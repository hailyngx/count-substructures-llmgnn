Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the first example to count the triangles in the given graph:

- **Node 0**:
  - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 5 are not connected.
  - Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 7 are not connected.
  - Pair 3: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 3 are not connected.
  - Pair 4: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are directly connected as (2, 0) shown in the edge list.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- **Node 1**:
  - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
  - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected.
  - Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are directly connected as (4, 1) shown in the edge list.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- **Node 2**:
  - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
  - Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are directly connected as (5, 13) shown in the edge list.
  - Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected.
  - Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are not connected.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- **Node 3**:
  - Pair 1: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 9 are not connected.
  - Pair 2: (0, 13) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 13 are not connected.
  - Pair 3: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are directly connected as (0, 3) shown in the edge list.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- **Node 4**:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  - Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are directly connected as (7, 10) shown in the edge list.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- **Node 5**:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.

- **Node 6**:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.

- **Node 7**:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
  - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.

- **Node 8**:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0
  
- **Node 9**:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
  - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.

- **Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14**:
  - Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
