Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0)

Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, I will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> Connected, forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Connected, forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> Connected, forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Connected, forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Connected, forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> Connected, forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Connected, forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Connected, forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.

If you need the list of unique triangles found, please let me know!
