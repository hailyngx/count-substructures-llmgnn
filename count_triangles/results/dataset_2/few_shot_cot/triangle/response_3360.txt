Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, we will now find the number of triangles in the given graph with 30 nodes:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 27) -> 3 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 24) -> 3 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge connecting 3 to 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (27, 24) -> 27 and 24 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge connecting 27 to 24. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (27, 11) -> 27 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge connecting 27 to 11. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (27, 4) -> 27 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge connecting 27 to 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (24, 11) -> 24 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge connecting 24 to 11. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 3: (26, 18) -> 26 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (28, 23) -> 28 and 23 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge connecting 28 to 23. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (28, 18) -> 28 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge connecting 28 to 18. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (23, 18) -> 23 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge connecting 23 to 18. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge connecting 8 to 13. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge connecting 8 to 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge connecting 8 to 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (19, 13) -> 19 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge connecting 19 to 13. No triangle formed.
