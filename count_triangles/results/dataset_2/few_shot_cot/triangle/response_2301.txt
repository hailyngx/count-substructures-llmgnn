Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected and also 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 1) -> 10 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 3) -> 10 and 3 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 1) -> 11 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 11 and 2 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 1 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are directly connected, and 9 and 8 are also 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
