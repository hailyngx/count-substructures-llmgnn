Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:  
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are not connected, as there is no edge (3, 15). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected, as they share the edge (3, 0). No third node connected to both, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 8) -> 15 and 8 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 27) -> 13 and 27 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 3) -> 13 and 3 are connected, as they share the edge (13, 1). No third node connected to both, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (27, 3) -> 27 and 3 are connected, as they share the edge (27, 1). No third node connected to both, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 23) -> 6 and 23 are connected, as they share the edge (6, 2). No third node connected to both, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are connected, as they share the edge (1, 3). No third node connected to both, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 29) -> 1 and 29 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 29) -> 11 and 29 are connected, as they share the edge (11, 29). No third node connected to both, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * ...

Continue this step-by-step process for all nodes to count the number of triangles in the graph and list the unique triangles found inside <> in the final output. In this case, you would iterate through all nodes, calculate the total triangles with that node as the smallest numbered node, and sum them up at the end to find the total number of triangles in the graph.
