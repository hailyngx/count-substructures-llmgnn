Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (16, 21) -> Both 16 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 29) -> Both 16 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 23) -> Both 16 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (21, 29) -> Both 21 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (21, 23) -> Both 21 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (29, 23) -> Both 29 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> Both 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> Both 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> Both 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 10) -> Both 14 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 13) -> Both 14 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 13) -> Both 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (24, 14) -> Both 24 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (24, 10) -> Both 24 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (24, 13) -> Both 24 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 10) -> Both 14 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 13) -> Both 14 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 13) -> Both 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

We will continue this process for each node and then count the total number of triangles. Let's proceed step by step.
