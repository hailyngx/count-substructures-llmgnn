Response:
Following the step-by-step process for counting triangles in the graph: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Nodes 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Nodes 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Nodes 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Nodes 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 3) -> Nodes 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Nodes 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Nodes 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Nodes 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) -> Nodes 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Nodes 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Nodes 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> Nodes 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 4), but since 3 and 4 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Nodes 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, and 7:
    * There are no pairs to consider for these nodes as there aren't at least two nodes greater than them.

* Node 8:
    * There are no pairs to consider for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 8 as it is smaller than Node 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> Nodes 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles found: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5, 6, and 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
