Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 23) -> Both 4 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> Both 6 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 24) -> Both 4 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 24 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 24) -> Both 5 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 24 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (12, 15) -> Both 12 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 12 and 15 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (17, 24) -> Both 17 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 17 and 24 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (24, 26) -> Both 24 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 24 and 26 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (16, 25) -> Both 16 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 16 and 25 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs that include smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that include smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continuing this process for all nodes until Node 29, we find the total number of triangles in the graph.

After computing the triangles for all nodes, we sum up the total number of triangles for each node to get the final answer.
