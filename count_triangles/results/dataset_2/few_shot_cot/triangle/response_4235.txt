Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided earlier, the process is carried out as follows:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) - Triangle formed <2, 3, 7>.
    * Pair 4: (9, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Triangle formed <3, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summing up the results:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
