Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are not connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 12) -> 19 and 12 are not connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 2 through 19:

* Node 2:
    * Pairs: (9, 10) and (9, 5) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (8, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are connected as (4, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pairs: (17, 14) and (17, 3) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pairs: (13, 2), (13, 18), and (2, 18) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are connected as (9, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (18, 1) -> 18 and 1 are connected as (18, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pairs: (13, 16) and (13, 5) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are connected as (2, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Due to the lack of larger numbered nodes, there are no triangles that can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
