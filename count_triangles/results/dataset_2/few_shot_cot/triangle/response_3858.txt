Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 8) -> Skipped (smaller nodes present).
    * Pair 2: (11, 14) -> Skipped (smaller nodes present).
    * Pair 3: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 14) -> Skipped (smaller nodes present).
    * Pair 5: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 7) -> 14 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (18, 7) -> 18 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 9) -> 18 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (18, 8) -> Skipped (smaller nodes present).
    * Pair 2: (18, 9) -> 18 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 4) -> 11 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (19, 17) -> 19 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6-19) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
