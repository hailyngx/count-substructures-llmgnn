Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Nodes 3 and 5 are connected, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 11) -> Nodes 5 and 11 are not connected in the adjacency list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 3) -> Nodes 0 and 3 are connected, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 1:**
    - Pair 1: (5, 11) -> Nodes 5 and 11 are connected, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 2:**
    - Since Node 2 is not part of any triangle, we skip it.

- **Node 3:**
    - Pair 1: (13, 7) -> Nodes 13 and 7 are connected, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 4:**
    - Pair 1: (10, 17) -> Nodes 10 and 17 are connected, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 15) -> Nodes 4 and 15 are connected, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 5:**
    - Pair 1: (1, 11) -> Nodes 1 and 11 are connected, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 6:**
    - Pair 1: (4, 15) -> Nodes 4 and 15 are not connected in the adjacency list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 7:**
    - Pair 1: (14, 19) -> Nodes 14 and 19 are connected, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 8:**
    - Pair 1: (13, 17) -> Nodes 13 and 17 are connected, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 9:**
    - Pair 1: (12, 17) -> Nodes 12 and 17 are connected, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 10:**
    - Pair 1: (4, 17) -> Nodes 4 and 17 are connected, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 11:**
    - Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Nodes 0 and 6 are connected, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Nodes 1 and 5 are connected, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 12:**
    - Since Node 12 is not part of any triangle, we skip it.

- **Node 13:**
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Nodes 6 and 8 are connected, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 14:**
    - Pair 1: (15, 19) -> Nodes 15 and 19 are not connected in the adjacency list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 15:**
    - Since Node 15 is not part of any triangle, we skip it.

- **Node 16:**
    - Pair 1: (14, 19) -> Nodes 14 and 19 are connected, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 17:**
    - Pair 1: (4, 15) -> Nodes 4 and 15 are connected, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 18:**
    - Since Node 18 is not part of any triangle, we skip it.

- **Node 19:**
    - Pair 1: (14, 16) -> Nodes 14 and 16 are connected, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Following the same process for the remaining nodes:

- **Node 0 to Node 9:**
    - No triangles involving these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph: **[0]**.
