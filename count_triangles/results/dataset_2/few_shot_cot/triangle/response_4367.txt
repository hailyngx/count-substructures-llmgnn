Response:
Following the given instructions, let's count the number of triangles in the graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Triangles found: <2, 6, 4>

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 2 as it is smaller than Node 9.
    * Pair 1: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Triangles found: <9, 13, 7>

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 2 as it is smaller than Node 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
[<2, 6, 4>, <9, 13, 7>]
