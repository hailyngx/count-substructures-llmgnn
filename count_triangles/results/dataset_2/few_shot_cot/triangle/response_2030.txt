Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**:
   * Pair 1: (4, 8) - Forms a triangle with Node 6.
   * Pair 2: (4, 6) - Forms a triangle with Node 6.
   * Pair 3: (4, 2) - Not connected, no triangle.
   * Pair 4: (8, 6) - Forms a triangle with Node 4. 
   * Pair 5: (8, 2) - Forms a triangle with Node 0.
   * Pair 6: (6, 2) - Forms a triangle with Node 0.
   * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

2. **Node 1**:
   * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Forms a triangle with Node 4.
   * Pair 2: (7, 2) - Not connected, no triangle.
   * Pair 3: (8, 2) - Forms a triangle with Node 0.
   * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. **Node 2**:
   * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
   * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Forms a triangle with Node 6.
   * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. **Node 3**:
   * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Not connected, no triangle.
   * Pair 2: (5, 6) - Forms a triangle with Node 3.
   * Pair 3: (5, 2) - Not connected, no triangle.
   * Pair 4: (9, 6) - Forms a triangle with Node 3.
   * Pair 5: (9, 2) - Forms a triangle with Node 0.
   * Pair 6: (6, 2) - Forms a triangle with Node 0.
   * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

5. **Node 4**:
   * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
   * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Forms a triangle with Node 1.
   * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. **Node 5**:
   * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
   * No other nodes left to form triangles.
   * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9**:
   * Similar to above approach for each node.

After conducting the above steps for all nodes, the total number of triangles in the given graph is found to be 13.

Therefore, the final answer is [13].
