Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

Continue this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 4: 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 14.

Therefore, there are [14 triangles] in the given graph.
