Response:
Following the step-by-step process for each node to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are connected as (8, 11) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are connected as (8, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (11, 1) -> 11 and 1 are connected as (11, 1) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (19, 8) -> 19 and 8 are connected as (19, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are connected as (7, 17) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are connected as (7, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (17, 4) -> 17 and 4 are connected as (17, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair as there are no nodes greater than 3 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (16, 10) -> 16 and 10 are connected as (16, 10) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (16, 14) -> 16 and 14 are connected as (16, 14) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (16, 13) -> 16 and 13 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (16, 2) -> 16 and 2 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are connected as (10, 14) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are connected as (10, 13) in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (10, 2) -> 10 and 2 are connected as (10, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are connected as (14, 13) in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (14, 2) -> 14 and 2 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (13, 2) -> 13 and 2 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are connected as (9, 19) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (17, 10) -> 17 and 10 are connected as (17, 10) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (17, 11) -> 17 and 11 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 2 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair as there are no nodes greater than 9 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 19:
    * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 5 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
