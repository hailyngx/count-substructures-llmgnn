Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 10). Triangle formed.

    * Pair 3: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 5, 6, and 7 have no triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 as they are smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 as they are smaller than 13.

    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5, 6, 7) + 0 (Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 9.

Therefore, [there are 9 triangles in the given graph].
