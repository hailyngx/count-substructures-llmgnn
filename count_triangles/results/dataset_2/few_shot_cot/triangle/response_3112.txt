Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 14: <0, 2, 8>
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 1: <0, 2, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 14: <1, 4, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <2, 7, 8>
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 0: <0, 2, 14>
    * Pair 4: (8, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 0: <0, 2, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 2: <2, 7, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 0: <0, 2, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <4, 7, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 11: <8, 10, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 11: <8, 10, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 12: <4, 10, 13>
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 1: <0, 2, 14>
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 1: <0, 2, 14>
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 2: <0, 6, 14>
    * Pair 4: (1, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 0: <0, 2, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 4

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 4 (Node 14) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.
