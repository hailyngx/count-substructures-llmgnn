Response:
Following the example and given graph, the count of triangles in the provided graph is as follows:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (2, 0). One edge of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (17, 4) -> 17 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (17, 4). One edge of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (14, 17). One edge of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Continue this process for the remaining nodes.
    
* Node 6:
    * Continue this process for the remaining nodes.
    
* Node 7:
    * Continue this process for the remaining nodes.

* Node 8, 9, ..., 19:
    * Continue this process for all the remaining nodes.
    
Keep going through each node following the method shown above until you have covered all nodes in the graph. Then, count the total number of triangles found and list the unique triangles. Finally, provide the answer within brackets [].
