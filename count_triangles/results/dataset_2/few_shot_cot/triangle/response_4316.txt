Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 7, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the provided graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Triangle formed <0, 1, 3>
        * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed <0, 1, 4>
        * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed <0, 3, 4>
        * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> Triangle formed <0, 3, 7>
        * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed <0, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

    * Node 1:
        * Skip paired nodes smaller than 1.
        * No more pairs available to form triangles with Node 1.

    * Node 2:
        * Skip paired nodes smaller than 2.
        * No pairs available to form triangles with Node 2.

    * Node 3:
        * Skip paired nodes smaller than 3.
        * No more pairs available to form triangles with Node 3.

    * Node 4:
        * Skip paired nodes smaller than 4.
        * No more pairs available to form triangles with Node 4.

    * Node 5:
        * Skip paired nodes smaller than 5.
        * No pairs available to form triangles with Node 5.

    * Node 6:
        * Skip paired nodes smaller than 6.
        * No more pairs available to form triangles with Node 6.

    * Node 7:
        * Skip paired nodes smaller than 7.
        * No pairs available to form triangles with Node 7.

    * Node 8:
        * Skip paired nodes smaller than 8.
        * No more pairs available to form triangles with Node 8.

    * Node 9:
        * Skip paired nodes smaller than 9.
        * No more pairs available to form triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0)
[4] 

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
