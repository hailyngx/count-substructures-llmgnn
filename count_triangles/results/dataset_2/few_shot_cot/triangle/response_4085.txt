Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as in the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not a triangle as 5 and 9 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> Triangle formed as 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> Not a triangle as 5 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 4: (9, 1) -> Not a triangle as 9 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Not a triangle as 9 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> Not a triangle as 9 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Pair 3: (8, 0) -> Not a triangle as 8 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Not a triangle as 5 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not a triangle as 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> Triangle formed as 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Not a triangle as 5 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not a triangle as 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> Not a triangle as 5 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> Triangle formed as 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Not a triangle as 9 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Not a triangle as 9 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> Not a triangle as 9 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4.
    * Pair 4: (9, 6) -> Not a triangle as 9 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4.
    * Pair 5: (9, 2) -> Not a triangle as 9 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4.
    * Pair 6: (7, 6) -> Not a triangle as 7 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4.
    * Pair 7: (7, 8) -> Not a triangle as 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4.
    * Pair 8: (7, 2) -> Not a triangle as 7 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> Not a triangle as 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4.
    * Pair 10: (6, 2) -> Not a triangle as 6 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing with nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node = 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
