Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example mentioned earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller nodes (0 and 1).
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller nodes (0, 1, 2).
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles: 1

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles: 1

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles: 2

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles: 3

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles: 0

Summing up the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 16.

Therefore, there are [16] triangles in the given graph.

<3, 5, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 8, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 7, 8>
