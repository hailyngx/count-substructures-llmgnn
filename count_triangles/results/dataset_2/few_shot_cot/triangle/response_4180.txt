Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the provided graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 18) -> 2 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Only 1-hop neighbors are from Node 0, so no triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (14, 10) -> 14 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (11, 4) -> 11 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (18, 17) -> 18 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * For Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8:
            * There are no triangles that can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 9:
            * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (14, 10) -> 14 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
            * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

        Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
