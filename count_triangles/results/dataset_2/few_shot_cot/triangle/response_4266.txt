Response:
Following the same procedure as shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> Not connected directly.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> Not connected directly.
    * Pair 5: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (8, 12) -> Not connected directly.
    * Pair 7: (8, 5) -> Not connected directly.
    * Pair 8: (11, 12) -> Not connected directly.
    * Pair 9: (11, 5) -> Not connected directly.
    * Pair 10: (12, 5) -> Not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (11, 4) -> 11 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 10: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Nodes 3, 4, and 5:
    * Skip because they are smaller than Node 2 and there are no other nodes to form triangles.
