Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (3, 11) - 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (7, 1) - 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (7, 14) - 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (8, 1) - 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 7: (8, 14) - 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 8: (9, 1) - 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
            * Pair 1: (12, 5) - 12 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (7, 11) - 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (7, 14) - 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (8, 11) - 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (8, 14) - 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (11, 14) - 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
            * Pair 1: (7, 12) - 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        Continue this process for the remaining nodes to find the total number of triangles.

        The final count of triangles in the graph is represented as: [Total number of triangles]. Provide this final answer after calculating for all nodes.
