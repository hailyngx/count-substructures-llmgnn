Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 7, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) <0, 7, 9>
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) <0, 4, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) <2, 4, 5>
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) <2, 7, 9>
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) <2, 3, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) <7, 9, 0>
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) <7, 8, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) <9, 2, 5>
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) <9, 8, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [9].
