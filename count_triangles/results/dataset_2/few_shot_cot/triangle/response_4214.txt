Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 9, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node because it has only two neighbors and no triangles are present.

2. Node 1:
    - Triangles:
        - <1, 2, 8>

3. Node 2:
    - Triangles:
        - <0, 2, 8>
        
4. Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node because the existing edges do not form any triangles.

5. Node 4:
    - Triangles:
        - <4, 8, 1>
        - <4, 8, 2>
        - <4, 8, 9>
        - <4, 1, 6>
        - <4, 1, 5>
        - <4, 6, 9>
        - <4, 6, 5>
        
6. Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node because the existing edges do not form any triangles.

7. Node 6:
    - Triangles:
        - <6, 4, 8>
        - <6, 4, 9>
        - <6, 4, 7>

8. Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node because the existing edges do not form any triangles.

8. Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node because it has only two neighbors and no triangles are present.

9. Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node because it has only two neighbors and no triangles are present.

Summarizing the triangles found for each node:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 7 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 6) = 12

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
