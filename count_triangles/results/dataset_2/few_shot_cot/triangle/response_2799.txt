Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (27, 12) -> 27 and 12 are directly connected. We need to find a common neighbor now.
    - Pair 2: (27, 26) -> 27 and 26 are directly connected. We need to find a common neighbor now.
    - Pair 3: (12, 26) -> 12 and 26 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (17, 2) -> 17 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (17, 23) -> 17 and 23 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 23) -> 2 and 23 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - We skip any pairs with nodes smaller than node 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (13, 9) -> 13 and 9 are directly connected. We need to find a common neighbor now.
    - Pair 2: (13, 22) -> 13 and 22 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are directly connected. We need to find a common neighbor now.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (27, 27) -> Self-loop, not considered for triangle formation.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (17, 8) -> 17 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (17, 10) -> 17 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - We skip any pairs with nodes smaller than node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (22, 14) -> 22 and 14 are directly connected. We need to find a common neighbor now.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (21, 5) -> 21 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (21, 6) -> 21 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected. We need to find a common neighbor now.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (29, 25) -> 29 and 25 are directly connected. We need to find a common neighbor now.
    - Pair 2: (29, 2) -> 29 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (25, 2) -> 25 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 11 to 30:
    - Skipped as they have no connections.

Summing up all the triangles found for each node:
