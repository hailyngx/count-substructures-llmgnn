Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) - Both 9 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 17 are also connected as (9, 17) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: Skipped pair where at least one node is smaller than 0.
    * Pair 3: (9, 15) - Both 9 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) - Both 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) - Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) - Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) - Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) - Both 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) - Both 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 10 are also connected as (9, 10) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) - Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 5 are also connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) - Both 1 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) - Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) - Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skipped pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (12, 15) - Both 12 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 12 and 15 are also connected as (12, 15) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skipped pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing the process for the remaining nodes...

* Node 6:
    * Skipped pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skipped pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) - Both 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 11 and 14 are also connected as (11, 14) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18:
    * No triangles can be formed as there aren't at least two nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

The answer is [7].
