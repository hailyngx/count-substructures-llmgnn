Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2

Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. But 5 and 4 do not have a common 1-hop neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. No common 1-hop neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. No common 1-hop neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. No common 1-hop neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
