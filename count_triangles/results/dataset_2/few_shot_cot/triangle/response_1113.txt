Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (2, 13) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (5, 13) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (0, 13) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (2, 13) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (5, 13) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as all other nodes are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (10, 14) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (12, 14) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (6, 14) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11 are skipped as they only have one neighbor.
   
10. Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> Triangle formed <0, 12, 2>.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (0, 13) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (1, 2) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (1, 5) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 7: (1, 13) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 8: (2, 5) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 9: (2, 13) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 10: (5, 13) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

11. Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (0, 14) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (2, 14) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (2, 3) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 7: (6, 14) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 8: (6, 3) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 9: (14, 3) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
