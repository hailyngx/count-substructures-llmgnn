Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 17) -> 3 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (18, 15) -> 18 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (18, 17) -> 18 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 18 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 15 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 9) -> 19 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 19 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (14, 8) -> Both 14 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 14 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> Both 11 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 11 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 11 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 12) -> 16 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 16 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 5, 6, and 7:
    * Skip them as they are smaller than the previous nodes.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> Both 9 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 9, 10, and 11:
    * Skip them as they are smaller than the previous nodes.

The triangles found are: <0, 3, 18>, <0, 3, 17>, and <1, 3, 19>.

Calculating the total number of triangles: [3]

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
