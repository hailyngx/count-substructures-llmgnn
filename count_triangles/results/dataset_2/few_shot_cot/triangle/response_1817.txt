Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 4 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 6 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than them to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
