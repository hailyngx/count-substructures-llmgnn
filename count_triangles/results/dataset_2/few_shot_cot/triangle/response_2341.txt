Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - No triangle formed as there is no direct edge between them.
    * Pair 2: (0, 24) - No triangle formed as there is no direct edge between them.
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) - No triangle formed as there is no direct edge between them.

* Node 20:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) - No triangle formed as there is no direct edge between them.
    * Pair 2: (13, 11) - No triangle formed as there is no direct edge between them.

    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Output: [3]
