Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (0, 15) -> 0 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 10:
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 11:
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 12:
    - Pair 1: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 13:
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 14:
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 15:
    - Pair 1: (2, 18) -> Both 2 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, and they are connected forming a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 16:
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 17:
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 18:
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 19:
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1 triangle] in the given graph.
