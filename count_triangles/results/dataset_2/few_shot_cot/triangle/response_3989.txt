Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 15) -> 6 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * No additional triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 1: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 17) -> 12 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * No additional triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9-19:
    * Proceed with the same process for Nodes 9-19.

After completing the calculations for all nodes, you can sum up the total number of triangles as follows:

[<6, 15, 3>, <13, 19, 1>, <5, 8, 4>, <12, 15, 6>, <0, 9, 7>, <12, 15, 6>, <0, 9, 7>, <12, 15, 6>, <12, 15, 6>, <0, 9, 7>, <12, 15, 6>, <6, 15, 3>, <0, 9, 7>, <13, 19, 1>, <12, 15, 6>, <0, 9, 7>, <13, 19, 1>] = 17]
