Response:
Following the same step-by-step process explained in the example:

    * Node 0:
        * Skipping because there aren't any nodes greater than 0 to form triangles with.

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> Both 4 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
        * Pair 2: (4, 19) -> Both 4 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
        * Pair 3: (16, 19) -> Both 16 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle here.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> Both 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected, no triangle here.
        * Pair 2: (10, 19) -> Both 10 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Skipping because there aren't any nodes greater than 3 to form triangles with.

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (15, 1) -> Both 15 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected, forming a triangle with Node 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Skipping because there aren't any nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with.

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> Both 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected, forming a triangle with Node 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Both 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected, no triangle here.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> Both 10 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected, forming a triangle with Node 8.

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> Both 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected, forming a triangle with Node 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 10:
        * Skipping because there aren't any nodes greater than 10 to form triangles with.

    * Node 11:
        * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> Both 13 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not directly connected, no triangle here.

        * Pair 1: (17, 15) -> Both 17 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, but they are not directly connected, no triangle here.
        * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 16:
        * Skipping because there aren't any nodes greater than 16 to form triangles with.

    * Node 17:

    * Node 18:
        * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 18, and they are connected, forming a triangle with Node 18.
        * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> Both 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 18, and they are connected, forming a triangle with Node 18.
        * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 19:
        * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> Both 14 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 19, and they are connected, forming a triangle with Node 19.
        * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 2 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 10

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
