Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, here is the breakdown of counting triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as (9, 11) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 9 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 3) -> 11 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 11 and 3 are connected as (11, 0, 3) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 as they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are connected as (4, 9, 1) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are connected as (4, 7, 2) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are connected as (4, 7, 3) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 4 as per the instructions.
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 1 are connected as (5, 1, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5 as they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 1) -> 10 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 1) -> 11 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 11 and 1 are connected as (11, 1, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6, 7, 8, and 9 are not involved in forming any triangles due to node sequence constraints.

* Node 10:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 10 as instructed. No triangles formed.

* Node 11:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 11 as instructed. No triangles formed.

* Node 12:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 12 as instructed. No triangles formed.

* Node 13:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 13 as instructed. No triangles formed.

* Node 14:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 14 as instructed. No triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
