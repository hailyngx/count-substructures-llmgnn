Response:
Following the step-by-step approach stated in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 21) -> Node 1 and Node 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 28) -> Node 1 and Node 28 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (21, 28) -> Node 21 and Node 28 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (19, 22) -> Node 19 and Node 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 29) -> Node 19 and Node 29 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7 and are connected. One side of the triangle found.
    * Pair 3: (22, 29) -> Node 22 and Node 29 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7 and are connected. One side of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 11 through 28:
    * After examining nodes 11 to 29 it is clear no additional triangles are present.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Nodes 11 to 28) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Output: [3]
