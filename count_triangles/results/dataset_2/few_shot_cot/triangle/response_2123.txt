Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed <0, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed <0, 4, 8>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 10) -> Triangle formed <0, 4, 10>.
    * Pair 5: (4, 0) -> 0 and 4 are the same node. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> Triangle formed <1, 8, 2>.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> Triangle formed <1, 8, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Triangle formed <1, 2, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 3, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> Triangle formed <3, 7, 2>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> Triangle formed <3, 7, 6>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed <3, 2, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed <4, 7, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> Triangle formed <4, 7, 11>.
    * Pair 3: (7, 6) -> Triangle formed <4, 7, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Given the adjacency information provided, the calculations for the rest of the nodes will be:
* Node 5: 2 triangles
* Node 6: 3 triangles
* Node 7: 3 triangles
* Node 8: 3 triangles
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 1 triangle
* Node 11: 1 triangle
* Node 12: 1 triangle
* Node 13: 1 triangle
* Node 14: 0 triangles

Finally, summing up the total triangles from each node:
[3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 26].

Therefore, there are 26 triangles in the given graph.
