Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 4

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 3, or 4 as they are smaller.
    * No more pairs to check. 
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

The remaining nodes have no triangles with at least 2 nodes greater.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
