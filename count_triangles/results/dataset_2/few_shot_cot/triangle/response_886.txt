Response:
Following the process described in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (8, 3) -> Forms a triangle with node 4.
    - Pair 2: (8, 19) -> Forms a triangle with node 4.
    - Pair 3: (3, 19) -> Forms a triangle with node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pair with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (17, 15) -> Forms a triangle with node 13.
    - Pair 2: (17, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    - Pair 3: (17, 18) -> Forms a triangle with node 13.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 16:
    - Pair 1: (14, 7) -> Forms a triangle with node 4.
    - Pair 2: (14, 3) -> Forms a triangle with node 4.
    - Pair 3: (7, 3) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Nodes 17, 18, and 19 do not form triangles with other nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 2 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 19.

Therefore, there are 19 triangles in the given graph.
