Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> Formed a triangle with Node 4: <0, 6, 14>
    * Pair 2: (0, 11) -> Formed a triangle with Node 4: <0, 4, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 11) -> Formed a triangle with Node 0: <0, 1, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Formed a triangle with Node 9: <2, 8, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> Formed a triangle with Node 0: <0, 4, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Formed a triangle with Node 8: <8, 9, 14>
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> Formed a triangle with Node 8: <8, 9, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
