Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as there are no 2 other nodes connected to it.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) - Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) - Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as there are no 2 other nodes connected to it.

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as there are no 2 other nodes connected to it.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as there are no 2 other nodes connected to it.

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as there are no 2 other nodes connected to it.

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as there are no 2 other nodes connected to it.

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as there are no 2 other nodes connected to it.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 6 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [8].
