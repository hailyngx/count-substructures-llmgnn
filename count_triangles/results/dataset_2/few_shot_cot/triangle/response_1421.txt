Response:
Following the same process as described in the example:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 2) in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> No triangle formed as it was already counted when processing Node 0.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> No triangle formed as it was already counted when processing Node 0.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (25, 2) -> 25 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (25, 2) in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (15, 29) -> 15 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Not possible to form a triangle for Node 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (28, 11) -> 28 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (28, 11) in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Not possible to form a triangle for Node 8.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (15, 19) in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
        * Not possible to form triangles with these nodes as there are not at least two nodes greater than them.

    * Node 15:
        * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 15, and they are directly connected as (4, 16) in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Nodes 16 to 28:
        * Not possible to form triangles with these nodes as there are not at least two nodes greater than them.

    * Node 29:
        * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 29, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 15) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 1, 2>, <3, 2, 25>, <6, 11, 28>, <9, 15, 19>]
