Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (7, 13) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (10, 13) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (8, 2) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they don't share a common edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (2, 13) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that have already been counted.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they don't share a common edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they don't share a common edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continue this process for the remaining nodes:

* Nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6 have already been counted in previous steps and will not form additional triangles.
* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (10, 13), but since 10 and 13 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * All these nodes have already been counted in previous steps and will not form additional triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
