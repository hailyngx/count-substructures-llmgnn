Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (16, 12) -> 16 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (17, 10) -> Both 17 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (17, 14) -> 17 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (17, 10) -> Both 17 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (19, 16) -> 19 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (19, 12) -> 19 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 14) -> 19 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (16, 12) -> 16 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
