Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (1, 13) in the edge list. Triangle formed.

  Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
  - Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
  - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 4: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (11, 12) in the edge list. Triangle formed.

  Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continue this process for the remaining nodes:

- Node 2:
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
  - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
  - Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total number of triangles = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
