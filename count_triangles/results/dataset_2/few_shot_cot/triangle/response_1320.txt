Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as per the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as per the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as they have fewer than 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
