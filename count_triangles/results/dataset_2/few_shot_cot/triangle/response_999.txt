    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are directly connected to 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are directly connected to 9. No triangle formed.

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected to 19. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
