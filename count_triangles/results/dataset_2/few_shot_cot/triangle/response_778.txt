Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> Not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 15) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 18) -> Directly connected as (8, 18) is in the list. One side of the triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 18) -> Directly connected as (15, 18) is in the list. Second side of the triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Directly connected as (1, 7) is in the list. One side of the triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 19) -> Directly connected as (1, 19) is in the list. Second side of the triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 19) -> Not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 19) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 18) -> Directly connected as (7, 18) is in the list. Second side of another triangle formed but already counted when considering Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (14, 4) -> Directly connected as (14, 4) is in the list. One side of the triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 2) -> Directly connected as (14, 2) is in the list. Second side of the triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> Directly connected as (2, 4) is in the list. Third side of the triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Directly connected as (3, 7) is in the list. One side of the triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> Directly connected as (3, 11) is in the list. Second side of the triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 11) -> Not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 11) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> Directly connected as (4, 17) is in the list. One side of the triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> Directly connected as (4, 2) is in the list. Second side of the triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 17) -> Not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 17) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 19) -> Directly connected as (4, 19) is in the list. Second side of another triangle formed but was already counted considering Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip as there are no pairs to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 16) -> Directly connected as (6, 16) is in the list. One side of the triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Directly connected as (6, 8) is in the list. Second side of the triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 16) -> Not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 16) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as they are already accounted for with smaller numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 6.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
