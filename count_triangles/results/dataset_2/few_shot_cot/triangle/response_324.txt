Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:
        
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Connected through node 0. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> Connected through node 0. Triangle formed: <0, 8, 1>
    * No more pairs possible. Triangles found: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> Connected through node 1. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 15>
    * Pair 2: (8, 15) -> Connected through node 1. Triangle formed: <1, 8, 15>
    * No more pairs possible. Triangles found: 2

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles. Triangles found: 0

* Node 3:
    * Triangle formation not possible as 3 is not part of any other triangles. Triangles found: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles. Triangles found: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> Connected through node 5. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 13>
    * No more pairs possible. Triangles found: 1

* Node 6:
    * Triangle formation not possible as no pair with greater nodes. Triangles found: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 19) -> Connected through node 7. Triangle formed: <3, 7, 19>
    * No more pairs possible. Triangles found: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> Connected through node 8. Triangle formed: <0, 8, 15>
    * No more pairs possible. Triangles found: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> Connected through node 9. Triangle formed: <4, 9, 13>
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> Connected through node 9. Triangle formed: <7, 9, 4>
    * No more pairs possible. Triangles found: 2

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> Connected through node 10. Triangle formed: <10, 14, 17>
    * No more pairs possible. Triangles found: 1

* Node 11:
    * Triangle formation not possible as 11 is not part of any other triangles. Triangles found: 0

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangles. Triangles found: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Connected through node 13. Triangle formed: <4, 9, 13>
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> Connected through node 13. Triangle formed: <5, 13, 4>
    * No more pairs possible. Triangles found: 2

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangles. Triangles found: 0

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> Connected through node 15. Triangle formed: <0, 15, 12>
    * No more pairs possible. Triangles found: 1

* Node 16:
    * Triangle formation not possible as no pair with greater nodes. Triangles found: 0

* Node 17:
    * No possible triangles. Triangles found: 0

* Node 18:
    * Triangle formation not possible as 18 is not part of any other triangles. Triangles found: 0

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangles. Triangles found: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 15) = 12

Therefore, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
