Response:
Following the instructions given in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5 and 6:
    * Skipped as they have been used in previous computations.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14:

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
