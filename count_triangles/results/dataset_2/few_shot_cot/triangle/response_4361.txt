Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (2, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 9) -> 10 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 9) -> 12 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 9) -> 10 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (10, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipped pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 4) -> 13 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (1, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 5) -> 11 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (11, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skipped pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (2, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Continue this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

By following the same process as detailed above for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, you can find the total number of triangles in the graph.
