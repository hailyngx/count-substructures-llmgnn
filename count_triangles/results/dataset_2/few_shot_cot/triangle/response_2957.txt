Summarizing the triangles:  
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) + 2 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Nodes 17, 18, 19) = 12.

Therefore, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
