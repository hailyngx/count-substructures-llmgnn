Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 and Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> Node 1 and Node 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> Node 1 and Node 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 13) -> Node 3 and Node 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 14) -> Node 3 and Node 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 14) -> Node 13 and Node 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 and Node 13.
    * Pair 2: (3, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 and Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 and Node 4.
    * Pair 4: (0, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 and Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 7, Node 10, and Node 6.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 7, Node 12, and Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles with Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:

    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles with Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
