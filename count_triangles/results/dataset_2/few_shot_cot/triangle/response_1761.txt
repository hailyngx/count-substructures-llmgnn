Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 10) -> Not a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 4) -> Not a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 6) -> Not a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 14) -> Not a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> Not a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> Not a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Not a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (17, 8) -> Not a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (19, 7) -> Not a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> Not a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (11, 0) -> Not a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (16, 2) -> Not a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> Not a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> Not a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> Not a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> Not a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * No possible triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node

* Node 18:
    * No possible triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph. 
The final answer is: [0].
