Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example provided, we will identify the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 18) - Both 4 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 20) - Both 4 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 20 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (4, 25) - Both 4 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 25 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (18, 20) - Both 18 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 18 and 20 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (18, 25) - Both 18 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 18 and 25 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 6: (20, 25) - Both 20 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 20 and 25 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    - We can skip all pairs involving 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (6, 24) - Both 6 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 6 and 24 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 26) - Both 6 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 6 and 26 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (24, 26) - Both 24 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 24 and 26 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (16, 28) - Both 16 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 16 and 28 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (12, 19) - Both 12 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 12 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (12, 29) - Both 12 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 12 and 29 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (19, 29) - Both 19 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 19 and 29 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
