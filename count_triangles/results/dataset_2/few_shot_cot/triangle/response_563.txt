Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same step-by-step process as illustrated in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 3) -> 10 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 5) -> 10 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> Already counted from Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* The process should be continued for Nodes 7 to 14.

By following this approach for all nodes, the total number of triangles in the given graph is found to be [17].
