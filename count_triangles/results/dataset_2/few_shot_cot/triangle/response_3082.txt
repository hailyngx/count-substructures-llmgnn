Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example above: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 13 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process with the remaining nodes to find the total number of triangles in the given graph. Finally, output the answer within brackets [].
