Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 24) - 3 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 18) - 0 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (28, 7) - 28 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 24) - 1 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) - 4 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) - 8 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 15) - 2 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (17, 15) - 17 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (22, 27) - 22 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (26, 14) - 26 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) - 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 25) - 10 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (22, 26) - 22 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 25) - 10 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Following the same process for Nodes 11 to 29, we can sum up the total number of triangles [ ] and list the unique triangles that were found inside <> in the answer. Let's continue this process.
