Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (12, 24) -> 12 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 12 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 27) -> 10 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (22, 5) -> 22 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Remaining nodes do not have enough nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
