Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 9) -> 15 and 9 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 2) -> 15 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (16, 9) -> 16 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 7 to 19, we find:
* Node 7: 0 triangles
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 1 triangle
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 1 triangle
* Node 14: 1 triangle
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 1 triangle
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 0 triangles
* Node 19: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
