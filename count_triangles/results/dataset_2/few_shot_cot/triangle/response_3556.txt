Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 1) -> 13 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 13) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are connected as (0, 2) in the edge list. Let's see if there are other triangles involving node 1 in subsequent calculations.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (6, 0) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are connected as (7, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are connected as (7, 11) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are connected as (7, 15) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (16, 5) -> 16 and 5 are connected as (5, 16) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (16, 15) -> 16 and 15 are connected as (15, 16) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. Let's see if there are triangles involving node 5 in the next calculations.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected as (9, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No new triangles to form with node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are connected as (9, 6) in the edge list.
    * No other triangles to form with node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> 0 and 15 are connected as (0, 15) in the edge list.
    * No other triangles to form with node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * No other triangles to form with node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 as they are smaller than 12.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (18, 1) -> 18 and 1 are connected as (18, 1) in the edge list.
    * No other triangles to form with node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 as they are smaller than 14.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are connected as (15, 16) in the edge list.
    * No other triangles to form with node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No new triangles to form with node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No new triangles to form with node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No new triangles to form with node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No new triangles to form with node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
