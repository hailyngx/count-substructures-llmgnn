Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example with each node in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 13 are also connected as (7, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 22) -> 7 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 22) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 12 are also connected as (3, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 17 are also connected as (2, 17) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 8 are also connected as (2, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 11 are also connected as (1, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 13 are also connected as (1, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 15) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 27) -> 5 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 27 are also connected as (5, 27) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Continuing this process for other nodes...
