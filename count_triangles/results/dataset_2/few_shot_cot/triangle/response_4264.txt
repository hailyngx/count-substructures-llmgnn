Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 24) -> 3 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (15, 24) -> 15 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 15 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (15, 2) -> 15 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (24, 2) -> 24 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 24 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 17) -> 3 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 24) -> 3 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (17, 5) -> 17 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (17, 24) -> 17 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 17 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (5, 24) -> 5 and 24 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 2, 3, and 4:
    * Their triangles are counted in the triangles formed with other nodes because they have smaller IDs.

It appears that some of the nodes have no triangles yet. Let's continue with the process:

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 17 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (1, 24) -> 1 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 1 and 24 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * No new triangles can be formed because there aren't enough nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the calculated triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 5) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
