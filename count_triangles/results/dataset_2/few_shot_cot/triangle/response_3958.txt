Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11: <0, 4, 19>
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <0, 4, 11>
    * Pair 3: (19, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <0, 19, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as there aren't enough nodes larger than Node 1 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 10>
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 17: <3, 9, 15>
    * Pair 2: (9, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 13: <3, 9, 17>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 17: <4, 9, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than Node 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> Triangle formed: <5, 7, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than Node 6.
    * No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than Node 7.
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <7, 11, 16>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than Node 8.
    * No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than Node 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 13: <9, 4, 17>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 10

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
