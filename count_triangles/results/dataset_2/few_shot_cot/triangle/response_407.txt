Response:
Following the same method as described in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are connected via edge (1, 2) and edge (1, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected via edge (1, 3) and edge (1, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected via edge (3, 7) and edge (7, 1). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected via edge (3, 4) and edge (3, 2). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected via edge (8, 4) and edge (8, 2). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are connected via edge (8, 5) and edge (5, 2). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected via edge (8, 4). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are connected via edge (4, 2) and edge (2, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are connected via edge (9, 8) and edge (8, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are connected via edge (2, 5) and edge (5, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
