Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
   - <5, 4, 0> is a triangle. As 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and they are connected with 1 edge.
   - No other triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1:**
   - <9, 1, 4> is a triangle. As 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and they are connected with 1 edge.
   - No other triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2:**
   - No triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

4. **Node 3:**
   - No triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. **Node 4:**
   - No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. **Node 5:**
   - <9, 5, 0> is a triangle. As 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 and they are connected with 1 edge.
   - <9, 5, 7> is a triangle. As 9, 5, and 7 are connected.
   - No other triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
   - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

7. **Node 6:**
   - No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. **Node 7:**
   - No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. **Node 8:**
   - No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. **Node 9:**
    - <6, 9, 8> is a triangle. As 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9 and they are connected with 1 edge.
    - No other triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
