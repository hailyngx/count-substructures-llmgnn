Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes from Node 3.  
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Now, let's continue calculating for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes from Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes from Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes from Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes from Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes from Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes from Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <2, 5, 7>, <0, 2, 14>, <1, 4, 14>, <5, 7, 11>, <7, 10, 12>.

The final answer is [5].
