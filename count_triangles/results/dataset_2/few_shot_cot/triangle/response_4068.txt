Response:
* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 6) - 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (2, 7) - 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (2, 9) - 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (6, 9) - 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 9>.
  * Pair 6: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 7>.
  * Pair 2: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 9>.
  * Pair 3: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (3, 6) - 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 6>.
  * Pair 2: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 8>.
  * Pair 3: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 6, 8>.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 5, 7>.
  * Pair 2: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 5, 8>.
  * Pair 3: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 7, 9>.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 6 to form triangles with.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Pair 1: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Skipped because there are no nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
