Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [triangle <0, 2, 8>]

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> Both 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> Both 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2 [triangles <1, 4, 6> and <1, 6, 2>]

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [triangle <2, 5, 9>]

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [triangle <2, 3, 8>]

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [triangle <4, 9, 7>]

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [triangle <1, 5, 6>]

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Both 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> Both 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2 [triangles <6, 9, 7> and <6, 9, 4>]

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [triangle <7, 9, 4>]

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9 triangles] in the given graph.
