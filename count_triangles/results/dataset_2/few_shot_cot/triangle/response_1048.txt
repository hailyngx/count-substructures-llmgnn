Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 since all three nodes are connected to each other.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 1 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 since all three nodes are connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 since all three nodes are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2 

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 since all three nodes are connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 since all three nodes are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 since all three nodes are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 since all three nodes are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 since all three nodes are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs involving nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.
        
Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [7].
