Response:
Following the example provided, let's break down the process step by step for each node to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 0) and (6, 0) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 1:
    * Pairs: (1, 14)
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pairs: (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 17)
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pairs: (3, 7) (3, 10)
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair: (4, 8)
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pairs: (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 19)
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pairs: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 11)
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair: (7, 11)
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair: (8, 18)
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pairs: (9, 11)
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair: (10, 17)
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed starting with Node 11 due to smaller connected nodes only.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed starting with Node 12 due to smaller connected nodes only.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13, 16:
    * No triangles can be formed starting with Node 13 or Node 16 due to lack of connected nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 and Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pairs: (14, 18)
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed starting with Node 15 due to smaller connected nodes only.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed starting with Node 17 due to smaller connected nodes only.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed starting with Node 18 due to smaller connected nodes only.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed starting with Node 19 due to lack of connected larger nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0
[Total triangles in the graph: 1]

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
