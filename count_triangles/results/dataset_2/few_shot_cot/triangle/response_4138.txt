Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are connected with the edge (1, 14).
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 12) -> 14 and 12 are connected with the edge (14, 12).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are connected with the edge (7, 14).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs including Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are connected with the edge (9, 3).
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are connected with the edge (9, 12).
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are connected with the edge (9, 13).
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs including Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * No new triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs including Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are connected with the edge (13, 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are nodes smaller than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
