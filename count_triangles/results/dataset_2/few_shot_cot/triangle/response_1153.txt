Response:
Following the provided example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are directly connected and 5 is connected to 0. Triangle formed <0, 2, 5>.
    * Pair 5: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (6, 2) -> Both 6 and 2 are connected to 0. Triangle formed <0, 2, 6>.
    * Pair 12: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (4, 2) -> Both 4 and 2 are connected to 0. Triangle formed <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 14: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Both 9 and 6 are connected to 1. Triangle formed <1, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are connected to 2. Triangle formed <2, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are connected to 3. Triangle formed <3, 7, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Both 9 and 6 are connected to 5. Triangle formed <5, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
