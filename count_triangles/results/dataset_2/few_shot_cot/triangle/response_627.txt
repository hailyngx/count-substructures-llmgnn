Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Nodes 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Nodes 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> Nodes 5 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 1) -> Nodes 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 8) -> Nodes 9 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 3) -> Nodes 9 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 1) -> Nodes 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 9>.
    * Pair 8: (8, 3) -> Nodes 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Nodes 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Nodes 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> Nodes 5 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Nodes 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Nodes 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 4) -> Nodes 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Nodes 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 6, 8>.
    * Pair 7: (6, 7) -> Nodes 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 8) -> Nodes 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Nodes 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [7].
