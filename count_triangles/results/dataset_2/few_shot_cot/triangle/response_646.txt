Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 14) -> Not a triangle since 3 and 14 are not connected.
    - Pair 2: (3, 15) -> Triangle found: <0, 3, 15>
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Not a triangle as 6 and 8 are not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (7, 12) -> Not a triangle since 7 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    - Pair 2: (7, 19) -> Not a triangle since 7 and 19 are not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 18) -> Not a triangle since 5 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Not a triangle since 9 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    - Pair 2: (9, 17) -> Not a triangle since 9 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (10, 18) -> Not a triangle since 10 and 18 are not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Not a triangle since 1 and 8 are not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7 to 15:
    - Skipped due to already being smaller than Node 16.

* Node 16:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

Calculating the total number of triangles:
Total triangles = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Nodes 7 to 15) + 0 (Node 16) = 1.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
