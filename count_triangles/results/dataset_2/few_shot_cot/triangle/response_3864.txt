Response:
Following the same approach as the example, let's find the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected to node 0 and also to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are directly connected to node 0, but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected to node 0, but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are directly connected to node 0 and also to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are directly connected to node 0, but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are directly connected to node 0, but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are directly connected to node 1, but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are directly connected to node 1, but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected to node 2 and also to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are directly connected to node 2, but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are directly connected to node 2, but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are directly connected to node 3, but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are directly connected to node 3, but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are directly connected to node 3, but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected to node 4, but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected to node 5 and also to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected to node 7 and also to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are directly connected to node 9, but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
