Response:
Following the process described earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10: <0, 2, 15>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> Same triangle formed with Node 0: <0, 2, 15>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 19: <3, 4, 19>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (3, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 19: <3, 4, 19>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 13: <5, 12, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2: <2, 10, 15>
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (3, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <3, 4, 19>
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12: <5, 13, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <5, 13, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> Same triangle formed with Node 2: <0, 2, 15>
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <3, 4, 19>
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (3, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <3, 4, 19>
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
