Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Connected to 3 and 5, forming a triangle with 0.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) - Connected to 3 and 2, forming a triangle with 0.
    * Pair 3: (3, 11) - Connected to 3 and 11, but 3 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) - Connected to 5 and 2, forming a triangle with 0.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) - Connected to 5 and 6, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) - Connected to 2 and 4, but 2 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 6) - Connected to 2 and 6, forming a triangle with 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there are no connected neighbors.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Connected to 5 and 6, forming a triangle with 2.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - Connected to 5 and 8, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 4) - Connected to 6 and 4, but 6 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) - Connected to 4 and 6, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 3) - Connected to 4 and 3, forming a triangle with 2.
    * Pair 6: (3, 0) - Connected to 3 and 0, forming a triangle with 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no connected neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are no connected neighbors.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no connected neighbors.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) - Connected to 13 and 17, forming a triangle with 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as there are no connected neighbors for them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 8) = 6.
* The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 2>, <0, 5, 2>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 4, 3>, <2, 4, 6>.
* Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
