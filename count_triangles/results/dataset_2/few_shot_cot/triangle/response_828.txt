Response:
I'll now count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are not connected because (10, 13) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are not connected because (10, 14) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are connected as (13, 14) in the edge list, but 13 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are connected as (2, 3) in the edge list, but 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are connected as (2, 6) in the edge list, but 2 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected as (3, 6) in the edge list, but 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list, but 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list, and 4 and 8 are also 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are connected as (4, 13) in the edge list, but 4 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
