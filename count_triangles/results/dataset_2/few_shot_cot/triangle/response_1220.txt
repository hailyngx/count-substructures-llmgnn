Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, 4, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 3

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 or 9 as they are greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it is greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
