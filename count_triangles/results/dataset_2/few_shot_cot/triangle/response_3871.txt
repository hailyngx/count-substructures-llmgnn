Response:
Following the structure provided in the example, below is how the triangles will be counted in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: No pair can be formed with Node 0 as there are no nodes greater than 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 or 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> Both 5 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 17) -> Both 5 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 18) -> Both 5 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (15, 17) -> Both 15 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (15, 18) -> Both 15 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (17, 18) -> Both 17 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> Both 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 19) -> Both 8 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 12) -> Both 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 19) -> Both 9 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 19) -> Both 12 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> Both 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 16) -> Both 7 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 16) -> Both 5 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, and 7: 
    * Similar to previous nodes, there are no qualified pairs for triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes and Node 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Both 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes and Node 9. 
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 10, 11, and 12:
    * No qualified pairs for triangles.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 15 and 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 or 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (18, 5) -> Both 18 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 17, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed. 

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 17) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

[<5, 15, 17>, <5, 15, 18>, <5, 17, 18>, <8, 9, 3>, <8, 12, 19>, <7, 4, 5>, <2, 15, 17>, <2, 15, 18>]
