Response:
Following the method as shown in the example provided earlier, we will find the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (28, 29) -> Connected to both nodes and form a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (28, 24) -> Connected to both nodes but do not form a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (29, 24) -> Connected to both nodes but do not form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (11, 29) -> Connected to both nodes but do not form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Does not form a triangle with any other nodes.

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (8, 26) -> Connected to both nodes but do not form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (11, 5) -> Connected to both nodes and form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Continue this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

7. Summarizing the triangles found:
    - Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + ... = [Total number of triangles]

8. Calculate the total number of triangles by summing up the triangles found for each node.

Now, follow the same process for the remaining nodes to find the total number of triangles in the graph.
