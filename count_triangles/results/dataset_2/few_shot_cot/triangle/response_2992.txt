Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Skip this pair as Node 1 is smaller than Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20:
    * Since there are no triangles with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered nodes, the count for each of them is 0.

Calculating the total triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6-20) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
