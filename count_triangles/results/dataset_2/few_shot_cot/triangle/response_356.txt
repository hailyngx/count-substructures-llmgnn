Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the sample, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip edges involving smaller nodes (no smaller nodes). 
    * No triangles involving Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Skip edges involving smaller nodes (0 is smaller). 
    * No triangles involving Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip edges involving smaller nodes (0 and 1 are smaller). 
    * No triangles involving Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3: 0.

* Node 4:
    * Skip edges involving smaller nodes (0, 1, and 2 are smaller).
    * No triangles involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> Connected, no other nodes left to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5: 0.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Connected, no other nodes left to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> Connected, no other nodes left to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> Connected, no other nodes left to form a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) -> Connected, no other nodes left to form a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (7, 3) -> Connected, no other nodes left to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6: 0.

* Node 7:
    * Skip edges involving smaller nodes (0, 1, 3, and 6 are smaller).
    * No triangles involving Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> Connected, no other nodes left to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8: 0.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> Connected, no other nodes left to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> Connected, no other nodes left to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> Connected, no other nodes left to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9: 0.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
