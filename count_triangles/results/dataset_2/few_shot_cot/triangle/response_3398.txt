Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. **Node 0:**
    - <1, 8, 0>  (1, 0), (1, 8), (0, 8)
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1:**
    - <9, 14, 1>  (9, 1), (1, 14), (9, 14)
    - <1, 2, 0>  (1, 0), (1, 2), (0, 2)
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. **Node 2:**
    - <10, 8, 2>  (10, 2), (2, 8), (10, 8)
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. **Node 3:**
    - No triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. **Node 4:**
    - <11, 14, 4>  (11, 4), (4, 14), (11, 14)
    - <12, 13, 4>  (12, 4), (4, 13), (12, 13)
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

6. **Node 5:**
    - No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. **Node 6:**
    - <1, 10, 6>  (1, 6), (1, 10), (6, 10)
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. **Node 7:**
    - No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. **Node 8:**
    - <0, 2, 8>  (0, 8), (0, 2), (8, 2)
    - <8, 11, 4>  (8, 4), (8, 11), (4, 11)
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

10. **Node 9:**
    - No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

11. **Node 10:**
    - No triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

12. **Node 11:**
    - No triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

13. **Node 12:**
    - <4, 13, 12>  (4, 12), (4, 13), (12, 13)
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

14. **Node 13:**
    - No triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

15. **Node 14:**
    - No triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 10.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
