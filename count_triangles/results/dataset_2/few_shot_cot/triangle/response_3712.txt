Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are indirectly connected through node 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are indirectly connected through node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are not connected because (6, 13) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are indirectly connected through node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are not connected because (6, 13) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 11 as they are smaller than 10. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 5, and 8 as they are smaller than 11. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 and 10 as they are smaller than 12. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 6 as it is smaller than 13. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7 and 8 as they are smaller than 14. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 13>, <4, 8, 7>, <4, 8, 5>, and <4, 5, 7>.

Thus, the final answer is [5].
