Response:
Following the process described in the example mentioned earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected through Node 2. No possible triangle.
    - Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are also connected. No possible triangle.
    - Pair 4: (4, 6) -> Node 6 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 0. Skip.
    - Pair 5: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (8, 2) -> Both 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (8, 6) -> Node 6 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 0. Skip.
    - Pair 8: (2, 6) -> Node 6 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 0. Skip.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are connected through Node 4. No possible triangle.
    - Pair 3: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are connected through Node 4. No possible triangle.
    - Pair 4: (11, 0) -> Both 11 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 10.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 11.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 12.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 13.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 14.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
