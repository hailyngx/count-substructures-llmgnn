Response:
Following the same approach as shown in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected (1, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) - Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected (4, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected (2, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected (4, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected (4, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected (4, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected (5, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected (6, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected (1, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) - Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected (4, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9 have been skipped as they do not have at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
