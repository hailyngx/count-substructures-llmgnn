Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, here is how you can count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are connected, but 1 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are connected, but 0 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are connected, but 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are connected, but 0 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected, and 2 and 8 are also 1-hop neighbors.  Triangle formed <2, 8, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are connected, but 2 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 18) -> 2 and 18 are connected, but 2 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are connected, but 3 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 17) -> 3 and 17 are connected, but 3 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4 to 19: Skipped as they are smaller than Nodes 2 and 3 or have fewer than 2 nodes larger than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
