Response:
Following the step-by-step triangle counting process for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) <5, 9, 0> -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) <4, 6, 1> -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) <4, 8, 2> -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) <6, 7, 2> -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) <7, 8, 3> -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) <6, 7, 4> -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) <0, 9, 5> -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 0 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) <3, 7, 8> -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
