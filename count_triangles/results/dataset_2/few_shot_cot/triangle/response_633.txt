Response:
Following the example provided, let's now count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 3 are also connected as (7, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 1 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 5) -> 11 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors as they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 3 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 10 are also connected as (6, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Cannot form triangles as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the graph.
