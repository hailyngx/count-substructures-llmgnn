Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 
0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. 

Thus, the final answer is [7].
