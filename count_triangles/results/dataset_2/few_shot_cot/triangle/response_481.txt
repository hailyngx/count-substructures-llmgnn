Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 3, 15>
<6, 9, 13>
<9, 13, 18>
<11, 17, 18>
<7, 17, 19>
<7, 13, 18>
<7, 17, 19>

So, the output is [7].
