Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example:

- Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (9, 12) -> Triangle formed: <4, 9, 12>
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (18, 19) -> Triangle formed: <6, 18, 19>
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 10:
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 11:
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 12:
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 13:
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 14:
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 15:
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 16:
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 17:
    - Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Triangle formed: <9, 13, 17>
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 18:
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 19:
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph by summing up the triangles found for each node:
Total triangles = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2], and the unique triangles found are <4, 9, 12> and <6, 18, 19>.
