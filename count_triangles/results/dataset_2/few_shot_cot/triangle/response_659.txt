Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph using the method explained in the example:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not a triangle since 5 and 9 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not a triangle since 5 and 7 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Not a triangle since 5 and 8 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> Not a triangle since 9 and 7 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 5: (9, 8) -> Not a triangle since 9 and 8 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Not a triangle since 7 and 8 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Not a triangle since 9 and 2 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> Not a triangle since 9 and 4 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> Not a triangle since 9 and 8 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> Not a triangle since 2 and 4 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> Not a triangle since 2 and 8 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> Not a triangle since 4 and 8 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Not a triangle since 1 and 3 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Not a triangle since 1 and 7 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Not a triangle since 1 and 8 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> Not a triangle since 3 and 7 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> Not a triangle since 3 and 8 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Not a triangle since 7 and 8 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> Not a triangle since 6 and 4 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> Not a triangle since 6 and 2 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Not a triangle since 6 and 7 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Not a triangle since 9 and 6 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> Not a triangle since 9 and 0 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> Not a triangle since 6 and 0 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Not a triangle since 9 and 7 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Not a triangle since 9 and 8 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Not a triangle since 6 and 7 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> Not a triangle since 6 and 8 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> Not a triangle since 8 and 0 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8 and Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with these nodes as there are no pairs greater than nodes 8 and 9.

Finally, calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:
Total triangles = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
