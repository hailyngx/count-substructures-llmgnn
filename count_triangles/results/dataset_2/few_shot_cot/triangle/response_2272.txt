Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10: <4, 5, 10>
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Already counted above
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 6: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> Already counted above
    * Pair 8: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (10, 2) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (10, 12) -> Already counted above
    * Pair 5: (12, 13) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 6: (12, 14) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 7: (12, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 8: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (3, 0) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (3, 1) -> Already counted above
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (11, 8) -> No triangle formed

    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (10, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 4, 10>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (12, 14) -> No triangle formed

    * Pair 6: (12, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 7: (14, 13) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6 and Node 7:
    * Skipped as all possible pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 6) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (11, 3) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (11, 6) -> Already counted above
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 0) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (10, 2) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (10, 0) -> Already counted above
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 1) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (13, 1) -> Already counted above
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (14, 13) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> Already counted above
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (7, 10) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (14, 1) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No pairs to form triangles with larger nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) = 2

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
