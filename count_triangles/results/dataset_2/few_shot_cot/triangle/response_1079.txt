Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed <0, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed <0, 6, 8>.
    * Pair 3: (12, 0) -> 12 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 0) -> 14 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 0 are connected. Triangle formed <0, 14, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed <1, 7, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 3 are connected. Triangle formed <1, 3, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 2) -> 13 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 4 are connected. Triangle formed <3, 4, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipped due to already considered cases.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed <7, 9, 1>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 14 are connected. Triangle formed <7, 14, 0>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10 through Node 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least two nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
