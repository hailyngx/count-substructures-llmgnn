Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Now, to form a triangle, we need to find a common 1-hop neighbor between 6 and the other node connected to 0. The common neighbor is 4. So, triangle formed: <0, 1, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1:**
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Now, find a common 1-hop neighbor for 3 and 9, which is 10. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> Already counted in Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> Already counted in Pair 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2:**
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 and 1, as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3:**
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Already counted in Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Already counted in Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4:**
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Now, find a common 1-hop neighbor for 6 and 8, which is 7. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. **Node 5:**
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5. No triangle can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Already counted in Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7. No triangle can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8:**
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9:**
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. **Node 10:**
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 10.
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Already counted in Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. **Node 11:**
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 11. No triangle can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. **Node 12:**
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 12.
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> Already counted in Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. **Node 13:**
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 13. No triangle can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. **Node 14:**
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 14. No triangle can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Adding all the triangles from each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
