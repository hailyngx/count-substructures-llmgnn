Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Skip any pairs with Node 2 as they are not connected.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) - Both 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (4, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<4, 3, 1>)

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (1, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) - Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) - Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<1, 3, 4>)

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles found are: <4, 3, 1>, <1, 3, 4>.

The final answer is [2].
