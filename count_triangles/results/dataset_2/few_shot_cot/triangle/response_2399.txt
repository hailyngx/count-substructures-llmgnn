Response:
Following the method outlined in the previous example to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 8, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (15, 12) -> 15 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <4, 9, 13>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <4, 9, 16>.
    * Pair 4: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <4, 9, 15>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <6, 9, 13>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <9, 13, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10 to 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with the remaining nodes as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than each node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
