Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2)

Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 7

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) - Triangle formed: <1, 5, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Triangle formed: <3, 5, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
