Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, we will now find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are connected as (1, 0, 3) in the edge list, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are connected as (7, 2) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are connected as (9, 8) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (9, 4) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are connected as (9, 5) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
