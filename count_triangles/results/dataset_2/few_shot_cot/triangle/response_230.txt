Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we can calculate the number of triangles in this graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 6>
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> Triangle formed: <1, 2, 13>
    * Pair 2: (2, 0) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 2>
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> Triangle formed: <1, 2, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> Triangle formed: <3, 5, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as all other nodes are of smaller value.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> Triangle formed: <5, 6, 7>
    * Pair 2: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 4 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> Triangle formed: <2, 6, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
