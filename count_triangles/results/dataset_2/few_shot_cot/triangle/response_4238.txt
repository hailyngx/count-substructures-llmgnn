Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 16) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Since Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes, no triangles can be formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (12, 14) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip finding triangles as all potential pairs are with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (8, 16) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as (9, 17) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* The rest of the nodes have no triangles based on the available pairs.

Calculating the total number of triangles: [1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 9) = 5].

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: 
<3, 9, 17>
<3, 9, 4>
<3, 16, 1>
<4, 12, 14>
<6, 8, 16>.
