Response:
Following the procedure outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Now, we look for the third node connected to both 3 and 9:
    - 3 is connected to 9 with 3 as the intermediate node.
    - Triangle formed: <0, 3, 9>

- Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Now, we look for the third node connected to both 3 and 5:
    - 3 is connected to 5 with 6 as the intermediate node.
    - Triangle formed: <1, 3, 5>
  - Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Already counted in Node 0.
  - Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

- Node 2:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1.
  - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Now, we look for the third node connected to both 7 and 9:
    - 7 is connected to 9 with 3 as the intermediate node.
    - Triangle formed: <2, 7, 9>

- Node 3:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, as they are smaller than 3.
  - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Now, we look for the third node connected to both 6 and 7:
    - 6 is connected to 7 with 8 as the intermediate node.
    - Triangle formed: <3, 6, 7>
  - Pair 2: (7, 9) -> Already counted in Node 2.
  - Pair 3: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

- Node 4:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
  - No new triangles formed.

- Node 5:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0-4.
  - No new triangles formed.

- Node 6:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0-5.
  - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Now, we look for the third node connected to both 7 and 8:
    - 7 is connected to 8 with 5 as the intermediate node.
    - Triangle formed: <6, 7, 8>

- Node 7:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0-6.
  - No new triangles formed.

- Node 8:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0-7.
  - No new triangles formed.

- Node 9:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0-8.
  - No new triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
