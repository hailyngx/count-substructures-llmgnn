Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step by considering each node as the smallest numbered node to avoid redundancy:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 5, 17>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs can be considered as there is only one neighbor for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 17) -> 1 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 2, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 7, 16>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can be considered as there is only one neighbor for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 20 do not have at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles, so they are skipped.

Summarizing the triangles found:
[<2, 5, 17>, <1, 2, 6>, <4, 7, 16>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
