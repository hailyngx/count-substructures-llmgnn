Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (9, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (12, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (11, 14) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 11) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 10) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 4) -> 13 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (13, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (13, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Next, continue this process for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 to find the total number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node:

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = Sum of triangles with each node as the smallest numbered node.
