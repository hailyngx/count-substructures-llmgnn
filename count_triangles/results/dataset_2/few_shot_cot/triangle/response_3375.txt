Response:
Following the provided instructions, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not connected. No triangle is formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but are not connected. No triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but are not directly connected. No triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 9) -> 13 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but are not directly connected. No triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but are not directly connected. No triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but are not directly connected. No triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 but are not directly connected. No triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

I will continue this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 following the same steps outlined above.
