Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> Connected to each other and both nodes are connected to Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 17) -> Connected to each other and both nodes are connected to Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 5) -> Connected to each other and both nodes are connected to Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 17) -> Connected to each other and both nodes are connected to Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 5) -> Connected to each other but not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (17, 5) -> Connected to each other and both nodes are connected to Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 17) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [7].
