Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skipped as Node 0 doesn't have 2 smaller neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipped as Node 2 doesn't have 2 smaller neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 0 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skipped as Node 5 doesn't have 2 smaller neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 6:
    * Skipped as Node 6 doesn't have 2 smaller neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 7:
    * Skipped as Node 7 doesn't have 2 smaller neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 8:
    * Skipped as Node 8 doesn't have 2 smaller neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
