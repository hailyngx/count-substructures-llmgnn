Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (3, 13) shown in the edge list. 
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (2, 3) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list. 
    * Pair 6: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list. 
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, continue this process for Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.
