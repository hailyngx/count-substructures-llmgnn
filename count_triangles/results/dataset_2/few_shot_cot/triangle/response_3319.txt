Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 as they are smaller than 0.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (10, 2) -> 10 and 2 are connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

I will continue this analysis for Nodes 5 to 14. Just a moment.
