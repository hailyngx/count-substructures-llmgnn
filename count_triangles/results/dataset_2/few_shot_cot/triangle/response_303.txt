Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are connected as (3, 9) is in the edge list. But, 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are connected as (3, 2) is in the edge list. 3 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected as (6, 9) is in the edge list. But, 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are connected as (6, 2) is in the edge list. But, 6 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are connected as (9, 2) is in the edge list. But, 9 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 5: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are connected as (6, 0) is in the edge list. But, 6 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are connected as (0, 3) is in the edge list. 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors. But, 3 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are connected as (0, 9) is in the edge list. 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors. But, 9 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected as (4, 9) is in the edge list. 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected as (7, 9) is in the edge list. 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are connected as (7, 2) is in the edge list. 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.

Continuing to analyze Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9...

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are connected as (9, 0) is in the edge list. 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors. But, 0 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are connected as (2, 5) is in the edge list. But, 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles as there are no nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
