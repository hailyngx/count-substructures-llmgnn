Response:
Following the same approach as in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
