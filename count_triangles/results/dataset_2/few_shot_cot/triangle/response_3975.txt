Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Not neighbors.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Not neighbors.
    * Pair 4: (2, 3) -> Not neighbors.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> Neighbor check -> They are connected as (2, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> Neighbor check -> They are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Neighbor check -> They are connected as (2, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Neighbor check -> They are connected as (2, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Neighbor check -> They are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Neighbor check -> They are connected as (5 ,6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Neighbor check -> They are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Neighbor check -> They are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Neighbor check -> They are connected as (9, 2) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
