Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for Nodes 6 to 14:

* Node 6: 4 triangles
* Node 7: 3 triangles
* Node 8: 3 triangles
* Node 9: 4 triangles
* Node 10: 4 triangles
* Node 11: 2 triangles
* Node 12: 3 triangles
* Node 13: 4 triangles
* Node 14: 5 triangles

Summing up all the triangles found for each node:

[3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 4 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 4 (Node 9) + 4 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 11) + 3 (Node 12) + 4 (Node 13) + 5 (Node 14) = 43]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 43.
