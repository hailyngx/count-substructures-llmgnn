Response:
Following the same approach as explained in the example above, we will count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are not connected directly, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are not connected directly, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected directly, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are not connected directly, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 10) -> 16 and 10 are not connected directly, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 13) -> 16 and 13 are not connected directly, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 4: (17, 10) -> 17 and 10 are not connected directly, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 5: (17, 13) -> 17 and 13 are not connected directly, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are not connected directly, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 4) -> 17 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as there is only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as there are only two neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are not connected directly, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not connected directly, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as there are only two neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are not connected directly, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8 to 19) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
