Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip pairs containing nodes 1 and 8 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) - Both 0 and 6 are connected to 4, forming a triangle <0, 4, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs containing nodes 3, 5, and 9 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - Both 1 and 2 are connected to 13, forming a triangle <1, 2, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 11 and 14 as they are smaller.
    * Skip <1, 13> pair as it is the same triangle from Node 1.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs containing nodes 4 and 6 as they are smaller.
    * Skip <1, 13> pair as it is already counted.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - Both 3 and 8 are connected to 4, forming a triangle <3, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip <0, 6> and <1, 3> pairs as they are already counted.
    * Skip pairs containing nodes 7, 8, and 13 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are connected to 3, forming a triangle <4, 3, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs containing nodes 7 and 14 as they are smaller.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pair with Node 10 as it is smaller.
    * Skip <0, 4> pair as it is already counted.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Node 14 as it is smaller.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip <3, 4> pair as it is already counted.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip <1, 2> pair as it is already counted.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Skip <1, 2, 13> pair as it is already counted.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
