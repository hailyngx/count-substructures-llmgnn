Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 5: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 6: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 7: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 8: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 9: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 10: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (3, 0) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 5: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 7: (2, 0) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 8: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 9: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 10: (4, 0) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 6: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 7: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 6: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (1, 0) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 0) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
