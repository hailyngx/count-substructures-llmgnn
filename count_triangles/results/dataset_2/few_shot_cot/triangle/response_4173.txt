Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 1 are also connected as (8, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 3) = 9
* The unique triangles found:
    * <8, 1, 9>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
