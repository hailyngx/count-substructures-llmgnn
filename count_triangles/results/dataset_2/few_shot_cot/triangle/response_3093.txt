Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example provided above, we will go through each node to find the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (6, 17) -> Both 6 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
