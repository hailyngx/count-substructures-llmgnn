Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
