Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (all nodes) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
