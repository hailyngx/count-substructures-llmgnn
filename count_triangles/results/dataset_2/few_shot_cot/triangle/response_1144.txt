Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 26) -> Both 1 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (4, 16) -> Both 4 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
  * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 3 to 29:

* Node 3:
  * ...

After counting triangles for all nodes, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [71].
