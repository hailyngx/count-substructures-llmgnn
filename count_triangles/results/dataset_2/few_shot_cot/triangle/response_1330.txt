Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, I will now count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6 through 19:
    * Skipped due to the absence of at least two nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
