Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 21) -> 5 and 21 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 24) -> 15 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (16, 21) -> 16 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 26) -> 12 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (21, 24) -> 21 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 20) -> 9 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9 to 29:
    * Skipped pairs as each node does not have at least 2 greater nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
