Response:
Following the same step-by-step process used in the example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Directly connected, 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> Directly connected, 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 11) -> Directly connected, 14 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Directly connected, 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> Directly connected, 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) -> Directly connected, 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> Directly connected, 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Directly connected, 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 14. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> There is no edge between 5 and 10, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 14. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
