Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 9, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, 0, and node 7

Response:
Following the steps from the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
