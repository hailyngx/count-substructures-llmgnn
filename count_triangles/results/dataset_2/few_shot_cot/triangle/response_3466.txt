Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 13) -> Similarly, no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 12) -> Similarly, no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 12) -> Similarly, no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 12) -> Similarly, no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

We will continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 to find the total number of triangles.

Finally, we will count the total number of triangles in the graph and provide the answer inside brackets at the end.
