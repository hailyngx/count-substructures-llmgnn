Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (2, 3) - 2 and 3 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (2, 3) - 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (2, 6) - 2 and 6 are connected as (1, 2) and (1, 6) in the edge list. However, they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (2, 7) - 2 and 7 are connected as (1, 2) and (1, 7) in the edge list. However, they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are connected as (1, 3) and (1, 7) in the edge list. However, they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * Pair 1: (3, 5) - 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (3, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (5, 4) - 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (5, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2
        
    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (5, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * Pair 1: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 9) - 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected as (5, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
        * Pair 1: (6, 9) - 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
        * Pair 1: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
