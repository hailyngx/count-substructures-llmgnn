Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (27, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (27, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (15, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Since Node 2 is not connected to any other node, no triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 23) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 28) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (28, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (28, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (16, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (22, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (22, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 9 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (24, 25) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (17, 21) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 29) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (21, 29) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (6, 22) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * These nodes do not have pairs that form triangles with larger numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
