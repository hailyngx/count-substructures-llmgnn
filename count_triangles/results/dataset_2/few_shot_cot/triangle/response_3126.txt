Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No triangles formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles possible with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles possible with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes than Node 8.
    * No triangles possible with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 9 and 10:
    * No triangles possible as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 9 or 10.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes than Node 11.
    * No triangles possible with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 12, 13, 14, and 15:
    * No triangles possible as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 16, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 17, 18, and 19:
    * No triangles possible as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 16) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
