Response:
Following the same methodology as described in the example with the given graph's information:

Starting the triangle counting process for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0
