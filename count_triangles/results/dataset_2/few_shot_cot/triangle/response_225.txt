Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Continue the same process for the remaining nodes.
    * Continue this process for each node in the graph to count the total number of triangles.

By following the process outlined above for all remaining nodes and their pairs, we can calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph.
