Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example, here is the calculation for the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 0, 5, and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 0, 5, and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed as 0, 5, and 13 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed as 0, 9, and 13 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed as 1, 5, and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 1, 5, and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> No triangle formed as 2, 7, and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> No triangle formed as 2, 7, and 10 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed as 2, 7, and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (7, 13) -> No triangle formed as 2, 7, and 13 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> No triangle formed as 3, 2, and 12 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4, 5, and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <4, 5, 7>
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed as 4, 5, and 1 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, let's continue with Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 to find the total number of triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> No triangle formed as 7, 4, and 10 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> Triangle formed: <4, 7, 14>
    * Pair 3: (10, 11) -> No triangle formed as 7, 10, and 11 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed as 7, 10, and 14 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> No triangle formed as 8, 3, and 1 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> No triangle formed as 8, 3, and 10 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> No triangle formed as 8, 3, and 12 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 13) -> No triangle formed as 8, 3, and 13 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed as 9, 5, and 0 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 10.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 10, 4, and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed as 10, 4, and 14 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> Triangle formed: <7, 10, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Triangle formed: <10, 11, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> No triangle formed as 12, 3, and 13 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are <2, 3, 13>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 14>, <7, 10, 14>, and <10, 11, 14>.
