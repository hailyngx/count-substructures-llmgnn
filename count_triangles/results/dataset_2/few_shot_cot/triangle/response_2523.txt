Response:
Following the step-by-step method used in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 10 are also connected as (5, 10) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 13 are also connected as (5, 13) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 1 are also connected as (9, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 8) -> 14 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are also connected as (5, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 10 are also connected as (5, 10) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (11, 12) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors with edges between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest node: 0

Based on the calculations for each node, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 10, 13>
<5, 6, 14>
<9, 1, 14>
<11, 12, 13>
