Summarizing the triangles: 
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 5

Therefore, there are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are <6, 14, 17>, <6, 7, 9>, <9, 13, 3>, <13, 9, 12>, <14, 6, 17>.
