Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected in the adjacency list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected in the adjacency list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected in the adjacency list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected in the adjacency list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected in the adjacency list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected in the adjacency list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected in the adjacency list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 11: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Continue this process for Node 1...
