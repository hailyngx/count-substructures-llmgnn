Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 7 are also connected as (8, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 5 are also connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
