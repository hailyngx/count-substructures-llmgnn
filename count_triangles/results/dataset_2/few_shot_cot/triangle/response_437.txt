Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 7 and Node 9 = <0, 7, 9>
        * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 1-hop neighbors not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> 1-hop neighbors not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * No possible triangles as all pairs involve smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 5 = <2, 4, 5>

        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 5

    * Node 5:
        * No possible triangles as all pairs involve smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 7 and Node 14 = <6, 7, 14>

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 10 and Node 11 = <7, 10, 11>
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * No possible triangles as all pairs involve smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:

    * Node 12:
        * 1 possible triangle with smaller nodes. Skipped.
        * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 14:
        * No possible triangles as all pairs involve smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 5 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 12

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 7, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 11>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 14>, <4, 7, 10>, <4, 7, 11>, <4, 10, 11>, <6, 7, 14>, <7, 10, 11>, <9, 10, 13>, <10, 13, 14>

The final answer is [12].
