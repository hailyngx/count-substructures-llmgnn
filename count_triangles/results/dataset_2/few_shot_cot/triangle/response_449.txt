* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.

    * Pair 4: (10, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (12, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 7.

    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 as they are smaller than 12.

    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 as they are smaller than 14.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 as they are smaller than 15.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 16, 17, 18, or 19 to form triangles.

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1)+ 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
