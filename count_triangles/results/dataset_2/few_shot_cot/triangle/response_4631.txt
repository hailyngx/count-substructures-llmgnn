Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 16 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (16, 6) -> 16 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 16 and 6 are not connected because (16, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 6) -> 18 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 18 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
Output: [4]
