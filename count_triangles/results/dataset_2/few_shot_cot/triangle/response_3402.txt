Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 3) - No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 6) - No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (1, 8) - No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (3, 8) - No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * No pairs could be formed with nodes larger than 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (5, 3) - No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (3, 7) - No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (5, 1) - No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (5, 0) - No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (5, 2) - Triangle formed! <3, 5, 2>
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * No pairs could be formed with nodes larger than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * No pairs could be formed with nodes larger than 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * No pairs could be formed with nodes larger than 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * No pairs could be formed with nodes larger than 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * No pairs could be formed with nodes larger than 8.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * No pairs could be formed with nodes larger than 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up the total triangles from each node:
