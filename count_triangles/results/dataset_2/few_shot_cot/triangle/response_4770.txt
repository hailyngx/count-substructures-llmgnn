Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Both 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> Both 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> Both 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 10) -> Both 13 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <0, 13, 10>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 14) -> Both 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <1, 13, 14>.
    * Pair 3: (13, 7) -> Both 13 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed <2, 9, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> Both 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <2, 9, 14>.
    * Pair 4: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> Both 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <4, 8, 11>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> Both 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <5, 6, 11>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed <6, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Both 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 greater numbered nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
