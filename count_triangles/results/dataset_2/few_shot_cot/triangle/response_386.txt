Response:
Let's count the triangles in the graph following the same process as the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed, both 5 and 7 are only 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed, both 5 and 1 are only 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> No triangle formed, both 7 and 1 are only 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> No triangle formed, 5 and 15 are only 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> No triangle formed, 13 and 17 are only 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> No triangle formed, 11 and 17 are only 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) -> No triangle formed, 16 and 18 are only 1-hop neighbors of 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs as there are no nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 17) -> No triangle formed, 0 and 17 are only 1-hop neighbors of 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (16, 3) -> No triangle formed, 16 and 3 are only 1-hop neighbors of 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (16, 10) -> No triangle formed, 16 and 10 are only 1-hop neighbors of 9.
    * Pair 2: (16, 19) -> No triangle formed, 16 and 19 are only 1-hop neighbors of 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs as there are no nodes greater than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) -> No triangle formed, 16 and 18 are only 1-hop neighbors of 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip as there are no nodes greater than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Skip as there are no nodes greater than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip as there are no nodes greater than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (11, 2) -> No triangle formed, 11 and 2 are only 1-hop neighbors of 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (11, 9) -> No triangle formed, 11 and 9 are only 1-hop neighbors of 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed, 3 and 2 are only 1-hop neighbors of 17.

* Node 18:
    * Skip as there are no nodes greater than 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skip as there are no nodes greater than 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 5) = <5, 13, 17>

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
