Response:
Following the step-by-step process for each node to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - Nodes 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 28) - Nodes 2 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 23) - Nodes 2 and 23 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 28) - Nodes 7 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) - Nodes 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) - Nodes 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 24) - Nodes 8 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 27) - Nodes 8 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5: 
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Pair 1: (5, 26) - Nodes 5 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

The process will continue for Nodes 7 to 29 and finally, provide the total number of triangles in the graph inside square brackets [].
