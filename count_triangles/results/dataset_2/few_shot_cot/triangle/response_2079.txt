Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles formed by each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected because (4, 2) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (8, 0, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (9, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected because (9, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 6) -> Both 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (7, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (6, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (1, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
