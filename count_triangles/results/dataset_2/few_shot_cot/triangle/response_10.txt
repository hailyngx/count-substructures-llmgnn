Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are connected, forming a potential triangle. Since there are no other nodes connected to both 8 and 1, no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are connected, forming a potential triangle. Since there are no other nodes connected to both 8 and 7, no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are connected, forming a potential triangle. Since there are no other nodes connected to both 8 and 11, no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 15) -> 6 and 15 are connected, forming a potential triangle. Since there are no other nodes connected to both 6 and 15, no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are connected, forming a potential triangle. Since there are no other nodes connected to both 6 and 19, no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are connected, forming a potential triangle. Since there are no other nodes connected to both 10 and 12, no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are connected, forming a potential triangle. Since there are no other nodes connected to both 10 and 11, no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 1) -> 11 and 1 are connected, forming a potential triangle. Since there are no other nodes connected to both 11 and 1, no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are connected but have no other common neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes: 

* Node 5: 0 triangles
* Node 6: 0 triangles
* Node 7: 0 triangles
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 1 triangle <11, 16, 15>
* Node 16: 0 triangles
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 0 triangles
* Node 19: 0 triangles

Calculating the total number of triangles found: [1]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph, specifically the triangle formed by nodes 11, 16, and 15.
