Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 3 to 14: Following the same process, we get:
    * Node 3: 0
    * Node 4: 3
    * Node 5: 0
    * Node 6: 0
    * Node 7: 1
    * Node 8: 0
    * Node 9: 3
    * Node 10: 0
    * Node 11: 0
    * Node 12: 0
    * Node 13: 3
    * Node 14: 0

Summing up the triangles from each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 3 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
