Response:
Following the step-by-step process as mentioned in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 15) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 15) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 10) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 19) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 12) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 19) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 12) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (19, 12) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * The rest of the pairs include nodes with smaller numbers. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 1) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 12) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 1) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 1) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * The rest of the pairs include nodes with smaller numbers. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with. End.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * The rest of the pairs include nodes with smaller numbers. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 8), but since 3 and 8 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * The rest of the pairs include nodes with smaller numbers. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * The rest of the pairs include nodes with smaller numbers. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * The rest of the pairs include nodes with smaller numbers. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * The rest of the pairs include nodes with smaller numbers. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * The rest of the pairs include nodes with smaller numbers. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * The rest of the pairs include nodes with smaller numbers. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * The only pair we could consider is (11, 19), but since 11 and 19 are both smaller than 15, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with. End.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with. End.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with. End.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with. End.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
