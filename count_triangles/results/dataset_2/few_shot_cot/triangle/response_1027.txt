Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * <1, 7, 19> - Nodes 7, 1, and 19 form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * <3, 4, 11> - Nodes 4, 3, and 11 form a triangle.
    * <3, 5, 14> - Nodes 5, 3, and 14 form a triangle.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
