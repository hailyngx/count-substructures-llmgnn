Response:
Following the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
   - <u>Pair 1:</u> (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - <u>Pair 2:</u> (7, 2) - 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - <u>Pair 3:</u> (9, 2) - 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1:**
   - <u>Pair 1:</u> (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2:**
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
   - <u>Pair 1:</u> (1, 6) - 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
   - <u>Pair 2:</u> (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

4. **Node 3:**
   - <u>Pair 1:</u> (5, 9) - 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. **Node 4:**
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. **Node 5:**
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. **Node 6:**
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. **Node 7:**
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. **Node 8:**
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. **Node 9:**
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4 

Therefore, the final answer is: [4].

Unique triangles found:
<1, 4, 6> 
<2, 1, 6>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
