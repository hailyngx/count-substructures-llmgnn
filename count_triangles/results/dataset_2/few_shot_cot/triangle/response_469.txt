Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph by considering each node as the smallest numbered node and looking at the possible triangles:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 15) -> Form a triangle with Node 28
    - Pair 2: (6, 28) -> Form a triangle with Node 17
    - Pair 3: (15, 28) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Pair 4: (15, 17) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (13, 25) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Pair 2: (13, 22) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Pair 3: (25, 22) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (18, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Pair 2: (18, 25) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Pair 3: (8, 25) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (20, 4) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Pair 2: (20, 14) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Pair 3: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (11, 3) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Pair 2: (11, 26) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Pair 3: (3, 26) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - No other nodes to form triangles with
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (9, 23) -> Form a triangle with Node 12
    - Pair 2: (9, 12) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Pair 3: (23, 12) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (18, 29) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Pair 2: (18, 23) -> Form a triangle with Node 24
    - Pair 3: (7, 29) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Pair 4: (7, 23) -> Form a triangle with Node 24
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

9. Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (2, 15) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Pair 2: (2, 25) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Pair 3: (15, 25) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (6, 21) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Pair 2: (6, 23) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Pair 3: (6, 12) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Pair 4: (9, 21) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

...Continuing the process for the remaining nodes to calculate the total number of triangles in the graph.
