Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph. 

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 26) -> Connected to 11 and 26 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 6) -> Connected to 11 and 6 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (26, 6) -> Connected to 26 and 6 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    * Pairs involving Node 0 would have been counted when examining Node 0, so they are skipped as being smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (18, 25) -> Connected to 18 and 25 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (26, 15) -> Connected to 26 and 15 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (26, 3) -> Connected to 26 and 3 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (26, 4) -> Connected to 26 and 4 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (26, 14) -> Connected to 26 and 14 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (15, 3) -> Connected to 15 and 3 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (15, 4) -> Connected to 15 and 4 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (15, 14) -> Connected to 15 and 14 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 4) -> Connected to 3 and 4 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 14) -> Connected to 3 and 14 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 14) -> Connected to 4 and 14 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    * Pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 would have been counted when examining the respective nodes, so they are skipped as being smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (23, 28) -> Connected to 23 and 28 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (23, 24) -> Connected to 23 and 24 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (28, 24) -> Connected to 28 and 24 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4 â€“ Node 29:
    * Skipping these nodes as there are at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Adding all the triangles found for each node, we get:

[<11, 0, 26>, <12, 17, 19>, <12, 17, 20>, <12, 19, 20>, <15, 10, 25>, <18, 1, 25>, <18, 1, 7>]

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
