Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

- Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 3: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 3: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> 0 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> 0 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> 0 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 8:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 10:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 11:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 12:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 13:

  * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 15:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 16:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 17:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 18:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 19:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
