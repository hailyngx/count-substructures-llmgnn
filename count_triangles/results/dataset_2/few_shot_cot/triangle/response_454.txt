Response:
Following the example provided, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph by systematically examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 9, 18>, <4, 9, 11>, <8, 9, 13>, and <7, 9, 18>.

Hence, the number of triangles in the graph is [7].
