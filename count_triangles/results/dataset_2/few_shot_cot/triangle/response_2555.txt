Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0: 
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 , but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 22) -> 7 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair including Node 0 or Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 28) -> 3 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pairs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 involve nodes smaller than 3, so they are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pairs 1, 2, and 3 have already been counted for Node 0 and Node 1, so they are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pairs 1 and 2 include nodes smaller than 5, so they are skipped.
    * Pair 3: (10, 21) -> 10 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (25, 27) -> 25 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pairs 1 and 2 have already been counted for Node 0 and Node 4, so they are skipped.
    * Pair 3: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (15, 28) -> 15 and 28 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (21, 24) -> 21 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pairs 1 and 2 are already counted for Node 5 and Node 7, so they are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 11 to 29:
    * For these nodes, all possible pairs have at least one node smaller than the current node, so no additional triangles will be counted.

Summing up the total triangles found for each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
