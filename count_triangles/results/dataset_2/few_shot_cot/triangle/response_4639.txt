Response:
Following the step-by-step approach mentioned in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - 1 and 2 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) - 1 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) - 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 12) - 2 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 12) - 7 and 12 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs (1, 0), (1, 3), and (1, 6) as they are smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) - 3 and 11 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) - 3 and 13 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 11) - 6 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 13) - 6 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 13) - 11 and 13 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 5, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) - Both 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 8) - Both 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 9, 8>.
    * Pair 5: (9, 0) - Both 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 0) - Both 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) - 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4 and 5:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) - 7 and 10 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12:
    * Skipped as there aren't enough nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (13, 4) - 13 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph: <2, 5, 9> and <2, 9, 8>.
