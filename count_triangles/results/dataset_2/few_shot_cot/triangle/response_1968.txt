Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 2, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 5, 13>
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 14, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 5, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: <8, 3, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than Node 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: <13, 1, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * No triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
