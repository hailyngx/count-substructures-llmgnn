Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 27) -> 2 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 27 are also connected. Triangle formed - <0, 2, 27>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 28) -> 2 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed - <2, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 20) -> 2 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed - <2, 20, 8>.
    * Pair 4: (2, 27) -> These nodes were already considered when Node 0 was the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

The process should be continued for the remaining nodes, identifying triangles that have not already been counted:

* Continue this process for all other nodes in a similar fashion as demonstrated above.

After examining all nodes, the total number of unique triangles found will be added up, and the final answer will be provided in brackets [].
