Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is [9].
