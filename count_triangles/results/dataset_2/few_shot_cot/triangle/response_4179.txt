Response:
Following the process described in the example provided, let's identify the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Forms a triangle <0, 13, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 6) -> Forms a triangle <1, 13, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (13, 0) -> Forms a triangle <0, 13, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (14, 0) -> Forms a triangle <0, 13, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (17, 15) -> Forms a triangle <8, 17, 15>.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16:
    * Not part of any triangle as all its connections are to nodes smaller than itself.

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (17, 15) -> Forms a triangle <8, 17, 15>.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
    * Not part of any triangle as it is connected to a smaller node only.

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 9

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
