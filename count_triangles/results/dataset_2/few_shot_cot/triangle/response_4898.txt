Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> Both 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
   * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
   * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 14 are also connected as (9, 14).
   * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
   * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 13).
   * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
   * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (9, 13).
   * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
   * Skip 1-hop neighbors: 6, 9, and 14 (smaller nodes).
   * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as (3, 14).
   * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
   * Skip 1-hop neighbor: 0 (smaller node).
   * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
   * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
   * Skip 1-hop neighbors: 0 (smaller node).
   * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
   * Skip 1-hop neighbor: 2 (smaller node).
   * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
   * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
   * Skip 1-hop neighbors: 0 (smaller node).
   * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
   * Skip 1-hop neighbors: 0 and 1 (smaller nodes).
   * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
   * Skip 1-hop neighbors: 2 and 14 (smaller nodes).
   * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
   * Skip 1-hop neighbors: 2 (smaller node).
   * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
