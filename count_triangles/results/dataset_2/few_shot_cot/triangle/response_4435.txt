Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 6, 2>

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 5, 4>

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 9, 4>
    - Pair 2: (9, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 9, 2>

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (19, 18) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 19, 18>
    - Pair 2: (19, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 19, 4>

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (14, 18) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 14, 18>
    - Pair 2: (14, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 14, 4>

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (9, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: <5, 9, 11>
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 4, 5>

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: <5, 6, 7>

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (16, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 7, 16>

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (11, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: <8, 11, 13>

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (5, 18) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: <5, 9, 18>

- Node 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16:
    - Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

- Node 17:
    - Not connected to any other nodes, so no triangles.

- Node 18:
    - Pair 1: (14, 15) -> Triangle formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: <14, 15, 18>
    - Pair 2: (12, 15) -> Triangle formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: <12, 15, 18>
    - Pair 3: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 4, 18>

- Node 19:
    - Pair 1: (8, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: <8, 13, 19>
    - Pair 2: (3, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 12, 19>

Total number of triangles in the graph: [11]
Triangles found: <0, 6, 2>, <1, 5, 4>, <2, 9, 4>, <0, 9, 2>, <3, 19, 18>, <3, 19, 4>, <4, 14, 18>, <3, 14, 4>, <5, 9, 11>, <1, 4, 5>, <5, 6, 7>
