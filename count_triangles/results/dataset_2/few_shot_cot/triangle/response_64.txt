Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> Nodes 12 and 18 are connected to Node 0, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> Nodes 13 and 16 are not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 19) -> Nodes 7 and 19 are connected to each other. No other node can form a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (14, 19) -> Nodes 14 and 19 are connected to each other. No other node can form a triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> Nodes 9 and 12 are connected to each other. No other node can form a triangle with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Nodes 9 and 14 are connected to each other. No other node can form a triangle with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
