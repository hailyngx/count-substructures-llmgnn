Response:
Following the process detailed in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (5, 15) - Node 5 and Node 15 are connected to Node 0 and also connected to each other. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (5, 15) - Node 5 and Node 15 are connected to Node 1 and also connected to each other. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * No triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (5, 11) - Node 5 and Node 11 are connected to Node 3 but are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * No triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
  * No triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  * No triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
  * Pair 1: (15, 17) - Node 15 and Node 17 are connected to Node 7 and also directly connected to each other. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
  * Pair 1: (8, 13) - Node 8 and Node 13 are connected to Node 8 but are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * No triangle formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
  * No triangle formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
  * Pair 1: (11, 17) - Node 11 and Node 17 are connected to Node 11 and also connected to each other. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
  * No triangle formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
  * No triangle formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
  * No triangle formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 7, and 12 as they are smaller than 15.
  * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15 as they are smaller than 16. No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
  * No triangle formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
  * No triangle formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 11) = 4

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
