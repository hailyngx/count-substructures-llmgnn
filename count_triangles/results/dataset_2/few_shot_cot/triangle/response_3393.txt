Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 18) -> 1 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Now, we need to find if there is another common neighbor for 0, 1, and 13.
    - Pair 3: (13, 18) -> Node 18 is also a 1-hop neighbor of 0 and shared with nodes 1 and 13. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<1, 13, 18>)

2. Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Now, we need to find if there is another common neighbor for 1, 3, and 11.
    - Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are not connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

11. Node 10:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

12. Node 11:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

13. Node 12:
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

14. Node 13:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

15. Node 14:
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

16. Node 15:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 15.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

17. Node 16:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 16.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

18. Node 17:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 17.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

19. Node 18:
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

20. Node 19:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 19.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Nodes 1-19) = 1.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
