Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) - Node 0 is connected to Node 3, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) - Node 0 is connected to Node 7, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) - Node 0 is connected to Node 8, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 9) - Node 0 is connected to Node 9, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 2>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 5, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) - Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 6, 9>.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) - Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 9) - Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 9, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - Node 2 is connected to Node 3, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) - Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) - Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 8, 1>.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) - Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 9, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) - Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 6, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (3, 0) - Node 3 is connected to Node 0, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 4 to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <5, 7, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <5, 9, 1>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipping these nodes as there are no larger nodes to form triangles with.

Summing up the total triangles:
[<1, 4, 2>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 8, 1>, <2, 9, 5>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 9, 1>] = [10]

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
