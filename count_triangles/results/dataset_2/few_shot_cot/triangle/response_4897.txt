Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 6: <0, 5, 6>
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 and Node 4: <0, 9, 4>
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 6: <0, 1, 6>
    * Pair 4: (0, 3) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 6) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 and Node 4: <1, 9, 4>
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 and Node 2: <1, 6, 2>
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 and Node 5: <1, 2, 5>
    * Pair 4: (1, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 and Node 6: <1, 0, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 4: <2, 5, 4>
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 5: <2, 4, 5>
    * Pair 3: (2, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 6: <2, 1, 6>
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 and Node 0: <2, 6, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 0) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 2: <4, 5, 2>
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 and Node 0: <4, 9, 0>
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 and Node 5: <4, 2, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 14.

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
