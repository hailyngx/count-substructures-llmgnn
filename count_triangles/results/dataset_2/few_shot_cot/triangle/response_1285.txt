Response:
Following the process detailed in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

- Node 0:
  - Pairs: (9, 7), (9, 10), (9, 13), (7, 10), (7, 13), (10, 13)
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
  - Pairs: (4, 7), (4, 10), (4, 8), (7, 10), (7, 8), (10, 8)
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
  - Pairs: (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 14), (6, 13), (9, 7), (9, 14), (7, 14), (7, 13)
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
  - Pairs: (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 13), (10, 11), (10, 13), (11, 13)
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
  - Pairs: (14, 5), (14, 8), (5, 8)
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
  - Pairs: (10, 8), (10, 1), (10, 14), (8, 1), (8, 14), (1, 14)
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
  - Pair: (9, 13)
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
  - Pair: (9, 7)
  - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
  - Pairs: (9, 8), (9, 11), (9, 14), (8, 11), (8, 14), (11, 14)
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
  - Pairs: (2, 13), (2, 7), (2, 14), (13, 7), (13, 14), (7, 14)
  - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 10:
  - Pair: (8, 14)
  - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 11:
  - Pair: (3, 13)
  - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 12:
  - No pairs possible as there is only one neighbor.
  - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 13:
  - Pair: (0, 2)
  - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 14:
  - No pairs possible as there is only one neighbor.
  - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
