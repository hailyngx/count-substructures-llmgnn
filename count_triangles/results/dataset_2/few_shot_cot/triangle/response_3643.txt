Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 6) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 6) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (3, 7) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 9) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (8, 6) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (8, 1) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 7) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (1, 6) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (9, 2) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 4) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 4) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (0, 1) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 7) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (0, 9) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 1) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 4) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (1, 4) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (4, 2) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 1) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 1) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (5, 3) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 4) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 4) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
