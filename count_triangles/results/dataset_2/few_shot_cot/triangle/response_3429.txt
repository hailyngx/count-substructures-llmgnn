Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as it has only one connection to Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 8).
    * Triangle formed: <2, 5, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    * Triangle formed: <1, 4, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected.
    * Triangle formed: <5, 7, 9>
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> Both 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected.
    * Triangle formed: <4, 5, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> Both 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected.
    * Triangle formed: <1, 4, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
[<2, 5, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, <5, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 9>]
