Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph by examining each node step-by-step:

* Node 0:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
  - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
  - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
  - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
  - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
  - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
  - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
  - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
