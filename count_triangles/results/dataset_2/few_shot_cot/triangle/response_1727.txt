Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 5, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 9, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 2

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (5, 1, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, and 7 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Alright, let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 9 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
