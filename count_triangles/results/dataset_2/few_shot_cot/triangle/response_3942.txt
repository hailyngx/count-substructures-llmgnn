Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are also 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No other combination with larger nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are also 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
