Response:
Following the example provided, I will now determine the number of triangles in the graph by examining each node and the possible triangles it forms:

  * Node 0:
      * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> <0, 5, 2> Triangle formed.
      * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

  * Node 1:
      * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> <1, 5, 10> Triangle formed.
      * Pair 2: (1, 9) - Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
      * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

  * Node 2:
      * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Both 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 10, 11>.
      * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> <2, 5, 10> Triangle formed.
      * Pair 3: (2, 0) -> <0, 2, 5> Triangle formed.
      * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

  * Node 3:
      * Pair 1: (4, 17) - Both 4 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
      * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

  * Node 4:
      * Pair 1: (17, 3) -> <3, 4, 17> Triangle formed.
      * Pair 2: (15, 4) - Both 15 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
      * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

  * Node 5:
      * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> <2, 5, 10> Triangle formed.
      * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> <1, 5, 10> Triangle formed.
      * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

  * Node 6:
      * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

  * Node 7:
      * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

  * Node 8:
      * Pair 1: (14, 10) -> <8, 10, 14> Triangle formed.
      * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

  * Node 9:
      * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

  * Node 10:
      * No new triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

  * Node 11:
      * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

  * Node 12:
      * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

  * Node 13:
      * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

  * Node 14:
      * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

  * Node 15:
      * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

  * Node 16:
      * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

  * Node 17:
      * No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

  * Node 18:
      * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

  * Node 19:
      * No new triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.  
[<0, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 10>, <2, 10, 11>, <2, 5, 10>, <0, 2, 5>, <3, 4, 17>, <8, 10, 14>, <1, 5, 10>, <2, 5, 10>]
