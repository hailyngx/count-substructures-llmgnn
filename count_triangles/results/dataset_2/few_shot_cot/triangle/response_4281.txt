Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Following the same methodology as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> Node 3, 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3, 7 are directly connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Node 3, 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3, 8 are directly connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Node 0, 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0, 7 are directly connected as (0, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> Node 0, 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0, 8 are directly connected as (0, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles can be formed using Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Node 3, 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 3, 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Node 7, 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7, 9 are directly connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * No additional triangles can be formed using Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 8 or Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
