Node 5 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0: 
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both nodes 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both nodes 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1: 
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both nodes 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both nodes 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2: 
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0 and 1.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3: 
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both nodes 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. 
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4: 
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both nodes 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. 
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5: 
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6: 
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
