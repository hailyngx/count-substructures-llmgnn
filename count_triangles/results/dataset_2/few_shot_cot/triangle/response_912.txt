Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are connected as shown in the edge list. 
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are not connected as there is no edge (11, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 11 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 12 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 11) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Formed triangle: <1, 3, 11>

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Formed triangle: <2, 5, 12>

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Formed triangle: <3, 5, 11>

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 5.
* Unique triangles found: <0, 7, 12>, <0, 7, 13>, <1, 3, 11>, <2, 5, 12>, <3, 5, 11>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
