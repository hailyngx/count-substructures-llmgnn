Response:
Following the example provided, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Node 0:
   - Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. There is also an edge between 4 and 0 as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
   - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. There is also an edge between 4 and 1 as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
   - Pair 1: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
   - Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
   - Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:

   - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

7. Node 6:
   - Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6. There is also an edge between 1 and 6 as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
   - Pair 1: (19, 12) -> 19 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7. There is also an edge between 19 and 12 as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
   - Not connected to any other nodes, so no triangles.

10. Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9. There is also an edge between 1 and 9 as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
