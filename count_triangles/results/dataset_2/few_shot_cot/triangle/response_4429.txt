Response:
Following the method outlined in the previous example to count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (6, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (7, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are not connected, so no triangle formed. Skipping other pairs with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skipping any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Skipping other pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Skipping other pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (8, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Skipping other pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 
The triangles found are: <6, 7, 13>, <6, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 9>.
The final answer is [4].
