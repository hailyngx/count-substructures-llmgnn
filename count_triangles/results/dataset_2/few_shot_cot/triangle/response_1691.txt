Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined above, we can now determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are directly connected as (5, 1). No other common neighbor with 0 found to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are directly connected as (5, 0). No other common neighbor with 1 found to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are directly connected as (9, 0). No other common neighbor with 1 found to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are directly connected as (9, 6). No other common neighbor with 2 found to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are directly connected as (7, 4). No other common neighbor with 3 found to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected as (7, 8). No other common neighbor with 3 found to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8). No other common neighbor with 3 found to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are directly connected as (6, 8). No other common neighbor with 4 found to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are directly connected as (9, 2). No other common neighbor with 6 found to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
