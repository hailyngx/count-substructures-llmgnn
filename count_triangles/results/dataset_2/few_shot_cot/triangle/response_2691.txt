Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (18, 14) -> 18 and 14 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than their own numbers to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [0].
