Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (15, 16) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - No triangles possible with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - No triangles possible with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    - No other triangles possible with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No triangles possible with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each to form triangles.

- Node 11:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 11.
    - Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 12 to 16:
    - Skipped as they are smaller than Node 17.

- Node 17:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 16 as they are smaller than 17.
    - Pair 1: (17, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 17.
    - No other triangles possible with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 18 to 28:
    - Skipped as they are smaller than Node 29.

- Node 29:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 28 as they are smaller than 29.
    - No triangles possible with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 17) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
