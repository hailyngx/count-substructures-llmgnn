Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as before, we'll calculate the number of triangles by considering each node as the smallest numbered node in the potential triangle:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
  - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
  - Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Both 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
  - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 5.
  - No other nodes left to form triangles.
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
  - Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Both 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
  - Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Both 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
  - No other nodes left to form triangles.
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
  - Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Both 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
