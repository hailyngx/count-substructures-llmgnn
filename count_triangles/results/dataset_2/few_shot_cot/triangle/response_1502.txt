Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles formed as all pairs require at least one more node.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangles formed as all pairs require at least one more node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 25) -> Node 0 and Node 25 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and Node 0 and Node 25 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles formed as all pairs require at least one more node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (21, 19) -> Triangle formed with Node 21, Node 19, and Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (21, 5) -> Node 5 and Node 21 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (17, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 17, Node 8, and Node 5.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) + 1 (Node 23) + 1 (Node 25) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
