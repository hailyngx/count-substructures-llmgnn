Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Node 3 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
