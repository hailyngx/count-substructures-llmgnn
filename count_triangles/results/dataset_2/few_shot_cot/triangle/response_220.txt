* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 2 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) = 27

Therefore, there are 27 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<6, 9, 4>, <6, 9, 0>, <12, 14, 1>, <12, 14, 3>, <12, 13, 7>, <12, 13, 1>, <12, 8, 2>, <12, 8, 3>, <6, 9, 0>, <6, 9, 4>, <6, 4, 9>, <6, 4, 0>, <6, 0, 9>, <12, 14, 10>, <12, 14, 3>, <12, 3, 14>, <12, 3, 8>, <12, 3, 2>, <12, 8, 3>, <7, 12, 13>, <7, 12, 8>, <7, 13, 12>, <7, 13, 1>, <7, 8, 12>, <9, 6, 4>, <9, 6, 0>, <9, 4, 6>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [27].
