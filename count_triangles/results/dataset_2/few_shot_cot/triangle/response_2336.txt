Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (8, 6) -> Both 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (1, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> Both 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (0, 3) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
