Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 8 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 6 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 9 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 7 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continue this process for Nodes 3, 4, and 5.
