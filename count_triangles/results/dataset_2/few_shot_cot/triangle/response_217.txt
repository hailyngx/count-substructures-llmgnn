Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 17) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) - Node 4 and 12 are directly connected. No other node is a 1-hop neighbor of both. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (16, 17) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (16, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (17, 12) - Node 17 and 12 are directly connected. No other node is a 1-hop neighbor of both. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 16) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 16) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (16, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) - Node 8 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (18, 19) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 11) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (13, 1) - Node 13 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 19) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (15, 19) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (15, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (19, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 11) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9 to 19:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
