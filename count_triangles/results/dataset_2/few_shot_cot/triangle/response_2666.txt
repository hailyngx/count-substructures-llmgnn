Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No edge between 2 and 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> No edge between 2 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> No edge between 2 and 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected, but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected, but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are connected, but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 3) -> No edge between 2 and 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected, but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are connected, but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected, but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Proceeding with the same method for Nodes 2 through 9:

* Node 2:
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
[2 (Node 0)] 

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 8>.
