Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

*Node 0:
    *Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    *Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    *Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    *Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

*Node 1:
    *Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    *Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    *Pair 3: (11, 9) -> 11 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    *Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

*Node 2:
    *Pairs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 include nodes smaller than 2, so they are skipped.
    *Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 3:
    *Pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 include nodes smaller than 3, so they are skipped.
    *Pair 5: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    *Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

*Node 4:
    *Pairs 1, 2, and 3 include nodes smaller than 4, so they are skipped.
    *Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 5:
    *Pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 include nodes smaller than 5, so they are skipped.
    *Pair 5: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    *Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

*Node 6:
    *Pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 include nodes smaller than 6, so they are skipped.
    *Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 7:
    *Pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 include nodes smaller than 7, so they are skipped.
    *Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 8:
    *Pairs 1, 2, and 3 include nodes smaller than 8, so they are skipped.
    *Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 9:
    *Pairs 1 and 2 include nodes smaller than 9, so they are skipped.
    *Pair 3: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    *Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

*Node 10:
    *The only pair we could consider is (6, 8), but since 6 and 8 are both smaller than 10, this pair is skipped.
    *Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 11:
    *Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 5, and 13 as they are smaller than 11.
    *Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 12:
    *Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 12.
    *The pairs are also not in the correct order to form a triangle.
    *Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 13:
    *Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 13.
    *Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 14:
    *Pairs 1, 2, and 3 include pairs of nodes smaller than 14, so they are skipped.
    *Pair 4: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    *Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
*Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 7, 0>
<5, 11, 1>
<3, 8, 9>
<5, 13, 11>
<8, 9, 12>
<8, 9, 14>
