Response:
Following the method outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (0, 1, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (0, 3, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 0) - 2 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (1, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (0, 3, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (0, 4, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, and 9:
    * Can't form any triangles as there are no pairs of nodes larger than 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
