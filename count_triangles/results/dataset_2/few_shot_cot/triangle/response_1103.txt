    * Pair 2: (19, 17) - Nodes 19 and 17 are connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Skipping Nodes 12 to 19 as they have fewer than 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) = 17.

Therefore, there are 17 triangles in the given graph.
