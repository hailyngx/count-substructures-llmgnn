Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

- Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 11 are also connected as (3, 11) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 9: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    - No other pairs to consider as other 1-hop neighbors are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    - No other pairs to consider as other 1-hop neighbors are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - No other pairs to consider as other 1-hop neighbors are smaller than 10.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 12:
    - Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - No other pairs to consider as other 1-hop neighbors are smaller than 12.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2)
Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
