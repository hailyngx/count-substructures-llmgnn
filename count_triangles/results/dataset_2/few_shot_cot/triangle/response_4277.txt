Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> Nodes 11 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 29) -> Both nodes 10 and 29 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 27) -> Both nodes 10 and 27 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 27) -> Nodes 3 and 27 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 25) -> Nodes 12 and 25 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> Nodes 7 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 15) -> Nodes 7 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 26) -> Nodes 18 and 26 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 25) -> Nodes 9 and 25 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (11, 28) -> Nodes 11 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (19, 21) -> Nodes 19 and 21 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (22, 29) -> Nodes 22 and 29 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> Nodes 5 and 17 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for all the remaining nodes, we find the total number of triangles in the graph:

[<5, 9, 17>, <5, 9, 25>]
