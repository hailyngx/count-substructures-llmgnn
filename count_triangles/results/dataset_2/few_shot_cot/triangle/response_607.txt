Response:
Following the method outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 12) -> 15 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

The process would continue for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 as well to count all the triangles.

Finally, calculate the total number of triangles by adding up the triangles found with each node as the smallest numbered node.

[Total number of triangles in the graph: 9]

[Unique triangles found: <15, 12, 1>, <3, 14, 2>, <6, 14, 5>, <12, 15, 1>, <15, 18, 3>, <6, 8, 2>, <6, 14, 2>, <8, 14, 2>, <10, 14, 2>]
