Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by considering each node as the smallest numbered node and identifying the triangles it forms:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (6, 13) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (12, 13) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (9, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 2) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1. No other pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2. No other pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. No other pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (9, 13) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skip because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
