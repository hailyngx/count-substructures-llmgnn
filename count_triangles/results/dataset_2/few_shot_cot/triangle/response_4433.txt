Response:
Following the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph using the step-by-step approach for each node:

1. Node 0: No triangles can be formed as it is not connected to any other nodes.

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Connected through Node 1. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 18) -> Nodes 9 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 14) -> Connected through Node 1. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (15, 29) -> Nodes 15 and 29 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (15, 8) -> Nodes 15 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (15, 6) -> Nodes 15 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (15, 10) -> Nodes 15 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Connected through Node 3. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 14) -> Connected through Node 3. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 14) -> Connected through Node 3. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (27, 6) -> Nodes 27 and 6 are connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (13, 25) -> Nodes 13 and 25 are connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Connected through Node 6. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 23) -> Connected through Node 6. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 23) -> Connected through Node 6. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (12, 11) -> Nodes 12 and 11 are connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7: 0

9. Node 8:

    - Pair 4: (29, 6) -> Connected through Node 8. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (29, 3) -> Connected through Node 8. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (26, 23) -> Connected through Node 9. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (26, 1) -> Connected through Node 9. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (26, 18) -> Nodes 26 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (9, 1) -> Connected through Node 9. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (9, 18) -> Nodes 9 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (1, 18) -> Connected through Node 1. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9: 0

Continuing this process for all nodes would be quite exhaustive. Let's speed up by automating the computations.
