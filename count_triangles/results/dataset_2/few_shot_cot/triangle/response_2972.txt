Response:
Following the instructions from the example mentioned, here is the breakdown of counting triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 21) -> 4 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 21 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (20, 5) -> 20 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 20 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (14, 21) -> 14 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 14 and 21 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (14, 24) -> 14 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 14 and 24 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 3) -> 14 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 14 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (21, 24) -> 21 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 21 and 24 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (21, 3) -> 21 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 21 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (24, 3) -> 24 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 24 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 10 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 10 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

The calculations will be continued for Nodes 5 to 29 to find the total number of triangles in the graph.
