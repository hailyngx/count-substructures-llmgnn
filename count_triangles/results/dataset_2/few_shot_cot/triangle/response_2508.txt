Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 8>.
    * Pair 3: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 8>.
    * Pair 5: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 11>.
    * Pair 6: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 8, 10>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs that involve nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 6, 10>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs that involve nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs that involve nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 7, 11>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 7, 14>.
    * Pair 3: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 11, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs that involve nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <4, 9, 11>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <4, 9, 12>.
    * Pair 3: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <4, 0, 11>.
