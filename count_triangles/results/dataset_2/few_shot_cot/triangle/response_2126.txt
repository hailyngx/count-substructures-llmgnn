Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (13, 1) -> 13 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 7: (14, 9) -> 14 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2
