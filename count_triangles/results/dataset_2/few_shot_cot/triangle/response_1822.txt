Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 6 as it is greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Skip any pair including Node 5 or Node 8 as they are greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Skip any pair including Node 9 as it is greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Skip any pair with Node 4 as it is greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 5 as it is greater than 4.
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 7 as it is not directly connected to 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is not directly connected to 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing to find triangles with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 3 as it is not directly connected to 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 6, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 14.

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
