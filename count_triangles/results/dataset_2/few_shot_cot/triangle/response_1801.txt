Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> Node 0, Node 3, and Node 2 are not connected directly, so no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) -> No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (0, 3, 4)

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5, Node 9, and Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1, Node 8, and Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (1, 5, 9) and (1, 4, 8)

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3, Node 8, and Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (3, 1, 8)

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4, Node 9, and Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4, Node 8, and Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4, Node 7, and Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3 (4, 9, 7), (4, 8, 1), and (4, 7, 9)

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7, Node 9, and Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (7, 9, 4)

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8, Node 1, and Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (8, 1, 5)

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:  
[<0, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 1, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 1>, <4, 9, 7>, <7, 9, 4>, <8, 1, 5>]
