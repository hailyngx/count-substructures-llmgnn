Response:
Applying the triangle counting method described in the example to each node in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 8) -> 14 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 2) -> 14 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
