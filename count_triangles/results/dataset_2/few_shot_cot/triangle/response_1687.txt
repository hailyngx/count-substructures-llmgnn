Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider as there aren't two more significant nodes connected to Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no triplets of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Proceeding similarly for Nodes 6 to 14:

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
