Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's compute the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <2, 6, 9>
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <2, 8, 9>
    * Pair 4: (9, 0) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 9>
    * Pair 5: (4, 1) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <3, 6, 9>
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 9>
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 7>
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <6, 7, 9>
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <3, 6, 9>
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <4, 7, 9>
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <0, 7, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <2, 8, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No new triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 16.

Therefore, there are 16 triangles in the given graph.
