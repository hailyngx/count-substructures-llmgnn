Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 2) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 2) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 14) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 14) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) - Connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 2) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 14) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 14) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 1) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 0) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 0) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) - Connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 13) - Connected.
    * Pair 5: (9, 6) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 6) - Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) - Connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) - Connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 1) - Connected.
    * Pair 5: (10, 14) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 14) - Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 to count the total number of triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
[Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7]

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
