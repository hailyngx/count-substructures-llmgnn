Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed -> <2, 4, 15>
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Not considering since Node 4 is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed -> <2, 7, 10>
    * Pair 4: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed -> <2, 10, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed -> <4, 6, 9>
    * Pair 2: (4, 15) -> Not considering since Node 15 is greater than Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> Not considering since Node 2 is greater than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed -> <6, 9, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected. Triangle formed -> <10, 11, 19>
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles found:
[<2, 4, 15>, <2, 7, 10>, <2, 10, 14>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 9, 11>, <10, 11, 19>]
