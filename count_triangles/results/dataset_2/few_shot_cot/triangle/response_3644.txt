Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (17, 9) -> Both 17 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 6) -> 17 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (17, 4) -> 17 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipped any pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> Both 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 3) -> 10 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Repeat the same process for Nodes 3 to 19:

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> Both 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Same process for Node 6: Find and count the triangles <<14, 17, 6>> and <<17, 1, 6>>.

* Node 7:
    * Same process for Node 7: Find and count the triangles that node 7 participates in.

* Node 8:
    * Same process for Node 8: Find and count the triangles that node 8 participates in.

* Node 9:
    * Same process for Node 9: Find and count the triangles that node 9 participates in.

* Node 10:
    * Same process for Node 10: Find and count the triangles that node 10 participates in.

* Node 11, 18, and 19: 
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them for triangle formation.

After counting all the triangles for each node, sum up the total number of triangles in the graph.

Finally, provide the final answer in brackets based on the counted triangles inside <> such as [<triangle 1>, <triangle 2>, ...].
