Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - <6, 22, 3> Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - <16, 24, 1> Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - <0, 18, 20> Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

21. Node 20:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 20.
    - Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 0

22. Node 21:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 21.
    - Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 0

23. Node 22:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 22.
    - Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 0

24. Node 23:

    - Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 0

25. Node 24:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 24.
    - Total triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node: 0

26. Node 25:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 25.
    - Total triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node: 0

27. Node 26:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 26.
    - Total triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node: 0

28. Node 27:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 27.
    - Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 0

29. Node 28:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 28.
    - Total triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node: 0

30. Node 29:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 29.
    - Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up all the triangles found for each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
