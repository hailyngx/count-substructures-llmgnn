Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 1, 2, and 3 since they are greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 2 and 3 since they are greater than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 3 since it is greater than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs since all possible nodes to form triangles are greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs since all possible nodes to form triangles are greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs since all possible nodes to form triangles are greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 3, 4, and 5 since they are greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with node 16 since it is greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 15 since it is greater than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 13 since it is greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 14 since it is greater than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs since all possible nodes to form triangles are greater than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 17 since it is greater than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs since all possible nodes to form triangles are greater than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs since all possible nodes to form triangles are greater than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pairs since all possible nodes to form triangles are greater than 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 17 since it is greater than 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip any pairs since all possible nodes to form triangles are greater than 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pairs since all possible nodes to form triangles are greater than 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skip any pairs since all possible nodes to form triangles are greater than 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: 
<2, 16, 17>
<8, 12, 14>

Output: [3]
