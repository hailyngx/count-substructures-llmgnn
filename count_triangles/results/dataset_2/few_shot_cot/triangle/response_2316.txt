Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Node 0:
    - <10, 12, 5> forms a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - <8, 12, 4> forms a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - <10, 12, 4> forms a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - <11, 13, 8> forms a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - <11, 14, 9> forms a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

11. Node 10:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

12. Node 11:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

13. Node 12:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 as they are smaller than 12.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

14. Node 13:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 as they are smaller than 13.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

15. Node 14:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13 as they are smaller than 14.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 + 0 + 0 = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
