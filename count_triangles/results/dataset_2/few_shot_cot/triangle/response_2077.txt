Response:
Following the example provided, I will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node's connections. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 13) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (17, 13) -> 17 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 1) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 18) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 14) -> 18 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (19, 17) -> 19 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (19, 17) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (14, 7) -> 14 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (14, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (14, 6), but since 14 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8-19) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
