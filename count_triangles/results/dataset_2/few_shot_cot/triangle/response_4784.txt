Response:
Following the same methodology as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> No triangle can be formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> No triangle can be formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> Node 2 and Node 4 are 1-hop neighbors and connected to each other. Triangle formed <1, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> No triangle can be formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> No triangle can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * There are no triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.
    
* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Node 1 and Node 3 are 1-hop neighbors and connected to each other. Triangle formed <1, 3, 7>.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) -> Node 1 and Node 10 are 1-hop neighbors and connected to each other. Triangle formed <1, 8, 10>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> No triangle can be formed.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> Node 1 and Node 14 are 1-hop neighbors and connected to each other. Triangle formed <1, 12, 14>.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 12) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
