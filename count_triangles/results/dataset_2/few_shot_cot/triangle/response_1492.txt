Response:
Following the instructions in the example provided, here is the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Connected to both 7 and 14. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 13) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 5) -> Connected to both 14 and 5. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (14, 13) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (2, 5) -> Connected to both 2 and 5. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (2, 13) -> Connected to both 2 and 13. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (5, 13) -> Connected to both 5 and 13. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes. No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Connected to both 8 and 5. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> Connected to both 5 and 13. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (17, 9) -> Connected to both 17 and 9. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 19) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 19) -> Connected to both 9 and 19. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 due to smaller node numbers.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Connected to both 7 and 8. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> Connected to both 7 and 10. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 10) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for Node 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Nodes 10 to 19 will be considered in the same way.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
