Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph using the information provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Triangle formed <0, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) - Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 5) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (9, 1) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (14, 5) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (14, 4) - Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) - Triangle formed <2, 10, 12>.
    * Pair 2: (10, 7) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (12, 7) - Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) - Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) - Triangle formed <4, 12, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) - Triangle formed <5, 10, 11>.
    * Pair 2: (10, 1) - Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (14, 13) - Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 9) - Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (11, 5) - Triangle formed <10, 11, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (11, 6) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (11, 8) - Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) - Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 + 1 (Node 2) + 0 + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 10) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0
* Total triangles in the graph = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

Thus, the answer is [4].
