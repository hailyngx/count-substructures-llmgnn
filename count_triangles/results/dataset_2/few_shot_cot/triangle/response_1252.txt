Response:
Following the same method used in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 0) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 6 are connected as (0, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 7 are also connected as (1, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 5 are also connected as (7, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 7 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 4 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 1 and 0 are also connected as (1, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
