Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (22, 11) - Both 22 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 22 and 11 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 17) - Both 3 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 11) - Both 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 18) - Both 3 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (17, 11) - Both 17 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pair involving Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (23, 20) - Both 23 and 20 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (23, 27) - Both 23 and 27 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (23, 14) - Both 23 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 17) - Both 1 and 17 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (18, 14) - Both 18 and 14 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Pair 1: (22, 26) - Both 22 and 26 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

7. Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 8, 9, 10, and beyond until all nodes are covered.

Finally, calculate the total number of triangles by summing up the triangles found for each node: [Total number of triangles].
