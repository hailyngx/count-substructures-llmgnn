Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (13, 0) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 0) -> Already counted with Pair 1.
    * Pair 5: (11, 0) -> Already covered in Pair 2.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6:
    * Skipped due to having smaller numbered neighboring nodes or not having at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (9, 7) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 5) -> 15 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (15, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (18, 5) -> 18 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

I will continue this process for the remaining nodes and calculate the total number of triangles once every node has been evaluated.
