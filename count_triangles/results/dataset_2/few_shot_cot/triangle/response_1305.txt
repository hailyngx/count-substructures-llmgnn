Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (20, 25) -> Nodes 20 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and they are connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (20, 23) -> Nodes 20 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (25, 23) -> Nodes 25 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (27, 20) -> Nodes 27 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and they are connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
