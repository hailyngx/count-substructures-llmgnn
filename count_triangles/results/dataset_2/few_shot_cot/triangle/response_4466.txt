Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle with Node 0 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> No triangle with Node 0 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 9 are also directly connected as (0, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle with Node 1 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 5 are also directly connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are also directly connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are also directly connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> No triangle with Node 2 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> No triangle with Node 3 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 5 are also directly connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No valid triangle pair with Node 4 as the smallest node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle with Node 5 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No valid triangle pair with Node 6 as the smallest node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle with Node 7 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 9, 4>
<1, 9, 5>
<2, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<0, 9, 3>
