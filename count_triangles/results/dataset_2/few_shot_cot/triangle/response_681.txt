Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 24) -> 2 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 24) in the edge list.  
      Check for the third node connected to both 2 and 24. The nodes connected to 2 are {9, 0}, and the nodes connected to 24 are {3, 0, 16}. 
      The only common node connected to both is 0.
      Therefore, triangle <0, 2, 24> is formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 24) -> 3 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 24) in the edge list.  
      Check for the third node connected to both 3 and 24. The nodes connected to 3 are {28, 0} and the nodes connected to 24 are {0, 2, 16}. 
      The only common node connected to both is 0.
      Therefore, triangle <0, 3, 24> is formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. **Node 1:**
    - Since the 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 are smaller than 1, we skip this node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2:**
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3:**
    - Pair 1: (0, 24) -> Triangle <0, 3, 24> was already counted when analyzing Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4:**
    - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5:**
    - Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Let's continue this process for Nodes 7 through 29.
