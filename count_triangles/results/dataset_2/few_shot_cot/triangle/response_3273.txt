Response:
Following the same method as the example provided earlier, we will now identify the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 since they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Moving on to Nodes 6 to 14, following the same process.
