Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, we will now count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected. Formed triangle: <0, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 6: (4, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 7: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are connected. Formed triangle: <0, 4, 1>.
    * Pair 8: (4, 6) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 9: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are connected. Formed triangle: <0, 5, 1>.
    * Pair 10: (5, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 11: (5, 3) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 12: (9, 1) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 13: (1, 6) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 14: (6, 14) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are connected. Formed triangle: <2, 12, 13>.
    * Pair 2: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are connected. Formed triangle: <2, 12, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (12, 14) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are connected. Formed triangle: <2, 5, 13>.
    * Pair 5: (5, 12) -> Formed triangle: <2, 5, 12>.
    * Pair 6: (5, 1) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 7: (5, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 8: (5, 3) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 9: (13, 8) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 10: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are connected. Formed triangle: <2, 13, 12>.
    * Pair 11: (13, 2) -> Formed triangle: <2, 13, 2>.
    * Pair 12: (13, 5) -> Already counted.
    * Pair 13: (2, 12) -> Already counted.
    * Pair 14: (2, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6: Same process as for nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Node 3: 1 triangle.
    * Node 4: 1 triangle.
    * Node 5: 1 triangle.
    * Node 6: 0 triangles.

Continuing to Nodes 7 to 14 in the same manner as above:

* Node 7: 1 triangle.
* Node 8: 0 triangles.
* Node 9: 0 triangles.
* Node 10: 0 triangles.
* Node 11: 3 triangles.
* Node 12: 1 triangle.
* Node 13: 1 triangle.
* Node 14: 0 triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 3 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 16.

Therefore, there are 16 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [16].
