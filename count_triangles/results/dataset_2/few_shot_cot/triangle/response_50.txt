Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) -> 10 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 8 and 11 are not connected as there is no edge (8, 11) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 8 and 6 are not connected as there is no edge (8, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 13 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 13 and 11 are not connected as there is no edge (13, 11) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are not connected because (13, 0) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (14, 11) -> 14 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 14 and 11 are not connected as there is no edge (14, 11) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (14, 0) -> 14 and 0 are not connected because (14, 0) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 8 and 7 are not connected as there is no edge (8, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 13 and 7 are not connected as there is no edge (13, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 13 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not directly connected as there isn't an edge between them, although they are 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 10) -> 11 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 11 and 10 are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process similarly for Nodes 4 to 14 to calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph. Once this is done, please input the answer in brackets as indicated in the example.
