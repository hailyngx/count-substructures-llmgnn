Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1:**
   - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed <1, 4, 5>
   - Pair 2: (0, 5) -> Triangle formed <0, 1, 5>
   - Pair 3: (0, 4) -> No triangle formed
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. **Node 2:**
   - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed
   - Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed
   - Pair 3: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3:**
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4:**
   - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed <1, 4, 5>
   - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed <4, 6, 0>
   - Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

6. **Node 5:**
   - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**
   - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed <4, 6, 8>
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. **Node 7:**
   - Skip due to smaller adjacent nodes
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8:**
   - Pair 1: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed
   - Pair 2: (8, 13) -> Triangle formed <8, 13, 14>
   - Pair 3: (8, 14) -> No triangle formed
   - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. **Node 9:**
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. **Node 10:**
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. **Node 11:**
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 2: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 3: (11, 12) -> Triangle formed <10, 11, 12>
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

13. **Node 12:**
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. **Node 13:**
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. **Node 14:**
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 7

Therefore, there are **7 triangles** in the given graph.  
The unique triangles are:  
[<1, 4, 5>, <0, 1, 5>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 6, 8>, <8, 13, 14>, <10, 11, 12>, <10, 11, 12>]

So, the final answer is **[7]**.
