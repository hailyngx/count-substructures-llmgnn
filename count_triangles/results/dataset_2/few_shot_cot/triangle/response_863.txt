Response:
Proceeding to count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected, forming a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected, forming a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two other 1-hop neighbors of 2 that are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two other 1-hop neighbors of 3 that are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two other 1-hop neighbors of 4 that are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected, forming a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two other 1-hop neighbors of 6 that are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two other 1-hop neighbors of 7 that are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two other 1-hop neighbors of 8 that are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected, forming a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two other 1-hop neighbors of 10 that are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two other 1-hop neighbors of 11 that are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two other 1-hop neighbors of 12 that are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two other 1-hop neighbors of 13 that are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two other 1-hop neighbors of 14 that are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
