Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Nodes 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> Nodes 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (5, 17) -> Nodes 5 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (12, 14) -> Nodes 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (15, 13) -> Nodes 15 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

            * Pair 2: (10, 16) -> Nodes 10 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> Nodes 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> Nodes 14 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Pair 1: (2, 16) -> Nodes 2 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions.

        * Node 10:
            * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 11:
            * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 12:
            * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 13:
            * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 14:
            * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 15:
            * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 16:
            * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 17:
            * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 18 and Node 19:
            * Skipped because there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 8.

        Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

        So, the final answer is [8].
