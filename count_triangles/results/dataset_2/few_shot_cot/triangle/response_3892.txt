Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (12, 8) -> 12 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.

    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (12, 1) -> 12 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
