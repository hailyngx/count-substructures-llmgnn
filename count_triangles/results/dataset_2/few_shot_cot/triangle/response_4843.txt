Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 4). One triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 7). One triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
  - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 8). One triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
  - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 7). One triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
  - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
  - No additional triangles.

- Node 5:
  - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
  - No additional triangles.

- Node 6:
  - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
  - No additional triangles.

- Node 7:
  - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
  - No additional triangles.

- Node 8:
  - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
  - No additional triangles.

- Node 9:
  - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
  - No additional triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 4

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
