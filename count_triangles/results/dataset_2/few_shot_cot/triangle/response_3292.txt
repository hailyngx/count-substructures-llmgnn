Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, I will compute the number of triangles in the graph for each node. At the end, we will count all the triangles found to get the total number of triangles in the graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 1) -> 10 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangle can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangle can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
