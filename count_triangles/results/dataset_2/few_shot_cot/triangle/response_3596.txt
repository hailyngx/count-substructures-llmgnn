Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) - 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) - 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) - 3 and 6 are not connected because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are not connected because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are not connected because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) - 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 3) - 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Same pairs as Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 4 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 6 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 7 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than Node 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) - 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 9 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
