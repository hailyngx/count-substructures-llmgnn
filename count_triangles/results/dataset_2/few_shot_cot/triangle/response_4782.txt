Response:
Following the example provided, let's go step by step through each node to find the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 19 are directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 19:
    * No pairs to analyze as the other nodes connected to Node 19 are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
