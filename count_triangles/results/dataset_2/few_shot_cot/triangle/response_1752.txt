Response:
Following the step-by-step process as demonstrated in the initial example: 

* Node 0:
  * Skip any pairs that include Node 1 as it is greater than 0.
  * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 12 are also connected as (2, 12) shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 14, 17, or 19 as they are greater than 1.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 7, 11, 13, 17, or 19 as they are greater than 2.
  * Pair 1: (12, 0) -> 12 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 12 and 0 are also connected as (12, 0) shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 11, or 17 as they are greater than 3.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 12 or 13 as they are greater than 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 15, or 18 as they are greater than 5.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8, 9, or 10 as they are greater than 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 11, 17, or 19 as they are greater than 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 13 or 19 as they are greater than 8.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 10 or 19 as they are greater than 9.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
  * Skip any pairs with Node 19 as it is greater than 10.
  * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 14 or 18 as they are greater than 11.
  * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
  * Skip any pairs involving other larger nodes.
  * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
  * Skip any pairs with Node 19 as it is greater than 13.
  * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
  * Skip any pairs with Node 19 as it is greater than 14.
  * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
  * Skip any pairs with Node 18 as it is greater than 15.
  * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
  * Skip as there are no larger nodes to form a triangle with.
  * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
  * Skip any pairs with Node 19 as it is greater than 17.
  * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
  * Skip any pairs with Node 19 as it is greater than 18.
  * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 12) = 3. 
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 12>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
