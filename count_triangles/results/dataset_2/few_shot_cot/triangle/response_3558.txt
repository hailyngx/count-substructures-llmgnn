Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example, we will now count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Not a triangle because 0 and 5 are not connected.
    - Pair 2: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are directly connected, forming a pair.
    - Pair 3: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are directly connected, forming a pair.
    - Pair 4: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are directly connected, forming a pair.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are directly connected, forming a pair.
    - Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Not a triangle because 1 and 9 are not connected.
    - Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Not a triangle because 1 and 7 are not connected.
    - Pair 4: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are directly connected, forming a pair.
    - Pair 5: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are indirectly connected through node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    - Skip pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1.
    - Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are directly connected, forming a pair.
    - Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are directly connected, forming a pair.
    - Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are directly connected, forming a pair.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected, forming a pair.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are directly connected, forming a pair.
    - Pair 3: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are directly connected, forming a pair.
    - Pair 4: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are directly connected, forming a pair.
    - Pair 5: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are directly connected, forming a pair.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected, forming a pair.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected, forming a pair.
    - Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected, forming a pair.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8:
    - Skipped due to smaller node numbers.

* Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    - Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are directly connected, forming a pair.
    - Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are directly connected, forming a pair.
    - Pair 3: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are directly connected, forming a pair.
    - Pair 4: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are directly connected, forming a pair.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 4

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 5 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 4 (Node 9) = 17.

Therefore, there are 17 triangles in the given graph.
