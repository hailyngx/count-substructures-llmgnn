Response:
Following the pattern provided in the example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

1. Node 0:
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
   - Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are directly connected. Triangle formed <4, 7, 14>.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
   - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
   - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. Node 10:
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. Node 11:
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. Node 12:
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. Node 13:
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. Node 14:
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

16. Node 15:
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

17. Node 16:
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

18. Node 17:
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

19. Node 18:
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

20. Node 19:
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Finally, summing up the total triangles for all nodes, we get [1] triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [1].
