Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:** No triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles = 0.

2. **Node 1:** 
    - <17, 1, 16> - Nodes 17, 1, and 16 form a triangle. Total triangles = 1.

3. **Node 2:** No triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles = 1.

4. **Node 3:** 
    - <11, 3, 2> - Nodes 11, 3, and 2 form a triangle. Total triangles = 2.

5. **Node 4:** 
    - <11, 4, 9> - Nodes 11, 4, and 9 form a triangle. Total triangles = 3.

6. **Node 5:** No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles = 3.

7. **Node 6:** No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles = 3.

8. **Node 7:** 
    - <7, 13, 19> - Nodes 7, 13, and 19 form a triangle.
    - <7, 9, 14> - Nodes 7, 9, and 14 form a triangle.
    - <9, 13, 19> - Nodes 9, 13, and 19 form a triangle.
    - <9, 16, 1> - Nodes 9, 16, and 1 form a triangle.
    - <9, 16, 18> - Nodes 9, 16, and 18 form a triangle.
    - <9, 16, 10> - Nodes 9, 16, and 10 form a triangle.
    Total triangles = 9.

9. **Node 8:** No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles = 9.

10. **Node 9:** No triangles will be considered as all the possible pairs with Node 9 have already been covered when it was the smallest numbered node. Total triangles = 9.

11. **Node 10:** No additional triangles with Node 10 since all possible triangles with it have been counted. Total triangles = 9.

12. **Node 11:** No triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles = 9.

13. **Node 12:** No triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles = 9.

14. **Node 13:** No triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles = 9.

15. **Node 14:** No triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles = 9.

16. **Node 15:** No triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles = 9.

17. **Node 16:** No additional triangles with Node 16 since all possible triangles with it have been counted. Total triangles = 9.

18. **Node 17:** No triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles = 9.

19. **Node 18:** No triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles = 9.

20. **Node 19:** No additional triangles with Node 19 since all possible triangles with it have been counted. Total triangles = 9.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
