Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (5, 9) - No triangle formed as 9 is not connected to 5.
        * Pair 2: (5, 4) - No triangle formed as 4 is not connected to 5.
        * Pair 3: (5, 2) - No triangle formed as 2 is not connected to 5.
        * Pair 4: (9, 4) - No triangle formed as 4 is not connected to 9.
        * Pair 5: (9, 2) - No triangle formed as 2 is not connected to 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (5, 9) - No triangle formed as 9 is not connected to 5.
        * Pair 2: (5, 3) - No triangle formed as 3 is not connected to 5.
        * Pair 3: (5, 7) - Triangle formed as 5, 7, and the direct edge (5, 7) exist.
        * Pair 4: (9, 3) - No triangle formed as 3 is not connected to 9.
        * Pair 5: (9, 7) - No triangle formed as 7 is not connected to 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip all combinations with smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Skip all combinations with smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip all combinations with smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip all combinations with smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip all combinations with smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Skip all combinations with smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip all combinations with smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Skip all combinations with smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
