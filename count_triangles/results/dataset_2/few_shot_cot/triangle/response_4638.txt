Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

*Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 18) -> 1 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 3) -> 10 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

*Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 1.

*Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) - Both 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 3 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

*Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) - Both 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

*Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) - Both 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) - Both 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 10) - Both 14 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

*Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.

*Node 10:
    * No pairs to form triangles with nodes greater than 10.

*Node 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least two greater numbered nodes to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
