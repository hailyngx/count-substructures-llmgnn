Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 17)  - Nodes 10 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected as (10, 17) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 9)   - Nodes 10 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 9)   - Nodes 17 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected as (17, 9). 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is greater than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * No pairs can be formed with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No pairs can be formed with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs can be formed with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs can be formed with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs can be formed with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 17)  - Nodes 9 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, and they are connected as (9, 17).
    * No other pairs can be formed with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can be formed with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (17, 20)  - Nodes 17 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 9, and they are connected as (17, 20).
    * No other pairs can be formed with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No pairs can be formed with Nodes smaller than 10.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10.
