Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Connected via edge (2, 0) and (0, 4), they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> Connected via edge (2, 0) and (0, 12), they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> No edge between 2 and 13. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 12) -> No edge between 4 and 12. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 13) -> Connected via edge (4, 0) and (0, 13). They are 1-hop neighbors. No edge directly between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 13) -> Connected via edge (0, 12) and (0, 13). They are 1-hop neighbors. No edge directly between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No edge between 5 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> No edge between 5 and 10. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> No edge between 5 and 13. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 10) -> Connected via edge (9, 1) and (1, 10). They are 1-hop neighbors. No edge directly between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 13) -> Connected via edge (9, 1) and (1, 13). They are 1-hop neighbors. No edge directly between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 13) -> Connected via edge (10, 1) and (1, 13). They are 1-hop neighbors. No edge directly between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with Node 0 or Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No edge between 7 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> No edge between 7 and 11. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 4) -> Connected via edge (7, 2) and (2, 4). They are 1-hop neighbors and directly connected. Triangle formed <2, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 4: (11, 5) -> No edge between 11 and 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Continue the process for Node 3 and the remaining nodes similarly.

After following the process for all nodes, you can then calculate the total number of triangles formed in the graph by summing up the triangles found for each node. Finally, provide the answer in brackets [] with unique triangles listed inside <> like <0, 2, 4>.
