        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (21, 22) -> 21 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 21 and 22 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (17, 22) -> 17 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 17 and 22 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (19, 0) -> 19 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 19 and 0 are not connected as there is no edge (19, 0) in the list. No triangle formed.
