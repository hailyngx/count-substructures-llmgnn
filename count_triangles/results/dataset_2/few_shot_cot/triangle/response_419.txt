Response:
Following the same process as described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 10) -> Node 10 is not connected to nodes 2 or 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> Node 0 and Node 3 are connected as (0, 3) in the edge list forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Node 0 and Node 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> Node 0 and Node 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 13) -> Node 0 and Node 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> Node 0 and Node 4 are connected as (0, 4) in the edge list forming a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (3, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs containing nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Node 6 and Node 7 are connected as (6, 7) in the edge list forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> Node 3 and Node 12 are connected as (3, 12) in the edge list forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Node 2 and Node 8 are connected as (2, 8) in the edge list forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7.
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> Node 3 and Node 12 are connected as (3, 12) in the edge list forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> Node 0 and Node 1 are connected as (0, 1) in the edge list forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:

    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with larger nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:  
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
