Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 1 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 1 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 1 (Node 29) = 12
