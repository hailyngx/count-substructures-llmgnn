Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step using the nodes provided:

1. **Node 0**:
    - <1, 2, 0>: Nodes 1, 2, and 0 form a triangle since they are all connected to each other.
    - <8, 7, 0>: Nodes 8, 7, and 0 form a triangle since they are all connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. **Node 1**:
    - <6, 9, 1>: Nodes 6, 9, and 1 form a triangle since they are all connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2**:
    - <3, 7, 2>: Nodes 3, 7, and 2 form a triangle since they are all connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. **Node 3**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. **Node 4**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. **Node 5**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. **Node 6**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. **Node 7**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. **Node 8**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. **Node 9**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

11. **Node 10**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

12. **Node 11**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

13. **Node 12**:
    - <1, 10, 12>: Nodes 1, 10, and 12 form a triangle since they are all connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

14. **Node 13**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

15. **Node 14**:
    - <6, 8, 14>: Nodes 6, 8, and 14 form a triangle since they are all connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are **5 triangles** in the given graph.
