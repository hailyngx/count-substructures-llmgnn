Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected because (4, 7) are not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 5 are also connected as (6, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (6, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are not connected because (1, 12) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are directly connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for Nodes 6, 7, and 8:

- Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Node 1, 6, and 9 can form a triangle <1, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 14), but since 3 and 14 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t enough nodes greater than 8 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) = 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
