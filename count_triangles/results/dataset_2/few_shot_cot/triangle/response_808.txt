Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 19 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider since all other nodes connected to Node 2 are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 11 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 18 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 13 and 18 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are not connected because (13, 19) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 16 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are not connected because (9, 19) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider since all other nodes connected to Node 7 are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider since all other nodes connected to Node 8 are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 16 and 19 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10, 11, 12, and 13:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, and 16 and 19 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 15, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16 to 19:
    * Skipped because for these nodes, there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 14) = 8.

Therefore, the answer is [8].
