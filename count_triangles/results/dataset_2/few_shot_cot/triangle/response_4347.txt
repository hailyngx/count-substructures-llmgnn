Response:
Following the approach described in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (14, 12) -> 14 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (14, 6) -> 14 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipped pairs with smaller nodes than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skipped pairs with smaller nodes than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipped pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continue this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [5].
