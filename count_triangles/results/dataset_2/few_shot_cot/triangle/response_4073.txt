Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 1) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 18) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> Both 8 and 16 are connected to 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are connected to 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 10) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 18) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (16, 10) -> Both 16 and 10 are connected to 4. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 1) -> Both 2 and 1 are connected to 6. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 18) -> Both 6 and 18 are connected to 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 0) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> Both 8 and 16 are connected to 2. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (17, 12) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 11) -> Both 12 and 11 are connected to 9. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 4) -> Both 10 and 4 are connected to 16. Triangle formed.
