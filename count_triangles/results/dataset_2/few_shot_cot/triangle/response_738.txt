Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Connected. Check third node:
        * (2, 0, 8) form a triangle. Triangle <0, 2, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs for Node 1 since all its neighbors have smaller node numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> Connected. Check third node:
        * (2, 8, 16) form a triangle. Triangle <2, 8, 16>.
    * Pair 2: (8, 3) -> Connected. Check third node:
        * No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs for Node 3 since all its neighbors have smaller node numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs for Node 4 since all its neighbors have smaller node numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs for Node 5 since all its neighbors have smaller node numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs for Node 6 since its neighbor has a smaller node number.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs for Node 7 since its neighbor has a smaller node number.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * (2, 17, 8) form a triangle. Triangle <2, 17, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No pairs for Node 9 since all its neighbors have smaller node numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No pairs for Node 10 since all its neighbors have smaller node numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> Connected. Check third node:
        * No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No pairs for Node 12 since all its neighbors have smaller node numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No pairs for Node 13 since all its neighbors have smaller node numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (1, 18) -> Connected. Check third node:
        * No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * No pairs for Node 15 since all its neighbors have smaller node numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (2, 17) -> Connected. Check third node:
        * (2, 17, 16) form a triangle. Triangle <2, 17, 16>.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * No pairs for Node 17 since all its neighbors have smaller node numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> Connected. Check third node:
        * No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No pairs for Node 19 since all its neighbors have smaller node numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 16) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
