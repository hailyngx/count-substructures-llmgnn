Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 27) -> 7 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 27 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (26, 27) -> 26 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 26 and 27 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (16, 21) -> 16 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 16 and 21 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 23) -> 6 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 23 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (14, 27) -> 14 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 14 and 27 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 27) -> 2 and 27 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node as there is only one adjacent node (28) which is smaller.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 5 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node as there is only one adjacent node (4) which is smaller.

* Node 11:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node as all its adjacent nodes are smaller.

All other nodes either have no triangle formations or don't have at least two larger adjacent nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

\[<5, 6, 23>, <11, 16, 20>, <16, 4, 21>, <26, 27, 3>, <14, 6, 27>, <5, 9, 18>\]
