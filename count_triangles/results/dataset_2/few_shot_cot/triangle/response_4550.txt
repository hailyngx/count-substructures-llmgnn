Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 14.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 12.
    * Pair 3: (14, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 14 and Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 and Node 14.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles possible with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Triangle already counted when considering Node 0.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 and Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No triangles possible with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles possible with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No further triangles possible with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles possible with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles possible with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No further triangles possible with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles possible with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Triangle already counted when considering Node 0.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (2, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Triangle already counted when considering Node 0.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles possible with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles possible with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No further triangles possible with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 5) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
