Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are connected, but 7 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are directly connected, but 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 and 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No pair left for node 5 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are directly connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of each other. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 7. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
    * No pair left for node 13 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 14, 15, 16, and 17:
    * Skipped since they are not part of any triangle-forming pairs.

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 18. No triangles can be formed with node 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 19.
    * Pair 1: (12, 17) -> 12 and 17 are directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 19. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 19) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
