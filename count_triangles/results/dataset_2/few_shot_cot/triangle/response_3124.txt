Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example given, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (21, 24) -> 21 and 24 are not connected because (21, 24) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (20, 23) -> 20 and 23 are not connected because (20, 23) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (20, 7) -> 20 and 7 are not connected because (20, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (20, 11) -> 20 and 11 are not connected because (20, 11) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (20, 6) -> 20 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 20 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 22) -> 11 and 22 are not connected because (11, 22) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 11 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (27, 14) -> 27 and 14 are not connected because (27, 14) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (27, 18) -> 27 and 18 are not connected because (27, 18) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (27, 29) -> 27 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (15, 4) -> 15 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5 - 29:
    * These nodes will follow a similar process of evaluating all possible pairs of 1-hop neighbors for triangle formation.

After going through this process for all nodes, the total number of triangles will be calculated as instructed.
