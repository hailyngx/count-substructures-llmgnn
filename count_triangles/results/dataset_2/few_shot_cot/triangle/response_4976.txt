Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: Skipped - Node 0 is not part of any triangle.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> Both 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller than Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> Both 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> Both 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> Both 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (16, 9) -> Both 16 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 11) -> Both 16 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Both 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> Both 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> Both 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
