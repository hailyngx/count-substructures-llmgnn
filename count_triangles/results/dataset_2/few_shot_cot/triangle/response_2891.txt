Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Not considering any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Not considering any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Not considering any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9: 
    * Skip nodes as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Not considering any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 13, 14, and 15:
    * Skipped as there aren't enough nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 16:
    * Not considering any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 as they are smaller than 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Not considering any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 19 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
