Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 10: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 11: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 12: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 13: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 5 (Triangles: <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 14>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 3, 5>)

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 5 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
