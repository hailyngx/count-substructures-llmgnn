Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 4). 
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 1). 
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (9, 4).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 7).
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 0).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (9, 8).
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (9, 0). 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 6).
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 0).
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5. No additional triangles for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 3, 5 as they are smaller than 6. No additional triangles for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 7. No additional triangles for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 2, 6, 7 as they are smaller than 8. No additional triangles for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 8 as they are smaller than 9. No additional triangles for Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
