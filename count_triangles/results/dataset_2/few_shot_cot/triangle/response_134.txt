Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (13, 0) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 15) -> 1 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 4) -> Both 13 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continue this process for Nodes 5 to 19, then sum up the total triangles found for each node to get the final count. 

Finally, provide the answer inside brackets [] with unique triangles listed inside <> such as <0, 2, 4>.
