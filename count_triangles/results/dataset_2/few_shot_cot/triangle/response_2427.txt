Response:
Following the step-by-step triangle counting process for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
