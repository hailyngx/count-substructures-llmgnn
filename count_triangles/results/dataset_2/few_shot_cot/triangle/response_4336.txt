Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not connected as there is no edge (1, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not connected as there is no edge (3, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not connected as there is no edge (3, 1) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Continuing this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because they each have fewer than 2 nodes with a larger number.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
