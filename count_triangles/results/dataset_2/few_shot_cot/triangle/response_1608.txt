Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 28) -> 7 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 28 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 28) -> 6 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 28 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 1 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 13 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 13 and 19 are not directly connected as there is no edge (13, 19) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (16, 24) -> 16 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 16 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (16, 21) -> 16 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 16 and 21 are not directly connected as there is no edge (16, 21) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 23) -> 1 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 1 and 23 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 23) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 28) -> 0 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 28 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for all nodes, the final answer is:  
[<11, 5, 22>, <4, 24, 17>, <8, 13, 2>, <28, 1, 26>, <23, 20, 6>, <28, 27, 21>, <15, 16, 24>]
