Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the graph by following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 2) -> 12 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 2) -> 14 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (15, 8) -> 15 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 3, 4, 5: 
    * Similar to the above process, you can evaluate the number of triangles with each of these nodes as the smallest numbered node. 

Continue this process for the remaining nodes in the graph and then sum up the total number of triangles formed by each node.

Finally, provide the total number of triangles in the graph in the format [total_number_of_triangles].
