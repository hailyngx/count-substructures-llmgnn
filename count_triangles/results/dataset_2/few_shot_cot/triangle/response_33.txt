Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the provided example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <4, 0, 5>
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are connected, but 0 and 9 do not have a common neighbor in the 1-hop neighbor set of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Triangle formed: <1, 9, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Triangle formed: <5, 2, 12>
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are connected, but they do not share a common neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <4, 3, 5>
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed: <3, 0, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are connected, but they do not share a common neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Proceeding with Nodes 6 to 14 in a similar manner:

    * Node 6: Total triangles = 0
    * Node 7: Total triangles = 0
    * Node 8: Total triangles = 1
    * Node 9: Total triangles = 1
    * Node 10: Total triangles = 0
    * Node 11: Total triangles = 0
    * Node 12: Total triangles = 1
    * Node 13: Total triangles = 0
    * Node 14: Total triangles = 1

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph by summing up the triangles found for each node:

Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 9

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
