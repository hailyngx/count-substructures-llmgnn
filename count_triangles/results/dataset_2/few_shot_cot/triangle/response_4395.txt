Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as in the previous example to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as there is no edge between 5 and 7. No triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as per the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as per the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
