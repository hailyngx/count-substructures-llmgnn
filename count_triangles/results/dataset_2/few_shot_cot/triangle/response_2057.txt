Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 14) - Both 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 13) - Both 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (1, 13). Potential triangle formed pending the third node.
    - No more possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (4, 3) - Both 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (3, 4). Potential triangle formed pending the third node.
    - Pair 2: (4, 12) - Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (4, 5). Potential triangle formed pending the third node.

- Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 15:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 16:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 17:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 18:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 19:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Calculating the total number of triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. [2]
