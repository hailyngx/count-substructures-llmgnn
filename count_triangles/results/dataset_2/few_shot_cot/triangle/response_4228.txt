Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 4) -> Node 2 is connected to both 0 and 4. Node 0 is connected to 4, so a triangle <0, 2, 4> is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Node 0 is connected to both 2 and 4. Node 2 is connected to 4, so a triangle <0, 2, 4> is formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> Node 0 is connected to both 2 and 8. Node 2 is connected to 8, so a triangle <0, 2, 8> is formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Node 0 is connected to both 3 and 4. Node 3 is connected to 4, so a triangle <0, 3, 4> is formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 4) -> Node 9 is connected to both 3 and 4. Node 3 is connected to 4, so a triangle <3, 4, 9> is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) -> Node 2 is connected to both 4 and 9. Node 4 is connected to 9, so a triangle <2, 4, 9> is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Now continuing with Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> Node 2 is connected to both 9 and 4. Node 9 is connected to 4, so a triangle <2, 4, 9> is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
