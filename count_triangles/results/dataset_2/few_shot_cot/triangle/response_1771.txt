Response:
Following the process outlined in the initial example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (27, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (27, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (27, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (27, 29) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 29) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (10, 29) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 29) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (25, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (25, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (29, 18) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (29, 26) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (29, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (29, 25) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (18, 26) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (18, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (18, 25) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (26, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (26, 25) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (10, 25) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

I will continue this process for all nodes in the graph to calculate the total number of triangles. Let's proceed with this detailed calculation.
