Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
