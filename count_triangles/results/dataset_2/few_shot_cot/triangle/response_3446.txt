Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 0, 5, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 2, and node 0

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided and applying it to the given graph, we will count the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
