Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node individually:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (8, 14) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (14, 0, 15) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (10, 1, 12) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (11, 2, 15) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (8, 9, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (9, 3, 17) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

The process continues for the remaining nodes, and the total number of triangles in the graph will be calculated and presented in the final answer. Let's proceed with this approach for all nodes.
