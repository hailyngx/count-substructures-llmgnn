Response:
Following the step-by-step approach explained before, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (3, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) - 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (9, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) - 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) - 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 8, 0>
<3, 9, 7>
<4, 8, 2>
<1, 8, 3>
<9, 7, 3>
