Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 6: <0, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> Nodes 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 14: <1, 4, 14>.
    * Pair 2: (8, 17) -> Nodes 8 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Nodes 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 and Node 14: <0, 3, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Perform the same process for Nodes 6 through 19 to count triangles. 

Continuing the process:

* Node 6:
    * Skip any smaller nodes in pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (16, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16 and Node 9: <7, 9, 16>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any smaller nodes in pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any smaller nodes in pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (12, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12 and Node 7: <7, 10, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (14, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14 and Node 5: <5, 11, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (15, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 15 and Node 9: <9, 12, 15>.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Skip any smaller nodes in pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any smaller nodes in pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skip any smaller nodes in pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip any smaller nodes in pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip any smaller nodes in pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skip any smaller nodes in pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skip any smaller nodes in pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, sum up the total number of triangles for each node:

* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
