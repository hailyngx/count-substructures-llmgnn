Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined above, here is the breakdown of counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> <0, 5, 9> Formed a triangle.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> <1, 3, 9> Formed a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 25) -> No triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 20) -> No triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 26) -> No triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> <1, 11, 13> Formed a triangle.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14.

* Node 15:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 15.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17.

* Node 18:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 18.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19.

* Node 20:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 20.

* Node 21:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 21.

* Node 22:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 22.

* Node 23:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 23.
