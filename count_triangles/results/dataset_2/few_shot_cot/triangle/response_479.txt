Response:
Following the process outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> Node 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 11) -> Node 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. They are also connected. No other nodes connected to both 8 and 11. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Node 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> Node 2 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> Node 2 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 17) -> Node 2 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 13) -> Node 8 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 14) -> Node 8 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (8, 17) -> Node 8 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (13, 14) -> Node 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. They are also connected. No other nodes connected to both 13 and 14. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (13, 17) -> Node 13 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. They are also connected. No other nodes connected to both 13 and 17. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Continue this process for Node 2 and all other nodes in the graph.
