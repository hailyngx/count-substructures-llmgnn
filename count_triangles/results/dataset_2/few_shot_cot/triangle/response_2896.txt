Response:
Following the same step-by-step process described in the example above, we will find the number of triangles in this graph:

1. Node 0:
    - <2, 5, 0> is a triangle.
    - No other triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 0: 1

2. Node 1:
    - No triangle involving Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1: 0

3. Node 2:
    - <6, 10, 2> is a triangle.
    - No other triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 2: 1

4. Node 3:
    - No triangle involving Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3: 0

5. Node 4:
    - No triangle involving Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 4: 0

6. Node 5:
    - No triangle involving Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5: 0

7. Node 6:
    - <2, 6, 8> is a triangle.
    - <6, 9, 3> is a triangle.
    - No other triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 6: 2

8. Node 7:
    - No triangle involving Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7: 0

9. Node 8:
    - No triangle involving Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 8: 0

10. Node 9:
    - <6, 9, 8> is a triangle.
    - No other triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 9: 1

11. Node 10:
    - No triangle involving Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 10: 0

12. Node 11:
    - No triangle involving Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 11: 0

13. Node 12:
    - No triangle involving Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 12: 0

14. Node 13:
    - No triangle involving Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 13: 0

15. Node 14:
    - No triangle involving Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 14: 0

Adding up the triangles formed with each node as the smallest numbered node:
[1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5]

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
