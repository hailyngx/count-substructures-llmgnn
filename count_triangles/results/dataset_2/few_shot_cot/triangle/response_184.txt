Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> Both 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 19) -> Both 4 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 19) -> Both 10 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> Both 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 8) -> Both 13 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> Both 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Similar to previous skips, as we move to larger nodes.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> Both 7 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> Both 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 11) -> Both 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 15) -> Both 7 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 11) -> Both 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 15) -> Both 10 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (11, 15) -> Both 11 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped due to the same rationale.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 4 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
1. <4, 0, 19>
2. <5, 3, 9>
3. <5, 3, 8>
4. <9, 3, 8>
5. <1, 6, 8>
6. <7, 10, 15>
7. <7, 18, 15>
8. <10, 15, 15>
9. <11, 15, 15>
