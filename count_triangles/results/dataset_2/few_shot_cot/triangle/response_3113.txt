Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (10, 2) - 10 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (10, 3) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (11, 12) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (11, 2) - 11 and 2 are directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (11, 3) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (12, 2) - Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (8, 13) - 8 and 13 are directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (8, 14) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (8, 11) - 8 and 11 are directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (13, 14) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (13, 2) - 13 and 2 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) - 7 and 13 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) - 7 and 6 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) - 7 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (13, 6) - 13 and 6 are directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (13, 12) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (6, 12) - 6 and 12 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) - Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8:
    * Skipped as they are smaller than Node 9 and already covered in previous cases.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) - 4 and 0 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) - 4 and 1 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (7, 0) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (7, 1) - 7 and 1 are directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (0, 1) - Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, and 12:
    * Skipped as they are smaller than Node 13 and already covered in previous cases.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) - 1 and 14 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) - 2 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:  
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:  
<[7, 8, 11], [7, 9, 11], [7, 9, 1], [8, 11, 1], [7, 13, 6], [13, 6, 12], [10, 2, 11], [1, 13, 14], [4, 7, 9]>.

So, the final answer is: [9].
