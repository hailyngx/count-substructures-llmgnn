Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0: 
    - Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1: 
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2: 
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No more triangles including Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3: 
    - Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - No more triangles including Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4: 
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5: 
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No more triangles including Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6: 
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7: 
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (13, 2) -> 13 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - No more triangles including Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8: 
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    - No more triangles including Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9: 
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - No more triangles including Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10: 
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 10.
    - Pair 1: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No more triangles including Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11: 
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    - No more triangles including Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12: 
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, and 11 as they are smaller than 12.
    - No more triangles including Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13: 
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, and 12 as they are smaller than 13.
    - Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14: 
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 14.
    - No more triangles including Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<7, 2, 13> and <0, 8, 7>.

So, the final answer is [2].
