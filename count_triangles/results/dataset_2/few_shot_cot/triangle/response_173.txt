Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) - Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) - There is no edge between 9 and 16, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) - Forms a triangle with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) - Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Node 1 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Skip any pair with Node 2 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) - Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) - Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 17) - Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) - Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes than Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pair with 4 as it is smaller than 11.
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) - Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes than Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) - Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes than Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (0, 17) - Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes than Node 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) - Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) - Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.  
[<0, 3, 8>, <0, 15, 3>, <3, 8, 0>, <3, 17, 0>, <8, 17, 3>, <9, 10, 1>, <11, 19, 6>, <13, 11, 7>, <15, 7, 0>, <19, 10, 11>]
