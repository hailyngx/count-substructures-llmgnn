Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are connected through node 1. Triangle formed. 
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected through node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected through node 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected through node 2. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are connected through node 3. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4. No valid triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No valid triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No valid triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected through node 7. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8. No valid triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9. No valid triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
