Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (9, 12) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (6, 1) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (6, 12) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (6, 0) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (8, 1) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 9: (8, 12) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 10: (8, 0) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 11: (1, 12) - Triangle formed as 1, 12, and 0 form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 11) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (11, 12) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (12, 14) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (14, 12) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) - No triangle formed as they are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:
    Since these nodes have no pairs greater than them to form triangles, they will not contribute to any triangles in the count.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
