Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs with higher-numbered nodes. No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs with higher-numbered nodes. No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs with higher-numbered nodes. No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No edges connected to Node 6, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs with higher-numbered nodes. No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs with higher-numbered nodes. No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs with higher-numbered nodes. No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No pairs with higher-numbered nodes. No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No pairs with higher-numbered nodes. No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No pairs with higher-numbered nodes. No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * No pairs with higher-numbered nodes. No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * No pairs with higher-numbered nodes. No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * No pairs with higher-numbered nodes. No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * No pairs with higher-numbered nodes. No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No pairs with higher-numbered nodes. No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Finally, adding up all the triangles counted for each node: 0

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
