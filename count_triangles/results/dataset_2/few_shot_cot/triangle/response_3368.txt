Response:
Following the same methodology as explained in the initial example, let's go through each node in the graph to count the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 16: <0, 3, 10>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> Node 0 is connected to node 3 and 14. Node 3 is connected to node 14. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 19) -> Nodes 1, 2, and 19 are all connected to each other. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 19>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) -> Triangle formed with Node 1: <1, 2, 19>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> No triangle formed as nodes are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> No triangle formed as nodes are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed as nodes are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (10, 14) -> Nodes 3, 10, and 14 are connected to each other. Triangle formed: <3, 10, 14>.
    * Pair 5: (13, 15) -> No triangle formed as nodes are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 10: <4, 7, 11>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> No triangle formed as nodes are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> No triangle formed as nodes are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 10: <4, 7, 11>.
    * Pair 2: (10, 11) -> Nodes 7, 10, and 11 are connected to each other. Triangle formed: <7, 10, 11>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 19) -> Triangle formed with Node 1: <1, 2, 19>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles formed as there are no pairs of directly connected nodes from Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <4, 7, 11>.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 14: <10, 13, 14>.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 3: <3, 10, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <4, 7, 10>.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * No triangles formed as there are no pairs of directly connected nodes from Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 3 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) = 13.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
