Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 4 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 0 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 3 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [9].

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 4, 0>, <5, 0, 3>, <3, 5, 7>, <9, 4, 7>, <5, 7, 3>, <4, 9, 7>, <5, 6, 3>, <4, 0, 9>, <4, 0, 5>.
