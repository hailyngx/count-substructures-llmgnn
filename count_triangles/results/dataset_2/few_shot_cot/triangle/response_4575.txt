Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected because (5, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> Both 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 1 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Node 5 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Both 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 9 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> Both 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 7 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
