Response:
Following the same process used in the example above, we will count the triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, continue the process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 to find the total number of triangles.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
