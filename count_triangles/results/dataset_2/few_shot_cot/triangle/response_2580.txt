Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph by adding the triangles found for each node:
[1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 19]

Therefore, there are 19 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles found are:
[<3, 14, 0>, <4, 11, 1>, <4, 12, 1>, <13, 14, 2>, <5, 9, 3>, <6, 11, 5>, <5, 13, 6>, <3, 11, 9>, <10, 12, 4>, <10, 7, 4>, <12, 7, 10>, <9, 14, 8>, <12, 7, 10>, <3, 11, 9>, <13, 4, 11>, <6, 13, 11>, <12, 7, 10>, <4, 14, 13>, <7, 4, 12>]
