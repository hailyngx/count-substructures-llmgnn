Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 has only one neighbor, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (11, 16), but since 11 and 16 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (18, 14) -> 18 and 14 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Let's continue this process for Nodes 5 through 10.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 5. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0, 1, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9, 10:
    * Skipped because there isn't at least 2 nodes greater than 9 or 10.

Summarizing the triangles so far:
* Total triangles = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 5

Let's continue this process for Nodes 11 through 20 to find the total number of triangles in the graph.
