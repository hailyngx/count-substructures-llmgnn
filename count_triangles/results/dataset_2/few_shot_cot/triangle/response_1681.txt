Response:
Following the method described in the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 11) -> Node 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 11) -> Node 2 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 11) -> Node 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> Node 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> Node 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Node 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> Node 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 11) -> Node 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 11) -> Node 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Node 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (14, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14:
    * Skipped as they do not have enough nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7 triangles] in the given graph.
