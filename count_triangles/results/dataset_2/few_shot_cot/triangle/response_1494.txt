Response:
Following the same methodology as the example provided, I will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node. 

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (7, 20) -> 7 and 20 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (0, 20) -> 0 and 20 are directly connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors. They are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: No possible pairs with at least two other nodes greater than 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors. They are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (3, 25) -> 3 and 25 are directly connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors. They are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors. They are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (4, 29) -> 4 and 29 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are directly connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors. They are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (5, 24) -> 5 and 24 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are directly connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors. They are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are directly connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors. They are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are directly connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors. They are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (8, 20) -> 8 and 20 are directly connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors. They are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (9, 24) -> 9 and 24 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are directly connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors. They are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15:
        * No possible triangles with at least two other nodes greater than them.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. 
Output: [9]
