Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 12 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 11 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 1 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 13 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 12 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
