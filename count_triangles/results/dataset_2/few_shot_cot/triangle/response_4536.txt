Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (21, 12) -> 21 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (21, 19) -> 21 and 19 are connected due to edge (0, 21), but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are connected due to edge (0, 12), but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (29, 10) -> 29 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected due to edge (2, 10). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (27, 7) -> 27 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and they are connected due to edge (4, 27). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5-29:
    * Following the same process, calculating triangles for each node:
    * Node 5: 0 triangles.
    * Node 6: 0 triangles.
    * Node 7: 1 triangle.
    * Node 8: 1 triangle.
    * Node 9: 0 triangles.
    * Node 10: 3 triangles.
    * Node 11: 1 triangle.
    * Node 12: 0 triangles.
    * Node 13: 1 triangle.
    * Node 14: 1 triangle.
    * Node 15: 0 triangles.
    * Node 16: 0 triangles.
    * Node 17: 0 triangles.
    * Node 18: 1 triangle.
    * Node 19: 1 triangle.
    * Node 20: 0 triangles.
    * Node 21: 1 triangle.
    * Node 22: 0 triangles.
    * Node 23: 0 triangles.
    * Node 24: 1 triangle.
    * Node 25: 1 triangle.
    * Node 26: 0 triangles.
    * Node 27: 1 triangle.
    * Node 28: 1 triangle.
    * Node 29: 1 triangle.

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 3 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 1 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 1 (Node 24) + 1 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 1 (Node 27) + 1 (Node 28) + 1 (Node 29) = 14

[14]

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.
