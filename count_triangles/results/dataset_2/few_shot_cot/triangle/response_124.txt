Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (5, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (5, 4) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 0 are connected as (0, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge (9, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (9, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected as there is no edge (3, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected as there is no edge (7, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2 because (5, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2 because (5, 1) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected as there is no edge (7, 1) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (9, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (9, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (9, 2) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (7, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
