Response:
Let's count the triangles step-by-step for each node in the graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 2) -> 14 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (19, 2) -> 19 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 7) -> 14 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 7) -> 19 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (14, 4) -> 14 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 6) -> 18 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Repeat this process for Nodes 5 to 19.

After going through each node, the triangles found are as follows:
[<4, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 13, 9>, <12, 15, 18>]
