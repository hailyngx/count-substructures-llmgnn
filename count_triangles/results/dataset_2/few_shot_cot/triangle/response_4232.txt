Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are connected in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are connected in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are connected in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are connected in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Since these nodes do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles, they will not contribute to any triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
