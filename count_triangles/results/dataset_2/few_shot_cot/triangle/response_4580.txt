Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 18 are also connected as (14, 18).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 11 and 13 are also connected as (11, 13).
    * Pair 2: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 13 and 19 are also connected as (13, 19).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2
