Response:
Following the step-by-step triangle counting method as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) - Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 16) - Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) - Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Direct connection, but not 1-hop neighbors, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 16) -> Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> Direct connection, but not 1-hop neighbors, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 19) -> Direct connection, but not 1-hop neighbors, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> Direct connection, but not 1-hop neighbors, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Direct connection, but not 1-hop neighbors, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 19) -> Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 18) -> Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [0].
