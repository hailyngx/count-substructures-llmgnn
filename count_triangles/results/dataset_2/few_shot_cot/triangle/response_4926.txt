Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (3, 0), (3, 5), (5, 0) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 3), (6, 12), (12, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

6. Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

7. Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (7, 6), (7, 9), (9, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (8, 7), (8, 12), (12, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

10. Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

11. Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11.

13. Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12.

14. Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13.

15. Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
