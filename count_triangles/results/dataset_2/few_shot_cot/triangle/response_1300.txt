Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 20) -> 8 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 22) -> 0 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Checking if there is a third node connected both to 0 and 22:
        * Node 28 is connected to 0 and 27. So, the triangle <0, 22, 28> is formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 24) -> 0 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Checking if there is a third node connected to both 0 and 8:
        * Node 25 is connected to 0, 15, and 26. So, the triangle <0, 8, 25> is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 29) -> 1 and 29 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are directly connected. Checking if there is a third node connected to both 1 and 19:
        * No other node is connected to 1 and 19. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Following the similar process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 2: 5 triangles
    * <2, 6, 21>
    * <2, 15, 26>
    * <2, 16, 27>
    * <2, 18, 15>
    * <2, 18, 4>

* Node 3: 3 triangles
    * <3, 17, 13>
    * <3, 11, 24>
    * <3, 25, 15>

* Node 4: 2 triangles
    * <4, 18, 15>
    * <4, 18, 2>

* Node 5: 0 triangles

* Node 6: 1 triangle
    * <6, 21, 13>

* Node 7: 0 triangles

* Node 8: 0 triangles

* Node 9: 1 triangle
    * <9, 20, 15>

* Node 10: 0 triangles

* Node 11: 2 triangles
    * <11, 24, 27>
    * <11, 29, 1>

* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 2 triangles
    * <13, 21, 6>
    * <13, 17, 3>

* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 2 triangles
    * <15, 4, 18>
    * <15, 20, 9>

* Node 16: 1 triangle
    * <16, 27, 7>

* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 1 triangle
    * <18, 15, 4>

* Node 19: 1 triangle
    * <19, 7, 27>

* Node 20: 1 triangle
    * <20, 15, 9>

* Node 21: 0 triangles
* Node 22: 1 triangle
    * <22, 13, 21>

* Node 23: 0 triangles
* Node 24: 0 triangles
* Node 25: 0 triangles
* Node 26: 1 triangle
    * <26, 15, 25>

* Node 27: 2 triangles
    * <27, 7, 19>
    * <27, 16, 2>

* Node 28: 0 triangles
* Node 29: 0 triangles

Calculating the total number of triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 + 0 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 28

Therefore, there are 28 triangles in the given graph.
