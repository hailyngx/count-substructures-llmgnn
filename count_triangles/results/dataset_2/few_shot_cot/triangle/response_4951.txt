            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 14.

        Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.
