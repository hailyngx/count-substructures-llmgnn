Response:
Following the method described in the example, we will now count the triangles step-by-step for all nodes in the graph.

* Node 0:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Nodes 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Nodes 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Nodes 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected by the edge (3, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Nodes 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected by the edge (4, 8).
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected by the edge (4, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 5, 6 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Nodes 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected by the edge (5, 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 6 as it is smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 7, 8 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Nodes 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected by the edge (7, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with node 8 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Nodes 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected by the edge (8, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there isn't at least one node greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
