Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (0, 14) -> Triangle formed: <0, 14, 16>.
    * Pair 3: (0, 17) -> Triangle formed: <0, 14, 17>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> Triangle formed: <1, 7, 10>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 19) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed: <7, 9, 10>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> Triangle formed: <1, 7, 10>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Triangle formed: <0, 8, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Triangle formed: <7, 9, 10>.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> Triangle formed: <1, 7, 10>.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as there are no configurations where at least two nodes are greater than them to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
