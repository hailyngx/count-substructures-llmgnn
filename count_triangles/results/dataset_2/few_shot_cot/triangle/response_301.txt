    * Pair 4: (9, 7) - Connected, triangle formed <1, 9, 7>.
    * Pair 5: (9, 6) - Not connected, no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) - Connected, triangle formed <2, 9, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Connected, triangle formed <3, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) - Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) - Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 4: (7, 6) - Connected, triangle formed <3, 7, 6>.
    * Pair 5: (7, 1) - Connected, triangle formed <3, 7, 1>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) - Connected, triangle formed <4, 5, 0>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) - Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 4: (8, 7) - Connected, triangle formed <4, 8, 7>.
    * Pair 5: (8, 2) - Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 6: (0, 7) - Connected, triangle formed <4, 0, 7>.
    * Pair 7: (0, 6) - Connected, triangle formed <4, 0, 6>.
    * Pair 8: (0, 1) - Connected, triangle formed <4, 0, 1>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 5:
    * Skipped as all adjacent nodes are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) - Connected, triangle formed <6, 9, 3>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) - Connected, triangle formed <8, 9, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 6 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 19.

Therefore, there are [19] triangles in the given graph.
