Response:
Following the step-by-step process described earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph: 

    * Node 0: 
        * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 6) and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected as (5, 7) and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are connected as (5, 0) and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are connected as (5, 4) and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1: 
        * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are connected as (3, 9) and both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2: 
        * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 8) and both are 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected as (5, 7) and both are 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are connected as (5, 4) and both are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3: 
        * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are connected as (9, 8) and both are 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are connected as (9, 4) and both are 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 7: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are connected as (8, 7) and both are 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 8: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are connected as (4, 0) and both are 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9: 
        * Skipped as they are smaller than the already checked nodes and do not form triangles on their own.

    Summarizing the triangles: 
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) = 4

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
