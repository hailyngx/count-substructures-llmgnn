Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as all neighbors are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as all neighbors are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as all neighbors are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider as all neighbors are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles found for each node:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
