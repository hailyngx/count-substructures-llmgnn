Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs as no other nodes are greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
