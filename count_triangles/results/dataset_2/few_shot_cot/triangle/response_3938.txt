Response:
Following the example step-by-step process for each node to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> Formed a triangle with Node 12.
    * Pair 2: (2, 19) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 19) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 12) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (19, 12) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Formed a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> Formed a triangle with Node 10.
    * Pair 3: (8, 12) -> Formed a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 4: (15, 13) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (15, 12) -> Formed a triangle with Node 7.
    * Pair 6: (13, 12) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 5) -> Formed a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 3) -> Formed a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (6, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 15) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph. 
The triangles are: 
[<1, 2, 12>, <2, 3, 5>, <6, 8, 10>, <6, 7, 15>].
