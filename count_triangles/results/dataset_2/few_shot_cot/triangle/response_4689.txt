Response:
Following the example provided, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 26) -> 14 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (14, 26) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (14, 24) -> 14 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 12) -> 14 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (14, 12) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (24, 26) -> 24 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (25, 27) -> 25 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 29) -> 15 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8:
    * Skipped as they either have smaller numbered 1-hop neighbors or are not part of any triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 22) -> 13 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped as they either have smaller numbered 1-hop neighbors or are not part of any triangles.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (2, 26) -> 2 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 15, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (6, 27) -> 6 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 16, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 17, 18, 19, 20:
    * Skipped as they either have smaller numbered 1-hop neighbors or are not part of any triangles.

* Node 21:
    * Pair 1: (14, 23) -> 14 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 21, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 22, 23:
    * Skipped as they have smaller numbered 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 24:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 24, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Skipped as they have smaller numbered 1-hop neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 24) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
