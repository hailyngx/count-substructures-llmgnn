Response:
Following the method shown in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph based on each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 9 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 9 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (10, 6) -> 10 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 10 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> Both 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 8) -> Both 10 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 10 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) -> Both 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 10 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 12) -> Both 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> Both 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> Both 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 13 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (10, 6) -> Both 10 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 10 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for the remaining nodes to find the total number of triangles in the graph.
