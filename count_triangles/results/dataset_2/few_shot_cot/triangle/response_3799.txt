Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 3) -> 13 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Since there are no other nodes connected to Node 1, no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 because it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 9) -> 11 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 10) -> 11 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are connected. No additional triangles formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 10) -> 14 and 10 are connected. No additional triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (16, 15) -> 16 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are connected. No additional triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 10) -> 14 and 10 are connected. No additional triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 5) -> 11 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (16, 5) -> 16 and 5 are connected. No additional triangles formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are connected. No additional triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are connected. No additional triangles formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 3) -> 13 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Nodes 9-19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
