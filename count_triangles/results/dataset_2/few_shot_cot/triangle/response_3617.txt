Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 11 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 8, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 19:
    * Skipped because there are no pairs with at least two nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Nodes 9 to 19) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
