Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not a valid pair since 5 is not connected to 6.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> Not a valid pair since 5 is not connected to 11.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> Not a valid pair since 5 is not connected to 10.
    * Pair 4: (5, 12) -> Not a valid pair since 5 is not connected to 12.
    * Pair 5: (6, 11) -> Not a valid pair since 6 is not connected to 11.
    * Pair 6: (6, 10) -> Not a valid pair since 6 is not connected to 10.
    * Pair 7: (6, 12) -> Not a valid pair since 6 is not connected to 12.
    * Pair 8: (10, 11) -> Not a valid pair since 10 is not connected to 11.
    * Pair 9: (10, 12) -> Not a valid pair since 10 is not connected to 12.
    * Pair 10: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Moving on to other nodes -

Please follow the steps above for Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, and provide the counts for each one, which will lead us to the total number of triangles in the graph at the end.
