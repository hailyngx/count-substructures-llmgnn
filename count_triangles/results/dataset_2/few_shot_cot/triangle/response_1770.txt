Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 3

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 1, 2, 5 as they are smaller than 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 4, 6, 9, 8 as they are smaller than 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 7, 8 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 7, 9, 8 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 6 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Node 4 as it is smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 0 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 1, 3, 2, 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 7, 1, 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 4)
Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
