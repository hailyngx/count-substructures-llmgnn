Response:
Following the method described in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0: No triangle can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 1: Triangle <1, 3, 5> is formed.
* Node 2: No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 3: No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 4: No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 5: No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 6: No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 7: No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 8: No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 9: Triangle <9, 15, 17> is formed.
* Node 10: No triangle can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 11: No triangle can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 12: No triangle can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 13: No triangle can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 14: No triangle can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 15: No triangle can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 16: No triangle can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 17: No triangle can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 18: No triangle can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 19: No triangle can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is: [2].
