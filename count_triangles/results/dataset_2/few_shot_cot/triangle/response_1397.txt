Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's identify the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> Already counted when analyzing Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 5.
    * Pair 3: (5, 19) -> Does not form a triangle since Node 19 is not connected to Node 3.
    * Pair 4: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed as there is no direct edge between Node 5 and Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller nodes (0 and 1)
    * Pair 1: (14, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 14.
    * Pair 2: (14, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11 and Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller nodes (1 and 2)
    * Pair 1: (14, 11) -> Already counted when analyzing Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (14, 16) -> Does not form a triangle as Node 16 is not connected to Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipping all pairs involving smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipping all other nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skipping all other nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skipping all pairs involving smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skipping all pairs involving smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:

    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skipping all pairs involving smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skipping all pairs involving smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skipping all pairs involving smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skipping all pairs involving smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skipping all pairs involving smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skipping all pairs involving smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are <5, 11, 1>, <5, 3, 1>, <14, 11, 2>, <14, 3, 2>. Hence, the answer is [6].
