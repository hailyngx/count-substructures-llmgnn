Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

1. **Node 0:**
   - Skipped pairs involving nodes smaller than 0.
   - Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of each other and are connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1:**
   - Skipped pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
   - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of each other and are connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2:**
   - Skipped pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
   - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of each other and are connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. **Node 3:**
   - Skipped pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
   - No new triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4:**
   - Skipped pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
   - No new triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5:**
   - Skipped pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
   - No new triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
   - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**
   - Skipped pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
   - No new triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
   - Skipped pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
   - No new triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8:**
   - Skipped pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
   - No new triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
   - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9:**
    - Skipped pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    - No new triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. **Node 10:**
    - Skipped pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
    - Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of each other and are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

12. **Node 11:**
    - Skipped pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
    - No new triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. **Node 12:**
    - Skipped pairs with nodes smaller than 12.
    - No new triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. **Node 13:**
    - Skipped pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
    - No new triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. **Node 14:**
    - Skipped pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
    - No new triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Adding up all the triangles from each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 10) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is [3].
