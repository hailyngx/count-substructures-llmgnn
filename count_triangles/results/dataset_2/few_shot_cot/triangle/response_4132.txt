Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 0.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0, so the total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node is 0.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 3 or 4 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 4 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1, 4, or 8 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5, so the total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node is 0.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 7, or 13 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6, so the total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node is 0.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 6, or 9 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, or 11 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8, so the total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node is 0.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4, 7, or 12 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, or 13 as they are smaller than 10.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10, so the total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node is 0.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 8, or 14 as they are smaller than 11.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11, so the total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node is 0.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 12.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12, so the total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node is 0.

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, or 10 as they are smaller than 13.
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 8, 11, or 13 as they are smaller than 14.
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
