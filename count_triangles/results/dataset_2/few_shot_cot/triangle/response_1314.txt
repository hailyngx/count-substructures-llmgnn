Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Connected to 4 and 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Connected to 4 and 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 11) -> Connected to 4 and 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (4, 2) -> Connected to 4 and 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (4, 0) -> Connected to 4 and 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 10) -> Connected to 3 and 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 12) -> Connected to 3 and 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Connected to 3 and 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (8, 12) -> Connected to 8 and 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (8, 10) -> Connected to 8 and 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Connected to 0 and 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 12) -> Connected to 0 and 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 4) -> Connected to 0 and 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (4, 12) -> Connected to 4 and 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 14) -> Connected to 1 and 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 10) -> Connected to 1 and 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (10, 14) -> Connected to 10 and 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, and summing up the total triangles for each node as the smallest numbered node, we get:

[Total triangles in the graph] = Answer.
