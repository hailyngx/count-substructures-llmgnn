Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Already counted.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4 and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4 and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) = 8.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
