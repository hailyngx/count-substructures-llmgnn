Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (18, 7) -> 18 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 8) -> 18 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 18 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 16) -> 18 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 18 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (18, 13) -> 18 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 18 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 15, 16, 17:
    * These nodes are skipped from further consideration as they don't have at least 2 nodes with higher numbers to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but 5 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 11 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 11 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (18, 15) -> 18 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 18 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and 11 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but 9 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, and 4 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of 14. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (19, 1) -> 19 and 1 are not connected because 19 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 18. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 4) -> 19 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 18, and 19 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 19:
    * Node 19 cannot form any triangles as it doesn't have at least 2 nodes with higher numbers to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 19) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
