Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Not connected.
        * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Not connected.
        * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> Not connected.
        * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Not connected.
        * Pair 5: (7, 1) -> Not connected.
        * Pair 6: (8, 1) -> Not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Not connected.
        * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Not connected.
        * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not connected.
        * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> Not connected.
        * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> Not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Connected as (7, 8). Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Not connected.
        * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> Not connected.
        * Pair 3: (8, 3) -> Not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Not connected.
        * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> Not connected.
        * Pair 3: (8, 3) -> Not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = [1].

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
