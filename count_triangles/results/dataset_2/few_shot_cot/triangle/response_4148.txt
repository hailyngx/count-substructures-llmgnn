Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors, and 6 and 4 are also connected as (6, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (8, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors, and 8 and 2 are also directly connected as (8, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 12: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, and 6 and 8 are also directly connected as (6,8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors, and 8 and 4 are also connected as (8,4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, and 8 and 7 are also connected as (8,7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, and 4 and 7 are also directly connected as (4,7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors, and 5 and 4 are also connected as (5,4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors, and 9 and 4 are also connected as (9,4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

The remaining nodes (5, 6, 7, 8, 9) do not form triangles with at least two nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [7].
