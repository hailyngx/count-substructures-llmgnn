Response:
Following the same steps as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) - does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) - does not form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 6) - forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (13, 10) - does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (13, 0) - does not form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) - does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) - forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) - does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) - forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) - forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 0) - forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Only one triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: (1, 13, 6).
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) - does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) - does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) - does not form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any triangles with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Only one triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: (10, 12, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Only one triangle can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: (12, 0, 10).
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - forms a triangle with Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) - does not form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any triangles with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any triples with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
