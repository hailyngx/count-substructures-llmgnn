Response:
Following the step-by-step process for each node to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as nodes 5 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as nodes 5 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed as nodes 5 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed as nodes 9 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed as nodes 9 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (7, 13) -> No triangle formed as nodes 7 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> No triangle formed as nodes 11 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> No triangle formed as nodes 11 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (13, 12) -> No triangle formed as nodes 13 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> No triangle formed as nodes 5 and 11 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed! <3, 5, 7>
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> No triangle formed as nodes 5 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (11, 7) -> No triangle formed as nodes 11 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (11, 14) -> No triangle formed as nodes 11 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed as nodes 7 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 14 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (14, 8) -> No triangle formed as nodes 14 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 5, and 8 as they are smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [1].
