Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the graph given.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 21) -> 3 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 27) -> 3 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing on to Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Already considered when looking at Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles found so far:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
