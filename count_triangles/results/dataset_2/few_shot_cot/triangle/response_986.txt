Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> No connection between 1 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> No connection between 1 and 11. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 7 are connected as shown in the edges list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edges list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> No connection between 4 and 12. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> No connection between 4 and 14. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> No connection between 10 and 14. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Other nodes do not have at least two nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
