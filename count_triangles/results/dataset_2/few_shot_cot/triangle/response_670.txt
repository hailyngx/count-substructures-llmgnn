Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined above, let's count the triangles in the given graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with node 1 and 4.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 1 and 8.
    * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> Forms a triangle with node 1 and 13.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 4 and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 4 and 8.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> Forms a triangle with node 4 and 13.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> Forms a triangle with node 8 and 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Forms a triangle with node 10 and 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with node 6 and 9.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> Forms a triangle with node 6 and 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 1 and 8.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> Forms a triangle with node 1 and 13.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> Forms a triangle with node 8 and 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Forms a triangle with node 3 and 9.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> Forms a triangle with node 3 and 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> Forms a triangle with node 5 and 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
     * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Forms a triangle with node 10 and 14.
     * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> Forms a triangle with node 11 and 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with node 6 and 9.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> Forms a triangle with node 6 and 11.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> Forms a triangle with node 9 and 12.
    * Pair 4: (10, 14) -> Forms a triangle with node 10 and 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 4

    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with node 1 and 4.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 1 and 8.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 4 and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 14. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 4 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 3 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 26.

Therefore, there are [26] triangles in the given graph.
