Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Nodes 8 and 9 as the smallest numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
