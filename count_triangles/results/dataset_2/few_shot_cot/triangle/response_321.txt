Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 23) -> 4 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 25) -> 6 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 27) -> 6 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 27) -> 4 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (19, 25) -> 19 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 3, 4, and 5 have already been calculated in the example above.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 25 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 25 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 to 29 would be handled similarly where each node will also have 0 triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 5 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + ... + 0 (Node 29) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
