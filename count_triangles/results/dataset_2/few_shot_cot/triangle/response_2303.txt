Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (14, 1) -> 14 and 1 are not connected.
    - Pair 2: (14, 9) -> 14 and 9 are not connected.
    - Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are connected as (1, 9) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (14, 5) -> 14 and 5 are connected as (14, 5) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (14, 6) -> 14 and 6 are not connected.
    - Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (11, 9) -> 11 and 9 are connected as (11, 9) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are connected as (5, 18) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are connected as (9, 1) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are connected as (9, 6) in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected as (1, 6) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are connected as (8, 16) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    - Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles.

- Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are connected as (13, 17) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are connected as (13, 16) in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are connected as (16, 17) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are connected as (15, 19) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (15, 0) -> 15 and 0 are connected as (15, 0) in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (19, 0) -> 19 and 0 are connected as (19, 0) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Nodes 12 to 19:
    - Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
