Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 14>.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 5, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> Already counted under Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 14>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> Already counted under Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

* Total triangles in the graph: [4]

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
