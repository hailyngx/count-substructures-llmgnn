Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 17) (26, 10) (26, 2) (26, 17) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 5) (21, 7) (21, 15) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 11) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 25) (6, 23) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 29) (10, 26) (10, 8) (10, 20) (15, 21) (15, 5) (15, 4) (23, 5) (23, 6) (23, 11) (23, 25) (2, 26) (2, 22) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 1) (18, 9) (18, 19) (18, 0) (18, 12) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 20) (25, 6) (25, 23) (25, 27) (25, 29) (27, 25) (27, 16) (12, 18) (12, 17) (12, 28) (1, 22) (1, 29) (29, 11) (29, 25) (29, 1) (14, 22) (14, 8) (14, 20) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 13) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 28) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 4) (13, 28) (16, 27) (17, 9) (17, 26) (17, 19) (17, 12) (28, 12) (28, 4) (28, 13) (20, 10) (20, 19) (20, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order:

Node 1: 2 edges
Node 16: 2 edges
Node 7: 3 edges
Node 3: 3 edges
Node 27: 2 edges
Node 2: 3 edges
Node 22: 3 edges
Node 24: 4 edges
Node 9: 2 edges
Node 8: 3 edges
Node 17: 4 edges
Node 28: 4 edges
Node 18: 4 edges
Node 19: 3 edges
Node 26: 4 edges
Node 29: 4 edges
Node 0: 3 edges
Node 20: 3 edges
Node 21: 3 edges
Node 23: 4 edges
Node 25: 4 edges
Node 4: 4 edges
Node 5: 5 edges
Node 6: 4 edges
Node 11: 5 edges
Node 12: 3 edges
Node 13: 4 edges
Node 14: 3 edges
Node 15: 3 edges

2. Relabel the vertices from 0 to 29 based on their new order.

3. Count the number of triangles by following the method described earlier.

The total number of triangles is [18].

Unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 22>
<0, 13, 28>
<0, 18, 19>
<0, 8, 14>
<1, 22, 29>
<3, 4, 13>
<3, 11, 29>
<4, 15, 23>
<5, 6, 25>
<5, 11, 23>
<5, 15, 21>
<5, 15, 4>
<5, 23, 25>
<6, 11, 23>
<6, 25, 27>
<10, 20, 26>
<11, 23, 25>
<11, 15, 21>
