Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees and relabeling them accordingly:

Node 0 has degree 2
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 5
Node 6 has degree 5
Node 1 has degree 5
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 5
Node 5 has degree 4

Based on the sorted order, the new labels for the nodes will be:
Node 0 → Node 0 (degree 2)
Node 7 → Node 1 (degree 3)
Node 2 → Node 2 (degree 4)
Node 3 → Node 3 (degree 4)
Node 5 → Node 4 (degree 4)
Node 1 → Node 5 (degree 5)
Node 6 → Node 6 (degree 5)
Node 4 → Node 7 (degree 5)
Node 9 → Node 8 (degree 5)
Node 8 → Node 9 (degree 5)

Now, we will count the triangles based on the edges provided. 

Triangles found:
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
