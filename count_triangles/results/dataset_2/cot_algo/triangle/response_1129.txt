Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 18) (17, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 7) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (5, 2) (5, 15) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 9) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 3) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 15) (1, 0) (6, 14) (6, 15) (6, 11) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 3) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 3) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 19) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 15) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 4) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 1 (degree 2)  
Node 10 (degree 3)  
Node 17 (degree 2)  
Node 7 (degree 5)  
Node 2 (degree 3)  
Node 8 (degree 3)  
Node 0 (degree 4)  
Node 14 (degree 2)  
Node 5 (degree 2)  
Node 13 (degree 3)  
Node 9 (degree 3)  
Node 16 (degree 4)  
Node 6 (degree 3)  
Node 18 (degree 4)  
Node 19 (degree 3)  
Node 3 (degree 4)  
Node 4 (degree 3)  
Node 15 (degree 5)  
Node 11 (degree 3)  
Node 12 (degree 3)  

After relabeling the vertices from 0 to 19 based on their degrees, the edges are as follows:  
(1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 15) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 18) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 13) (5, 2) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 18) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 16) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 18) (11, 13) (11, 15) (11, 6) (12, 10) (12, 17) (13, 4) (15, 2) (15, 9) (15, 8) (15, 6) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 15) (17, 12) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 19) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 18)  

Counting the number of triangles using the given edges and relabeled vertices, we find that there are 12 triangles in total.
The unique triangles are:  
<2, 4, 13>  
<2, 6, 11>  
<2, 6, 15>  
<3, 7, 10>  
<3, 9, 13>  
<3, 9, 16>  
<3, 15, 18>  
<4, 9, 13>  
<7, 10, 18>  
<9, 15, 16>  
<12, 10, 18>  
<15, 18, 19>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [12].
