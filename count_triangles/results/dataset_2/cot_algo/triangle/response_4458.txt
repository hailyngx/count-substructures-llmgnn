Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 11) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 0) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 5) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 11) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and connections:

Node 0 is connected to nodes: 3, 14, 10
Node 1 is connected to nodes: 11, 14, 10
Node 2 is connected to nodes: 9, 3, 8, 7, 5, 11
Node 3 is connected to nodes: 0, 14, 2, 4
Node 4 is connected to nodes: 9, 3, 7, 12
Node 5 is connected to nodes: 12, 14, 2, 11
Node 6 is connected to nodes: 9, 14, 10, 13
Node 7 is connected to nodes: 4, 12, 2
Node 8 is connected to nodes: 9, 13, 2, 11
Node 9 is connected to nodes: 6, 8, 4, 2, 13
Node 10 is connected to nodes: 6, 1, 12, 0
Node 11 is connected to nodes: 1, 8, 2, 5
Node 12 is connected to nodes: 4, 7, 5, 10
Node 13 is connected to nodes: 6, 9, 8
Node 14 is connected to nodes: 6, 1, 3, 0, 5

Next, we sort the vertices by the number of connections in ascending order:
Nodes in degree-based order: 0, 1, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 4, 8, 13, 6, 14, 3, 9, 2

Now, we count the triangles based on the sorted vertices. 

Number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 3, 14>
<0, 10, 14>
<0, 3, 2>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 5, 11>
<6, 9, 13>
