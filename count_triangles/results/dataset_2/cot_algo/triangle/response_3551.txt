Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 10) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 11) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting nodes by their degree (number of connections). The sorted nodes with their degrees are as follows:
- Node 9 (degree 2)
- Node 10 (degree 2)
- Node 0 (degree 3)
- Node 14 (degree 2)
- Node 7 (degree 3)
- Node 4 (degree 2)
- Node 5 (degree 3)
- Node 11 (degree 3)
- Node 6 (degree 6)
- Node 12 (degree 5)
- Node 2 (degree 4)
- Node 8 (degree 6)
- Node 13 (degree 6)
- Node 3 (degree 4)
- Node 1 (degree 4)

Now, we will count the triangles based on the provided edges in the provided order. Each triangle will be counted only once.

Triangles:
- <1, 7, 11>
- <0, 1, 3>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <2, 5, 11>
- <3, 7, 12>
- <6, 8, 13>
- <6, 9, 4>
- <6, 9, 11>
- <6, 9, 12>
- <6, 10, 13>
- <8, 2, 6>
- <8, 2, 13>
- <13, 2, 6>
- <13, 2, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [14].
