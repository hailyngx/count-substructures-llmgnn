Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 23) (13, 7) (13, 18) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 27) (22, 12) (3, 17) (3, 23) (3, 8) (15, 26) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 24) (9, 26) (9, 17) (9, 16) (26, 15) (26, 9) (26, 14) (4, 24) (4, 2) (7, 13) (0, 20) (0, 10) (0, 19) (20, 0) (20, 1) (20, 21) (20, 23) (20, 11) (1, 20) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 14) (10, 0) (21, 13) (21, 20) (21, 18) (14, 22) (14, 26) (14, 1) (14, 18) (2, 22) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 11) (12, 22) (12, 18) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 19) (11, 20) (11, 2) (6, 25) (6, 8) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 9) (5, 23) (5, 27) (23, 13) (23, 3) (23, 20) (23, 5) (27, 22) (27, 5) (27, 29) (27, 24) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 25) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 29) (18, 13) (18, 21) (18, 14) (18, 12) (24, 15) (24, 4) (24, 27) (25, 6) (25, 29) (25, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 25) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree, relabeling them accordingly, and then counting triangles based on the edges given. 

Here are the vertices sorted by their degree:

Vertex 5 (Degree 2)
Vertex 7 (Degree 2)
Vertex 10 (Degree 2)
Vertex 19 (Degree 3)
Vertex 11 (Degree 3)
Vertex 12 (Degree 3)
Vertex 16 (Degree 3)
Vertex 18 (Degree 4)
Vertex 0 (Degree 5)
Vertex 1 (Degree 5)
Vertex 4 (Degree 5)
Vertex 6 (Degree 5)
Vertex 20 (Degree 5)
Vertex 21 (Degree 5)
Vertex 22 (Degree 5)
Vertex 27 (Degree 5)
Vertex 29 (Degree 5)
Vertex 2 (Degree 6)
Vertex 3 (Degree 6)
Vertex 9 (Degree 6)
Vertex 14 (Degree 6)
Vertex 24 (Degree 6)
Vertex 25 (Degree 6)
Vertex 26 (Degree 6)
Vertex 8 (Degree 7)
Vertex 13 (Degree 7)

Now, let's count the number of triangles based on the sorted vertices:

[Total number of triangles: 24]

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 16>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 24>
<0, 10, 20>
<0, 19, 20>
<0, 19, 29>
<1, 2, 11>
<1, 14, 22>
<1, 16, 19>
<2, 11, 20>
<3, 9, 17>
<3, 15, 17>
<3, 15, 26>
<4, 24, 27>
<5, 23, 27>
<6, 8, 25>
<6, 25, 29>
<8, 15, 17>
<8, 15, 24>
<8, 25, 29>
<9, 17, 26>
<14, 18, 22>
<14, 18, 26>
