Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 18) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 0) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 0) (0, 16) (0, 13) (0, 8) (0, 12) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 18) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 19) (6, 14) (6, 15) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 15) (19, 7) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 1) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 12) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 2) (12, 0) (12, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the nodes by the number of connections each node has. The sorted list of nodes is as follows: 
Nodes: 4, 19, 5, 6, 12, 1, 2, 13, 18, 11, 16, 3, 17, 0, 15, 8, 7, 14, 9, 10

Using the sorted list, we will now count the triangles in the graph:

[Total Number of Triangles: 12]
<0, 8, 15>
<0, 12, 18>
<0, 13, 2>
<0, 13, 10>
<2, 11, 16>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 7, 14>
<3, 10, 13>
<7, 14, 17>
<10, 13, 2>
<10, 13, 3>
<10, 13, 1>
