Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 0) (15, 3) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 12) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 7) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 13) (7, 6) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 1) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 12) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 19) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (14, 19) (4, 15) (4, 10) (4, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Vertices with degree 1: 1, 14
Vertices with degree 2: 3, 2, 17
Vertices with degree 3: 18, 13, 19
Vertices with degree 4: 11, 12
Vertices with degree 5: 16, 6, 15, 7
Vertices with degree 6: 9, 0, 10, 5, 4, 8

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method on the edges, we find the triangles and count them:

- Triangle 1: <2, 5, 18> (Shared connections: 2-5, 2-18, 5-18)
- Triangle 2: <4, 5, 18> (Shared connections: 4-5, 4-18, 5-18)
- Triangle 3: <0, 6, 7> (Shared connections: 0-6, 0-7, 6-7)
- Triangle 4: <0, 6, 9> (Shared connections: 0-6, 0-9, 6-9)
- Triangle 5: <0, 6, 7> (Shared connections: 0-6, 0-7, 6-7)
- Triangle 6: <10, 4, 5> (Shared connections: 10-4, 10-5, 4-5)
- Triangle 7: <10, 4, 5> (Shared connections: 10-4, 10-5, 4-5)
- Triangle 8: <10, 5, 18> (Shared connections: 10-5, 10-18, 5-18)
- Triangle 9: <10, 5, 18> (Shared connections: 10-5, 10-18, 5-18)
- Triangle 10: <10, 5, 18> (Shared connections: 10-5, 10-18, 5-18)
- Triangle 11: <10, 4, 5> (Shared connections: 10-4, 10-5, 4-5)
- Triangle 12: <10, 4, 5> (Shared connections: 10-4, 10-5, 4-5)
- Triangle 13: <10, 4, 18> (Shared connections: 10-4, 10-18, 4-18)
- Triangle 14: <10, 4, 5> (Shared connections: 10-4, 10-5, 4-5)
- Triangle 15: <10, 4, 5> (Shared connections: 10-4, 10-5, 4-5)
- Triangle 16: <10, 4, 18> (Shared connections: 10-4, 10-18, 4-18)
- Triangle 17: <10, 4, 5> (Shared connections: 10-4, 10-5, 4-5)
- Triangle 18: <10, 4, 5> (Shared connections: 10-4, 10-5, 4-5)
- Triangle 19: <10, 4, 18> (Shared connections: 10-4, 10-18, 4-18)
