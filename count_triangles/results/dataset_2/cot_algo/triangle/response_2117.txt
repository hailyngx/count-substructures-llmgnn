Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 12) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 10) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 19) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 1) (4, 9) (4, 17) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 1) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 18) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 16) (8, 2) (8, 17) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 0) (1, 10) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 19) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 13) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 18) (10, 16) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 7) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 13) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 10), (1, 10), (1, 15), (1, 18), (2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 19), (3, 7), (3, 13), (3, 15), (4, 9), (4, 17), (5, 12), (5, 17), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 3), (8, 16), (8, 17), (9, 11), (9, 16), (9, 19), (10, 14), (10, 16), (12, 18), (12, 5), (13, 17), (13, 19), (14, 10), (14, 18), (16, 8), (16, 9), (16, 10), (17, 4), (17, 5), (17, 8), (17, 13), (18, 12), (18, 14), (18, 1), (19, 2), (19, 9), (19, 13)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes by degree: 6, 16, 0, 2, 4, 7, 11, 12, 14, 1, 3, 13, 15, 17, 19, 5, 8, 9, 10, 18

Now, we will count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering method:

Triangles: [21]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 10>, <0, 1, 18>, <0, 5, 17>, <1, 15, 3>, <1, 15, 18>, <2, 8, 17>, <3, 13, 17>, <3, 15, 1>, <4, 9, 16>, <5, 12, 18>, <7, 10, 16>, <9, 11, 16>, <9, 11, 7>, <9, 16, 8>, <9, 16, 10>, <9, 16, 14>, <9, 19, 13>, <10, 14, 18>, <13, 17, 4>, <13, 17, 8>, <13, 19, 2>
