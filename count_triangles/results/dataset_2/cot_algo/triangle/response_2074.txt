Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees, then relabeling them from least to most connected. Here's how the vertices are relabeled based on their degrees:

Vertices: 
6 (degree 5) - relabeled as 0
9 (degree 5) - relabeled as 1
8 (degree 5) - relabeled as 2
5 (degree 6) - relabeled as 3
7 (degree 5) - relabeled as 4
4 (degree 4) - relabeled as 5
3 (degree 5) - relabeled as 6
1 (degree 4) - relabeled as 7
0 (degree 1) - relabeled as 8
2 (degree 2) - relabeled as 9

Now, considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles formed by shared connections. 

Calculating triangles: 
Triangles: [6]

Unique Triangles: <0, 1, 2>
