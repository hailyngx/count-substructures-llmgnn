Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: 6, 9, 3, 8, 5, 2
- 1: 6, 8, 7
- 2: 9, 3, 4, 7, 0
- 3: 9, 0, 4, 2
- 4: 3, 8, 2, 5
- 5: 6, 4, 0
- 6: 5, 1, 0
- 7: 1, 2, 8
- 8: 9, 1, 4, 7, 0
- 9: 8, 2, 3, 0

Now, let's perform the Degree-Based Ordering:
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 0: degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering, we consider the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
1. (6, 5): Forms a triangle with node 0 <0, 5, 6>
2. (6, 1): Does not form a triangle
3. (6, 0): Does not form a triangle
4. (9, 8): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 4 <0, 4, 8>
5. (9, 2): Does not form a triangle
6. (9, 3): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 4 <0, 3, 9>
7. (9, 0): Does not form a triangle
8. (1, 6): Does not form a triangle
9. (1, 8): Does not form a triangle
10. (1, 7): Does not form a triangle
11. (3, 9): Does not form a triangle
12. (3, 0): Does not form a triangle
13. (3, 4): Does not form a triangle
14. (3, 2): Does not form a triangle
15. (4, 3): Does not form a triangle
16. (4, 8): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 9 <0, 4, 8>
17. (4, 2): Forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 0 <0, 2, 4>
18. (4, 5): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 6 <0, 5, 4>
19. (7, 1): Does not form a triangle
20. (7, 2): Does not form a triangle
21. (7, 8): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 4 <0, 4, 8>
22. (8, 9): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 4 <0, 8, 9>
23. (8, 1): Does not form a triangle
24. (8, 4): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 9 <0, 4, 8>
25. (8, 7): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 4 <0, 7, 8>
26. (8, 0): Forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 9 <0, 8, 9>
27. (5, 6): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 4 <0, 5, 6>
28. (5, 4): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 6 <0, 4, 5>
29. (5, 0): Does not form a triangle
30. (0, 6): Forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 4 <4, 5, 6>
31. (0, 9): Forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 8 <0, 8, 9>
32. (0, 3): Forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 8 <0, 3, 4>
33. (0, 8): Forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 9 <0, 8, 9>
34. (0, 5): Forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 6 <0, 5, 6>
35. (0, 2): Forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 8 <0, 2, 4>
36. (2, 9): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 4 <0, 4, 9>
37. (2, 3): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 4 <0, 3, 4>
38. (2, 4): Forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 0 <0, 2, 4>
39. (2, 7): Does not form a triangle
