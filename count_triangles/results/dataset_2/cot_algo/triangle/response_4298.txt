Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (10, 3) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 16) (18, 15) (18, 1) (18, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 18) (8, 4) (8, 5) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 16) (11, 9) (11, 14) (0, 19) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 17) (1, 18) (1, 5) (1, 19) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 12) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 12) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 5) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 3) (16, 19) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 19) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 12) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 16) (1, 5) (1, 18) (1, 19) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 16) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (5, 12) (5, 15) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 9) (7, 17) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 18) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (10, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 15) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 12) (14, 19) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 9) (15, 12) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 14) (16, 19) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 2) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 16) (18, 15) (18, 1) (18, 8) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 14)

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method by sorting the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most:

Nodes by degree: 0, 10, 12, 19, 6, 11, 17, 7, 16, 8, 18, 13, 15, 9, 14, 3, 5, 1, 4, 2

Now, we will count the number of triangles and list the unique triangles found:

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles: <1, 5, 3>, <4, 8, 5>, <5, 15, 12>, <9, 11, 14>, <9, 14, 15>, <13, 12, 5>, <16, 19, 14>, <16, 17, 13>
