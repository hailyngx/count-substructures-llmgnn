Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 7) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 7) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 1) (3, 10) (3, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are as follows:
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 10: 6 connections
Node 12: 6 connections
Node 0: 7 connections
Node 11: 7 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

The total number of triangles is [18].
Unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 10>, <0, 4, 11>, <0, 5, 14>, <0, 6, 10>, <0, 6, 12>, <1, 2, 11>, <1, 2, 13>, <1, 7, 13>, <1, 7, 14>, <2, 7, 13>, <2, 9, 13>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 8, 12>, <4, 10, 11>, <8, 10, 11>, <9, 12, 13>.
