Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 6) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 15) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 7) (17, 13) (17, 15) (4, 8) (4, 1) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 3) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 14) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 9) (15, 13) (15, 17) (9, 0) (9, 19) (9, 1) (9, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (18, 10) (18, 9) (18, 6) (6, 16) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 18) (14, 5) (14, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(11, 16), (11, 3), (11, 2), (16, 3), (16, 6), 
(8, 13), (8, 4), (8, 12), (13, 17), (13, 15), (13, 10), 
(10, 18), (10, 7), (17, 15), 
(4, 1), (2, 19), (2, 3), (0, 9), (0, 6), 
(7, 5), (19, 12), (5, 14)

Now, applying the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Degree of each node:
0: 3, 1: 4, 2: 3, 3: 4, 4: 3, 5: 2, 6: 4, 7: 3, 8: 3, 9: 4, 
10: 3, 11: 3, 12: 2, 13: 4, 14: 2, 15: 3, 16: 3, 17: 2, 18: 3, 19: 4

Nodes sorted by degree:
5, 12, 17, 14, 18, 0, 2, 4, 11, 1, 8, 7, 15, 3, 10, 16, 6, 9, 13, 19

Based on this ordering, the edge pairs to consider are:
(0, 9), (2, 19), (4, 1), (7, 5), (11, 16), (1, 14), (8, 13), (3, 10), (16, 6)

Now, counting the total number of triangles inside brackets [] and listing the unique triangles found inside <>:

[14]
<13, 15, 17>, <13, 15, 17>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 3, 11>, <2, 3, 11>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <8, 13, 15>, <8, 13, 15>, <8, 13, 17>, <8, 13, 17>, <0, 6, 19>, <0, 6, 19>
