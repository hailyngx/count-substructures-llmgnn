The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: (3, 24), (3, 13), (15, 4), (15, 28), (6, 18), (6, 11), (9, 24), (9, 14), (9, 0), (7, 19), (7, 23), (7, 14), (7, 13), (21, 25), (21, 22), (28, 15), (28, 29), (28, 16), (28, 24), (29, 1), (17, 13), (17, 5), (17, 2), (17, 11), (22, 21), (22, 26), (22, 19), (22, 20), (26, 14), (26, 27), (1, 20), (1, 16), (1, 23), (13, 17), (13, 19), (8, 19), (8, 24), (8, 11), (19, 29), (19, 8), (14, 25), (25, 27), (27, 26), (4, 12), (12, 23), (0, 16), (2, 5), (5, 10)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on the number of connections they have:

Node 10 (Degree 1)  
Node 20 (Degree 2)  
Node 18 (Degree 2)  
Node 12 (Degree 2)  
Node 0 (Degree 2)  
Node 2 (Degree 2)  
Node 6 (Degree 2)  
Node 9 (Degree 3)  
Node 15 (Degree 2)  
Node 3 (Degree 2)  
Node 4 (Degree 2)  
Node 5 (Degree 4)  
Node 6 (Degree 3)  
Node 1 (Degree 4)  
Node 7 (Degree 5)  
Node 11 (Degree 4)  
Node 13 (Degree 4)  
Node 14 (Degree 4)  
Node 16 (Degree 3)  
Node 17 (Degree 4)  
Node 19 (Degree 6)  
Node 21 (Degree 2)  
Node 22 (Degree 5)  
Node 24 (Degree 5)  
Node 25 (Degree 3)  
Node 26 (Degree 3)  
Node 27 (Degree 2)  
Node 28 (Degree 6)  
Node 29 (Degree 4)  

Based on Degree-Based Ordering, the triangles are counted as follows:

- Triangles involving Node 10: None
- Triangles involving Node 20: None
- Triangles involving Node 18: None
- Triangles involving Node 12: None
