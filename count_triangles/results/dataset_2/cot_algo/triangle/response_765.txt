Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 20) (7, 18) (21, 7) (21, 5) (21, 2) (21, 17) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 15) (13, 25) (13, 2) (13, 28) (10, 8) (10, 28) (5, 21) (5, 6) (5, 26) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 19) (12, 7) (12, 28) (12, 18) (12, 15) (28, 13) (28, 10) (28, 12) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 25) (29, 14) (29, 3) (9, 8) (9, 22) (9, 27) (22, 9) (22, 1) (17, 21) (17, 6) (17, 20) (20, 7) (20, 17) (20, 3) (23, 14) (19, 6) (19, 29) (19, 15) (0, 18) (16, 7) (16, 4) (16, 26) (26, 5) (26, 16) (26, 14) (26, 25) (4, 16) (4, 14) (14, 29) (14, 23) (14, 26) (14, 4) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 19) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 0) (1, 5) (1, 22) (1, 2) (2, 21) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 1) (25, 13) (25, 29) (25, 26) (25, 24) (24, 25) (27, 9) (3, 5) (3, 29) (3, 20) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, ..., 29}

Edges: (7, 21), (7, 12), (7, 16), (7, 20), (7, 18), (21, 5), (21, 2), (21, 17), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 15), (13, 25), (13, 2), (13, 28), (10, 28), (5, 6), (5, 26), (5, 1), (5, 3), (6, 17), (6, 19), (12, 28), (12, 18), (12, 15), (28, 29), (29, 19), (29, 25), (29, 14), (9, 22), (9, 27), (22, 1), (17, 20), (23, 14), (0, 18), (16, 4), (16, 26), (4, 14), (15, 19), (1, 22), (25, 24), (24, 25), (3, 29)

Number of nodes: 30
Number of edges: 45 (since each edge is undirected, it counts as 1)

Next, we'll sort the vertices by their number of connections (degree):

0: 1 connections
8: 3 connections
9: 3 connections
10: 2 connections
12: 4 connections
13: 3 connections
14: 4 connections
15: 3 connections
16: 3 connections
17: 3 connections
18: 3 connections
19: 3 connections
20: 3 connections
21: 4 connections
22: 2 connections
23: 1 connections
24: 1 connections
25: 3 connections
26: 3 connections
27: 1 connections
28: 4 connections
29: 4 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 3 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles. 

Total triangles: [13]

Unique triangles: 
<7, 12, 28>
<5, 6, 17>
<5, 6, 26>
<5, 14, 29>
<6, 17, 21>
<6, 17, 20>
<6, 19, 29>
<10, 12, 28>
<13, 25, 29>
<16, 26, 14>
<16, 26, 25>
<17, 20, 3>
<25, 26, 14>
