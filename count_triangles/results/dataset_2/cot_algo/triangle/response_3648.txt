This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 6) (17, 21) (2, 29) (2, 20) (29, 2) (29, 8) (29, 24) (29, 3) (8, 29) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 27) (13, 6) (24, 29) (24, 3) (26, 12) (26, 4) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 0) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 4) (15, 11) (16, 22) (16, 25) (16, 27) (21, 17) (21, 9) (21, 22) (4, 14) (4, 26) (4, 15) (4, 22) (22, 16) (22, 21) (22, 4) (22, 5) (11, 15) (0, 1) (0, 28) (3, 29) (3, 24) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 23) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 27) (28, 10) (28, 20) (7, 20) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 18) (20, 2) (20, 28) (20, 7) (20, 19) (19, 7) (19, 20) (19, 25) (25, 16) (25, 19) (25, 5) (9, 1) (9, 21) (18, 7) (18, 27) (27, 13) (27, 16) (27, 28) (27, 18) (5, 22) (5, 25) (5, 10) (23, 6) (12, 8) (12, 26) (12, 28) (10, 28) (10, 7) (10, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. Let's assign new labels to the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 0 - Degree: 2
Vertex 2 - Degree: 2
Vertex 7 - Degree: 2
Vertex 9 - Degree: 2
Vertex 16 - Degree: 3
Vertex 17 - Degree: 2
Vertex 18 - Degree: 2
Vertex 19 - Degree: 3
Vertex 23 - Degree: 1
Vertex 26 - Degree: 2
Vertex 28 - Degree: 5
Vertex 3 - Degree: 2
Vertex 5 - Degree: 3
Vertex 6 - Degree: 3
Vertex 10 - Degree: 3
Vertex 15 - Degree: 4
Vertex 21 - Degree: 3
Vertex 24 - Degree: 2
Vertex 25 - Degree: 3
Vertex 29 - Degree: 5
Vertex 4 - Degree: 4
Vertex 8 - Degree: 4
Vertex 11 - Degree: 2
Vertex 12 - Degree: 3
Vertex 13 - Degree: 5
Vertex 1 - Degree: 4
Vertex 20 - Degree: 4
Vertex 22 - Degree: 4
Vertex 27 - Degree: 4
Vertex 14 - Degree: 2

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [236]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 8, 13>
<3, 24, 29>
<0, 1, 28>
<6, 13, 27>
<3, 24, 3>
<2, 20, 28>
