Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 13) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 13) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 3) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 11)
