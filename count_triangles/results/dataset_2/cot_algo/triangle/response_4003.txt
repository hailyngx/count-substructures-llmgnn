Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 13) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 1) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 1) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the triangles efficiently. Let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Nodes with their degrees:
(1, 4) - degree 4
(5, 3) - degree 3
(0, 3) - degree 3
(14, 4) - degree 4
(13, 3) - degree 3
(7, 3) - degree 3
(4, 4) - degree 4
(12, 4) - degree 4
(1, 4) - degree 4
(2, 5) - degree 5
(11, 4) - degree 4
(3, 5) - degree 5
(8, 5) - degree 5
(10, 5) - degree 5
(6, 4) - degree 4

Now, let's relabel the nodes accordingly:
(1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 0, 9, 10, 11, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14)

Next, we will go through each edge, only considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Counting the number of triangles:
We find 5 triangles in the graph.

The triangles are:
<3, 10, 11>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 10>
<3, 4, 12>
<1, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
