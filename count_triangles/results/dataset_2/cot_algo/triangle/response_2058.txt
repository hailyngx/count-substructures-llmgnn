Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 3) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 6) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 12) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by degree are:  

Vertices: 2, 6, 5, 13, 8, 9, 11, 10, 0, 7, 12, 3, 1, 14, 4

Now, we iterate through each edge to count the number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [16]

Unique triangles found:  
<0, 1, 3>  
<0, 1, 7>  
<0, 3, 5>  
<0, 3, 10>  
<1, 2, 11>  
<1, 4, 7>  
<1, 4, 14>  
<1, 7, 12>  
<2, 6, 4>  
<2, 6, 12>  
<2, 8, 14>  
<3, 5, 9>  
<3, 9, 13>  
<4, 6, 2>  
<7, 1, 11>  
<8, 12, 10>
