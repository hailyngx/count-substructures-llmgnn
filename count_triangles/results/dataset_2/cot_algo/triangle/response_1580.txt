Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 19) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 9) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 13) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 17) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 6) (4, 12) (1, 16) (1, 2) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 2) (17, 9) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 2) (3, 19) (3, 18) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 17) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 17) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 19) (18, 15) (18, 3) (19, 16) (19, 17) (19, 3) (19, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first construct the graph with the provided nodes and edges and then apply the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. The vertices will then be relabeled accordingly.

The graph is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, ..., 19
Edges: 
- 0: 11, 14, 8
- 1: 16, 2
- 2: 1, 6, 17
- 3: 19, 18
- 4: 12
- 5: 11, 8, 17
- 6: 15, 17, 2
- 7: 11, 12, 13
- 8: 0, 9, 5
- 9: 12, 8, 15, 17
- 10: 15
- 11: 16, 7, 0, 13, 5
- 12: 7, 4, 9
- 13: 11, 7, 14, 19
- 14: 0, 13
- 15: 9, 10, 18, 6
- 16: 11, 1, 19
- 17: 6, 9, 5, 2, 19
- 18: 15, 3
- 19: 16, 17, 3, 13

Now, let's proceed to count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

After relabeling the vertices based on their degree, we identify the triangles and count them.

Total number of triangles: [9]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 2, 17>
<6, 15, 17>
<6, 17, 19>
<8, 9, 17>
<15, 17, 19>
<15, 6, 17>
<15, 6, 2>
<15, 17, 2>
<17, 2, 19>
