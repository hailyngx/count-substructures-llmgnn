Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (9, 21) (9, 14) (9, 20) (9, 1) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 24) (17, 14) (17, 10) (15, 27) (15, 8) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 19) (27, 8) (20, 9) (20, 21) (20, 6) (25, 26) (25, 2) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (6, 20) (6, 1) (6, 3) (21, 9) (21, 20) (21, 28) (21, 29) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 2) (28, 23) (22, 26) (22, 0) (26, 25) (26, 22) (3, 6) (3, 13) (18, 14) (18, 24) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 12) (19, 27) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 16) (2, 15) (2, 25) (2, 28) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 13) (16, 19) (16, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 24) (7, 8) (0, 11) (0, 28) (0, 22) (8, 15) (8, 27) (8, 7) (8, 24) (24, 14) (24, 18) (24, 7) (24, 8) (4, 19) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 23) (29, 21) (29, 23) (23, 14) (23, 28) (23, 13) (23, 29) 

Response:
The vertices in the graph can be sorted based on their degrees as follows: 

Node 5: 2 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 22: 4 connections
Node 25: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 27: 5 connections
Node 18: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 16: 5 connections
Node 29: 5 connections
Node 20: 6 connections
Node 17: 6 connections
Node 21: 6 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 12: 6 connections
Node 14: 7 connections
Node 24: 7 connections
Node 11: 7 connections
Node 2: 7 connections
Node 0: 7 connections
Node 23: 7 connections
Node 28: 7 connections

By iterating through the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles and identify the unique triangles present in the graph. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [22] with the unique triangles being:
<5, 11, 0>
<5, 11, 7>
<5, 11, 1>
<9, 21, 20>
<9, 21, 29>
<9, 21, 28>
<9, 14, 17>
<9, 14, 18>
<9, 14, 24>
<9, 14, 23>
<21, 20, 6>
<21, 20, 1>
<21, 20, 9>
<9, 1, 6>
<9, 1, 19>
<9, 1, 12>
<27, 15, 2>
<27, 15, 8>
<27, 15, 19>
<14, 24, 7>
