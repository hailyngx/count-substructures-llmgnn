Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. 
The sorted vertices are as follows:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 3: 7 connections

Now, let's count the number of triangles based on the given edges:
