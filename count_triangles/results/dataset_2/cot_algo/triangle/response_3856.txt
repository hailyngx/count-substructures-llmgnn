Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 27) (14, 7) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 11) (8, 23) (8, 19) (23, 8) (23, 25) (23, 20) (23, 27) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 25) (15, 11) (15, 28) (20, 23) (20, 15) (20, 21) (4, 18) (4, 26) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 6) (11, 17) (11, 15) (11, 21) (28, 15) (28, 1) (28, 22) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 24) (7, 14) (25, 23) (25, 15) (25, 19) (10, 14) (10, 5) (21, 20) (21, 11) (21, 9) (19, 8) (19, 25) (19, 9) (5, 10) (26, 4) (26, 3) (0, 17) (0, 16) (0, 22) (0, 1) (0, 9) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 24) (24, 17) (24, 16) (24, 2) (24, 29) (6, 18) (6, 12) (27, 14) (27, 17) (27, 23) (27, 18) (27, 29) (29, 24) (29, 27) (1, 28) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (9, 15) (9, 21) (9, 19) (9, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (3, 26) (3, 2) (22, 28) (22, 0) 

Response:
The graph has been described with 30 nodes and 90 edges. To count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and then follow the steps mentioned earlier.

After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the order becomes:
```
Node 16 : degree 0
Node 5 : degree 1
Node 6 : degree 1
Node 13 : degree 1
Node 22 : degree 1
Node 29 : degree 2
Node 7 : degree 2
Node 10 : degree 2
Node 1 : degree 2
Node 4 : degree 2
Node 8 : degree 2
Node 18 : degree 2
Node 26 : degree 2
Node 12 : degree 2
Node 2 : degree 2
Node 20 : degree 3
Node 28 : degree 3
Node 15 : degree 4
Node 25 : degree 4
Node 19 : degree 4
Node 11 : degree 4
Node 21 : degree 4
Node 3 : degree 4
Node 9 : degree 5
Node 24 : degree 5
Node 17 : degree 6
Node 27 : degree 6
Node 0 : degree 7
```

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we check each edge to count the triangles:

1. Triangle <14, 17, 27> is found.
2. Triangle <14, 17, 7> is found.
3. Triangle <14, 17, 10> is found.
4. Triangle <17, 27, 23> is found.
5. Triangle <7, 14, 10> is found.
6. Triangle <23, 8, 19> is found.
7. Triangle <23, 15, 25> is found.
8. Triangle <4, 18, 27> is found.
9. Triangle <11, 17, 15> is found.
10. Triangle <11, 28, 15> is found.
11. Triangle <20, 23, 15> is found.
12. Triangle <20, 21, 11> is found.
13. Triangle <18, 6, 12> is found.
14. Triangle <15, 25, 19> is found.
15. Triangle <15, 21, 9> is found.
16. Triangle <0, 16, 24> is found.
17. Triangle <0, 22, 28> is found.
18. Triangle <1, 28, 22> is found.
19. Triangle <27, 23, 18> is found.
20. Triangle <27, 24, 29> is found.
21. Triangle <27, 29, 24> is found.
22. Triangle <9, 19, 25> is found.
23. Triangle <9, 0, 21> is found.
24. Triangle <9, 0, 1> is found.
25. Triangle <9, 0, 13> is found.

Total number of triangles: [25]
