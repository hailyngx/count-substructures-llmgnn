Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. In this case, the degrees of the vertices are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 6
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4

Relabeling the vertices based on their degrees:
- Node 8 -> 0
- Node 0 -> 1
- Node 5 -> 2
- Node 4 -> 3
- Node 3 -> 4
- Node 1 -> 5
- Node 9 -> 6
- Node 7 -> 7
- Node 2 -> 8
- Node 6 -> 9

After relabeling, the edges become:
(1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (5, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) 

Now, we count the triangles:
- The triangles are <1, 7, 5>, <1, 7, 2>, <1, 7, 3>, <1, 5, 3>, <1, 5, 9>, <5, 7, 3>, <5, 7, 2>, <5, 3, 9>, <9, 3, 7>, <9, 3, 5>, <9, 3, 2>, <7, 3, 2>
- Therefore, the total number of triangles is [12].
