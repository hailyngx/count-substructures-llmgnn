Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 6) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 6) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 10) 

Response:
The graph consists of the following edges:
- (0, 1), (0, 9)
- (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 10), (1, 11)
- (2, 10), (2, 11), (2, 13)
- (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 11), (3, 13)
- (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9), (4, 11)
- (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 11), (5, 12), (5, 13), (5, 14)
- (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6), (6, 8), (6, 14)
- (7, 3), (7, 7), (7, 12), (7, 9)
- (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 8), (8, 9), (8, 14)
- (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (9, 11)
- (10, 1), (10, 2)
- (11, 1), (11, 11), (11, 2), (11, 3), (11, 4), (11, 5), (11, 9)
- (12, 5), (12, 7), (12, 12), (12, 14)
- (13, 2), (13, 3), (13, 5), (13, 13)
- (14, 5), (14, 6), (14, 8), (14, 12), (14, 14)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

After relabeling the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 10 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 6
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 6
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 5 has degree 7
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 11 has degree 7
- Node 12 has degree 4
- Node 13 has degree 4
- Node 14 has degree 5

Triangles found based on the sorted nodes:
- Total number of triangles: [22]
- Unique triangles found: 
<1, 4, 11>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 5, 11>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 9, 4>, <1, 9, 11>, <4, 5, 11>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 9, 11>, <5, 11, 14>, <6, 8, 14>, <6, 14, 12>, <8, 9, 11>, <8, 9, 14>, <9, 11, 4>, <9, 11, 5>, <10, 2, 13>
