Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (5, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 14) 

Response:
The given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
(6, 9), (6, 14), (6, 8), (6, 0), 
(9, 2), (9, 11), (9, 14), (9, 1), (9, 13), 
(1, 3), (1, 10), (1, 12), 
(3, 11), (3, 0), (3, 12), 
(10, 11), (10, 4), (10, 2), 
(11, 13), (11, 12), (11, 2), 
(4, 8), (4, 13), (4, 14), 
(8, 0), 
(7, 12), (7, 14), (7, 2), 
(12, 7), 
(5, 13), 
(13, 5), 
(2, 7)
```

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:

Nodes by degrees: 5, 7, 0, 12, 10, 1, 4, 8, 6, 3, 14, 11, 13, 2, 9

After relabeling, the edges we will consider based on the Degree-Based Ordering method are:
(5, 13), (7, 12), (0, 3), (12, 7), (10, 11), (1, 3), (4, 8), (8, 0), (6, 9), (3, 11), (14, 7), (11, 13), (13, 5), (2, 7)

By checking for shared connections between the vertices of these edges, we can count the number of triangles. 

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

Unique triangles found:
<3, 0, 6>, <7, 12, 14>, <0, 3, 8>, <7, 12, 14>, <10, 11, 13>, <2, 7, 14>
