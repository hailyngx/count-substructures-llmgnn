Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 14) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (1, 8) (1, 0) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 2) (14, 11) (14, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 10, 7, 12, 1
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8, 0
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 11, 12, 4
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 11, 6, 7, 14
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 13, 2
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 4, 10
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 13, 7, 3, 12
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 0
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 3, 1
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 4, 13, 0
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 0, 12
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 14, 12, 2
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 10, 11, 6, 0, 2
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 4, 0, 6
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11, 3

Next, we sort the nodes by their degree:

Node 1 (Degree: 2)
Node 2 (Degree: 3)
Node 7 (Degree: 3)
Node 10 (Degree: 3)
Node 14 (Degree: 3)
Node 4 (Degree: 4)
Node 8 (Degree: 4)
Node 11 (Degree: 4)
Node 12 (Degree: 5)
Node 0 (Degree: 6)
Node 3 (Degree: 5)
Node 6 (Degree: 5)
Node 5 (Degree: 4)
Node 9 (Degree: 5)
Node 13 (Degree: 5)

We will now count the triangles:

Triangles: [24]

Unique triangles:
