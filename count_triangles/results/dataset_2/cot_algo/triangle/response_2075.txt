Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 9) (14, 13) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 9) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 1) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Let's label the vertices accordingly:

- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 6
- Node 5 has degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 6
- Node 8 has degree 6
- Node 9 has degree 6
- Node 10 has degree 4
- Node 11 has degree 4
- Node 12 has degree 4
- Node 13 has degree 4
- Node 14 has degree 2

Now, let's count the triangles using the sorted labels and the given edges. After checking for shared connections between vertices in each edge, the total number of triangles found in the graph is [12]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
- <1, 8, 13>
- <1, 10, 0>
- <1, 13, 14>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <3, 9, 11>
- <3, 9, 6>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <4, 7, 12>
- <8, 5, 6>
- <9, 4, 10>
- <9, 3, 6>
