Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (14, 10) (14, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Vertices:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 11), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 12), (1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 8), (10, 11), (10, 13), (10, 5), (10, 14), (11, 6), (11, 10), (11, 8), (11, 12), (5, 10), (5, 13), (5, 2), (5, 4), (13, 10), (13, 5), (13, 12), (13, 7), (0, 7), (0, 12), (7, 9), (7, 13), (7, 0), (7, 2), (8, 9), (8, 3), (8, 11), (8, 14), (8, 12), (4, 9), (4, 1), (4, 5), (12, 9), (12, 11), (12, 13), (12, 0), (12, 8), (14, 10), (14, 8), (2, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 7)

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices in degree sequence: 0, 1, 10, 4, 7, 14, 5, 2, 8, 11, 12, 13, 3, 6, 9

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 12]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 13>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 13, 9>
<7, 13, 9>
<8, 11, 12>
<8, 12, 13>
<9, 12, 13>
