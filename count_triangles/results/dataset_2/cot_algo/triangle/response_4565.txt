Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (12, 5) (12, 15) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 17) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 10) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 17) (9, 1) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 19) (4, 17) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 14) (18, 16) (18, 11) (19, 3) (19, 10) (14, 13) (14, 16) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 11) (17, 0) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 2) (11, 18) (11, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. Let's relabel the nodes so that we can count the triangles efficiently.

The sorted labels with the corresponding degree of each node are as follows:
Node 16 (degree 3), Node 4 (degree 1), Node 18 (degree 2), Node 11 (degree 2), Node 19 (degree 2), Node 9 (degree 1), Node 7 (degree 1), Node 14 (degree 2), Node 5 (degree 4), Node 6 (degree 4), Node 12 (degree 2), Node 3 (degree 4), Node 1 (degree 6), Node 0 (degree 6), Node 8 (degree 3), Node 15 (degree 3), Node 10 (degree 4), Node 13 (degree 5), Node 2 (degree 4), Node 17 (degree 4).

Let's now proceed with counting the triangles by considering the edges with the lower labeled nodes having fewer connections.

We start by counting the triangles formed by nodes with degrees:
Degree 1: 0 triangles (nodes 4, 9, 7)
Degree 2: 1 triangle <16, 14, 11> (node 16 connected to 14 and 11)
Degree 3: 3 triangles <1, 8, 17> (node 1 connected to 8 and 17)
Degree 4: 7 triangles <5, 6, 0>, <5, 13, 12>, <6, 13, 5>, <12, 15, 10>, <13, 0, 5>, <13, 2, 14>, <13, 10, 19> 
Degree 5: 6 triangles <13, 3, 1>, <13, 3, 9>, <13, 3, 19>, <13, 3, 8>, <13, 15, 1>, <13, 15, 12> 
Degree 6: 0 triangles (nodes 1, 0)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17] which are represented by unique triangles as follows:
<16, 14, 11>, <1, 8, 17>, <5, 6, 0>, <5, 13, 12>, <6, 13, 5>, <12, 15, 10>, <13, 0, 5>, <13, 2, 14>, <13, 10, 19>, <13, 3, 1>, <13, 3, 9>, <13, 3, 19>, <13, 3, 8>, <13, 15, 1>, <13, 15, 12>.
