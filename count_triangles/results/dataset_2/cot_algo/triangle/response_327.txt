Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (16, 11) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 7) (10, 3) (10, 12) (4, 19) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 18) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 5) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 2) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 19) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 7) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 1) (19, 4) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 3) (1, 7) (1, 12) (13, 9) (13, 12) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 19) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: (17, 5), (8, 0), (5, 0)
- 1: (7, 1), (12, 1)
- 2: (8, 2), (2, 18)
- 3: (10, 3), (5, 3), (19, 3)
- 4: (19, 4)
- 5: (6, 5), (17, 5), (15, 5), (0, 5), (5, 0), (3, 5)
- 6: (14, 6), (5, 6), (18, 6)
- 7: (17, 7), (15, 7), (1, 7)
- 8: (9, 8), (0, 8), (8, 2)
- 9: (11, 9), (8, 9), (13, 9), (19, 9)
- 10: (12, 10), (3, 10)
- 11: (16, 11), (9, 11)
- 12: (14, 12), (10, 12), (1, 12), (13, 12)
- 13: (9, 13), (12, 13)
- 14: (17, 14), (6, 14), (18, 14), (12, 14)
- 15: (5, 15), (19, 15), (7, 15)
- 16: (11, 16)
- 17: (14, 17), (17, 0), (17, 5), (17, 18), (7, 17)
- 18: (14, 18), (2, 18), (18, 6), (18, 17)
- 19: (4, 19), (9, 19), (15, 19), (19, 3)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices in increasing order of degree:
(1) - 1 connection: 1, 16
(2) - 2 connections: 4, 7, 10, 11, 13
(3) - 3 connections: 2, 6, 8, 15
(4) - 4 connections: 0
(5) - 5 connections: 9, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19
(6) - 6 connections: 3, 5

Now, we count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [11]

Unique triangles: <0, 5, 17>, <3, 5, 19>, <3, 12, 14>, <3, 12, 13>, <3, 5, 0>, <4, 9, 19>, <2, 8, 9>, <1, 7, 15>, <6, 14, 18>, <10, 12, 13>, <8, 0, 17>
