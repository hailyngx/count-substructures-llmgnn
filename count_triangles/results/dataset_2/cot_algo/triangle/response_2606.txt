Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 17) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 2) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 2) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 19) (4, 13) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 17) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 14) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (1, 16) (1, 15) (1, 4) (9, 15) (9, 17) (0, 11) (0, 10) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 6) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 5) (17, 3) (17, 4) (17, 9) (6, 16) (6, 7) (6, 12) (14, 18) (14, 5) (14, 19) (12, 6) (12, 19) (19, 13) (19, 14) (19, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections). After relabeling the nodes according to their degree in ascending order, we can calculate the number of triangles in the graph.

The sorted nodes based on their degree are:
Nodes: [11, 16, 3, 15, 10, 0, 7, 13, 4, 18, 5, 1, 9, 2, 17, 6, 14, 19, 8, 12]
Degrees: [3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 5, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]

By analyzing the edges while following the Degree-Based Ordering rule of processing edges only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].

Unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 4, 15>
<1, 4, 17>
<1, 15, 9>
<1, 15, 2>
<1, 15, 4>
<4, 13, 19>
<4, 18, 14>
<5, 13, 19>
<5, 14, 19>
<7, 3, 15>
<7, 3, 17>
<10, 0, 11>
<10, 2, 5>
<10, 2, 15>
<13, 8, 18>
