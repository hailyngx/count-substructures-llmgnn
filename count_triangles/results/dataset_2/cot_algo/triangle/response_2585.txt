Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on the number of connections are: <1, 9, 8, 3, 6, 0, 2, 4, 7, 5>.

From the provided edges, we only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. (1, 3) - Shared connections: 8. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 8>.
2. (9, 3) - Shared connections: None.
3. (8, 1) - Shared connections: None.
4. (3, 9) - Shared connections: 7. Triangle formed: <3, 9, 7>.
5. (6, 4) - Shared connections: None.
6. (0, 6) - Shared connections: 5. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 5>.
7. (2, 0) - Shared connections: 5. Triangle formed: <2, 0, 5>.
8. (4, 6) - Shared connections: 7. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
