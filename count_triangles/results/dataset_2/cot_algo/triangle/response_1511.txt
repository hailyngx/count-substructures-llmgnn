Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: [4, 2, 7, 3]
- 1: [8, 6, 2]
- 2: [5, 8, 6, 1, 3, 0]
- 3: [5, 9, 4, 2, 0, 7]
- 4: [9, 8, 0, 3]
- 5: [2, 3]
- 6: [8, 1, 7, 2]
- 7: [6, 0, 3]
- 8: [9, 4, 2, 6, 1]
- 9: [8, 4, 3]

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 5, 1, 7, 0, 6, 9, 4, 8, 2, 3
2. Perform edge traversal based on the order and count the triangles:

Triangles: [5, 1, 2], [0, 2, 6], [0, 2, 8], [0, 2, 6], [0, 2, 1], [0, 2, 8], [0, 2, 6], [0, 2, 1], [0, 2, 3], [0, 2, 8], [0, 2, 6], [0, 7, 6], [0, 7, 3], [2, 6, 8], [4, 8, 9], [4, 8, 3], [4, 8, 9], [8, 6, 3], [8, 6, 1]

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [19].
