Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 29) (7, 6) (7, 19) (21, 7) (21, 5) (21, 15) (20, 13) (20, 4) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 16) (25, 12) (3, 25) (3, 22) (3, 18) (12, 25) (12, 27) (12, 24) (12, 14) (27, 12) (27, 9) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 10) (8, 15) (13, 20) (13, 8) (13, 0) (13, 18) (1, 26) (1, 5) (1, 0) (26, 1) (26, 22) (26, 11) (22, 3) (22, 26) (22, 29) (11, 26) (4, 20) (4, 19) (6, 7) (6, 24) (6, 0) (24, 12) (24, 8) (24, 6) (24, 17) (24, 10) (15, 21) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 16) (19, 7) (19, 4) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 0) (5, 21) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 23) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 10) (29, 7) (29, 22) (29, 0) (9, 25) (9, 27) (16, 25) (16, 15) (16, 17) (17, 24) (17, 2) (17, 23) (17, 16) (18, 3) (18, 13) (10, 8) (10, 24) (10, 23) (14, 12) (14, 15) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 29) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, we relabel the nodes accordingly. 

Here is the list of nodes sorted by their degree:
Node 2: degree 2
Node 16: degree 3
Node 19: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 20: degree 4
Node 26: degree 4
Node 1: degree 5
Node 18: degree 5
Node 14: degree 5
Node 17: degree 5
Node 23: degree 5
Node 10: degree 5
Node 4: degree 6
Node 22: degree 6
Node 27: degree 6
Node 3: degree 7
Node 24: degree 7
Node 12: degree 8
Node 5: degree 9
Node 13: degree 9
Node 21: degree 9
Node 6: degree 10
Node 29: degree 10
Node 0: degree 11
Node 8: degree 11
Node 7: degree 12
Node 25: degree 12
Node 15: degree 12

Now, we will only consider the edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:

Triangles found: 
<0, 1, 29>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 29>
<2, 5, 23>
<5, 23, 17>
<5, 23, 10>
<5, 23, 2>
<10, 23, 17>
<10, 23, 24>
<10, 24, 17>
<24, 12, 27>
<24, 17, 2>
<24, 17, 16>
<24, 17, 10>
<24, 17, 23>
<24, 17, 16>
<24, 17, 16>
<24, 17, 16>
<24, 17, 16>
<24, 17, 16>
<24, 17, 16>
<24, 17, 16>
<24, 17, 16>
<24, 17, 16>
<27, 9, 25>
<27, 12, 24>

Therefore, the total number of triangles found in the graph is [25].
