Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 13) (8, 11) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 14) (0, 10) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 2) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the triangles efficiently. 
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we can label them as follows:

Vertices with their degrees:
0: 1
3: 2
5: 2
8: 2
10: 3
7: 4
6: 4
9: 4
13: 4
12: 5
2: 5
11: 5
14: 5
4: 7
1: 7

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

We will iterate through the edges, considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found:
<1, 7, 11>
<1, 7, 4>
<1, 7, 10>
<4, 7, 10>
<6, 12, 13>
<9, 11, 14>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 2, 14>
<2, 9, 14>

Total number of triangles: [9]
