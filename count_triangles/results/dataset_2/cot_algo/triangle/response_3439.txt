Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 9) (15, 16) (15, 3) (5, 6) (5, 17) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 10) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 1) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 18) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (2, 11) (2, 17) (2, 10) (9, 3) (9, 4) (18, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2) 

Response:
The graph has the following edges:
- (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2)
- (16, 12) (16, 15)
- (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 9)
- (15, 16) (15, 3)
- (5, 6) (5, 17) (5, 0)
- (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 0)
- (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7)
- (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13)
- (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 10)
- (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2)
- (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 1)
- (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 8)
- (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1)
- (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 18)
- (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 14)
- (14, 7) (14, 1)
- (2, 11) (2, 17) (2, 10)
- (9, 3) (9, 4)
- (18, 12)
- (10, 13) (10, 2)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

0: 4 connections
1: 3 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 3 connections
19: 3 connections
9: 2 connections
14: 2 connections
18: 1 connection
10: 2 connections
2: 3 connections
3: 3 connections
11: 3 connections
12: 4 connections
13: 4 connections
15: 2 connections
16: 2 connections
17: 5 connections

Based on the degree-based ordering, we can now count the number of triangles. The total number of triangles is [29].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 11, 13>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 17>
<0, 7, 6>
<0, 7, 13>
<0, 11, 2>
<1, 8, 17>
<1, 8, 19>
<1, 4, 12>
<2, 11, 17>
<2, 10, 13>
<3, 15, 16>
<3, 15, 19>
<4, 12, 17>
<4, 12, 18>
<4, 9, 3>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 17, 13>
<6, 7, 0>
<7, 13, 17>
<8, 17, 1>
<8, 19, 3>
<9, 3, 15>
<10, 13, 2>
<12, 16, 15>
<12, 17, 16>
<13, 17, 5>
<14, 7, 1>
