Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
Let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 9: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 8: 6 connections

Now, we will list the edges in the correct order (from the node with the lower label to the one with the higher label):

(2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 8)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the edges:

1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <0, 3, 8>
3. <1, 3, 6>
4. <1, 3, 8>
5. <1, 4, 5>
6. <1, 4, 7>
7. <1, 4, 8>
8. <1, 5, 7>
9. <1, 5, 8>
10. <1, 6, 7>
11. <1, 6, 8>
12. <1, 7, 8>
13. <3, 6, 8>
14. <4, 5, 7>
15. <4, 5, 8>
16. <4, 7, 8>
17. <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
