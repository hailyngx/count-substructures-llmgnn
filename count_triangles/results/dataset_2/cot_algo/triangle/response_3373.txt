Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 4) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) 
(6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) 
(2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) 
(8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) 
(9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) 
(3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) 
(7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) 
(0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) 
(4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) 
(1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 4)

After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels are:
0(3), 1(3), 2(3), 3(4), 4(5), 5(5), 6(4), 7(6), 8(6), 9(5)

Triangles:
