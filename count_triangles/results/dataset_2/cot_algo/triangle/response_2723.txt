Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each node to determine the correct labeling order:

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 5

Based on the degrees, we will assign the following labels to the nodes:
- Node 5: label 0
- Node 1: label 1
- Node 7: label 2
- Node 3: label 3
- Node 0: label 4
- Node 6: label 5
- Node 9: label 6
- Node 2: label 7
- Node 8: label 8
- Node 4: label 9

Now, we can list the edges based on the new labeling order:
- (0, 4)
- (1, 4)
- (1, 6)
- (2, 3)
- (2, 7)
- (3, 4)
- (4, 8)
- (4, 9)
- (4, 6)
- (5, 9)
- (6, 7)
- (8, 9)
- (8, 0)
- (8, 1)
- (8, 4)
- (9, 2)
- (9, 3)
- (9, 5)
- (9, 8)

Now, we'll count the total number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. The output will be the total number of triangles inside brackets [].

[10]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
