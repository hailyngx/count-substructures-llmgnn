Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 6) (1, 6) (1, 18) (3, 4) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 19) (2, 18) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 15) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 17) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 16) (16, 7) (16, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (17, 2) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 15) (19, 11) (19, 17) (8, 14) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 17) (0, 13) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: (5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 11)
- 1: (9, 14), (9, 12)
- 2: (4, 7), (4, 10), (4, 15), (4, 3)
- 3: (7, 12), (7, 16), (7, 6)
- 4: (1, 6), (1, 18)
- 5: (3, 4), (10, 4), (10, 13), (11, 5), (11, 14), (11, 19)
- 6: (2, 18), (2, 14), (2, 17)
- 7: (12, 9), (12, 7), (12, 13), (12, 17)
- 8: (13, 5), (13, 10), (13, 12), (13, 15), (13, 0)
- 9: (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 17), (6, 16)
- 10: (16, 7), (16, 6)
- 11: (14, 9), (14, 11), (14, 2), (14, 8)
- 12: (17, 2), (17, 12), (17, 6), (17, 19), (17, 15)
- 13: (19, 11), (19, 17)
- 14: (8, 14)
- 15: (15, 4), (15, 18), (15, 13), (15, 17)
- 16: (0, 13)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
0 (degree: 1)
16 (degree: 1)
8 (degree: 1)
18 (degree: 2)
3 (degree: 2)
10 (degree: 2)
19 (degree: 2)
5 (degree: 3)
1 (degree: 3)
2 (degree: 3)
4 (degree: 4)
7 (degree: 4)
9 (degree: 4)
15 (degree: 4)
6 (degree: 5)
11 (degree: 5)
14 (degree: 5)
17 (degree: 5)
12 (degree: 5)
13 (degree: 5)

Now, let's find the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles: 
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 14, 17>
<2, 14, 8>
<4, 7, 12>
<4, 7, 16>
<5, 9, 14>
<6, 1, 18>
<6, 7, 12>
<6, 7, 16>
<6, 12, 17>
<11, 14, 9>
<15, 17, 2>
