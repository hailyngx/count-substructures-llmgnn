Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges:
- 0: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
- 1: 0, 3, 4, 6
- 2: 9
- 3: 0, 1, 6, 7
- 4: 1, 6, 7, 8
- 5: 6, 7, 9
- 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
- 7: 0, 3, 4, 5, 9
- 8: 0, 4, 6
- 9: 0, 2, 5, 7

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees from least to most:

Nodes by degree: 2, 8, 5, 4, 9, 1, 3, 7, 0, 6

We will now count the triangles:

Triangles: [9]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
