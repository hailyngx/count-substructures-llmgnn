Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are:  

Node 7: 5 connections  
Node 8: 4 connections  
Node 0: 4 connections  
Node 2: 4 connections  
Node 1: 3 connections  
Node 3: 3 connections  
Node 5: 3 connections  
Node 4: 3 connections  
Node 6: 3 connections  
Node 9: 2 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and comparing edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections, we find the triangles and their count:

<1, 5, 7>  
<2, 4, 7>  
<2, 4, 8>  
<2, 7, 8>  
<3, 5, 7>  
<4, 6, 7>  
<4, 6, 9>  
<4, 7, 9>  
<4, 7, 8>  

Total number of triangles: [9]
