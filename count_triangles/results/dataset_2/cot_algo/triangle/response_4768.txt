Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 18) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 13) (13, 2) (13, 15) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 4) (4, 10) (4, 17) (12, 5) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 14) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 3) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 6) (19, 3) (0, 5) (0, 15) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 0) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 8) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 0) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the vertices is as follows:
Node 19: Degree 1
Node 16: Degree 2
Node 12: Degree 2
Node 18: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 14: Degree 4
Node 17: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 15: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 6
Node 11: Degree 6

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Total number of triangles: [12]
Unique triangles found: <0, 5, 15>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 3, 17>, <0, 3, 6>, <1, 2, 8>, <3, 14, 17>, <3, 14, 19>, <4, 10, 17>, <4, 17, 11>, <5, 9, 18>, <7, 14, 16>, <10, 11, 14>
