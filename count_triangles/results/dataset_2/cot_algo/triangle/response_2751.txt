Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (15, 14) (10, 7) (10, 14) (17, 13) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 11) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 6) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 1) (11, 17) (11, 4) (11, 7) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 13) (16, 3) (16, 0) (16, 9) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 14) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 11) (1, 18) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 14) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 13) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 1) (19, 17) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the nodes based on the number of connections each node has. Then, we relabel the nodes according to their sorted order and follow the procedure mentioned earlier.

After sorting the nodes based on their degrees, the new labeling is as follows:

Nodes: [3, 15, 10, 17, 2, 8, 4, 18, 0, 11, 5, 13, 16, 9, 7, 1, 6, 14, 19, 12]

Now, by considering only the edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections, we observe the following unique triangles:

<2, 0, 4>
<1, 5, 13>
<4, 11, 18>
<0, 16, 9>
<7, 11, 17>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
