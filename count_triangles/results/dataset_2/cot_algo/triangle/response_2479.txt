Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 17) (14, 10) (17, 7) (17, 3) (10, 14) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 13) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 12) (18, 9) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 9) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 9) (5, 19) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 13) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 13) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 12) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 12) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in this graph proceeds as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
   - Vertex 5: 1 connection
   - Vertex 4: 2 connections
   - Vertex 1: 2 connections
   - Vertex 18: 2 connections
   - Vertex 16: 2 connections
   - Vertex 14: 2 connections
   - Vertex 2: 3 connections
   - Vertex 12: 4 connections
   - Vertex 6: 4 connections
   - Vertex 13: 4 connections
   - Vertex 17: 4 connections
   - Vertex 19: 4 connections
   - Vertex 3: 4 connections
   - Vertex 11: 4 connections
   - Vertex 10: 5 connections
   - Vertex 8: 5 connections
   - Vertex 0: 5 connections
   - Vertex 7: 5 connections
   - Vertex 15: 5 connections
   - Vertex 9: 5 connections

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   - Vertex 5 -> 0
   - Vertex 4 -> 1
   - Vertex 1 -> 2
   - Vertex 18 -> 3
   - Vertex 16 -> 4
   - Vertex 14 -> 5
   - Vertex 2 -> 6
   - Vertex 12 -> 7
   - Vertex 6 -> 8
   - Vertex 13 -> 9
   - Vertex 17 -> 10
   - Vertex 19 -> 11
   - Vertex 3 -> 12
   - Vertex 11 -> 13
   - Vertex 10 -> 14
   - Vertex 8 -> 15
   - Vertex 0 -> 16
   - Vertex 7 -> 17
   - Vertex 15 -> 18
   - Vertex 9 -> 19

3. Count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

   Total number of triangles: [16]

   Unique triangles found: 
   <1, 2, 6>
   <1, 2, 12>
   <1, 6, 15>
   <2, 6, 12>
   <6, 12, 15>
   <0, 9, 12>
   <0, 9, 3>
   <0, 9, 18>
   <10, 13, 15>
   <10, 15, 8>
   <10, 15, 6>
   <10, 15, 7>
   <8, 12, 6>
   <8, 12, 2>
   <8, 12, 9>
   <12, 2, 7>
