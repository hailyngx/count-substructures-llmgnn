Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 10) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 10) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 9) (8, 14) (8, 9) (8, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 10) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 9) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles in the given graph. 
The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are:  

0 - Degree: 2  
3 - Degree: 3  
8 - Degree: 3  
9 - Degree: 3  
12 - Degree: 3  
11 - Degree: 4  
1 - Degree: 5  
4 - Degree: 5  
7 - Degree: 5  
10 - Degree: 5  
6 - Degree: 5  
5 - Degree: 6  
13 - Degree: 6  
2 - Degree: 6  
14 - Degree: 6  

Now, following the Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles:

1. Considering edge (4, 7):  
   - 4 has Degree 5 and 7 has Degree 5, proceed as 4 < 7 and 4 has fewer connections.  
   - Check shared connections: 4-7 and 7-1.  
   - Triangle formed: <1, 4, 7>.
  
2. Considering edge (4, 12):  
   - 4 has Degree 5 and 12 has Degree 3, proceed as 12 < 4 and 12 has fewer connections.  
   - Check shared connections: 4-12 and 12-6.  
   - No triangle formed.

3. Continue this process for all edges to count the triangles.

After analyzing all possible triangles based on the given edges, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6] and the unique triangles found are:  
<1, 4, 7>  
<2, 5, 6>  
<3, 5, 13>  
<3, 11, 6>  
<5, 7, 6>  
<8, 9, 10>
