Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0 is connected to: 1, 4, 5, 9
- 1 is connected to: 0, 2, 3, 6, 9
- 2 is connected to: 1, 4, 6
- 3 is connected to: 1, 6, 7, 9
- 4 is connected to: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7
- 5 is connected to: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9
- 6 is connected to: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8
- 7 is connected to: 3, 4, 5
- 8 is connected to: 6
- 9 is connected to: 0, 1, 3, 5

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Node 8 (degree 1)
Node 2 (degree 2)
Node 7 (degree 3)
Node 3 (degree 4)
Node 0 (degree 4)
Node 9 (degree 4)
Node 1 (degree 5)
Node 4 (degree 5)
Node 6 (degree 6)
Node 5 (degree 5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
- We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Now, let's count the triangles:
Triangles: [<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 7>]

Total number of triangles: [9]
