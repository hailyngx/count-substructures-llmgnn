Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 3) (14, 4) (17, 10) (17, 5) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 16) (12, 10) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 18) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 3) (19, 8) (19, 0) (4, 14) (4, 0) (0, 19) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 18) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 5) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 13) (15, 11) (15, 9) (15, 18) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 16: 3 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 17: 3 connections
Node 14: 1 connection
Node 19: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 11: 3 connections

Following the lower label rule, we will consider the following edges:
(14, 4), (17, 10), (14, 0), (14, 18), (17, 5), (5, 13), (8, 5), (8, 19), (8, 3), (19, 8), (19, 0), (0, 18)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the shared connections:

<14, 0, 4>
<14, 0, 18>
<14, 4, 18>
<0, 4, 18>
<17, 5, 13>
<8, 5, 13>
<5, 13, 10>
<8, 19, 0>

Total number of triangles: [8]
