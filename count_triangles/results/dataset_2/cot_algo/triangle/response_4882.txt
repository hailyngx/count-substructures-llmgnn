Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, from least to most connections.

Node 6: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 7
Node 5: Degree 7

Starting with the vertices with the least edges to other vertices, we look at each edge and count the triangles that can be formed due to shared connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles found in the graph is: [17]
  
These triangles are: 
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<6, 3, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
