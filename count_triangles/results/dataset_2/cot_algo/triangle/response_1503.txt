Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 0) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 12) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 8) (0, 12) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their degrees. 

The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
0 -> 6
1 -> 4
2 -> 3
3 -> 6
4 -> 6
5 -> 3
6 -> 5
7 -> 4
8 -> 6
9 -> 2
10 -> 3
11 -> 5
12 -> 4
13 -> 2
14 -> 3

Now, we will count the triangles:
(3, 1, 4)
(8, 6, 4)
(10, 8, 12)
(0, 9, 11)
(0, 9, 13)
(0, 8, 12)
(7, 1, 4)
(7, 3, 4)
(14, 1, 4)
(14, 3, 4)

So, the total number of triangles is [10]. The unique triangles found are <3, 1, 4>, <8, 6, 4>, <10, 8, 12>, <0, 9, 11>, <0, 9, 13>, <0, 8, 12>, <7, 1, 4>, <7, 3, 4>, <14, 1, 4>, <14, 3, 4>.
