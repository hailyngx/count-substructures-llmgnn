Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Edges:
- 0: [4, 7, 1]
- 1: [5, 6, 4, 0, 8, 2]
- 2: [4, 1, 3]
- 3: [5, 6, 4, 8, 2]
- 4: [9, 7, 0, 1, 3, 2]
- 5: [9, 8, 1, 3]
- 6: [9, 1, 3]
- 7: [4, 0, 8]
- 8: [5, 7, 3, 1]
- 9: [5, 6, 4]

Now, we follow the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Nodes sorted by degree (ascending): [2, 0, 7, 9, 8, 6, 5, 3, 1, 4]

Triangles found:
- <1, 2, 3>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <4, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [7]
