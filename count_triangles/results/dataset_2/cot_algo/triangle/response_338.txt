Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Nodes: 4, 6, 0, 5, 1, 7, 3, 2, 8, 9 

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles.

The total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
