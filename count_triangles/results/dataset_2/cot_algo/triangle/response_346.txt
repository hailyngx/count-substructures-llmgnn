Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (16, 11) (16, 13) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 28) (0, 27) (0, 20) (0, 3) (0, 18) (27, 0) (27, 3) (27, 20) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 5) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 1) (23, 12) (10, 11) (10, 26) (10, 2) (10, 28) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 1) (20, 8) (20, 19) (12, 7) (12, 23) (12, 29) (12, 8) (2, 10) (2, 26) (18, 0) (19, 20) (19, 17) (19, 14) (26, 10) (26, 2) (26, 17) (1, 4) (1, 23) (1, 20) (1, 15) (1, 13) (15, 1) (15, 14) (15, 21) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (17, 19) (17, 26) (17, 9) (17, 21) (3, 0) (3, 27) (3, 13) (28, 7) (28, 10) (28, 9) (24, 21) (29, 12) (29, 6) (5, 22) (5, 23) (8, 20) (8, 12) (6, 22) (6, 13) (6, 29) (6, 25) (21, 15) (21, 17) (21, 24) (9, 17) (9, 28) (9, 14) (25, 22) (25, 6) (14, 19) (14, 15) (14, 9) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:

0: 4 connections
20: 5 connections
27: 3 connections
3: 3 connections
12: 4 connections
10: 4 connections
26: 3 connections
7: 4 connections
23: 4 connections
1: 5 connections
13: 4 connections
2: 2 connections
18: 1 connection
19: 3 connections
17: 4 connections
8: 2 connections
6: 4 connections
15: 3 connections
21: 4 connections
9: 3 connections
29: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
25: 2 connections
24: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
22: 4 connections
28: 3 connections
16: 2 connections
11: 2 connections
14: 3 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 13]
<0, 19, 20>
<0, 1, 20>
<0, 3, 27>
<0, 20, 27>
<1, 13, 15>
<1, 15, 21>
<1, 17, 19>
<1, 20, 27>
<2, 10, 26>
<9, 17, 21>
<12, 7, 23>
<12, 8, 20>
<15, 17, 21>
