Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 13) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
The degree of each node in the graph is as follows:
Node 0: 5
Node 1: 6
Node 2: 2
Node 3: 3
Node 4: 4
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 1
Node 8: 5
Node 9: 3
Node 10: 4
Node 11: 5
Node 12: 4
Node 13: 5
Node 14: 5

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degree in ascending order:
Nodes in order: 7, 2, 9, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 0, 12, 13, 14, 8, 11, 1

Next, we will examine the edges in this order to count the number of triangles.
After going through all the edges, we find that the total number of triangles in the graph is 17. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
The unique triangles found are <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 10>, <0, 6, 12>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 14>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 11>, <1, 8, 14>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 10, 12>, <4, 10, 13>, <4, 11, 13>, <5, 6, 11>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 8, 11>, <9, 10, 13>, <11, 13, 14>.
