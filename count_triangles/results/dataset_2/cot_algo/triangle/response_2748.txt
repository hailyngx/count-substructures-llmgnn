Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 19) (1, 9) (21, 26) (21, 22) (21, 14) (15, 29) (15, 12) (27, 18) (27, 19) (27, 23) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 18) (5, 23) (5, 10) (5, 16) (6, 20) (6, 0) (17, 24) (17, 2) (17, 26) (29, 15) (29, 16) (29, 14) (11, 28) (11, 4) (28, 11) (28, 25) (28, 23) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 3) (26, 0) (0, 6) (0, 26) (0, 10) (0, 25) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 24) (9, 1) (9, 23) (9, 19) (18, 27) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 3) (23, 27) (23, 5) (23, 28) (23, 9) (4, 11) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 16) (19, 1) (19, 27) (19, 9) (7, 14) (24, 17) (24, 10) (24, 25) (22, 21) (22, 16) (22, 12) (22, 3) (16, 5) (16, 29) (16, 2) (16, 22) (20, 6) (25, 28) (25, 0) (25, 24) (25, 14) (14, 21) (14, 29) (14, 7) (14, 25) (14, 12) (12, 15) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 3) (3, 26) (3, 18) (3, 22) (3, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly. 

Here is the sorted list of vertices with their connections:

Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 13: 3 connections
Vertex 20: 3 connections
Vertex 19: 3 connections
Vertex 12: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 11: 4 connections
Vertex 25: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 22: 4 connections
Vertex 24: 4 connections
Vertex 21: 5 connections
Vertex 17: 5 connections
Vertex 10: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 14: 5 connections
Vertex 26: 6 connections
Vertex 23: 6 connections
Vertex 18: 6 connections
Vertex 15: 6 connections
Vertex 29: 6 connections
Vertex 28: 6 connections
Vertex 27: 7 connections
Vertex 16: 7 connections
Vertex 0: 7 connections
Vertex 2: 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles in the graph. 

The total number of triangles is [30].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 10>
<0, 6, 20>
<0, 25, 14>
<1, 9, 19>
<5, 16, 22>
<5, 10, 24>
<8, 13, 18>
<12, 14, 25>
<15, 29, 16>
<17, 24, 25>
<21, 26, 3>
<23, 9, 19>
<3, 12, 22>
