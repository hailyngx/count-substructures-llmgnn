Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 0), (9, 6), (9, 3), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 0), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 3), (7, 0), (8, 2), (2, 1)

Next, we will label the nodes according to their degrees from lowest to highest:
Nodes degree-wise: 1, 2, 9, 3, 7, 0, 6, 4, 8, 5

Now, we will list the edges based on the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections:
Edges for counting triangles: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 0), (9, 6), (9, 3), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 0), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 3), (7, 0), (8, 2), (2, 1)

Now, we will count the number of triangles:
Total number of triangles: [6]

List of unique triangles found: <8, 5, 6>, <4, 8, 5>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 0>, <5, 9, 6>, <5, 2, 8>
