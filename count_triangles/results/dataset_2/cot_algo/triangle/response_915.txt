Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 0) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 18) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 17) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 1) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 13) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 13) (17, 11) (17, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) (8, 19) (8, 12) (15, 19) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 3) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 17) (3, 5) (3, 19) (3, 6) (3, 16) (6, 14) (6, 3) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Node degrees:
0: 2
1: 2
2: 3
3: 4
4: 3
5: 5
6: 2
7: 4
8: 3
9: 3
10: 2
11: 5
12: 4
13: 4
14: 4
15: 2
16: 3
17: 2
18: 4
19: 3

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order:

(15, 19) (8, 19) (8, 12) (0, 14) (14, 7) (14, 6) (3, 19) (3, 6) (3, 16) (6, 3) (16, 10) (16, 9) (16, 3) (10, 11) (11, 7) (11, 17) (7, 18) (18, 12) (18, 1) (18, 5) (12, 4) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 5) (11, 12) (12, 8) (12, 18) (1, 11) (4, 12) (4, 13) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 13) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 5) (17, 11) (13, 14) (2, 17) (2, 5) (3, 5) (7, 11) (11, 1)

Number of triangles: [12]

The unique triangles are:
<0, 7, 11>
<0, 14, 7>
<0, 14, 13>
<3, 16, 10>
<3, 16, 9>
<3, 6, 14>
<4, 12, 11>
<4, 12, 18>
<5, 18, 7>
<11, 12, 18>
<11, 7, 18>
<12, 8, 19>
