Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 17) (22, 10) (22, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 28) (17, 18) (17, 5) (17, 11) (19, 2) (19, 26) (19, 20) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 6) (26, 25) (26, 4) (4, 18) (4, 26) (4, 15) (13, 1) (13, 26) (13, 0) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 24) (27, 25) (27, 9) (27, 5) (12, 2) (12, 28) (12, 29) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (14, 11) (14, 20) (16, 24) (16, 8) (16, 5) (7, 3) (7, 22) (7, 11) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 21) (0, 29) (24, 25) (24, 16) (5, 17) (5, 27) (5, 16) (8, 11) (8, 16) (20, 19) (20, 14) (29, 12) (29, 0) (29, 21) (15, 18) (15, 4) (23, 10) (23, 28) (21, 0) (21, 29) (6, 3) (6, 26) (6, 10) (10, 22) (10, 23) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 28) (9, 27) (9, 10) (9, 28) (28, 2) (28, 12) (28, 23) (28, 10) (28, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles is as follows:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections in ascending order.
   - Node 1 has 2 connections.
   - Nodes 3, 18, 22, and 7 have 3 connections.
   - Nodes 13, 4, 25, 27, 12, 11, 14, 16, 5, 8, 20, 15, and 21 have 4 connections.
   - Nodes 0, 26, 17, 19, 24, 10, and 29 have 5 connections.
   - Nodes 6 and 23 have 6 connections.
   - Node 9 has 7 connections.
   - Node 28 has 8 connections.

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   - Node 28 (original label 29) has label 1.
   - Node 9 (original label 28) has label 2.
   - Node 23 (original label 27) has label 3.
   - Node 6 (original label 26) has label 4.
   - Node 24 (original label 25) has label 5.
   - Node 10 (original label 24) has label 6.
   - Node 29 (original label 23) has label 7.
   - Node 21 (original label 22) has label 8.
   - Node 15 (original label 21) has label 9.
   - Node 20 (original label 20) has label 10.
   - Node 8 (original label 19) has label 11.
   - Node 5 (original label 18) has label 12.
   - Node 16 (original label 17) has label 13.
   - Node 14 (original label 16) has label 14.
   - Node 11 (original label 15) has label 15.
   - Node 12 (original label 14) has label 16.
   - Node 27 (original label 13) has label 17.
   - Node 25 (original label 12) has label 18.
   - Node 4 (original label 11) has label 19.
   - Node 0 (original label 10) has label 20.
   - Node 17 (original label 9) has label 21.
   - Node 26 (original label 8) has label 22.
   - Node 19 (original label 7) has label 23.
   - Node 3 (original label 6) has label 24.
   - Node 22 (original label 5) has label 25.
   - Node 18 (original label 4) has label 26.
   - Node 7 (original label 3) has label 27.
   - Node 2 (original label 2) has label 28.
   - Node 13 (original label 1) has label 29.
   - Node 1 (original label 0) has label 30.

3. Count the number of triangles:
   - There are 10 triangles in total.

The unique triangles found are:
<10, 9, 13>
<10, 4, 26>
<4, 26, 5>
<4, 18, 15>
<4, 26, 13>
<5, 16, 8>
<5, 27, 9>
<5, 17, 11>
<7, 3, 22>
<20, 14, 11>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [10].
