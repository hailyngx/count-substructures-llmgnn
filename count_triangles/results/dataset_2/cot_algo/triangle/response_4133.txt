Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 10) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 13) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (14, 13) (14, 12) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), 
(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 10), (1, 11), 
(2, 7), (2, 9), (2, 10), (2, 1), 
(3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), 
(4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), 
(5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 13), 
(6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9), 
(7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 12), 
(8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 10), (8, 13), 
(9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 13), 
(10, 1), (10, 2), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 8), 
(11, 1), (11, 10), 
(12, 7), (12, 10), (12, 14), 
(13, 5), (13, 8), (13, 9), (13, 14), 
(14, 12), (14, 13) 

Let's perform the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in this graph: 

Vertices by number of connections (in ascending order): 
{14}, {0, 1, 11, 12}, {5, 8, 10, 13}, {2, 4, 7, 9}, {3, 6}

Edges to check based on the method: 
(0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 10), (1, 11), (5, 13), (2, 7), (2, 9), (2, 10), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 12), (8, 10), (8, 13), (9, 13), (10, 12)

The total number of triangles is [12]. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 10, 11>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 10>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 13>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 10>, <4, 8, 13>
