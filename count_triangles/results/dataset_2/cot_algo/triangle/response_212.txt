Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 12) (16, 7) (16, 15) (3, 1) (15, 16) (15, 2) (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 7) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 17) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 17) (18, 13) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 6) (7, 16) (7, 5) (7, 1) (14, 2) (14, 4) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 17) (12, 11) (12, 0) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 13) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 4) (13, 0) (13, 18) (13, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. Let's now count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Nodes sorted by their degrees:
Node 3: degree 1
Node 16: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 19: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 14: degree 2
Node 12: degree 2
Node 11: degree 2
Node 13: degree 3
Node 0: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 18: degree 5
Node 5: degree 6
Node 17: degree 6
Node 15: degree 4

Now, let's iterate through the edges and count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles = 73
[73]

Unique triangles in the graph are:
<1, 10, 19>
<1, 18, 10>
<1, 18, 13>
<1, 18, 7>
<1, 18, 9>
