Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 17) (27, 24) (27, 28) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 24) (22, 23) (22, 6) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 3) (23, 9) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 29) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (1, 20) (1, 5) (26, 14) (26, 29) (26, 6) (26, 17) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 21) (14, 26) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 18) (20, 28) (20, 16) (7, 12) (7, 25) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 7) (25, 7) (25, 6) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 3) (19, 8) (19, 5) (16, 0) (16, 20) (16, 29) (21, 0) (21, 9) (21, 2) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 2) (29, 8) (29, 26) (29, 16) (9, 23) (9, 21) (9, 3) (13, 6) (18, 20) (18, 6) (18, 28) (28, 27) (28, 20) (28, 18) (6, 22) (6, 26) (6, 25) (6, 13) (6, 18) (17, 15) (17, 23) (17, 26) (3, 23) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 14) (2, 21) (2, 24) (2, 3) 

Response:
[23, 13, 6, 25] (nodes with the fewest connections)
[7, 1, 5, 19] (nodes with slightly more connections)
[22, 18, 3, 9, 21, 2] (nodes with more connections)
[24, 28, 11, 27, 10, 12, 14, 0, 20, 16, 29, 8, 4] (nodes with the most connections)

Total number of triangles: [34]
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 14>, <0, 16, 26>, <0, 16, 20>, <0, 21, 2>, <0, 21, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 19>, <1, 20, 15>, <2, 14, 24>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 21, 9>, <3, 5, 23>, <3, 9, 21>, <4, 10, 12>, <4, 8, 14>, <5, 19, 3>, <6, 18, 22>, <6, 18, 28>, <6, 25, ...
And so on.
