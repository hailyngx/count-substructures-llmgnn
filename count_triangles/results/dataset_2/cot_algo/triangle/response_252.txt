Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we'll follow the Degree-Based Ordering method.  
First, we'll sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices in increasing degree order: 0, 1, 8, 2, 6, 7, 5, 4, 9, 3

Next, we'll relabel the vertices accordingly:
0 -> 0 (degree 4)
1 -> 1 (degree 3)
8 -> 2 (degree 3)
2 -> 3 (degree 3)
6 -> 4 (degree 3)
7 -> 5 (degree 4)
5 -> 6 (degree 4)
4 -> 7 (degree 5)
9 -> 8 (degree 6)
3 -> 9 (degree 8)

We will now check the shared connections between edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

From the given edges:
(6, 9): No triangles since both 6 and 9 have fewer connections than 8.
(6, 5): <5, 6, 9>
(6, 4): <4, 6, 9>
(9, 2): No triangles since 2 has fewer connections than 9.
(9, 3): <3, 9, 1>
(9, 7): <7, 9, 5>
(1, 3): <1, 3, 0>
(1, 2): <1, 2, 0>
(1, 0): No triangles since 0 has fewer connections than 1.
(3, 9): <3, 9, 1>
(3, 1): <1, 3, 0>
(3, 7): <7, 3, 5>
(3, 0): <0, 3, 1>
(3, 5): <5, 3, 6>
(3, 8): No triangles since both 8 and 3 have the same number of connections.
(4, 6): <4, 6, 9>
(4, 8): No triangles since 8 has more connections than 4.
(4, 2): <2, 4, 1>
(4, 0): <0, 4, 1>
(4, 5): <5, 4, 6>
(8, 3): No triangles since both 3 and 8 have the same number of connections.
(8, 4): No triangles since 4 has more connections than 8.
(8, 7): <7, 8, 5>
(5, 6): <5, 6, 9>
(5, 3): <5, 3, 6>
(5, 4): <5, 4, 6>
(5, 0): <0, 5, 1>
(5, 7): <5, 7, 9>
(7, 9): <7, 9, 5>
(7, 3): <7, 3, 5>
(7, 8): <7, 8, 5>
(7, 5): <7, 5, 9>
(0, 1): <0, 1, 3>
(0, 3): <0, 3, 1>
(0, 4): <0, 4, 1>
(0, 5): <0, 5, 1>
(2, 9): No triangles since 2 has fewer connections than 9.
(2, 1): <1, 2, 0>
(2, 4): <2, 4, 1>
