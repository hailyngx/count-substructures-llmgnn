Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 14) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 14) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their corresponding number of connections:
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 2: 6 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 5 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 5 connections
- Node 10: 6 connections
- Node 11: 5 connections
- Node 12: 5 connections
- Node 13: 4 connections
- Node 14: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the order given in the input. Since the lower labeled vertex should have fewer connections, we will analyze the edges accordingly to count the number of triangles.

After analyzing all the edges and counting the triangles, we find that there are [6] triangles in total. The unique triangles are:
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 6, 12>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 6, 10>
- <2, 9, 14>
- <6, 10, 12>
