Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 3) (13, 1) (22, 16) (22, 0) (3, 13) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 20) (15, 3) (0, 22) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 12) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 6) (27, 8) (7, 6) (7, 23) (21, 5) (21, 17) (23, 7) (23, 18) (23, 25) (14, 0) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 9) (17, 21) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 11) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 1) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 10) (26, 20) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 2) (28, 20) (18, 23) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 25) (16, 22) (16, 28) (8, 27) (8, 19) (8, 24) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 1) (4, 12) (4, 6) (25, 0) (25, 23) (25, 18) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 29) (10, 3) (10, 26) (10, 19) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 19) (29, 27) (29, 11) (29, 6) (24, 8) (24, 5) (20, 3) (20, 26) (20, 28) (9, 14) (9, 2) (6, 27) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 29) (2, 28) (2, 9) (5, 21) (5, 18) (5, 24)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start counting the triangles.

[The total number of triangles is: [66]]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 12, 25>
<0, 14, 17>
<0, 14, 21>
<0, 14, 23>
<0, 17, 21>
<0, 17, 23>
<1, 12, 19>
<1, 13, 3>
<3, 10, 20>
<3, 13, 15>
<4, 6, 29>
<5, 18, 24>
<6, 7, 23>
<10, 19, 26>
<11, 14, 17>
<14, 17, 19>
<16, 20, 28>
<18, 23, 25>
<19, 21, 17>
<26, 8, 27>
