Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 6) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 8) (17, 18) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 15) (0, 5) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 19) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 1) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 10) (7, 16) (7, 10) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 6) (3, 4) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 15) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 15) (10, 14) (10, 9) (10, 7) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 12) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 1) (1, 0) (1, 19) (1, 12) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges:
- 0: {5, 1}
- 1: {0, 19, 12}
- 2: {5, 19}
- 3: {4}
- 4: {11, 3, 15}
- 5: {0, 2, 19, 15}
- 6: {16, 8, 18, 15}
- 7: {16, 10}
- 8: {16, 9, 17, 6}
- 9: {8, 18, 10}
- 10: {14, 9, 7}
- 11: {16, 4, 12}
- 12: {11, 14, 15, 1}
- 13: {15}
- 14: {12, 19, 10}
- 15: {13, 5, 4, 6, 12}
- 16: {11, 7, 8, 6}
- 17: {8, 18}
- 18: {17, 9, 6}
- 19: {14, 1, 2, 5}

After sorting the vertices by the number of connections:
0, 3, 13, 7, 2, 17, 18, 10, 9, 14, 1, 12, 19, 5, 15, 6, 16, 8, 4, 11

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Edges with lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
- Triangle 1: <8, 16, 6>
- Triangle 2: <1, 12, 19>
- Triangle 3: <1, 12, 15>
- Triangle 4: <0, 1, 12>
- Triangle 5: <0, 5, 15>
- Triangle 6: <5, 15, 19>
- Triangle 7: <16, 6, 8>
- Triangle 8: <6, 15, 16>
- Triangle 9: <10, 14, 19>
- Triangle 10: <10, 7, 16>
- Triangle 11: <10, 7, 10>
- Triangle 12: <14, 19, 2>
- Triangle 13: <14, 12, 1>

Total number of triangles: [13]
