Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 10) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 19) (14, 11) (14, 16) (17, 15) (17, 8) (17, 18) (2, 13) (2, 10) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 12) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 11) (1, 15) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 16) (19, 8) (19, 13) (16, 4) (16, 14) (16, 0) (16, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 2) (5, 3) (5, 18) (12, 18) (12, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method first requires sorting the vertices by their degrees in increasing order. 

Here is the list of vertices with their degrees:
(3: 2), (5: 2), (15: 3), (1: 4), (17: 4), (7: 4), (13: 4), (4: 4), (6: 4), (0: 5), (16: 5), (9: 2), (10: 3), (19: 2), (8: 3), (18: 3), (2: 2), (14: 2), (12: 2), (11: 3)

Now, we will label the vertices accordingly:
(3: 0), (5: 1), (15: 2), (1: 3), (17: 4), (7: 5), (13: 6), (4: 7), (6: 8), (0: 9), (16: 10), (9: 11), (10: 12), (19: 13), (8: 14), (18: 15), (2: 16), (14: 17), (12: 18), (11: 19)

Next, we will count the number of triangles by considering only those edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Triangles found: 
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 6, 10>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 6, 10>
<1, 2, 17>
<3, 4, 17>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 13>
<4, 8, 10>
<4, 11, 12>
<4, 16, 18>
<6, 7, 13>
<7, 9, 13>
<8, 13, 15>
<10, 11, 17>
<14, 16, 19>
<15, 17, 18>

Thus, the total number of triangles is [16].
