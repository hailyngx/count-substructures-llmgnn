The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 29) (22, 1) (4, 19) (4, 26) (7, 11) (7, 24) (7, 28) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 23) (27, 21) (27, 9) (27, 5) (23, 22) (23, 0) (23, 26) (23, 29) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 18) (6, 26) (9, 27) (9, 6) (9, 29) (8, 2) (15, 25) (15, 16) (20, 3) (20, 24) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 12) (28, 7) (28, 6) (28, 1) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 24) (18, 21) (3, 20) (3, 11) (3, 21) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 17) (14, 0) (14, 5) (5, 27) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 19) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 25) (19, 16) (21, 27) (21, 18) (21, 3) (17, 13) (17, 11) (17, 12) (29, 22) (29, 23) (29, 9) (29, 25) (12, 2) (12, 17) (26, 4) (26, 23) (26, 6) (26, 10) (10, 26) (10, 16) (16, 15) (16, 19) (16, 10) (24, 7) (24, 20) (24, 18) (25, 0) (25, 15) (25, 19) (25, 29) (1, 22) (1, 28) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps to count triangles efficiently in the given graph.

Let's first construct the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(13, 22), (13, 17), (22, 13), (22, 23), (22, 29), (22, 1), (4, 19), (4, 26), (7, 11), (7, 24), (7, 28), (0, 14), (0, 25), (0, 23), (27, 21), (27, 9), (27, 5), (23, 22), (23, 0), (23, 26), (23, 29), (6, 9), (6, 28), (6, 18), (6, 26), (9, 27), (9, 6), (9, 29), (8, 2), (15, 25), (15, 16), (20, 3), (20, 24), (2, 8), (2, 18), (2, 12), (28, 7), (28, 6), (28, 1), (18, 6), (18, 2), (18, 24), (18, 21), (3, 20), (3, 11), (3, 21), (11, 7), (11, 3), (11, 5), (11, 17), (14, 0), (14, 5), (5, 27), (5, 11), (5, 14), (5, 19), (19, 4), (19, 5), (19, 25), (19, 16), (21, 27), (21, 18), (21, 3), (17, 13), (17, 11), (17, 12), (29, 22), (29, 23), (29, 9), (29, 25), (12, 2), (12, 17), (26, 4), (26, 23), (26, 6), (26, 10), (10, 26), (10, 16), (16, 15), (16, 19), (16, 10), (24, 7), (24, 20), (24, 18), (25, 0), (25, 15), (25, 19), (25, 29), (1, 22), (1, 28)
```

Now, let's compute the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort the nodes based on the number of connections (degrees):
```
Nodes sorted by degrees: 12, 8, 14, 20, 10, 13, 1, 15, 4, 28, 3, 0, 7, 5, 24, 16, 18, 21, 9, 6, 2, 25, 19, 26, 27, 22, 11, 17, 23, 29
```

2. Proceed with each edge only if the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

3. Count the triangles formed. 

After counting, we find that there are a total of 12 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12]. 

The unique triangles found are:
1. <0, 5, 14>
2. <0, 5, 19>
3. <0, 19, 25>
4. <0, 23, 29>
5. <2, 8, 12>
6. <2, 12, 17>
7. <3, 11, 21>
8. <4, 19, 26>
9. <4, 5, 19>
10. <7, 11, 3>
11. <7, 24, 20>
12. <19, 25, 29>
