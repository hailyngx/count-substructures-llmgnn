Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 0), (9, 6), (9, 1), (9, 0), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 4), (1, 4), (1, 8), (3, 2), (4, 7), (7, 8), (8, 2), (0, 7), (0, 8)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their degree from least to most and relabel them accordingly:

- Node 3 (Degree 1)
- Node 2 (Degree 2)
- Node 5 (Degree 3)
- Node 1 (Degree 3)
- Node 4 (Degree 3)
- Node 7 (Degree 3)
- Node 0 (Degree 3)
- Node 9 (Degree 4)
- Node 8 (Degree 4)
- Node 6 (Degree 6)

Next, let's identify the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. For (3, 2):
   - No triangles

2. For (2, 5):
   - Triangle: <2, 5, 6>

3. For (5, 9):
   - Triangle: <5, 6, 9>

4. For (5, 6):
   - Triangle: <5, 6, 7>
   - Triangle: <5, 6, 8>
   - Triangle: <5, 6, 4>

5. For (0, 5):
   - Triangle: <0, 5, 6>
   - Triangle: <0, 5, 9>

6. For (0, 7):
   - Triangle: <0, 7, 8>

7. For (7, 8):
   - Triangle: <7, 8, 6>

Total number of triangles: [7]
Triangles found: <2, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 4>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 6>
