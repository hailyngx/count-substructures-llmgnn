Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 16) (9, 7) (14, 18) (14, 4) (17, 1) (17, 15) (10, 7) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 19) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 4) (1, 17) (1, 2) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 3) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 4) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 4) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 15) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (3, 12) (3, 18) (18, 14) (18, 11) (18, 5) (18, 3) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 15) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(6, 5), (6, 2), (9, 16), (9, 7), (14, 18), (14, 4), (17, 1), (17, 15), (10, 7), (11, 0), (11, 18), (11, 4), (8, 13), (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 12), (13, 8), (13, 5), (13, 19), (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 18), (5, 0), (5, 7), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 1), (2, 19), (2, 4), (1, 17), (1, 2), (12, 8), (12, 16), (12, 3), (16, 9), (16, 12), (16, 4), (15, 17), (15, 19), (15, 4), (19, 13), (19, 2), (19, 15), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 5), (0, 11), (0, 8), (0, 5), (3, 12), (3, 18), (18, 14), (18, 11), (18, 5), (18, 3), (4, 14), (4, 11), (4, 2), (4, 16), (4, 15)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:
Nodes based on degree: 3, 10, 1, 9, 17, 7, 19, 0, 6, 16, 12, 15, 18, 11, 14, 13, 8, 5, 2, 4

Now, we will count the number of triangles.
Triangles: 14
