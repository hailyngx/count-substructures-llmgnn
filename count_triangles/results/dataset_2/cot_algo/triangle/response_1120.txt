Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (5, 1) (5, 12) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 14) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) 
(9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) 
(1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) 
(3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) 
(4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) 
(8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) 
(5, 1) (5, 12) 
(0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 2) 
(7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) 
(2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) 
(12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) 
(11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) 
(14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 10) 
(10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 14) 
(13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 2)

After sorting the nodes by degree:
Nodes: 7, 0, 5, 6, 13, 3, 2, 12, 11, 9, 10, 1, 4, 8, 14
