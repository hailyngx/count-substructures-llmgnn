Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 23) (26, 27) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 8) (15, 5) (27, 26) (27, 15) (27, 22) (27, 1) (4, 13) (4, 29) (7, 29) (7, 5) (1, 27) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 17) (3, 10) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 12) (25, 21) (25, 18) (25, 24) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 14) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 8) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 24) (18, 25) (18, 5) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 21) (28, 11) (28, 19) (12, 25) (12, 6) (12, 22) (23, 9) (23, 15) (23, 19) (19, 2) (19, 28) (19, 23) (19, 22) (19, 16) (22, 27) (22, 12) (22, 19) (29, 4) (29, 7) (29, 6) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 29) (6, 14) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 24) (14, 16) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 18) (13, 4) (13, 1) (16, 19) (16, 14) (16, 8) (8, 15) (8, 20) (8, 17) (8, 16) (0, 1) (0, 17) (24, 25) (24, 2) (24, 14) (21, 25) (21, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly and count the triangles by checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge.

After sorting the vertices by their degrees, we have the following new labels for the nodes:
Node 16 (degree 2)
Node 9 (degree 2)
Node 28 (degree 2)
Node 0 (degree 3)
Node 3 (degree 3)
Node 7 (degree 3)
Node 18 (degree 3)
Node 21 (degree 3)
Node 24 (degree 3)
Node 26 (degree 3)
Node 5 (degree 4)
Node 6 (degree 4)
Node 12 (degree 4)
Node 20 (degree 4)
Node 22 (degree 4)
Node 29 (degree 4)
Node 2 (degree 5)
Node 4 (degree 5)
Node 11 (degree 5)
Node 1 (degree 6)
Node 13 (degree 6)
Node 14 (degree 6)
Node 19 (degree 6)
Node 25 (degree 6)
Node 10 (degree 7)
Node 15 (degree 7)
Node 17 (degree 7)
Node 8 (degree 8)
Node 27 (degree 8)

Now, we will construct triangles by checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge. 

The total number of triangles is [20].
The unique triangles found are <3, 10, 17>, <6, 14, 16>, <6, 12, 22>, <6, 12, 25>, <10, 14, 16>, <10, 17, 27>, <10, 17, 1>, <11, 20, 25>, <13, 1, 27>, <14, 16, 19>, <14, 16, 24>, <14, 24, 25>, <17, 1, 27>, <18, 5, 15>, <19, 16, 22>, <19, 16, 25>, <19, 28, 11>, <19, 23, 15>, <19, 23, 28>, and <22, 12, 25>.
