Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are as follows:
Node 0: 0 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Checking the edges with the vertices with lower labels:
1. Edge (0, 3) - No triangles found.
2. Edge (3, 2) - No triangles found.
3. Edge (3, 0) - No triangles found.
4. Edge (1, 0) - No triangles found.
5. Edge (0, 4) - No triangles found.
6. Edge (4, 8) - No triangles found.
7. Edge (8, 2) - No triangles found.
8. Edge (2, 5) - Found triangle <2, 5, 1>.
9. Edge (5, 9) - Found triangle <5, 9, 7>.
10. Edge (7, 6) - Found triangle <7, 6, 1>.
11. Edge (6, 8) - No triangles found.
12. Edge (8, 4) - Found triangle <8, 4, 0>.
13. Edge (4, 9) - Found triangle <4, 9, 5>.
14. Edge (9, 5) - Found triangle <9, 5, 2>.
15. Edge (5, 1) - Found triangle <5, 1, 4>.
16. Edge (1, 6) - Found triangle <1, 6, 3>.
17. Edge (6, 9) - Found triangle <6, 9, 7>.
18. Edge (9, 7) - Found triangle <9, 7, 5>.
19. Edge (7, 5) - Found triangle <7, 5, 1>.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <2, 5, 1>, <5, 9, 7>, <7, 6, 1>, <8, 4, 0>, <4, 9, 5>, <6, 9, 7>.
