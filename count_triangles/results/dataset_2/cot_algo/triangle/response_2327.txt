Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps to efficiently count triangles in the graph provided. 

Nodes sorted by their degrees:
Node 7: degree 1
Node 5: degree 4
Node 2: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 0: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 1: degree 6

Edges considered with lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
1. Edge: (5, 4) (Node 5 and Node 4 share Node 0) Triangle: <0, 4, 5>
2. Edge: (5, 6) (Node 5 and Node 6 share Node 0) Triangle: <0, 5, 6>
3. Edge: (5, 7) (Node 5 and Node 7 share no new connections)
4. Edge: (5, 9) (Node 5 and Node 9 share Node 1) Triangle: <1, 5, 9>
5. Edge: (9, 6) (Node 9 and Node 6 share Node 0) Triangle: <0, 6, 9>
6. Edge: (9, 8) (Node 9 and Node 8 share Node 1) Triangle: <1, 8, 9>
7. Edge: (9, 3) (Node 9 and Node 3 share Node 1) Triangle: <1, 3, 9>
8. Edge: (4, 5) (Node 4 and Node 5 share Node 0) Triangle: <0, 4, 5>
9. Edge: (4, 0) (Node 4 and Node 0 share no new connections)
10. Edge: (4, 1) (Node 4 and Node 1 share Node 0) Triangle: <0, 1, 4>
11. Edge: (7, 5) (Node 7 and Node 5 share no new connections)
12. Edge: (1, 9) (Node 1 and Node 9 share Node 5) Triangle: <1, 5, 9>
13. Edge: (1, 4) (Node 1 and Node 4 share Node 0) Triangle:<0, 1, 4>
14. Edge: (1, 3) (Node 1 and Node 3 share Node 9) Triangle: <1, 3, 9>
15. Edge: (3, 9) (Node 3 and Node 9 share Node 1) Triangle: <1, 3, 9>
16. Edge: (3, 4) (Node 3 and Node 4 share Node 0) Triangle: <0, 3, 4>
17. Edge: (6, 5) (Node 6 and Node 5 share Node 0) Triangle: <0, 5, 6>
18. Edge: (6, 9) (Node 6 and Node 9 share Node 0) Triangle: <0, 6, 9>
19. Edge: (6, 3) (Node 6 and Node 3 share Node 9) Triangle: <3, 6, 9>
20. Edge: (2, 6) (Node 2 and Node 6 share Node 0) Triangle: <0, 2, 6>
21. Edge: (2, 8) (Node 2 and Node 8 share no new connections)
22. Edge: (2, 0) (Node 2 and Node 0 share no new connections)
23. Edge: (8, 9) (Node 8 and Node 9 share Node 1) Triangle: <1, 8, 9>
24. Edge: (8, 1) (Node 8 and Node 1 share Node 4) Triangle: <1, 4, 8>
25. Edge: (8, 2) (Node 8 and Node 2 share no new connections)
26. Edge: (0, 4) (Node 0 and Node 4 share no new connections)
27. Edge: (0, 1) (Node 0 and Node 1 share no new connections)
28. Edge: (0, 6) (Node 0 and Node 6 share no new connections)
29. Edge: (0, 2) (Node 0 and Node 2 share no new connections)
30. Edge: (0, 8) (Node 0 and Node 8 share no new connections)
