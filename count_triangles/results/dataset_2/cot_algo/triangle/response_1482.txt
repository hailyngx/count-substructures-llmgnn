Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 15) (0, 29) (27, 4) (27, 18) (27, 2) (7, 21) (7, 19) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 9) (18, 27) (18, 9) (18, 20) (22, 19) (22, 6) (22, 3) (1, 26) (1, 29) (1, 5) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 17) (2, 27) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 17) (11, 28) (28, 11) (28, 12) (28, 23) (24, 26) (24, 3) (24, 12) (24, 13) (4, 27) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 3) (10, 8) (10, 13) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 14) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 23) (19, 7) (19, 22) (19, 15) (19, 5) (9, 21) (9, 18) (9, 8) (9, 20) (6, 21) (6, 22) (6, 29) (6, 23) (17, 26) (17, 8) (17, 16) (29, 0) (29, 1) (29, 6) (23, 28) (23, 5) (23, 6) (23, 25) (23, 12) (3, 22) (3, 24) (3, 4) (14, 2) (14, 15) (14, 20) (16, 4) (16, 17) (20, 18) (20, 9) (20, 14) (12, 28) (12, 24) (12, 23) (13, 24) (13, 10) (25, 23) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed based on the given nodes and edges. The next step is to count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method as described.

Sorted vertices based on the number of connections are as follows:
(5 connections) - 25
(4 connections) - 0, 1, 7, 11, 15, 16, 18, 20
(3 connections) - 3, 6, 13, 19, 24, 26, 28, 29
(2 connections) - 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 21, 22, 23, 27

Triangles found:
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 27>
<2, 8, 17>
<2, 8, 9>
<2, 14, 15>
<2, 18, 27>
<3, 4, 27>
<4, 8, 17>
<5, 19, 23>
<6, 21, 23>
