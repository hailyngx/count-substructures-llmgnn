Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:  

Node 0: 4 connections  
Node 1: 4 connections  
Node 8: 4 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 6: 4 connections  
Node 5: 4 connections  
Node 9: 5 connections  
Node 4: 5 connections  
Node 3: 5 connections  
Node 2: 5 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:  

Triangles:  

<0, 1, 2>  
<0, 1, 9>  
<0, 2, 3>  
<0, 2, 7>  
<0, 3, 6>  
<0, 6, 7>  
<1, 2, 3>  
<1, 2, 9>  
<2, 3, 7>  
<2, 7, 8>  
<3, 7, 9>  

Total number of triangles: [11]
