Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 11) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 2) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 2) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 13) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are:  
(9, 5, 15, 14, 10, 11, 12, 2, 0, 8, 13, 7, 6, 4, 1)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the edges:

1. Edge (6, 12): No triangle is formed.
2. Edge (6, 4): Triangle <4, 6, 12>.

21. Edge (13, 3): No triangle is formed.
22. Edge (13, 1): No triangle is formed.
23. Edge (13, 10): Triangle <4, 13, 10>.
24. Edge (0, 6): No triangle is formed.
25. Edge (0, 14): No triangle is formed.
26. Edge (0, 3): No triangle is formed.
27. Edge (0, 11): Triangle <0, 4, 11>.
28. Edge (0, 12): No triangle is formed.
29. Edge (0, 2): No triangle is formed.
30. Edge (14, 0): No triangle is formed.
31. Edge (14, 2): No triangle is formed.
32. Edge (3, 13): No triangle is formed.
33. Edge (3, 0): No triangle is formed.
34. Edge (3, 12): No triangle is formed.
35. Edge (11, 9): No triangle is formed.
36. Edge (11, 4): Triangle <4, 6, 11>.
37. Edge (11, 0): Triangle <0, 4, 11>.
38. Edge (11, 2): No triangle is formed.
39. Edge (2, 0): No triangle is formed.

44. Edge (2, 1): No triangle is formed.
45. Edge (12, 6): No triangle is formed.
46. Edge (12, 0): No triangle is formed.
47. Edge (12, 3): No triangle is formed.
48. Edge (12, 2): Triangle <2, 0, 12>.
49. Edge (12, 1): No triangle is formed.
50. Edge (5, 8): No triangle is formed.
51. Edge (5, 2): No triangle is formed.
52. Edge (5, 1): No triangle is formed.
53. Edge (1, 8): No triangle is formed.
