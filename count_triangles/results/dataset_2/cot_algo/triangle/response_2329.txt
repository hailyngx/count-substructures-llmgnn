Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 24) (22, 17) (22, 8) (9, 26) (9, 19) (9, 11) (9, 3) (26, 9) (26, 10) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 24) (2, 17) (29, 2) (29, 8) (0, 20) (0, 4) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 19) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 5) (8, 22) (8, 2) (8, 29) (8, 14) (21, 28) (21, 16) (21, 11) (21, 25) (28, 21) (28, 1) (28, 12) (4, 0) (4, 18) (4, 23) (18, 4) (18, 14) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 23) (5, 13) (5, 15) (7, 20) (7, 25) (7, 16) (25, 21) (25, 7) (25, 11) (10, 26) (10, 15) (10, 3) (17, 22) (17, 2) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 19) (16, 21) (16, 7) (12, 28) (12, 11) (19, 9) (19, 20) (19, 15) (19, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 27) (23, 4) (23, 6) (23, 27) (11, 9) (11, 21) (11, 25) (11, 12) (27, 3) (27, 23) (1, 28) (24, 22) (24, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to first sort the nodes based on their degree. Here is the sorted list of nodes with their degrees:
0 - 4 edges
1 - 1 edge
4 - 3 edges
5 - 2 edges
6 - 3 edges
7 - 3 edges
8 - 4 edges
9 - 4 edges
10 - 3 edges
11 - 4 edges
12 - 2 edges
13 - 4 edges
14 - 3 edges 
15 - 4 edges
16 - 3 edges
17 - 2 edges
18 - 2 edges
19 - 4 edges
20 - 4 edges
21 - 4 edges
22 - 4 edges
23 - 3 edges
24 - 3 edges
25 - 3 edges
26 - 2 edges
27 - 2 edges
28 - 3 edges
29 - 3 edges

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:
- Edge (13, 22) forms a triangle with node 8: <13, 22, 8>
- Edge (13, 5) forms a triangle with node 15: <13, 5, 15>
- Edge (13, 3) does not form a triangle as node 13 already has more connections than node 3
- Edge (13, 6) does not form a triangle as node 13 already has more connections than node 6
- Edge (22, 24) forms a triangle with node 8: <22, 24, 8>
- Edge (22, 17) forms a triangle with node 2: <22, 17, 2>
- Edge (22, 8) does not form a triangle as node 22 already has more connections than node 8
- Edge (9, 26) forms a triangle with node 10: <9, 26, 10>
- Edge (9, 19) forms a triangle with node 14: <9, 19, 14>
- Edge (9, 11) forms a triangle with node 3: <9, 11, 3>
- Edge (9, 3) does not form a triangle as node 9 already has more connections than node 3
- Edge (26, 10) does not form a triangle as node 26 already has more connections than node 10 
- Edge (2, 29) forms a triangle with node 8: <2, 29, 8>
- Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle as node 2 already has more connections than node 8
- Edge (2, 6) does not form a triangle as node 2 already has more connections than node 6
- Edge (2, 24) forms a triangle with node 22: <2, 24, 22>
- Edge (2, 17) does not form a triangle as node 2 already has more connections than node 17 
- Edge (29, 8) does not form a triangle as node 29 already has more connections than node 8 
- Edge (0, 20) forms a triangle with node 4: <0, 20, 4>

After calculating all possible triangles, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
