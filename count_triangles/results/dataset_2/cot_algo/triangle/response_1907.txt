Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 3) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: <2, 1, 10, 12, 0, 14, 3, 6, 13, 9, 7, 11, 5, 8, 4>.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles:

[Number of triangles: 24]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
