Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections and then proceeding through the edges while checking for shared connections to count triangles. 

Here is the list of unique triangles found and the total number of triangles in the given graph: 

Vertices sorted by the number of connections (degree):
(6, 4), (5, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (1, 5), (9, 5), (0, 5), (2, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6)

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 4, 5>

Total number of triangles: [3]
