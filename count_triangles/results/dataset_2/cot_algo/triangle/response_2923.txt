Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: {3, 6, 8, 4, 2}
- 1: {3, 6, 2, 8, 7}
- 2: {1, 7, 0, 4}
- 3: {1, 0, 7, 4, 8}
- 4: {5, 3, 6, 0, 2}
- 5: {6, 4}
- 6: {5, 1, 4, 0}
- 7: {9, 1, 3, 8, 2}
- 8: {1, 3, 0, 7}
- 9: {7}

Now, let's proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Nodes by degree: 9, 5, 2, 0, 7, 8, 6, 1, 3, 4

Now, we will list the triangles found:
[Total number of triangles: 6]
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 7, 2>
<3, 1, 7>
<4, 2, 7>
