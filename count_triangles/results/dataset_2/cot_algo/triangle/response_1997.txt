Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 0) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 3) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 6) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 5) (9, 13) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree and then checking for triangles in a specific order. Let's follow the process step by step:

1. Sort the vertices by their degrees from least to most:
   - Node 7: degree = 1
   - Node 9: degree = 1
   - Node 10: degree = 3
   - Node 14: degree = 3
   - Node 1: degree = 4
   - Node 8: degree = 4
   - Node 12: degree = 4
   - Node 5: degree = 5
   - Node 6: degree = 5
   - Node 13: degree = 6
   - Node 3: degree = 6
   - Node 0: degree = 7
   - Node 11: degree = 7
   - Node 2: degree = 7
   - Node 4: degree = 7

2. Relabel the vertices in ascending order of their degrees:
   - Node 7: 0
   - Node 9: 1
   - Node 10: 2
   - Node 14: 3
   - Node 1: 4
   - Node 8: 5
   - Node 12: 6
   - Node 5: 7
   - Node 6: 8
   - Node 13: 9
   - Node 3: 10
   - Node 0: 11
   - Node 11: 12
   - Node 2: 13
   - Node 4: 14

3. Check the edges in the order of the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections.

Now, let's count the triangles and provide the results:

Total Number of Triangles: [12]
Unique Triangles Found:

<0, 3, 10>
<0, 5, 10>
<2, 5, 11>
<2, 8, 14>
<3, 10, 13>
