Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 6) (0, 10) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 1) (7, 3) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 6) (13, 14) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 13), (1, 3), (1, 7), (1, 11), (1, 14), (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 12), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 11), (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 12), (4, 14), (5, 11), (6, 8), (6, 12), (6, 13), (6, 14), (7, 3), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 6), (9, 10), (9, 12), (10, 12), (10, 13), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes by degree: 8 > 2 > 6 > 1 > 7 > 0 > 4 > 9 > 5 > 3 > 11 > 12 > 10 > 13 > 14

Next, we will count the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

There are 8 triangles in the graph.
[8]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 13>
<0, 6, 14>
<4, 6, 12>
<4, 9, 12>
<6, 12, 13>
<6, 12, 14>
<9, 12, 13>
