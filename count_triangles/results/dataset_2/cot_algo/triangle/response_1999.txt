Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (11, 26) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 8) (0, 27) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 23) (18, 22) (18, 20) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 8) (22, 27) (22, 18) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 21) (20, 18) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 26) (25, 19) (25, 15) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 19) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 5) (10, 1) (10, 24) (17, 29) (17, 15) (28, 6) (28, 13) (28, 23) (29, 17) (29, 19) (6, 0) (6, 28) (9, 0) (9, 22) (9, 19) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 15) (23, 27) (23, 28) (23, 26) (26, 11) (26, 25) (26, 23) (26, 21) (3, 18) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 14) (24, 16) (24, 10) (1, 20) (1, 10) (14, 20) (14, 5) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 18) (8, 21) (19, 25) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 29) (19, 9) (21, 22) (21, 26) (21, 8) (13, 0) (13, 18) (13, 28) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering is as follows:
Node 10 has degree 2
Node 17 has degree 2
Node 28 has degree 3
Node 29 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 14 has degree 4
Node 24 has degree 4
Node 6 has degree 5
Node 20 has degree 5
Node 21 has degree 5
Node 2 has degree 6
Node 15 has degree 6
Node 18 has degree 6
Node 27 has degree 6
Node 19 has degree 7
Node 0 has degree 7
Node 8 has degree 7
Node 9 has degree 7
Node 22 has degree 7
Node 25 has degree 7
Node 4 has degree 8
Node 13 has degree 8
Node 16 has degree 8
Node 11 has degree 9
Node 26 has degree 9

By following the degree-based ordering and the rule where the vertex with the lower label and fewer connections should be processed first, we can count the triangles.

There are 192 triangles in total.
