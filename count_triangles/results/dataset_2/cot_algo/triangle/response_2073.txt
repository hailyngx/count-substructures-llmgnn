Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows: 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 11), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 10), (2, 12), (3, 7), (3, 14), (4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 13), (5, 6), (5, 14), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 13), (8, 11), (8, 13), (9, 13), (9, 14), (10, 13), (10, 14), (11, 12), (12, 13), (12, 14)

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted by degree:
1. 1 (degree 2)
2. 3 (degree 2)
3. 5 (degree 2)
4. 9 (degree 2)
5. 10 (degree 2)
6. 11 (degree 2)
7. 4 (degree 5)
8. 7 (degree 5)
9. 2 (degree 6)
10. 12 (degree 4)
11. 6 (degree 6)
12. 0 (degree 7)
13. 8 (degree 7)
14. 13 (degree 9)
15. 14 (degree 6)

Calculating the number of triangles:
- For each edge, we only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. We need to check shared connections for each pair of vertices with an edge between them.
