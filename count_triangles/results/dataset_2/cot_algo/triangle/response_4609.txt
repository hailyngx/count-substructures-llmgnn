Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: 5, 4, 3, 1
- 1: 4, 8, 0, 2
- 2: 7, 1, 3
- 3: 7, 8, 0, 2
- 4: 9, 7, 8, 6, 0, 1
- 5: 9, 8, 0
- 6: 4, 8
- 7: 9, 4, 3, 2, 8
- 8: 5, 4, 7, 6, 3, 1
- 9: 5, 4, 7

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Reorder the nodes based on the number of connections:
Nodes: 0, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 3, 7, 8, 4

Now, follow the step of checking shared connections for each edge starting from the edges with vertices with lower labels and fewer connections.

Triangles:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <1, 2, 7>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <4, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [10]
