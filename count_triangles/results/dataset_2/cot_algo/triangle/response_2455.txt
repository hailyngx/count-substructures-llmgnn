Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the nodes based on the number of connections each node has:

Nodes: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
Degrees: (3, 2, 3, 5, 5, 4, 6, 5, 2, 3)

The sorted nodes with their degrees are: (1, 2, 8), (0, 9), (5), (3), (7), (4), (6)

Now, we will go through each edge in the order specified and count the triangles formed:

1. Edge (4, 7): Node 4 has 5 connections, Node 7 has 5 connections, both have 3 shared connections (3, 6, 9).
2. Edge (4, 9): Node 4 has 5 connections, Node 9 has 3 connections, both have 2 shared connections (3, 6).
3. Edge (4, 3): Node 4 has 5 connections, Node 3 has 5 connections, both have 2 shared connections (0, 6).
4. Edge (4, 1): Node 4 has 5 connections, Node 1 has 2 connections, no triangles.
5. Edge (4, 6): Node 4 has 5 connections, Node 6 has 6 connections, both have 3 shared connections (3, 5, 7).

The total number of triangles is [3].

The unique triangles found are: 
<3, 4, 6> 
<3, 4, 7> 
<6, 4, 7>
