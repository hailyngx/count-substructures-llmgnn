Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 17) (8, 14) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 18) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 16) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 17) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 9) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 19) (16, 13) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 18) (11, 17) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 1) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 17) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 15) (9, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 13) (17, 2) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 18) 

Response:
The vertices by their number of connections are:
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 15: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 4
Node 16: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 17: Degree 5
Node 18: Degree 5
Node 19: Degree 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices should be labeled as follows:
Node 9: Label 1
Node 5: Label 2
Node 6: Label 3
Node 15: Label 4
Node 7: Label 5
Node 12: Label 6
Node 3: Label 7
Node 14: Label 8
Node 2: Label 9
Node 0: Label 10
Node 10: Label 11
Node 13: Label 12
Node 16: Label 13
Node 1: Label 14
Node 4: Label 15
Node 11: Label 16
Node 8: Label 17
Node 17: Label 18
Node 18: Label 19
Node 19: Label 20

Using the labeled nodes, the triangles found are:
<0, 4, 17>
<0, 4, 18>
<0, 10, 19>
<1, 4, 13>
<1, 4, 14>
<1, 7, 11>
<1, 7, 17>
<2, 3, 16>
<2, 3, 8>
<4, 12, 16>
<4, 1, 14>
<5, 11, 18>
<6, 5, 11>
<10, 0, 18>

The total number of triangles is [13].
