Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 7), (9, 5), (9, 2), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 3), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 3), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 3), (8, 5), (8, 2), (8, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 0), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 3), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 0), (0, 9), (0, 1), (0, 3)

Now let's label the nodes based on their degrees in non-decreasing order:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 5: degree 7

Since we have edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections than the higher labeled vertex, we can now count the number of triangles by checking for shared connections:

Number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 6>
