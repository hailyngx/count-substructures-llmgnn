Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles is as follows:

Nodes sorted by their number of connections (degree):
Node 4 < Node 8 < Node 0 < Node 7 < Node 1 < Node 5 < Node 6 < Node 3 < Node 9 < Node 2

Using the sorted nodes and the given edges, we can count the number of triangles present in the graph. The total number of triangles is [8].

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 0, 4>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 8>
