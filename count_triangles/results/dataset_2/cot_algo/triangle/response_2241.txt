Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}
Edges: [(0, 10), (0, 1), (0, 25), (1, 4), (1, 24), (2, 9), (2, 13), (2, 24), (3, 7), (3, 29), (6, 15), (6, 22), (7, 12), (9, 11), (9, 24), (10, 17), (13, 20), (13, 29), (14, 26), (14, 23), (15, 11), (15, 28), (16, 18), (16, 4), (17, 10), (18, 20), (18, 29), (19, 12), (19, 28), (20, 25), (21, 12), (21, 27), (22, 6), (23, 14), (23, 28), (23, 24), (27, 21), (27, 23), (27, 4), (28, 11), (28, 15)]

Using Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by degree: [17, 6, 7, 0, 5, 16, 10, 22, 9, 14, 21, 18, 13, 20, 19, 29, 12, 24, 8, 4, 26, 3, 15, 27, 11, 25, 2, 1, 23]
Edges to consider: [(0, 10), (0, 1), (0, 25), (1, 4), (1, 24), (2, 9), (2, 13), (2, 24), (3, 7), (3, 29), (6, 15), (6, 22), (7, 12), (9, 11), (9, 24), (10, 17), (13, 20), (13, 29), (14, 26), (14, 23), (15, 11), (15, 28), (16, 18), (16, 4), (17, 10), (18, 20), (18, 29), (19, 12), (19, 28), (20, 25), (21, 12), (21, 27), (22, 6), (23, 14), (23, 28), (23, 24), (27, 21), (27, 23), (27, 4), (28, 11), (28, 15)]

Calculating triangles:
Total number of triangles: [14]
Unique triangles: <0, 10, 25>, <0, 1, 24>, <0, 10, 17>, <1, 4, 24>, <2, 9, 24>, <2, 13, 24>, <2, 13, 29>, <6, 15, 22>, <7, 12, 21>, <9, 11, 24>, <13, 20, 29>, <14, 23, 26>, <15, 11, 28>, <18, 20, 29>
