Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 15) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 18) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 14) (2, 7) (2, 14) (18, 13) (18, 1) (0, 19) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 5) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 8) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 5) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 1) (1, 16) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 1) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 12) (17, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
(0, 19), 
(1, 9), (1, 12), (1, 16), (1, 18), 
(2, 7), (2, 14), 
(3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 11), 
(4, 7), (4, 9), 
(5, 14), (5, 15), (5, 19), 
(6, 10), (6, 12), 
(7, 2), 
(8, 3), (8, 13), (8, 14), (8, 17), 
(9, 1), (9, 4), 
(10, 6), (10, 14), (10, 19), 
(11, 3), (11, 4), (11, 10), (11, 16), 
(12, 1), (12, 6), (12, 15), 
(13, 8), (13, 18), (13, 19), 
(14, 2), (14, 5), (14, 8), (14, 10), 
(15, 5), (15, 12), (15, 16), 
(16, 1), (16, 11), (16, 15), 
(17, 8), 
(18, 1), (18, 13), 
(19, 0), (19, 5), (19, 8), (19, 10), (19, 13)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their number of connections:
Nodes with fewer connections come first. If two nodes have the same number of connections, we sort them based on their indices.

Sorted nodes: 
0, 17, 2, 9, 12, 13, 15, 18, 7, 5, 6, 3, 16, 1, 10, 14, 19, 4, 11, 8

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Check each edge where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found:
<1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 9, 4>, <3, 4, 11>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 8, 11>, <4, 9, 11>, <5, 14, 10>, <5, 14, 8>, <5, 14, 2>, <5, 14, 19>, <6, 10, 14>, <7, 2, 14>, <8, 3, 11>, <8, 3, 4>, <8, 3, 13>, <8, 3, 19>, <8, 4, 9>, <8, 4, 11>, <8, 9, 19>, <8, 10, 14>, <8, 13, 19>, <8, 14, 10>, <8, 14, 5>, <9, 4, 11>, <10, 6, 12>, <10, 14, 5>, <10, 14, 8>, <10, 14, 19>, <11, 3, 4>, <12, 6, 10>, <12, 6, 15>, <13, 8, 19>, <14, 2, 7>, <14, 2, 5>, <14, 2, 19>, <14, 5, 19>, <14, 5, 15>, <15, 5, 12>, <15, 12, 1>, <16, 1, 11>, <18, 1, 13>, <19, 0, 5>, <19, 5, 15>, <19, 10, 14>, <19, 13, 8>

Total number of triangles: [51]
