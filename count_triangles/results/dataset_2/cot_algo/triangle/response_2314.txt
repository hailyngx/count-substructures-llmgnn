Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Let's follow the steps to find the total number of triangles in the graph.

**Step 1:** Sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections).

| Vertex | Degree |
|--------|--------|
|   1    |   2    |
|   8    |   2    |
|   0    |   4    |
|   6    |   4    |
|   7    |   4    |
|   8    |   4    |
|   9    |   5    |
|   4    |   5    |
|   2    |   5    |
|   3    |   6    |
|   5    |   6    |

**Step 2:** Relabel the vertices accordingly:

| Vertex | New Label |
|--------|-----------|
|   1    |     0     |
|   8    |     1     |
|   0    |     2     |
|   6    |     3     |
|   7    |     4     |
|   8    |     5     |
|   9    |     6     |
|   4    |     7     |
|   2    |     8     |
|   3    |     9     |
|   5    |     10    |

**Step 3:** Check for triangles based on the sorted vertices. Count the triangles and list them out:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 9, 3>
6. Triangle <2, 9, 4>
7. Triangle <2, 9, 5>
8. Triangle <2, 4, 3>
9. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
10. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
11. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
12. Triangle <2, 5, 7>
13. Triangle <2, 5, 3>
14. Triangle <4, 7, 5>
15. Triangle <3, 7, 5>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is **15** as shown below:
