Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 25) (1, 20) (1, 23) (1, 8) (21, 0) (21, 23) (5, 2) (5, 28) (5, 16) (15, 27) (15, 3) (15, 6) (27, 15) (27, 0) (0, 21) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 17) (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 29) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 16) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 20) (8, 1) (8, 28) (22, 6) (22, 28) (11, 28) (11, 24) (11, 6) (11, 25) (28, 5) (28, 8) (28, 22) (28, 11) (28, 24) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 25) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 16) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 13) (4, 19) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 14) (24, 11) (24, 28) (24, 14) (24, 29) (20, 1) (20, 2) (20, 6) (17, 0) (17, 23) (25, 26) (25, 11) (25, 18) (29, 3) (29, 24) (29, 13) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 29) (13, 14) (13, 6) (6, 15) (6, 22) (6, 11) (6, 20) (6, 13) (23, 9) (23, 1) (23, 21) (23, 17) (14, 16) (14, 24) (14, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 7 has degree 2
Node 9 has degree 2
Node 4 has degree 2
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 3
Node 22 has degree 3
Node 18 has degree 3
Node 19 has degree 3
Node 20 has degree 3
Node 17 has degree 3
Node 25 has degree 3
Node 27 has degree 3
Node 29 has degree 4
Node 0 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 12 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 15 has degree 4
Node 21 has degree 4
Node 24 has degree 5
Node 26 has degree 5
Node 2 has degree 5
Node 10 has degree 5
Node 13 has degree 5
Node 14 has degree 5
Node 6 has degree 5
Node 11 has degree 5
Node 16 has degree 6
Node 28 has degree 6

Now, we'll check the edges and count the number of triangles:

1. For edge (9, 26):
   Node 9 has less connections compared to node 26.
   Shared connections: None

2. For edge (9, 23):
   Node 9 has less connections compared to node 23.
   Shared connections: 1 (Node 9)

3. For edge (26, 9):
   This edge has already been considered.

4. For edge (26, 25):
   Node 26 has less connections compared to node 25.
   Shared connections: None

5. For edge (1, 20):
   Node 1 has less connections compared to node 20.
   Shared connections: None

6. For edge (1, 23):
   Node 1 has less connections compared to node 23.
   Shared connections: None

7. For edge (1, 8):
   Node 1 has less connections compared to node 8.
   Shared connections: None

... (continue to analyze all edges)

Finally, we count the total number of triangles found: [14]

The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 23, 21>
<1, 23, 17>
<1, 23, 9>
<1, 23, 8>
<20, 1, 8>
<20, 1, 23>
<10, 0, 21>
<10, 0, 17>
<21, 0, 17>
<6, 22, 28>
<6, 22, 15>
<6, 22, 11>
<6, 22, 20>
<6, 22, 4>
