Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 8), (5, 0), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 6), (4, 3), (4, 2), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 2), (7, 1), (1, 7), (1, 3), (3, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 8), (6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 2), (6, 0), (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 8), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 6)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to find the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found:

1. Sorted Vertex List based on degree:
[1, 5, 6, 0, 7, 8, 2, 3, 9, 4]

2. Counting Triangles:
Triangles: [21]

Unique triangles:
<3, 1, 7>
<2, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<7, 1, 3>
<4, 6, 2>
<2, 3, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 2>
<1, 7, 4>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 3>
<6, 9, 4>
