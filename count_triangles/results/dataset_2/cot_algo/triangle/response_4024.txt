This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 7) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 14) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 10), (1, 12), (3, 1), (3, 5), (10, 1), (10, 11), (10, 6), (10, 8), (10, 7), (10, 9), (11, 10), (11, 13), (8, 10), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 14), (13, 11), (13, 4), (13, 9), (4, 8), (4, 13), (4, 9), (4, 5), (2, 8), (2, 12), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 0), (0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 5), (7, 10), (7, 2), (7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 1), (6, 10), (6, 2), (6, 7), (12, 1), (12, 2), (12, 14), (12, 9), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 2), (5, 0), (5, 7), (14, 8), (14, 12), (14, 9), (9, 10), (9, 13), (9, 4), (9, 12), (9, 14)

Let's now find the triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices ordered by degree:
0(4), 1(4), 3(2), 6(4), 8(4), 12(4), 13(3), 2(6), 4(6), 5(6), 7(6), 10(7), 9(6), 11(2), 14(4)

Triangles in the graph are as follows:
