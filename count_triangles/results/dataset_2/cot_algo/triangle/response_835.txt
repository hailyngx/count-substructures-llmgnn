Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 7) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 8) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 12) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 3) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. Here is the list of vertices sorted by degree:
(4, 2), (13, 2), (14, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (9, 4), (5, 5), (8, 5), (10, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (11, 5), (12, 6), (3, 6)

Now, we will analyze the edges based on the lower-labeled vertex having fewer connections:

1. (5, 8): No triangles
2. (5, 12): Triangle <5, 12, 9>
3. (5, 11): No triangles
4. (5, 0): No triangles
5. (5, 7): Triangle <5, 7, 12>
6. (9, 6): No triangles
7. (9, 2): No triangles
8. (9, 1): No triangles
9. (9, 12): Triangle <9, 12, 5>
10. (6, 14): No triangles
11. (6, 10): Triangle <6, 10, 0>
12. (10, 0): No triangles
13. (10, 3): Triangle <10, 3, 4>
14. (10, 7): Triangle <10, 7, 5>
15. (11, 6): Triangle <11, 6, 2>
16. (11, 14): No triangles
17. (11, 7): Triangle <11, 7, 5>
18. (8, 13): No triangles
19. (8, 3): No triangles
20. (13, 12): No triangles
21. (4, 1): No triangles
22. (7, 10): No triangles
23. (7, 11): Triangle <7, 11, 5>
24. (12, 13): No triangles
25. (1, 4): No triangles
26. (2, 3): No triangles
27. (14, 3): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
