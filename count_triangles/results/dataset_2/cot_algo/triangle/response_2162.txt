Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 13) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 13) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to efficiently count the number of triangles in the given graph. First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 3: Degree 5
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 5
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 6
Node 4: Degree 2

Now, we will iterate through the edges and count the number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [22]
Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 14>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 11, 2>
<0, 11, 5>
<0, 11, 12>
<2, 1, 7>
<2, 1, 6>
<2, 11, 5>
<2, 11, 12>
<3, 0, 11>
<3, 9, 13>
<3, 9, 6>
<3, 9, 12>
<3, 9, 14>
<3, 12, 5>
<3, 12, 10>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 12>
<5, 8, 10>
<6, 7, 1>
<6, 1, 2>
<9, 7, 1>
