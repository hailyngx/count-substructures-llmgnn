Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 0) (14, 11) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 14 has degree 1
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 13 has degree 4
- Node 12 has degree 6
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 11 has degree 5
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 10 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 6

Now, we apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles in the graph:

1. Start with edge (5, 9): Both nodes have the same degree, so proceed.
   Check for shared connections: Shared connections are 8 and 13.
   <5, 8, 13> forms a triangle.

2. Move to edge (5, 13): Node 5 has fewer connections than node 13, so proceed.
   Check for shared connections: Shared connections are 8 and 0.
   <5, 8, 0> forms a triangle.

3. Move to edge (5, 8): Node 5 has fewer connections than node 8, so proceed.
   Check for shared connections: No triangle formed.

4. Move to edge (5, 0): Node 5 has fewer connections than node 0, so proceed.
   Check for shared connections: No triangle formed.

5. Move to edge (9, 5): Node 9 has more connections than node 5, so skip.

6. Continue this process for all remaining edges.

After checking all edges, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
Unique triangles found in the graph are:
<5, 8, 13>
<5, 8, 0>
<5, 13, 1>
<5, 13, 12>
<5, 13, 3>
<5, 13, 11>
<9, 8, 10>
<9, 8, 7>
<9, 1, 4>
<9, 1, 7>
<9, 1, 13>
<9, 1, 12>
<7, 10, 0>
<7, 10, 3>
<7, 12, 2>
<7, 12, 3>
<7, 1, 4>
<7, 1, 12>
<6, 3, 12>
<13, 3, 11>
