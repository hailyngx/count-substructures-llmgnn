Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 15) (21, 7) (21, 27) (21, 25) (21, 2) (21, 15) (18, 10) (18, 24) (22, 3) (28, 29) (28, 17) (28, 13) (28, 25) (29, 28) (29, 8) (29, 25) (17, 28) (17, 2) (1, 25) (1, 4) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 14) (19, 5) (19, 27) (8, 29) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 27) (9, 8) (9, 12) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 23) (6, 0) (24, 18) (24, 3) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 15) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 25) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 18) (10, 3) (3, 22) (3, 8) (3, 24) (3, 10) (23, 16) (23, 2) (23, 4) (20, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 20) (12, 15) (15, 7) (15, 21) (15, 11) (15, 12) (25, 21) (25, 28) (25, 29) (25, 1) (25, 14) (27, 21) (27, 19) (27, 8) (13, 28) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 23) (4, 13) (2, 21) (2, 17) (2, 16) (2, 23) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method proceeds as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections (degree):
Nodes sorted by degree - (7, 10), (6, 13), (18, 6), (22, 1), (28, 6), (29, 4), (17, 3), (1, 2), (5, 4), (8, 5), (9, 3), (16, 4), (24, 3), (11, 3), (14, 5), (0, 4), (10, 3), (3, 6), (23, 3), (20, 1), (12, 4), (15, 4), (25, 5), (27, 3), (13, 4), (4, 4), (2, 4), (21, 6), (19, 2).

2. Relabel the vertices based on this sorting:
Relabeling - (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26), (26, 27), (27, 28), (28, 29), (29, 30).

3. Count the triangles:
Triangles - [15]
Unique triangles - <2, 4, 14>, <2, 4, 23>, <2, 16, 23>, <4, 13, 23>, <2, 11, 13>, <0, 12, 15>, <0, 12, 20>, <0, 5, 19>, <0, 5, 14>, <0, 5, 14>, <1, 25, 14>, <4, 25, 14>, <29, 25, 28>, <8, 27, 29>, <13, 16, 28>.
