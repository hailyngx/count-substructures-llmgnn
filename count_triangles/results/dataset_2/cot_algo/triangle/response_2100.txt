Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 15) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 11) (3, 13) (3, 26) (3, 4) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 21) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 29) (11, 10) (11, 27) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 16) (21, 25) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 13) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 23) (14, 13) (17, 25) (17, 20) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 24) (28, 21) (15, 2) (15, 20) (20, 29) (20, 17) (20, 15) (20, 19) (19, 20) (19, 22) (26, 3) (26, 1) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 26) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 16) (5, 10) (5, 23) (8, 14) (8, 24) (8, 4) (9, 25) (9, 10) (9, 18) (0, 7) (6, 10) (6, 24) (24, 18) (24, 8) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 4) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 23) (16, 4) (23, 14) (23, 5) (23, 16) (22, 19) (22, 27) (13, 3) (13, 21) (13, 14) (27, 11) (27, 24) (27, 22) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to label the nodes based on their degree (number of connections).

Node degrees:
0: 2
1: 4
2: 6
3: 4
4: 4
5: 2
6: 3
7: 4
8: 3
9: 4
10: 4
11: 4
12: 3
13: 4
14: 4
15: 2
16: 4
17: 3
18: 4
19: 2
20: 5
21: 4
22: 2
23: 3
24: 5
25: 3
26: 3
27: 3
28: 2
29: 3

Nodes sorted by degree:
0, 5, 15, 19, 22, 28, 6, 8, 12, 25, 26, 27, 17, 23, 1, 3, 7, 13, 18, 21, 10, 11, 14, 4, 9, 16, 2, 24, 20, 29

Let's now count the triangles using this ordering. 

Number of triangles: [24]

Unique triangles:
<0, 7, 16>
<1, 14, 13>
<1, 14, 26>
<1, 26, 3>
<2, 15, 20>
<2, 18, 9>
<2, 29, 11>
<2, 29, 20>
<3, 13, 21>
<3, 13, 14>
<4, 16, 23>
<4, 16, 24>
<4, 24, 6>
<4, 24, 27>
<5, 23, 16>
<6, 10, 9>
<8, 24, 27>
<9, 10, 11>
<13, 14, 21>
<16, 7, 12>
<17, 20, 29>
<18, 2, 29>
<20, 17, 25>
<27, 22, 11>
