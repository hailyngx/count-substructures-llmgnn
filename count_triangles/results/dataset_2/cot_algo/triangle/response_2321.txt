Now, let's count the triangles:
- (7, 12, 4) form a triangle.
- (7, 12, 25) form a triangle.
- (7, 2, 13) form a triangle.
- (7, 2, 19) form a triangle.
- (12, 7, 17) form a triangle.
- (4, 12, 25) form a triangle.
- (4, 12, 7) form a triangle.
- (4, 5, 19) form a triangle.
- (4, 5, 11) form a triangle.
- (2, 7, 19) form a triangle.
- (2, 13, 22) form a triangle.
- (2, 19, 5) form a triangle.
- (19, 5, 11) form a triangle.
- (12, 7, 21) form a triangle.
- (16, 1, 17) form a triangle.
- (16, 1, 24) form a triangle.
- (16, 21, 7) form a triangle.
- (25, 12, 7) form a triangle.
- (27, 15, 29) form a triangle.
- (27, 15, 20) form a triangle.
- (27, 29, 22) form a triangle.
- (27, 29, 15) form a triangle.
- (0, 18, 28) form a triangle.
- (0, 18, 3) form a triangle.
- (0, 18, 28) form a triangle.
- (13, 22, 29) form a triangle.
- (13, 22, 28) form a triangle.
- (13, 16, 1) form a triangle.
- (13, 16, 27) form a triangle.
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [30].  
The unique triangles are <7, 12, 4>, <7, 12, 25>, <7, 2, 13>, <7, 2, 19>, <12, 7, 17>, <4, 12, 25>, <4, 12, 7>, <4, 5, 19>, <4, 5, 11>, <2, 7, 19>, <2, 13, 22>, <2, 19, 5>, <19, 5, 11>, <12, 7, 21>, <16, 1, 17>, <16, 1, 24>, <16, 21, 7>, <25, 12, 7>, <27, 15, 29>, <27, 15, 20>, <27, 29, 22>, <27, 29, 15>, <0, 18, 28>, <0, 18, 3>, <13, 22, 29>, <13, 22, 28>, <13, 16, 1>, <13, 16, 27>.
