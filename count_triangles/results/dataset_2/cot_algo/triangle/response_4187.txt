Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 4) (17, 19) (17, 8) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 18) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 6) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 5) (7, 11) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 2) (5, 10) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 19) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 4) (2, 12) (2, 4) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 13) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 9) (9, 16) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 15) (4, 14) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 15) (15, 9) (15, 4) (18, 1) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by the number of connections from least to most:
   Vertices: [17, 18, 2, 5, 7, 8, 15, 1, 6, 9, 12, 19, 3, 14, 0, 4, 10, 11, 16, 13]
   
2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   Sorted Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

3. Count the triangles based on the edges and sorted vertices:

Total triangles: [9]

Unique triangles: <3, 4, 14> <4, 9, 15> <4, 9, 16> <4, 13, 16> <4, 14, 15> <5, 6, 19> <8, 9, 15> <9, 15, 16> <13, 16, 19>
