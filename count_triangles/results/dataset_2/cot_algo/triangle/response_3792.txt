Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 0) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 5) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 5) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 14) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
- 0: (10, 11, 4, 12, 14)
- 1: (9)
- 2: (7, 5, 6)
- 3: (1, 11, 6, 4)
- 4: (3, 8, 13, 0, 6)
- 5: (10, 2, 14, 6)
- 6: (3, 4, 7, 2, 14, 5)
- 7: (6, 14, 2)
- 8: (11, 4, 12)
- 9: (1, 10, 11, 14)
- 10: (11, 0, 13, 9, 5)
- 11: (3, 10, 0, 9, 8)
- 12: (8, 0)
- 13: (10, 4, 14)
- 14: (7, 0, 6, 9, 13, 5)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Nodes sorted by degree:
- 1, 8, 2, 12, 3, 5, 7, 13, 9, 4, 0, 10, 11, 6, 14
2. Counting triangles:

Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 10>
<0, 4, 12> 
<0, 4, 14> 
<0, 5, 10> 
<0, 5, 14> 
<0, 10, 12> 
<0, 10, 14> 
<0, 11, 12> 
<0, 11, 14> 
<4, 5, 6> 
<4, 6, 14> 
<10, 11, 14>
