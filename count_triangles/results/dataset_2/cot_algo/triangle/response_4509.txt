Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 14) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 14) (9, 15) (9, 5) (9, 18) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 8) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 0) (11, 1) (11, 17) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 13) (17, 11) (17, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 16) (16, 7) (16, 4) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 19) (18, 9) (18, 6) (18, 12) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 4) (14, 15) (14, 5) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 8) (4, 16) (4, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently in the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges provided.

First, let's sort the nodes by their degree:

Node 16: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 19: degree 3
Node 0: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 11: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 18: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 17: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5
Node 13: degree 5
Node 15: degree 6

Now, we will analyze the edges based on the degree-based ordering:

- Begin with the edge (16, 4), proceed since 2 < 2 (same degrees).
- Count the triangles: None

- Next, the edge (19, 4), proceed since 3 < 2.
- Count the triangles: None

- Continue with the rest of the edges in this manner, ensuring the lower labeled node has fewer connections.

After analyzing all edges, we find the total number of triangles [39]. The unique triangles are as follows:

<0, 10, 19>
<0, 10, 2>
<0, 10, 13>
<0, 13, 1>
<0, 13, 7>
<0, 13, 10>
<1, 13, 11>
<1, 13, 7>
<1, 13, 2>
<2, 10, 19>
<2, 10, 6>
<2, 10, 4>
<2, 6, 18>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 12>
<2, 12, 8>
<2, 12, 17>
<2, 17, 13>
<2, 4, 16>
<2, 4, 13>
<4, 16, 7>
<4, 16, 2>
<4, 16, 13>
<5, 9, 15>
<5, 9, 14>
<6, 8, 12>
<7, 13, 11>
<7, 13, 0>
<9, 15, 5>
<10, 19, 0>
<12, 17, 13>
<12, 17, 8>
<13, 17, 11>
<13, 17, 12>
<14, 15, 5>
<18, 6, 12>
<18, 6, 8>
