Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 0) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 6) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. In this case, the sorted order of vertices based on their degree is as follows:
0, 3, 8, 9, 13, 12, 11, 6, 2, 7, 10, 1, 4, 14, 5

Using this sorted order, let's now check for triangles formed by shared connections between the two vertices of each edge based on the condition that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 11>
<0, 6, 14>
<0, 10, 5>
<3, 6, 14>
<3, 2, 13>
<8, 9, 12>
<8, 2, 13>
<9, 12, 11>
<11, 8, 13>
<2, 13, 8>
