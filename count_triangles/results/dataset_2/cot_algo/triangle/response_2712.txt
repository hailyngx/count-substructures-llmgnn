Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges:
- 0: {1, 4, 11, 14}
- 1: {0, 13, 14}
- 2: {3, 9, 10, 12}
- 3: {2, 4, 7, 12}
- 4: {0, 3, 5, 11, 12}
- 5: {4, 9, 10, 14}
- 6: {8, 10, 13}
- 7: {3, 8, 11, 14}
- 8: {6, 7, 9, 11, 13}
- 9: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- 10: {2, 5, 6}
- 11: {0, 4, 7, 8, 14}
- 12: {2, 3, 4}
- 13: {1, 6, 8}
- 14: {0, 1, 5, 7, 11}

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes by degree: [2, 9, 3, 6, 12, 13, 10, 0, 1, 11, 4, 8, 7, 5, 14]

By following the degree-based ordering, we count the number of triangles and list them:

[Total number of triangles: 3]
<Triangles: <0, 1, 14>, <0, 4, 11>, <4, 7, 14>>
