Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. After relabeling the nodes according to their degrees, here is the new vertex labeling:

0 -> 2 connections
9 -> 2 connections
3 -> 2 connections
4 -> 3 connections
7 -> 4 connections
8 -> 3 connections
6 -> 4 connections
1 -> 4 connections
5 -> 5 connections
2 -> 4 connections

Using the edges provided, we can count the number of triangles by following the method described earlier. 

The total number of triangles is [6], and the unique triangles found are <4, 0, 5>, <4, 0, 7>, <4, 2, 0>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 7>.
