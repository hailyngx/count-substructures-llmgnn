Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the connections for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 6, 3, 4
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 6, 1, 0, 4
- Node 4: 9, 1, 3, 7, 0
- Node 5: 6, 2, 8, 0, 7
- Node 6: 5, 1, 7, 3, 8
- Node 7: 5, 9, 6, 4, 0, 8
- Node 8: 5, 9, 6, 7
- Node 9: 8, 4, 7

Now, we order the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes sorted by degree: 2, 1, 9, 8, 0, 7, 4, 3, 6, 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:
- (1, 3) [Shared connection: 6]
- (1, 4) [Shared connection: 6]
- (0, 3) [Shared connection: 6]
- (0, 4) [Shared connection: 6, 7]
- (0, 5) [Shared connection: 6, 7]
- (0, 7) [Shared connection: 4, 5]
- (2, 5) [Shared connection: None]
- (3, 4) [Shared connection: 1]
- (3, 6) [Shared connection: 1]
- (4, 9) [Shared connection: None]
- (5, 6) [Shared connection: None]
- (5, 8) [Shared connection: None]
- (5, 7) [Shared connection: 0]
- (6, 7) [Shared connection: 3]
- (7, 8) [Shared connection: 5]
- (8, 9) [Shared connection: None]

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 6>
<5, 6, 7>
