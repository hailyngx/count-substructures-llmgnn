Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 19) (7, 4) (7, 5) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 16) (9, 4) (9, 2) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 11) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 19) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 18) (3, 8) (11, 17) (11, 8) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 14) (15, 0) (15, 5) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (16, 6) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 18) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 14) (19, 4) (19, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 14) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices by degree:
0: 3 connections
3: 1 connection
7: 2 connections
9: 2 connections
1: 3 connections
4: 4 connections
6: 3 connections
2: 5 connections
5: 4 connections
8: 5 connections
12: 4 connections
15: 3 connections
13: 3 connections
17: 4 connections
10: 3 connections
14: 5 connections
11: 2 connections
16: 1 connection
18: 3 connections
19: 2 connections

According to the degree-based ordering, the vertices in ascending order are: 3, 7, 9, 16, 11, 19, 0, 1, 10, 13, 15, 6, 5, 17, 4, 12, 8, 18, 2, 14.

Let's count the triangles formed by checking shared connections:

Total number of triangles: [18]

Unique triangles: <1, 10, 14>, <1, 10, 17>, <1, 10, 18>, <1, 14, 18>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 19>, <2, 8, 18>, <2, 12, 17>, <5, 8, 14>, <5, 14, 18>, <6, 13, 17>, <6, 13, 14>, <6, 16, 9>, <7, 5, 8>, <7, 5, 14>, <8, 11, 17>, <8, 11, 14>, <8, 12, 17>
