Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 26) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 23) (16, 9) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 28) (5, 7) (5, 20) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 3) (4, 25) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 14) (15, 27) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 2) (27, 6) (0, 12) (0, 6) (20, 5) (20, 17) (2, 16) (2, 15) (2, 27) (2, 18) (2, 25) (18, 2) (18, 6) (12, 0) (12, 28) (12, 22) (28, 5) (28, 12) (26, 11) (26, 10) (26, 8) (17, 20) (17, 13) (1, 13) (1, 22) (19, 5) (19, 21) (19, 10) (23, 16) (13, 17) (13, 1) (10, 26) (10, 19) (10, 21) (10, 22) (21, 19) (21, 10) (21, 22) (21, 29) (24, 11) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 29) (3, 9) (3, 7) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 22) (22, 12) (22, 1) (22, 10) (22, 21) (22, 14) (8, 26) (8, 24) (8, 29) (6, 27) (6, 0) (6, 18) (6, 25) (29, 21) (29, 24) (29, 8) (25, 4) (25, 2) (25, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

The edges listed in the graph can also be represented as an adjacency list:

0: [12, 6]
1: [13, 22]
2: [16, 15, 27, 18, 25]
3: [9, 7]
4: [25]
5: [9, 19, 28, 7, 20]
6: [27, 0, 18, 25]
7: [5, 3, 14]
8: [26, 24, 29]
9: [16, 5, 24, 14, 3]
10: [26, 19, 21, 22]
11: [16, 24, 26]
12: [0, 28, 22]
13: [17, 1]
14: [9, 7, 22]
15: [27, 2]
16: [11, 2, 23, 9]
17: [20, 13]
18: [2, 6]
19: [5, 21, 10]
20: [5, 17]
21: [19, 10, 22, 29]
22: [12, 1, 10, 21, 14]
23: [16]
24: [11, 9, 8, 29]
25: [4, 2, 6]
26: [11, 10, 8]
27: [15, 2, 6]
28: [5, 12]
29: [21, 24, 8]

By arranging the nodes from the least connected to the most connected, we get the following ordering: [4, 17, 13, 0, 1, 15, 18, 3, 7, 12, 20, 23, 14, 19, 5, 28, 6, 21, 10, 29, 8, 11, 16, 24, 9, 25, 2, 26, 27]

Now, we will count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles is: [45]

The unique triangles found are: <0, 5, 28>, <0, 6, 27>, <0, 12, 28>, <0, 12, 22>, <0, 6, 18>, <1, 13, 17>, <1, 13, 21>, <1, 13, 22>, <2, 15, 27>, <2, 16, 25>, <2, 18, 6>, <2, 18, 25>, <2, 6, 27>, <3, 7, 14>, <5, 19, 21>, <5, 20, 17>, <5, 20, 7>, <5, 7, 14>, <5, 9, 16>, <5, 9, 24>, <5, 9, 14>, <5, 9, 24>, <6, 25, 27>, <7, 14, 22>, <8, 24, 29>, <8, 26, 24>, <8, 26, 29>, <8, 26, 10>, <9, 14, 22>, <10, 19, 21>, <10, 19, 22>, <10, 21, 29>, <11, 16, 24>, <11, 16, 26>, <11, 24, 29>, <12, 22, 14>, <12, 22, 28>, <16, 23, 11>, <16, 9, 24>, <18, 6, 25>, <19, 21, 10>, <24, 29, 8>, <26, 10, 21>, <26, 11, 24>, <27, 15, 2>
