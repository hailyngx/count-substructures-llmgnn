Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: 5, 4, 7, 6, 1
- 1: 5, 7, 8, 2, 6
- 2: 9, 4, 8, 1, 6
- 3: 5, 9, 7
- 4: 9, 0, 2
- 5: 9, 8, 1, 0, 3
- 6: 8, 2, 0, 1
- 7: 0, 3, 1
- 8: 5, 2, 6, 1
- 9: 5, 4, 2, 3

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

0: 5 connections
1: 5 connections
2: 5 connections
3: 3 connections
4: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 4 connections
5: 5 connections

Next, we will count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 10]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
