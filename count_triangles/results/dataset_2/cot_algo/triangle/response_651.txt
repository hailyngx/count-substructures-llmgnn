Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 12) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 12) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 14: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 11: Degree 5
Node 12: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 4

Now, we will relabel the nodes according to their degree from lowest to highest:

Node 2: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 11: Degree 5
Node 12: Degree 5

We will now proceed by checking shared connections between edges with the lower labeled vertices having fewer connections.

By counting the triangles, we find the following triangles:
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 4, 12>
<1, 4, 13>
<3, 4, 12>
<3, 4, 11>
<3, 4, 10>
<3, 8, 14>
<4, 7, 12>
<4, 7, 13>
<5, 7, 13>
<9, 7, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
