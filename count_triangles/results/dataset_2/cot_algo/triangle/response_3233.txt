Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 21) (7, 4) (7, 20) (7, 23) (7, 2) (18, 22) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 28) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 6) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 26) (3, 29) (25, 5) (25, 8) (25, 14) (25, 11) (12, 24) (12, 17) (27, 10) (27, 1) (8, 25) (8, 5) (24, 12) (24, 26) (24, 2) (24, 15) (26, 3) (26, 24) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 15) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 19) (20, 7) (20, 2) (20, 23) (9, 15) (29, 3) (29, 1) (29, 0) (19, 17) (19, 21) (1, 27) (1, 29) (1, 16) (6, 4) (6, 22) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 29) (0, 10) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 26) (10, 0) (23, 7) (23, 26) (23, 20) (28, 18) (28, 3) (28, 13) (15, 24) (15, 26) (15, 9) (2, 7) (2, 24) (2, 20) (2, 6) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 25) (5, 8) (5, 2) (16, 22) (16, 17) (16, 1) (21, 4) (21, 19) (13, 28) (11, 18) (11, 25) (14, 25) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 1
- Node 13 has degree 1
- Node 14 has degree 1
- Node 15 has degree 3
- Node 19 has degree 2
- Node 20 has degree 3
- Node 21 has degree 2
- Node 27 has degree 2
- Node 28 has degree 3
- Node 29 has degree 3
- Node 18 has degree 4
- Node 22 has degree 4
- Node 24 has degree 4
- Node 25 has degree 4
- Node 17 has degree 4
- Node 26 has degree 5
- Node 16 has degree 4
- Node 10 has degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 11 has degree 3
- Node 12 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 5
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4

Now, we will proceed with counting the number of triangles.
