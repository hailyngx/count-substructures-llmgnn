Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 8) (4, 3) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 14) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 0) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 17) (18, 3) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 17) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 18) (17, 15) (19, 2) (19, 3) (16, 7) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 13) (12, 2) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 2) (1, 7) (1, 11) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 18) (3, 19) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 18) 

Response:
Let's label the nodes based on the number of connections they have:

Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 12: 2 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 15: 5 connections
Node 16: 1 connection
Node 17: 5 connections
Node 18: 5 connections
Node 19: 2 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Count of triangles: 10

[Total number of triangles: 10]

Unique triangles found:
<3, 4, 10>
<3, 4, 15>
<3, 10, 15>
<3, 15, 17>
<4, 6, 15>
<4, 15, 17>
<5, 9, 13>
