Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (11, 4) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 10) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 13) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

- Node 5 has 2 connections.
- Node 11 has 1 connection.
- Node 14 has 4 connections.
- Node 6 has 5 connections.
- Node 7 has 4 connections.
- Node 9 has 3 connections.
- Node 12 has 4 connections.
- Node 0 has 5 connections.
- Node 1 has 4 connections.
- Node 8 has 6 connections.
- Node 2 has 3 connections.
- Node 3 has 5 connections.
- Node 4 has 7 connections.
- Node 10 has 6 connections.
- Node 13 has 5 connections.

Based on the sorted list, we will start counting triangles by considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles is [36].

The unique triangles found are:
- <4, 6, 13>
- <0, 6, 13>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 4, 13>
- <3, 6, 10>
- <3, 8, 10>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <0, 1, 13>
- <0, 8, 12>
- <1, 7, 13>
- <1, 12, 13>
- <6, 10, 12>
- <3, 10, 12>
- <4, 9, 10>
- <9, 10, 12>
- <1, 7, 12>
- <6, 7, 12>
- <2, 8, 10>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <3, 8, 12>
