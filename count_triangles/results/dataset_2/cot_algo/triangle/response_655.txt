Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 14) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 5) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 9) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
The graph based on the given edges is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (0, 11), (0, 8), (0, 13), (0, 9), (0, 2), (0, 5), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 12), (2, 5), (2, 0), (3, 14), (3, 12), (4, 7), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 13), (5, 2), (5, 12), (5, 0), (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 10), (6, 13), (6, 9), (7, 4), (7, 11), (7, 10), (7, 14), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 0), (9, 6), (9, 14), (9, 0), (10, 7), (10, 11), (10, 6), (10, 14), (11, 7), (11, 10), (11, 0), (12, 3), (12, 13), (12, 2), (12, 5), (13, 5), (13, 12), (13, 14), (13, 0), (13, 6), (14, 7), (14, 3), (14, 10), (14, 13), (14, 9)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted by their number of connections (degree):
Vertices: [ 11→2, 1→3, 3→2, 4→3, 7→5, 8→3, 12→3, 9→3, 10→4, 13→5, 5→5, 2→4, 6→5, 0→7, 14→6 ]

Triangles: [ 0, 13, 5 ], [ 0, 9, 6 ], [ 2, 0, 5 ], [ 2, 0, 8 ], [ 2, 8, 1 ], [ 5, 0, 13 ], [ 5, 2, 12 ], [ 5, 4, 6 ], [ 6, 1, 7 ], [ 6, 9, 14 ], [ 10, 7, 14 ], [ 12, 3, 14 ]
Total number of triangles: [12]
