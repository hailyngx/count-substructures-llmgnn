Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 10) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 12) 

Response:
The vertices and their connections are as follows after relabeling:

0: 2, 8, 10
1: 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14
2: 0, 8, 11, 12
3: 1, 6, 10
4: 7, 8, 10, 11
5: 8, 9
6: 1, 3, 10, 12
7: 1, 4, 8, 9, 11
8: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7
9: 5, 7, 13, 14
10: 0, 3, 4, 6, 12
11: 1, 2, 4, 7, 12
12: 1, 2, 6, 10, 11
13: 9, 14
14: 1, 9, 13

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the total number of triangles in this graph is [33]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 11>
<0, 2, 12>
<0, 8, 10>
<0, 8, 12>
<0, 10, 12>
<1, 3, 6>
