Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Here is the given graph represented with nodes and edges:

Nodes: 

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 

(5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3)

To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Nodes sorted by degree: 9 > 6 > 7 > 3 > 0 > 5 > 2 > 1 > 8 > 4

Based on this ordering, the edges we will consider are:

(7, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 8), (1, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 4), (7, 1), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 1), (9, 5)

By examining shared connections between the endpoints of these edges, we find the total number of triangles to be [3].

The unique triangles found are:

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 8, 4>
