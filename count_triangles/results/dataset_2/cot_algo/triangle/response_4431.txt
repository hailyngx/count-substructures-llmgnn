Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections and then relabeling them accordingly. 

Here are the nodes with their degrees:
Node 0: 4 edges
Node 1: 5 edges
Node 2: 4 edges
Node 3: 3 edges
Node 4: 3 edges
Node 5: 4 edges
Node 6: 4 edges
Node 7: 4 edges
Node 8: 5 edges
Node 9: 6 edges
Node 10: 4 edges
Node 11: 3 edges
Node 12: 4 edges
Node 13: 4 edges
Node 14: 5 edges

Now, we will relabel the nodes as follows:
Node 11: 0 edges
Node 3: 3 edges
Node 4: 3 edges
Node 12: 4 edges
Node 2: 4 edges
Node 0: 4 edges
Node 7: 4 edges
Node 10: 4 edges
Node 5: 4 edges
Node 6: 4 edges
Node 13: 4 edges
Node 14: 5 edges
Node 1: 5 edges
Node 8: 5 edges
Node 9: 6 edges

Now we will go through the edges list and count the triangles:

The total number of triangles in the given graph is: [59]
