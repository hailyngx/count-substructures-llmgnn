Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are:

Vertex 5 - 3 connections
Vertex 8 - 2 connections
Vertex 6 - 3 connections
Vertex 2 - 4 connections
Vertex 1 - 4 connections
Vertex 4 - 4 connections
Vertex 7 - 4 connections
Vertex 3 - 6 connections
Vertex 0 - 6 connections
Vertex 9 - 6 connections

Based on these sorted vertices, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
[15]
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>
