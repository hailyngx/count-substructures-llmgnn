Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 2) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 12) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 14) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 14) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 10) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are as follows: 
Node 7 (Degree 2) 
Node 2 (Degree 3)
Node 4 (Degree 3) 
Node 6 (Degree 3)
Node 0 (Degree 4) 
Node 8 (Degree 4) 
Node 13 (Degree 4) 
Node 12 (Degree 4)
Node 1 (Degree 6) 
Node 10 (Degree 4) 
Node 3 (Degree 5) 
Node 14 (Degree 4) 
Node 9 (Degree 6)
Node 11 (Degree 6)
Node 5 (Degree 4)

Now, let's count the number of triangles. Starting from the edge with the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections, we have the following unique triangles:

<0, 9, 11>
<0, 9, 3>
<0, 9, 5>
<0, 9, 10>
<0, 9, 8>
<4, 1, 6>
<4, 1, 11>
<4, 1, 3>
<4, 1, 13>
<4, 1, 14>
<2, 7, 11>
<2, 7, 3>
<2, 7, 4>
<2, 7, 12>
<2, 7, 6>
<2, 7, 1>
<2, 10, 14>
<2, 10, 5>
<2, 10, 9>
<2, 10, 1>
<4, 12, 0>
<4, 12, 6>
<4, 12, 14>
<4, 12, 1>
<6, 12, 0>
<6, 12, 4>
<6, 12, 14>
<6, 12, 1>
<10, 14, 5>
<10, 14, 9>
<10, 14, 1>
<10, 14, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [30].
