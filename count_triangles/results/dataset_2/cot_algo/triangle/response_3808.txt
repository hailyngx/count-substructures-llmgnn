Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 1) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 13) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 6) (0, 13) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their corresponding connections based on the given edges:
1: 9, 7, 2, 8
2: 7, 12, 8, 1
3: 5, 7, 8, 14, 6
4: 5, 11, 6
5: 9, 12, 4, 3, 10, 14
6: 12, 3, 4
7: 10, 11, 12, 3, 2, 1
8: 10, 2, 3, 1
9: 5, 14, 1
10: 5, 11, 8, 7
11: 10, 14, 7, 4
12: 5, 7, 2, 13, 6
13: 12, 14, 0
14: 5, 9, 11, 3, 13

By sorting the nodes based on their degrees:
0: 1
1: 4
2: 4
13: 3
6: 3
9: 3
4: 3
8: 4
3: 5
12: 5
10: 4
11: 4
7: 6
5: 6
14: 5

The triangles found in the graph are:
[27]
