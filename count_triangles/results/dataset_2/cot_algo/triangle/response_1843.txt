Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 3) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 19) (22, 25) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (21, 13) (21, 2) (8, 23) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 25) (23, 28) (23, 27) (0, 8) (0, 20) (0, 17) (20, 0) (20, 18) (2, 4) (2, 21) (2, 15) (18, 20) (18, 25) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 3) (15, 2) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 5) (15, 29) (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 27) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 28) (17, 0) (17, 16) (17, 11) (5, 13) (5, 15) (19, 22) (19, 14) (19, 24) (29, 15) (29, 9) (29, 24) (29, 10) (10, 12) (10, 29) (10, 26) (10, 28) (10, 14) (26, 10) (26, 6) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (6, 26) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 27) (16, 17) (16, 24) (16, 14) (24, 19) (24, 29) (24, 16) (24, 14) (27, 23) (27, 9) (27, 11) (28, 23) (28, 1) (28, 10) (25, 22) (25, 23) (25, 18) (14, 19) (14, 10) (14, 16) (14, 24) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Vertices: 13, 22, 9, 5, 19, 20, 12, 6, 26, 4, 7, 21, 2, 15, 29, 24, 0, 1, 10, 3, 11, 17, 16, 25, 14, 27, 18, 8, 23, 28

Based on the sorted vertices list, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The total number of triangles is [40].

The unique triangles found are:
<10, 14, 16>
<1, 10, 28>
<0, 8, 23>
<22, 25, 18>
<10, 26, 14>
<14, 19, 24>
