Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 20) (7, 9) (21, 7) (21, 13) (21, 26) (22, 9) (22, 19) (22, 10) (22, 17) (23, 27) (12, 10) (12, 11) (27, 23) (27, 20) (27, 26) (27, 16) (15, 20) (15, 14) (15, 24) (20, 7) (20, 27) (20, 15) (20, 17) (20, 28) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 22) (9, 18) (5, 24) (5, 14) (13, 21) (13, 1) (17, 22) (17, 20) (17, 25) (17, 11) (25, 17) (25, 26) (25, 14) (26, 21) (26, 27) (26, 25) (19, 22) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 3) (18, 9) (1, 13) (1, 29) (1, 11) (1, 16) (29, 1) (29, 0) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 1) (24, 15) (24, 5) (24, 0) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 8) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 25) (14, 19) (14, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (16, 4) (16, 27) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 10) (0, 29) (0, 24) (10, 22) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 16) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 16) (28, 20) 

Response:
The given graph can be constructed and the Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied as follows:

Nodes sorted by degree (number of connections):
Nodes with degree 1: 0, 6, 18, 28
Nodes with degree 2: 3, 5, 12, 13
Nodes with degree 3: 1, 11, 15, 23, 24, 29
Nodes with degree 4: 2, 10, 14, 19, 25
Nodes with degree 5: 8, 16
Nodes with degree 6: 9, 21, 27
Nodes with degree 7: 7, 17, 20
Nodes with degree 8: 4
Nodes with degree 9: 22
Nodes with degree 10: 26

Now, we will list the triangles based on the connections between the nodes:

Triangles:
<1, 13, 21>
<14, 17, 25>
<3, 8, 16>
<1, 11, 19>
<5, 14, 25>
<0, 24, 29>
<6, 10, 12>
<9, 22, 19>
<1, 11, 12>
<7, 17, 20>
<4, 7, 9>
<14, 19, 22>
<7, 20, 27>
<7, 9, 22>
<16, 17, 20>
<8, 16, 10>
<26, 27, 21>
<17, 20, 28>
<14, 19, 3>
<3, 14, 5>
<11, 17, 22>
<21, 26, 25>
<8, 16, 27>
<10, 16, 4>
