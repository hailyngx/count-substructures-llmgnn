Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 5), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 9), (7, 5), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 8), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 8), (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2), (9, 7), (9, 0), (8, 4), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 5), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 0), (0, 7), (0, 9), (0, 2), (0, 5), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 3), (5, 8), (5, 0)

Next, let's rearrange the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes by degree: 2, 9, 1, 6, 8, 0, 5, 4, 3, 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

Triangles found: 
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 7>

Total number of triangles: [7]
