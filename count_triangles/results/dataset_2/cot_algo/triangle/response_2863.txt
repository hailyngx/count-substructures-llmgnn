Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 11) (9, 18) (9, 10) (9, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 11) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 18) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 8) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 16) (15, 10) (15, 11) (13, 17) (13, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 7) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 4) (4, 19) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 2) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 8) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 8) (2, 1) (2, 12) (18, 5) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 0) (6, 4) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 15) 

Response:
The given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: (5, 18), (14, 0), (3, 0), (8, 0), (18, 0)
- 1: (14, 1), (1, 3), (1, 2), (3, 1)
- 2: (12, 2), (1, 2), (2, 12)
- 3: (8, 3), (0, 3), (3, 1), (3, 18)
- 4: (6, 4), (4, 19), (12, 4)
- 5: (11, 5), (5, 18)
- 6: (6, 4)
- 7: (8, 7), (7, 13), (10, 7)
- 8: (8, 16), (8, 19), (8, 7), (3, 8), (0, 8)
- 9: (9, 10), (10, 9), (12, 9), (9, 18)
- 10: (15, 10), (19, 10), (7, 10), (10, 9), (10, 16)
- 11: (11, 15), (11, 5), (17, 11)
- 12: (2, 12), (12, 4), (12, 9)
- 13: (7, 13), (17, 13)
- 14: (14, 1), (14, 0)
- 15: (15, 11), (15, 10)
- 16: (16, 8), (16, 17), (10, 16)
- 17: (16, 17), (17, 13), (17, 11)
- 18: (18, 3), (18, 0), (18, 5), (18, 9)
- 19: (19, 8), (19, 4), (10, 19)

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles. 

The total number of triangles in this graph is [12].

Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 18>
<0, 8, 16>
<0, 8, 19>
<1, 2, 12>
<3, 8, 18>
<4, 12, 9>
<7, 8, 16>
<7, 10, 19>
<10, 16, 8>
<11, 15, 10>
<16, 17, 11>
