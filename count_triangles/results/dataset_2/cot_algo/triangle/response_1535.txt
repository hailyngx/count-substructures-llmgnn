Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(0, 3), (0, 9)
(1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 14)
(2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7)
(3, 6), (3, 10)
(4, 10), (4, 11), (4, 14)
(5, 9), (5, 11), (5, 12)
(6, 10), (6, 12)
(7, 8), (7, 11), (7, 13), (7, 14)
(8, 10), (8, 12), (8, 13)
(9, 11), (9, 12)
(10, 12)
(11, 12)
(13, 7)
(14, 6), (14, 7)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles.

Sorted nodes by degree:
Degree 1: 0, 1, 2, 13
Degree 2: 3, 5, 8, 9
Degree 3: 4, 7, 10, 11, 14
Degree 4: 6, 12

Counting triangles:

1. For node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed.

2. For node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed.

3. For node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed.

4. For node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed.

5. For node 4:
    - Triangles: <4, 10, 14> 

6. For node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed.

7. For node 6:
    - Triangles: <6, 10, 12>, <6, 10, 14>, <6, 12, 14>

8. For node 7:
    - Triangles: <7, 11, 14>

9. For node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed.

10. For node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed.

11. For node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed.

12. For node 11:
    - Triangles: <10, 11, 12>, <11, 12, 14>

13. For node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed.

14. For node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed.

15. For node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed.

Total number of triangles: [7]

Unique triangles found: <4, 10, 14>, <6, 10, 12>, <6, 10, 14>, <6, 12, 14>, <7, 11, 14>, <10, 11, 12>, <11, 12, 14>
