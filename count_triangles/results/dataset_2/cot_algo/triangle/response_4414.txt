Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 11) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 3) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 25) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 27) (3, 1) (3, 23) (3, 9) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 24) (22, 18) (22, 19) (22, 15) (8, 1) (23, 3) (23, 13) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 9) (11, 5) (28, 11) (28, 17) (28, 12) (28, 10) (6, 24) (6, 12) (6, 19) (21, 20) (21, 26) (21, 24) (26, 21) (26, 16) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 15) (24, 18) (24, 6) (24, 21) (24, 16) (24, 12) (19, 0) (19, 22) (19, 6) (19, 25) (10, 28) (10, 14) (10, 20) (17, 28) (17, 25) (17, 2) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 17) (7, 14) (2, 17) (2, 5) (2, 16) (5, 11) (5, 2) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 2) (29, 4) (20, 1) (20, 21) (20, 10) (15, 22) (15, 9) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 24) (12, 13) (12, 14) (13, 23) (13, 12) (4, 29) (4, 14) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 4) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 

0 (degree: 3), 4 (degree: 2), 7 (degree: 1), 16 (degree: 3), 27 (degree: 3), 28 (degree: 4), 6 (degree: 3), 21 (degree: 3), 29 (degree: 1), 9 (degree: 4), 15 (degree: 2), 17 (degree: 3), 25 (degree: 3), 2 (degree: 3), 5 (degree: 2), 11 (degree: 4), 19 (degree: 4), 22 (degree: 3), 26 (degree: 2), 10 (degree: 3), 12 (degree: 4), 18 (degree: 2), 1 (degree: 5), 3 (degree: 4), 8 (degree: 1), 23 (degree: 2), 13 (degree: 2), 24 (degree: 5), 14 (degree: 4), and 20 (degree: 3).

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider edges only when the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Following this method, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15], and the unique triangles found are: 
<12, 14, 28>, <3, 9, 11>, <1, 9, 25>, <1, 20, 21>, <6, 12, 24>, <1, 3, 9>, <15, 22, 24>, <4, 14, 29>, <17, 25, 28>, <19, 22, 24>, <9, 11, 19>, <6, 19, 24>, <6, 19, 22>, <2, 16, 26>, <14, 20, 28>.
