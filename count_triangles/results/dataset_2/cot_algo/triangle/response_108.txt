Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degrees is as follows:

Node 9 : Connections (2)
Node 5 : Connections (3)
Node 2 : Connections (4)
Node 4 : Connections (4)
Node 1 : Connections (5)
Node 0 : Connections (5)
Node 3 : Connections (5)
Node 6 : Connections (5)
Node 8 : Connections (6)
Node 7 : Connections (6)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
