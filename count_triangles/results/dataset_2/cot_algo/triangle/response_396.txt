Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 0), (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 4), (1, 5), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 0), (1, 7), (3, 9), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 0), (4, 6), (4, 1), (4, 7), (4, 0), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 1), (7, 4), (8, 9), (8, 2), (8, 0), (2, 6), (2, 8), (0, 9), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 8)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the nodes by their number of connections from least to most:

Nodes in order of degree: 2, 8, 5, 4, 7, 1, 3, 9, 0, 6

Next, we will count the total number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 
Finally, we will list the unique triangles found.

The total number of triangles is [1].

Unique triangles found: <1, 3, 4>.
