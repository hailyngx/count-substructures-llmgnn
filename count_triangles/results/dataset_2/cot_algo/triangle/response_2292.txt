Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (15, 9) (15, 28) (15, 11) (0, 12) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 23) (27, 22) (27, 7) (27, 16) (27, 5) (8, 0) (8, 11) (13, 18) (7, 27) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 28) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 23) (28, 15) (28, 7) (28, 6) (28, 14) (29, 16) (29, 21) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 9) (26, 1) (26, 19) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 22) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 20) (9, 10) (22, 27) (22, 6) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 24) (5, 27) (5, 19) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 23) (11, 18) (11, 20) (23, 0) (23, 12) (23, 11) (10, 9) (10, 21) (10, 4) (10, 24) (21, 29) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 14) (16, 27) (16, 29) (16, 21) (14, 28) (14, 1) (14, 21) (2, 3) (2, 20) (2, 17) (2, 25) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 11) (24, 7) (24, 19) (24, 10) (24, 20) (25, 2) (4, 10) (4, 20) (17, 2) (20, 9) (20, 11) (20, 2) (20, 24) (20, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method aims to count triangles efficiently in a graph. Let's apply this method to the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges.

After sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes will be as follows:
0(4), 1(4), 2(4), 3(1), 4(3), 5(2), 6(3), 7(4), 8(2), 9(4), 10(4), 11(4), 12(3), 13(1), 14(3), 15(4), 16(3), 17(1), 18(3), 19(3), 20(5), 21(4), 22(2), 23(3), 24(3), 25(1), 26(2), 27(4), 28(4), 29(2).

Let's list the unique triangles and then count the total number of triangles:

Unique triangles found:
<0, 8, 11>
<0, 12, 23>
<1, 6, 14>
<1, 9, 15>
<4, 10, 20>
<5, 19, 24>
<6, 14, 21>
<7, 12, 28>
<9, 15, 28>
<9, 10, 21>

Total number of triangles: [10]
