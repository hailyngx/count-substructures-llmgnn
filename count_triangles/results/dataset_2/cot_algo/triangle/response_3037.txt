Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 8) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 12) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 9) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 8) (8, 15) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 9) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 12) (4, 9) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 11) (6, 0) (6, 16) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 16) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 13) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 14) (16, 9) (5, 10) (11, 17) (11, 12) (11, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) 

Response:
The sorted nodes based on degree are as follows:  
Node 5: 1 edge  
Node 13: 1 edge  
Node 2: 2 edges  
Node 5: 2 edges  
Node 6: 2 edges  
Node 15: 2 edges  
Node 18: 2 edges  
Node 0: 3 edges  
Node 1: 3 edges  
Node 17: 3 edges  
Node 7: 4 edges  
Node 3: 5 edges  
Node 10: 5 edges  
Node 12: 5 edges  
Node 11: 6 edges  
Node 16: 6 edges  
Node 19: 6 edges  
Node 4: 7 edges  
Node 14: 7 edges  
Node 8: 8 edges  
Node 9: 8 edges  

After going through the edges while considering the sorted nodes, we find a total of 26 triangles:  
[26]  

The unique triangles found are:

<0, 7, 14>  
<15, 3, 14>  
<18, 2, 1>
