Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges based on the given information:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, we will sort the vertices by their degree in ascending order: 
0 (degree 2)
1 (degree 3)
7 (degree 3)
8 (degree 4)
5 (degree 5)
6 (degree 4)
3 (degree 3)
2 (degree 4)
9 (degree 6)
4 (degree 6)

Based on the sorted vertices, we will count the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle <0, 5, 8>
- Triangle <1, 3, 9>
- Triangle <1, 8, 5>
- Triangle <2, 4, 9>
- Triangle <2, 5, 9>
- Triangle <2, 7, 9>
- Triangle <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle <4, 6, 9>
- Triangle <5, 6, 8>

There are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
