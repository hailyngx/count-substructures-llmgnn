Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 9) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 27) (21, 7) (21, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 0) (22, 26) (22, 9) (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 15) (9, 16) (9, 22) (9, 4) (9, 20) (28, 26) (28, 4) (28, 25) (17, 20) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 18) (20, 9) (20, 17) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 2) (15, 26) (15, 10) (29, 16) (29, 6) (29, 3) (8, 21) (8, 6) (19, 17) (19, 2) (19, 13) (25, 28) (25, 23) (27, 7) (27, 1) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 3) (6, 29) (6, 8) (6, 24) (6, 3) (24, 6) (24, 2) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 24) (1, 12) (1, 27) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 19) (18, 17) (18, 23) (18, 3) (23, 25) (23, 18) (23, 4) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 10) (4, 23) (3, 12) (3, 29) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the provided graph is as follows:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
(11, 5), (16, 3), (7, 4), (21, 2), (12, 5), (0, 2), (14, 4), (22, 2), (26, 4), (9, 4), (28, 3), (17, 4), (20, 2), (10, 3), (15, 2), (29, 3), (8, 2), (19, 3), (25, 2), (27, 2), (5, 3), (6, 4), (24, 2), (2, 4), (1, 2), (13, 3), (18, 3), (23, 3), (4, 4), (3, 5)

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
<0, 14> shares connection 0 and 14
<14, 7> shares connections 14 and 7
<22, 26> shares connections 22 and 26
<9, 16> shares connection 16
<9, 22> shares connection 9
<17, 20> shares connection 17
<10, 15> shares connection 15
<9, 20> shares connection 9 and 20
<10, 15> shares connection 10 and 15
<9, 20> shares connection 20
<10, 15> shares connection 10
<9, 26> shares connection 26
<2, 12> shares connection 2 and 12
<2, 24> shares connection 2
<1, 12> shares connection 1 and 12
<18, 23> shares connection 18
<4, 23> shares connection 4
<3, 12> shares connection 3 and 12

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 17, and the unique triangles found are: 
<0, 14, 7>, <22, 26, 28>, <9, 16, 11>, <9, 22, 26>, <17, 20, 9>, <10, 15, 26>, <10, 4, 23>, <2, 12, 13>, <2, 24, 6>, <1, 12, 7>, <18, 17, 5>, <18, 23, 25>, <4, 9, 16>, <4, 10, 15>, <3, 12, 2>, <3, 18, 17>, <3, 6, 29>
