Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 7) (15, 25) (15, 16) (27, 15) (27, 18) (3, 29) (25, 15) (25, 9) (25, 12) (20, 8) (20, 24) (20, 5) (20, 16) (8, 20) (8, 19) (13, 2) (13, 7) (5, 20) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 24) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 26) (14, 28) (14, 16) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 14) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 12) (1, 17) (1, 4) (17, 1) (17, 9) (17, 4) (18, 27) (18, 26) (18, 12) (26, 14) (26, 18) (26, 29) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 21) (21, 6) (21, 4) (21, 2) (21, 24) (19, 8) (24, 20) (24, 6) (24, 21) (24, 29) (22, 10) (23, 5) (23, 29) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 10) (2, 13) (2, 21) (9, 25) (9, 17) (29, 3) (29, 26) (29, 24) (29, 23) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 18) (10, 22) (10, 7) (10, 16) (16, 15) (16, 20) (16, 5) (16, 14) (16, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:
1. Sort the vertices by the number of connections in ascending order.
2. Relabel the vertices starting from 0 to 29 based on the sorted order.

The sorted vertices list:
Vertices: 3, 1, 9, 2, 19, 26, 17, 22, 13, 10, 12, 18, 27, 8, 20, 6, 29, 23, 5, 24, 11, 7, 21, 14, 4, 28, 16, 15, 0, 25

Now, we can check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. For the edge (15, 27):
   Vertex 15 (label 28) has 4 connections {25, 7, 16, 27}
   Vertex 27 (label 3) has 1 connection {15}
   They share a connection at vertex 27 which forms a triangle: <27, 15, 25>

2. For the edge (15, 7):
   Vertex 15 (label 28) has 4 connections {25, 7, 16, 27}
   Vertex 7 (label 21) has 3 connections {13, 11, 10}
   They share a connection at vertex 7 which forms a triangle: <7, 15, 25>

3. For the edge (15, 25):
   Vertex 15 (label 28) has 4 connections {25, 7, 16, 27}
   Vertex 25 (label 19) has 4 connections {12, 9, 15, 23}
   They share connections at vertices 15 and 25 which form triangles: <15, 25, 9> and <15, 25, 12>

... (continued for all edges)

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [18].
The unique triangles found are: <27, 15, 25>, <7, 15, 25>, <25, 15, 9>, <25, 15, 12>, <27, 15, 16>, <6, 21, 24>, <6, 21, 4>, <6, 21, 2>, <6, 24, 29>, <6, 24, 4>, <6, 24, 21>, <6, 24, 21>, <21, 6, 2>, <21, 6, 24>, <21, 24, 29>, <21, 24, 4>, <21, 24, 6>, <21, 24, 6>.
