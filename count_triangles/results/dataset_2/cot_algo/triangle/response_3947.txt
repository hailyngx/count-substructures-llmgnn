Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 11) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 15) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 0) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 19) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (11, 17) (11, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (0, 18) (0, 4) (0, 15) (0, 19) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 14) (16, 10) (16, 13) (19, 9) (19, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

1. Sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):
   - Node 5: degree 2
   - Node 6: degree 2
   - Node 18: degree 4
   - Node 7: degree 4
   - Node 17: degree 4
   - Node 12: degree 4
   - Node 19: degree 4
   - Node 16: degree 4
   - Node 14: degree 4
   - Node 0: degree 4
   - Node 11: degree 4
   - Node 1: degree 4
   - Node 9: degree 4
   - Node 2: degree 4
   - Node 13: degree 4
   - Node 8: degree 5
   - Node 4: degree 5
   - Node 3: degree 5
   - Node 10: degree 5
   - Node 15: degree 5

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degree (from 0 for the lowest degree to 19 for the highest degree):
   - Nodes 5 and 6: 0 and 1
   - Nodes 18, 7, 17, 12, 19, 16, 14, 0, 11, 1, 9, 2, 13: 2 to 13
   - Nodes 8, 4, 3, 10, 15: 14 to 18

3. Count the number of triangles:
   - Triangles: <1, 0, 5>, <10, 3, 15>, <7, 14, 1>

[Number of triangles: 3]
