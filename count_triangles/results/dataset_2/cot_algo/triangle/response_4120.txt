Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (9, 17) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 16) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 10) (13, 1) (13, 19) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 18) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 0) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 17) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 16) (2, 7) (2, 15) (2, 17) (12, 14) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 14) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 14) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 18) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 18) (16, 6) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 16) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to efficiently count the number of triangles in the provided graph.

First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 6
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 1
- Node 13: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 4

Vertices sorted by degree:
12, 5, 4, 9, 13, 2, 6, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 7, 8, 17, 18, 19, 0, 1, 3

Based on the sorted order, the re-labeled vertices are:
12 -> 0;  5 -> 1;  4 -> 2;  9 -> 3; 13 -> 4; 2 -> 5; 6 -> 6; 10 -> 7; 11 -> 8; 14 -> 9; 15 -> 10; 16 -> 11; 7 -> 12; 8 -> 13; 17 -> 14; 18 -> 15; 19 -> 16; 0 -> 17; 1 -> 18; 3 -> 19

Now, let's check for triangles (0-1-18, 0-9-3) and unique triangles found are <0, 1, 18> and <0, 9, 3>.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
