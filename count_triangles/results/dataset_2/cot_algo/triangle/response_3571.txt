Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 3) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 3) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 7) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 11) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 5) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 10) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 3) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in increasing order, then relabeling the nodes accordingly. 

After sorting the nodes, the new labels will be:
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 6 / Node 9 / Node 8 / Node 11 / Node 14: Degree 5
Node 3 / Node 10 / Node 1 / Node 12 / Node 13: Degree 6
Node 4: Degree 8

Based on the connections between the relabeled nodes, the triangles and their count are as follows:
Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 1, 12>
<1, 10, 7>
<1, 11, 13>
<3, 0, 12>
<5, 2, 7>
