Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 7) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges:
- 0: {6, 13, 12, 3}
- 1: {6, 11, 8, 7}
- 2: {8, 4, 7, 14}
- 3: {5, 9, 12, 0}
- 4: {5, 11, 8, 2}
- 5: {4, 3, 10}
- 6: {9, 1, 7, 0}
- 7: {6, 13, 12, 2, 1}
- 8: {13, 4, 2, 1}
- 9: {6, 14, 3, 12}
- 10: {5, 11, 14}
- 11: {10, 1, 12, 4}
- 12: {9, 11, 7, 0, 3}
- 13: {8, 14, 7, 0}
- 14: {9, 10, 13, 2}

Now, let's find the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Arrange the vertices based on the number of connections (degree):
{0, 5, 2, 13, 6, 9, 1, 4, 10, 11, 7, 12, 3, 8, 14}

2. Count the triangles:
- Triangles: [27]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 12>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 12, 3>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 7, 14>, <3, 5, 12>, <3, 9, 12>, <4, 5, 11>, <4, 8, 11>, <5, 10, 11>, <6, 7, 13>, <6, 9, 12>, <7, 12, 13>, <8, 11, 4>, <2, 8, 4>, <4, 7, 2>, <8, 1, 6>, <1, 7, 6>, <9, 12, 3>, <9, 14, 10>, <10, 5, 4>, <10, 11, 1>, <13, 7, 6>, <13, 8, 4>
