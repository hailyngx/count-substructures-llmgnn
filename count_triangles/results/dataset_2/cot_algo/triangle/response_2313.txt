Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 5) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 12) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Based on the number of connections for each node, the nodes are relabeled as follows:
0 - 4 connections
1 - 4 connections
2 - 4 connections
3 - 4 connections
4 - 6 connections
5 - 6 connections
6 - 5 connections
7 - 4 connections
9 - 6 connections
10 - 5 connections
11 - 5 connections
12 - 6 connections
13 - 3 connections
14 - 4 connections

Now, going through each edge and checking shared connections, we find the following triangles:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 11>
<0, 4, 12>
<0, 4, 10>
<0, 4, 13>
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 7, 10>
<0, 7, 11>
<0, 10, 6>
<0, 10, 3>
<0, 10, 4>
<0, 10, 11>
<0, 10, 12>
<0, 11, 4>
<0, 11, 5>
<0, 11, 10>
<1, 9, 13>
<1, 9, 14>
<1, 9, 12>
<1, 13, 5>
<1, 13, 14>
<1, 13, 0>
<1, 14, 5>
<1, 14, 12>
<2, 7, 5>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 7, 4>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 11>
<3, 9, 10>
<3, 9, 5>
<3, 10, 6>
<3, 10, 12>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 12>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 0>
<4, 7, 2>
<5, 2, 7>
<5, 2, 3>
<5, 2, 11>
<5, 13, 0>
<5, 13, 1>
<6, 9, 12>
<9, 12, 1>

Total number of triangles: [47]
