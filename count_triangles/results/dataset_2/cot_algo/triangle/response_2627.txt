Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 4) (27, 15) (27, 29) (27, 28) (27, 1) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 19) (9, 17) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 5) (25, 28) (25, 11) (10, 6) (10, 17) (10, 4) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 16) (8, 23) (8, 28) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 18) (23, 13) (4, 15) (4, 10) (4, 24) (18, 15) (18, 23) (18, 13) (29, 27) (29, 0) (29, 24) (14, 26) (14, 7) (14, 20) (26, 14) (26, 21) (26, 11) (5, 3) (5, 21) (5, 7) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 24) (22, 19) (22, 7) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 22) (28, 27) (28, 25) (28, 8) (12, 16) (16, 6) (16, 17) (16, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 22) (13, 23) (13, 18) (13, 2) (13, 21) (21, 26) (21, 5) (21, 13) (21, 24) (1, 27) (1, 20) (20, 14) (20, 1) (0, 8) (0, 29) (24, 4) (24, 29) (24, 2) (24, 21) (11, 15) (11, 25) (11, 26) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the nodes by their number of connections from least to most. After relabeling the vertices, we can count the triangles based on the shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

Based on the provided edges and vertices, let's label the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 22: 2 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 20: 2 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 12: 3 connections
- Node 13: 4 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 23: 4 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 21: 4 connections
- Node 24: 4 connections
- Node 29: 4 connections
- Node 10: 4 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 19: 4 connections
- Node 17: 4 connections
- Node 16: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 25: 2 connections
- Node 11: 3 connections
- Node 26: 3 connections
- Node 14: 3 connections
- Node 28: 3 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 18: 4 connections
- Node 27: 4 connections
- Node 15: 4 connections

Now, let's identify the triangles formed by the shared connections between the vertices of each edge and count them accordingly. 

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [38]. 

Some of the unique triangles found are:
- <15, 27, 1>
- <6 , 9, 16>
- <17, 9, 10>
- <8, 23, 18>
- <13, 21, 26>
- <2, 24, 21>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <4, 15, 10>
- <19, 2, 22>
- <0, 8, 29>
