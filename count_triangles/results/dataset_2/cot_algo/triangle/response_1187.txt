Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method follows the steps:

1. Calculate the degree of each node:
    - Node 0: degree 2
    - Node 1: degree 3
    - Node 2: degree 3
    - Node 3: degree 4
    - Node 4: degree 4
    - Node 5: degree 6
    - Node 6: degree 5
    - Node 7: degree 3
    - Node 8: degree 5
    - Node 9: degree 3

2. Sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order and relabel them:
    - Node 0: degree 2 -> Label 0
    - Node 1: degree 3 -> Label 1
    - Node 2: degree 3 -> Label 2
    - Node 7: degree 3 -> Label 3
    - Node 9: degree 3 -> Label 4
    - Node 6: degree 5 -> Label 5
    - Node 8: degree 5 -> Label 6
    - Node 3: degree 4 -> Label 7
    - Node 4: degree 4 -> Label 8
    - Node 5: degree 6 -> Label 9

3. Process the edges using the degree-based ordering rule:
    - Only consider edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections.
    - Check for shared connections to find triangles.
