Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and the given 40 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- 0: {9, 7, 3, 8, 2}
- 1: {5, 4, 2}
- 2: {5, 9, 1, 3, 0}
- 3: {4, 0, 2}
- 4: {3, 1, 6}
- 5: {9, 2, 8, 1, 7}
- 6: {4, 7, 8}
- 7: {5, 9, 0, 6, 8}
- 8: {5, 7, 0, 6}
- 9: {5, 2, 7, 0}

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Node Degrees: [(0, 5), (1, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (6, 3), (8, 3), (5, 5), (7, 5), (9, 4), (2, 5)]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

Triangles: [<0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 2>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2>, 8, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 2, 5>, <4, 6, 7>]

Total number of triangles: [11]
