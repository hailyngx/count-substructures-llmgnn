Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to Node 8
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 4, 5, 7

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

Sorted Nodes by their number of connections (degrees):
0 (1), 7 (4), 9 (3), 2 (4), 6 (4), 8 (5), 4 (4), 5 (5), 3 (5), 1 (5)

Count of triangles []: [7]
Unique triangles <> found:
