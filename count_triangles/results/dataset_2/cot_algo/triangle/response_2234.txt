Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 2) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 13) (10, 0) (10, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (14, 10, 3, 11)
- 1: (5, 11, 13)
- 2: (6, 4, 7, 12, 13)
- 3: (5, 4, 0, 11)
- 4: (7, 12, 13, 3, 2)
- 5: (8, 1, 3)
- 6: (9, 2, 11, 8)
- 7: (4, 11, 2, 8, 9)
- 8: (5, 9, 6, 7, 10)
- 9: (6, 8, 13, 7, 12)
- 10: (0, 8)
- 11: (6, 7, 0, 3, 1)
- 12: (9, 4, 14, 2)
- 13: (9, 4, 1, 2)
- 14: (0, 12)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

Vertices sorted by degree (from least to most):
0 (4), 1 (3), 10 (2), 5 (3), 2 (5), 3 (5), 4 (5), 7 (5), 8 (5), 9 (5), 6 (4), 11 (5), 12 (4), 13 (4), 14 (2)

Triangles:
Total number of triangles: [15]

Unique triangles:
<1, 4, 13>
<1, 2, 13>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 13>
<1, 13, 4>
<1, 13, 2>
<0, 2, 12>
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 12, 2>
<0, 14, 2>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 11>
<3, 7, 4>
<3, 11, 4>
