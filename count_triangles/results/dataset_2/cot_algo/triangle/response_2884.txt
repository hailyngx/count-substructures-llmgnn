Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly. 

After sorting the nodes by their degrees, the new labels are: 
Node 5 (degree 3)
Node 0 (degree 4)
Node 3 (degree 4)
Node 2 (degree 4)
Node 8 (degree 3)
Node 6 (degree 5)
Node 7 (degree 4)
Node 9 (degree 4)
Node 1 (degree 5)
Node 4 (degree 5)

Now, focusing on edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can identify the triangles:

Triangles:
<[0, 2, 5]>
<[0, 2, 9]>
<[0, 5, 6]>
<[1, 3, 6]>
<[1, 3, 7]>
<[1, 5, 6]>
<[1, 5, 7]>
<[2, 3, 9]>
<[4, 6, 9]>
<[4, 6, 7]>
<[4, 7, 9]>

Total number of triangles: [11]
