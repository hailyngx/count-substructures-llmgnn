Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 12) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 4) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 13) (13, 0) (13, 9) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 
- 0: 12, 4, 13, 9
- 1: 11, 6, 2, 7, 4
- 2: 5, 8, 12, 1, 3
- 3: 5, 2, 12, 14, 4
- 4: 0, 1, 3, 9
- 5: 6, 2, 8, 3, 14
- 6: 10, 5, 1, 14, 8
- 7: 8, 12, 9, 1
- 8: 11, 5, 6, 2, 7
- 9: 11, 7, 0, 4, 13
- 10: 6
- 11: 1, 9, 8
- 12: 2, 7, 0, 3
- 13: 0, 9
- 14: 5, 6, 3

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in this graph. Let's proceed with the calculations and output the result once done.
