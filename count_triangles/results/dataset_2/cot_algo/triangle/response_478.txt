Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 15) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 18) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 17) (2, 15) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 10) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 13) (11, 3) (11, 0) (7, 6) (7, 13) (15, 1) (15, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 6) (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 10) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 17) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 5) (16, 8) (16, 17) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 19) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 20 nodes and the given 60 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
- 0: {3, 11, 14}
- 1: {3, 15}
- 2: {9, 15, 17, 18}
- 3: {0, 1, 11, 18, 19}
- 4: {9, 10, 18}
- 5: {9, 10, 16}
- 6: {7, 8, 17}
- 7: {6, 13}
- 8: {6, 16, 19}
- 9: {2, 4, 5, 13}
- 10: {4, 5, 19}
- 11: {0, 3}
- 12: {13}
- 13: {7, 9, 12, 14}
- 14: {0, 13}
- 15: {1, 2}
- 16: {5, 8, 17}
- 17: {2, 6, 16}
- 18: {2, 3, 4}
- 19: {3, 8, 10}

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

Nodes sorted by degree:
{12, 7, 1, 0, 11, 14, 10, 5, 4, 15, 17, 6, 8, 2, 18, 13, 19, 9, 3, 16}

Let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 11]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 18>
<0, 11, 3>
<0, 13, 14>
<2, 3, 18>
<4, 9, 13>
<4, 9, 18>
<5, 9, 10>
<6, 7, 13>
<6, 8, 16>
<8, 16, 17>
