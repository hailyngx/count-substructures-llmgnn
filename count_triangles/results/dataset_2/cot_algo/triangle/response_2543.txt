Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 25) (9, 20) (1, 10) (1, 23) (1, 7) (21, 16) (21, 15) (2, 3) (29, 26) (29, 25) (29, 14) (12, 27) (12, 20) (12, 11) (12, 23) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 7) (27, 19) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 26) (16, 21) (16, 22) (16, 23) (17, 8) (17, 25) (17, 24) (25, 9) (25, 29) (25, 17) (25, 19) (25, 28) (19, 27) (19, 25) (19, 22) (19, 20) (22, 16) (22, 19) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 28) (26, 29) (26, 0) (26, 3) (6, 23) (20, 9) (20, 12) (20, 19) (14, 29) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 24) (14, 15) (18, 14) (24, 4) (24, 17) (24, 14) (3, 2) (3, 27) (3, 4) (3, 26) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 13) (11, 15) (13, 10) (13, 11) (23, 1) (23, 12) (23, 16) (23, 6) (28, 25) (28, 10) (15, 21) (15, 14) (15, 11) (7, 1) (7, 27) 

Response:
The list of edges for the given graph is provided. Let's construct the graph first. 

After constructing the graph, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles. 

The total number of triangles will be provided in brackets [] and the unique triangles found will be listed inside <>.

Let's begin the construction of the graph and counting of triangles.
