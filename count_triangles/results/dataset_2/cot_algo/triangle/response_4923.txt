Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 0) (15, 23) (15, 21) (27, 22) (27, 28) (27, 26) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 9) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 1) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 29) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 6) (20, 0) (20, 3) (1, 17) (1, 26) (1, 25) (1, 5) (26, 27) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 21) (26, 16) (5, 1) (5, 26) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 11) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 29) (28, 27) (28, 24) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 25) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 23) (21, 15) (21, 26) (21, 9) (21, 22) (3, 20) (3, 22) (14, 8) (16, 4) (16, 26) (16, 8) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 24) (24, 28) (24, 8) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 25) (25, 1) (25, 12) (25, 19) (25, 23) (23, 15) (23, 13) (23, 25) (22, 27) (22, 21) (22, 3) (29, 18) (29, 11) (29, 19) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 21) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows these steps:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections from least to most.
2. Relabel the vertices accordingly.
3. For each edge, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
4. Check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge; these shared connections form triangles.
5. Count the number of triangles.

Let's apply this method to the given graph:

Sorted vertices by connections (degree):
Nodes (0, 3, 5, 7, 10, 4, 13, 14, 9, 6, 11, 28, 17, 20, 22, 27, 1, 16, 18, 19, 24, 2, 8, 12, 15, 21, 23, 25, 26, 29)
