Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 8) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 17) (0, 8) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (6, 7) (6, 13) (15, 9) (19, 4) (19, 9) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 10) (9, 16) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 13) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 17) (16, 9) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (17, 0) (17, 18) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method can be used to count triangles in this graph. 

Let's first sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then relabel them accordingly:

Vertices sorted by degree:
(4, 7, 19) - degree: 3
(6, 13) - degree: 2
(2, 10, 11, 18) - degree: 4
(1, 3, 12, 17) - degree: 4
(0, 5, 8, 9, 14, 16) - degree: 6
(15) - degree: 1

Relabeled vertices:
1 -> 0
3 -> 1
12 -> 2
17 -> 3
0 -> 4
5 -> 5
8 -> 6
9 -> 7
14 -> 8
16 -> 9
15 -> 10
6 -> 11
13 -> 12
2 -> 13
10 -> 14
11 -> 15
18 -> 16
7 -> 17
19 -> 18

Now, let's find the triangles:

Triangles [<vertex1>, <vertex2>, <vertex3>]:
[<5, 0, 2>]
[<5, 0, 14>]
[<7, 1, 14>]
[<9, 2, 12>]
[<9, 2, 0>]
[<9, 2, 14>]
[<9, 2, 15>]
[<9, 5, 0>]
[<9, 12, 14>]
[<9, 12, 0>]
[<9, 14, 0>]
[<11, 7, 12>]
[<11, 12, 6>]
[<11, 12, 13>]
[<16, 7, 2>]
[<16, 7, 3>]
[<16, 7, 11>]
[<16, 7, 18>]
[<16, 2, 3>]
[<16, 2, 11>]
[<16, 2, 18>]
[<16, 3, 11>]
[<16, 11, 18>]

Total number of triangles: [23]
