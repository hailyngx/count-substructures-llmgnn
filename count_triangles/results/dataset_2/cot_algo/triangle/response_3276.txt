Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 15) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 4) (17, 14) (17, 1) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 14) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 15) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 1) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 19) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 15) (8, 4) (1, 17) (1, 18) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 13) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 19) (16, 1) (16, 12) (16, 3) (12, 13) (12, 16) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 13) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 16) 

Response:
The nodes and their connections can be represented as follows:
- Node 0: 7, 2, 18, 15
- Node 1: 17, 18, 15, 16, 13
- Node 2: 0, 9, 15
- Node 3: 4, 5, 9, 16
- Node 4: 8, 10, 17, 3
- Node 5: 18, 13, 3
- Node 6: 19
- Node 7: 0, 11, 15
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 2, 3
- Node 10: 4, 14
- Node 11: 7, 14
- Node 12: 13, 16
- Node 13: 5, 1, 12, 19
- Node 14: 17, 11, 19, 10
- Node 15: 7, 2, 0, 1
- Node 16: 1, 12, 3
- Node 17: 4, 14, 1
- Node 18: 5, 0, 1
- Node 19: 14, 6, 13

Considering the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 6: 0 connections
- Nodes 8, 9, 10, 16, 18: 1 connection
- Nodes 1, 5, 11, 12: 2 connections
- Nodes 0, 2, 13, 15: 4 connections
- Nodes 4, 7, 14, 17: 4 connections
- Nodes 3, 19: 4 connections

Using the given edges and the degree-based ordering, we can count the number of triangles and unique triangles as follows:
- Number of triangles: [20]
- Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 9>, <0, 2, 15>, <0, 7, 15>, <1, 13, 19>, <1, 15, 18>, <3, 5, 13>, <3, 4, 17>, <3, 9, 16>, <4, 10, 14>, <5, 13, 19>, <7, 11, 14>, <13, 14, 19>, <13, 15, 1>, <15, 1, 17>
