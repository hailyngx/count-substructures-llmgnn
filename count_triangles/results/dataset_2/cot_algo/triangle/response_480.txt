Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) from least to most. The sorted node labels will be as follows: 

Node 9 (Degree 4)
Node 1 (Degree 3)
Node 3 (Degree 3)
Node 8 (Degree 4)
Node 5 (Degree 4)
Node 0 (Degree 4)
Node 4 (Degree 5)
Node 7 (Degree 5)
Node 6 (Degree 5)
Node 2 (Degree 4)

Now, we will analyze each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

1. Edge (5, 9): Node 5 has connections with Node 2, Node 6, Node 7
2. Edge (5, 6): Node 5 has connections with Node 7, Node 9
3. Edge (5, 2): Node 5 has connections with Node 6, Node 7
4. Edge (5, 7): Node 5 has connections with Node 6, Node 2
5. Edge (9, 4): Node 9 has connections with Node 0, Node 7
6. Edge (9, 7): Node 9 has connections with Node 0
7. Edge (4, 8): Node 4 has connections with Node 7
8. Edge (4, 0): Node 4 has connections with Node 8, Node 1
9. Edge (7, 8): Node 7 has connections with Node 6

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8], and the unique triangles are <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 9, 4>, <4, 0, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 5>, <7, 5, 6>, <7, 5, 9>.
