Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: 3, 2, 4, 8
- 1: 2, 4, 6, 9
- 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 9
- 3: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8
- 4: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
- 5: 2, 3, 9
- 6: 1, 3, 4, 7
- 7: 4, 6
- 8: 0, 3, 4, 9
- 9: 1, 2, 5, 8

Next step is to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices sorted with increasing number of connections: 7, 5, 0, 1, 7, 6, 3, 4, 9, 8

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:

- 0 --> 0
- 1 --> 1
- 2 --> 2
- 3 --> 3
- 4 --> 4
- 5 --> 5
- 6 --> 6
- 7 --> 7
- 8 --> 8
- 9 --> 9

Checking each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the triangles as follows:

- Shared connections between (0, 3) and (0, 8): Triangle <0, 3, 8>
- Shared connections between (0, 2) and (0, 3): Triangle <0, 2, 3>
- Shared connections between (0, 2) and (0, 8): Triangle <0, 2, 8>
- Shared connections between (1, 2) and (1, 4): Triangle <1, 2, 4>
- Shared connections between (2, 3) and (2, 5): Triangle <2, 3, 5>
- Shared connections between (2, 1) and (2, 3): Triangle <1, 2, 3>
- Shared connections between (2, 1) and (2, 4): Triangle <1, 2, 4>
- Shared connections between (3, 4) and (3, 8): Triangle <3, 4, 8>
- Shared connections between (4, 6) and (4, 8): Triangle <4, 6, 8>
- Shared connections between (4, 7) and (4, 6): Triangle <4, 7, 6>
- Shared connections between (8, 4) and (8, 9): Triangle <4, 8, 9>
- Shared connections between (9, 1) and (9, 8): Triangle <1, 9, 8>

Considering all the unique triangles found, the total number of triangles is [12].
