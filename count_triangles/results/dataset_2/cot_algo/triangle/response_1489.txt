Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 11) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 12) (8, 15) (8, 5) (1, 16) (17, 16) (17, 0) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 16) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 18) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 7) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 18) (2, 10) (2, 19) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 18) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degrees is as follows:
(1) 16: 3 connections
(2) 1: 0 connections
(3) 2: 0 connections
(4) 4: 1 connection
(5) 12: 1 connection
(6) 9: 2 connections
(7) 3: 3 connections
(8) 7: 3 connections
(9) 11: 3 connections
(10) 8: 4 connections
(11) 13: 4 connections
(12) 19: 4 connections
(13) 18: 4 connections
(14) 6: 4 connections
(15) 5: 4 connections
(16) 0: 5 connections
(17) 10: 5 connections
(18) 14: 5 connections
(19) 15: 5 connections
(20) 17: 6 connections

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are: <5, 10, 15>, <7, 0, 16>, <13, 10, 14>, <14, 11, 13>, <14, 11, 15>, <14, 13, 18>, <14, 18, 13>, <14, 18, 6>.
