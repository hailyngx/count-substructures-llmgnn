Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 0) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 13) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) 

Response:
The given graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. Let's further analyze the graph to count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The vertices sorted by their degrees are: 

Node 6: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 12: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 5
Node 10: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 6
Node 11: Degree 6
Node 5: Degree 7
Node 14: Degree 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles by examining the lower-labeled vertex in each edge to prevent double-counting. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [38].

The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<5, 4, 9>, <5, 10, 3>, <5, 4, 14>, <5, 14, 3>, <5, 3, 10>, <5, 14, 10>, <5, 10, 14>, <9, 4, 2>, <9, 4, 13>, <4, 7, 11>, <4, 11, 13>, <7, 1, 12>, <10, 3, 14>, <10, 8, 14>, <3, 14, 2>, <3, 10, 11>, <3, 11, 13>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 13, 2>, <7, 1, 12>, <7, 8, 10>, <7, 11, 12>, <1, 12, 11>, <1, 7, 4>, <11, 0, 6>, <11, 0, 8>, <11, 0, 12>, <6, 0, 8>, <2, 13, 14>, <2, 14, 8>, <8, 0, 12>, <14, 12, 0>, <14, 13, 2>, <13, 11, 12>, <13, 14, 12>, <13, 14, 2>, <0, 6, 8>.
