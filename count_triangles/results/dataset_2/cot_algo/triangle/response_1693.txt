Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 29) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 20) (9, 5) (18, 22) (18, 7) (23, 13) (23, 0) (24, 6) (24, 8) (24, 20) (4, 13) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 24) (8, 4) (8, 29) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 19) (21, 17) (28, 21) (28, 3) (28, 1) (28, 20) (1, 28) (1, 17) (1, 25) (17, 21) (17, 1) (17, 2) (17, 7) (26, 11) (26, 16) (19, 5) (19, 21) (19, 2) (10, 13) (10, 21) (10, 14) (3, 13) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 24) (6, 4) (12, 16) (12, 15) (16, 26) (16, 12) (16, 27) (16, 20) (11, 26) (11, 14) (11, 27) (11, 29) (14, 10) (14, 11) (0, 23) (0, 3) (0, 25) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 3) (7, 18) (7, 17) (7, 15) (15, 12) (15, 7) (25, 1) (25, 0) (27, 21) (27, 16) (27, 11) (20, 5) (20, 24) (20, 28) (20, 16) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 11) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes with 90 edges. Let's construct the graph with the provided edge information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges:
- 0: {23, 25}
- 1: {17, 28}
- 2: {3, 17, 19}
- 3: {0, 2, 13, 28}
- 4: {6, 8, 13}
- 5: {9, 19, 20}
- 6: {4, 24}
- 7: {15, 17, 18}
- 8: {4, 8, 24, 29}
- 9: {5}
- 10: {13, 14, 21}
- 11: {14, 26, 27, 29}
- 12: {15, 16}
- 13: {3, 4, 10, 22, 23}
- 14: {10, 11}
- 15: {7, 12}
- 16: {12, 16, 20, 26, 27}
- 17: {1, 2, 7, 21}
- 18: {7, 22}
- 19: {2, 5, 21}
- 20: {5, 16, 24, 28}
- 21: {10, 17, 19, 27, 28}
- 22: {13, 18, 29}
- 23: {13}
- 24: {6, 8, 20}
- 25: {0, 1}
- 26: {11, 16}
- 27: {11, 21, 26}
- 28: {1, 3, 20, 21}
- 29: {8, 11, 22}

Next, we will calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
