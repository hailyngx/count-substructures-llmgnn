Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 3), (9, 1), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 2), (4, 6), (4, 3), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 8), (7, 1), (6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 8), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 1), (0, 3), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 9), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 0), (1, 2), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 0), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1)}

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degrees:
Node degrees: {0: 3, 1: 6, 2: 4, 3: 3, 4: 5, 5: 3, 6: 4, 7: 4, 8: 5, 9: 3}
Sorted nodes: [0, 3, 5, 9, 2, 6, 7, 8, 4, 1]

Using Degree-Based Ordering to count triangles (shared connections between two vertices of each edge):
Triangles:
