Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 2) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 12) (8, 18) (4, 1) (4, 15) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 7) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 9) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 13) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 1) (1, 4) (1, 19) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 0) (13, 7) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 12) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 12) (10, 9) (10, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the number of triangles in this graph.
After sorting the vertices by their degrees (number of connections), we have the following labels for the vertices:

Vertex 11: 1 connection
Vertex 16: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 14: 2 connections
Vertex 17: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 18: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 15: 3 connections
Vertex 13: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 10: 2 connections
Vertex 12: 4 connections
Vertex 19: 5 connections

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Checking (11, 16) → Vertex 11 has 1 connection, Vertex 16 has 2 connections. Proceed because Vertex 11 has fewer connections.
Checking (16, 11) → Skipped because it's the same as (11, 16).
Checking (16, 2) → Vertex 16 has 2 connections, Vertex 2 has 4 connections. Proceed.
Checking (5, 9) → Vertex 5 and Vertex 9 both have 4 connections each. Skip.
Checking (5, 19) → Vertex 5 has 4 connections, Vertex 19 has 5 connections. Proceed.
Checking (5, 15) → Skipped due to equal connections.
Checking (5, 3) → Proceed.
Checking (9, 10) → Skip.
Checking (9, 7) → Proceed.
Checking (14, 17) → Proceed.
Checking (14, 19) → Proceed.
Checking (17, 3) → Proceed.
Checking (17, 2) → Proceed.
Checking (2, 8) → Proceed.
Checking (2, 6) → Proceed.
Checking (8, 19) → Proceed.
Checking (8, 12) → Proceed.
Checking (4, 1) → Proceed.
Checking (4, 15) → Proceed.
Checking (18, 8) → Proceed.
Checking (18, 19) → Proceed.
Checking (18, 7) → Proceed.
Checking (0, 7) → Proceed.
Checking (7, 13) → Proceed.
Checking (19, 1) → Proceed.
Checking (19, 14) → Proceed.
Checking (19, 18) → Proceed.
Checking (1, 15) → Proceed.
Checking (3, 6) → Proceed.
Checking (3, 12) → Proceed.
Checking (6, 10) → Proceed.
Checking (10, 12) → Skip.

After following the method, we find the total number of triangles inside brackets [2]. 
The unique triangles found are <5, 7, 9> and <2, 17, 19>.
