Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 9) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
The degree of each node in the given graph is as follows:
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 5
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 6

Since the nodes are labeled according to their degrees, let's check for triangles.

Triangles:
<0, 6, 14>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 12>
<2, 3, 10>
<2, 6, 10>
<2, 7, 10>
<3, 9, 10>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 13>
<4, 7, 10>
<5, 6, 7>
<8, 11, 14>
<9, 10, 14>
<9, 13, 14>
<10, 11, 14>
<10, 12, 14>

There are a total of 16 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
