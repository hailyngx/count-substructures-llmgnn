Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 1) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by number of connections (degree):
5(4), 9(3), 7(5), 12(4), 0(5), 14(4), 13(3), 8(5), 1(4), 6(5), 11(5), 2(6), 3(4), 10(2), 4(1).

Edges sorted by lowest label:
(1, 5), (0, 5), (6, 12), (3, 12), (3, 0), (5, 9), (2, 9), (4, 2), (7, 12), (11, 7), (6, 14), (8, 14), (1, 13), (7, 13), (10, 7), (6, 7), (2, 7), (0, 7), (1, 6), (8, 6), (11, 6), (3, 6), (6, 10), (7, 2), (0, 2), (2, 5), (0, 1), (0, 11), (8, 11).
