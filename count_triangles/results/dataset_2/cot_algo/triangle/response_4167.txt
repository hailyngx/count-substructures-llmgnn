Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 2) (16, 10) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 18) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 17) (8, 13) (8, 19) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 18) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 5) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 19) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 10) (12, 3) (12, 19) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 18) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 14) (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 1) (9, 18) (9, 2) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 9) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 5) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 0) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be followed to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 16 - Label 0
Node 12 - Label 1
Node 2 - Label 2
Node 9 - Label 3
Node 18 - Label 4
Node 1 - Label 5
Node 6 - Label 6
Node 14 - Label 7
Node 7 - Label 8
Node 5 - Label 9
Node 15 - Label 10
Node 10 - Label 11
Node 17 - Label 12
Node 19 - Label 13
Node 3 - Label 14
Node 4 - Label 15
Node 13 - Label 16
Node 8 - Label 17
Node 0 - Label 18
Node 11 - Label 19

Looking at the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can identify the triangles formed:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 12>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 9, 18>
<1, 9, 14>
<1, 9, 5>
<2, 5, 0>
<2, 9, 18>
<4, 6, 15>
<4, 6, 1>
<4, 6, 15>
<4, 7, 5>
<4, 19, 12>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 10, 7>
<5, 14, 3>
<7, 10, 17>
<13, 8, 19>
<15, 10, 17>
<16, 10, 17>
<19, 18, 3>

Total number of triangles: [19]
