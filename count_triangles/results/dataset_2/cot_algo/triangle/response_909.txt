Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 2) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 2) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 14) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree (number of connections) are as follows:
Vertices: 4, 7, 14, 3, 9, 12, 10, 0, 5, 8, 11, 6, 1, 13, 2

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (4, 7): Vertex 4 has 5 connections, and Vertex 7 has 5 connections.
2. Edge (4, 12): Vertex 4 has 5 connections, and Vertex 12 has 4 connections.
3. Edge (4, 0): Vertex 4 has 5 connections, and Vertex 0 has 5 connections.
4. Edge (4, 5): Vertex 4 has 5 connections, and Vertex 5 has 4 connections.
5. Edge (4, 14): Vertex 4 has 5 connections, and Vertex 14 has 4 connections.
6. Edge (7, 12): Vertex 7 has 5 connections, and Vertex 12 has 4 connections.
7. Edge (7, 0): Vertex 7 has 5 connections, and Vertex 0 has 5 connections.
8. Edge (7, 5): Vertex 7 has 5 connections, and Vertex 5 has 4 connections.
9. Edge (6, 9): Vertex 6 has 3 connections, and Vertex 9 has 4 connections.
10. Edge (6, 14): Vertex 6 has 3 connections, and Vertex 14 has 4 connections.
11. Edge (6, 10): Vertex 6 has 3 connections, and Vertex 10 has 4 connections.
12. Edge (9, 7): Vertex 9 has 4 connections, and Vertex 7 has 5 connections.
13. Edge (9, 6): Vertex 9 has 4 connections, and Vertex 6 has 3 connections.
14. Edge (9, 3): Vertex 9 has 4 connections, and Vertex 3 has 5 connections.
15. Edge (8, 13): Vertex 8 has 5 connections, and Vertex 13 has 2 connections.

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is 15.

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 7, 12>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 9, 7>, <4, 9, 3>, <4, 14, 7>, <4, 14, 3>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <7, 0, 12>, <7, 5, 8>, <12, 3, 9>, <6, 9, 3>, <6, 14, 4>, <9, 3, 14>, <8, 13, 1>.
