Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph and identify the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

First, let's sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices sorted by degree:
1. Node 7 - Degree: 2
2. Node 8 - Degree: 3
3. Node 9 - Degree: 3
4. Node 0 - Degree: 4
5. Node 3 - Degree: 4
6. Node 5 - Degree: 4
7. Node 2 - Degree: 5
8. Node 6 - Degree: 5
9. Node 4 - Degree: 6
10. Node 1 - Degree: 6

Now, we will label the vertices based on their sorted order:
Node 7 -> A
Node 8 -> B
Node 9 -> C
Node 0 -> D
Node 3 -> E
Node 5 -> F
Node 2 -> G
Node 6 -> H
Node 4 -> I
Node 1 -> J

After relabeling, the edges become:
(A, B) (A, J) (B, C) (C, I) (C, G) (D, F) (D, H) (D, G) (D, J) (E, I) (F, I) (F, J) (G, J) (H, I)

Now, let's count the triangles formed by using the connections between lower labeled vertices:
1. <D, F, H>
2. <D, G, H>
3. <D, G, J>
4. <F, I, J>

Total number of triangles: [4]
