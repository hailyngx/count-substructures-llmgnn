Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following labels for the nodes: 
Node 0: 5 edges
Node 13: 5 edges
Node 12: 2 edges
Node 7: 5 edges
Node 4: 4 edges
Node 11: 4 edges
Node 10: 4 edges
Node 8: 4 edges
Node 14: 4 edges
Node 3: 4 edges
Node 1: 4 edges
Node 9: 4 edges
Node 6: 5 edges
Node 5: 5 edges
Node 2: 3 edges

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now iterate over the edges to count the number of triangles. 

Number of triangles: [17]
