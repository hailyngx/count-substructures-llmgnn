Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 11) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 14) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 12) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be depicted as shown below:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}  
Edges:  
(4, 12), (4, 13), (4, 0),  
(7, 14), (7, 9), (7, 1),  
(1, 7), (1, 11), (1, 2), (1, 10), (1, 13),  
(3, 0), (3, 10), (3, 13), (3, 9), (3, 5),  
(6, 9), (6, 14), (6, 12), (6, 8),  
(9, 7), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 14),  
(5, 3), (5, 13), (5, 11),  
(0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 14), (0, 2),  
(14, 7), (14, 6), (14, 9), (14, 0), (14, 13),  
(13, 4), (13, 1), (13, 3), (13, 5), (13, 14),  
(8, 6), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11),  
(12, 4), (12, 6), (12, 2), (12, 11),  
(2, 1), (2, 0), (2, 12),  
(11, 1), (11, 5), (11, 8), (11, 12),  
(10, 1), (10, 3), (10, 8)

Now, let's apply Degree-Based Ordering to count the number of triangles and list them:

Vertices sorted by degree from lowest to highest:  
Nodes: {5, 8, 2, 10, 14, 12, 0, 6, 4, 7, 11, 9, 1, 3, 13}

Count of triangles [12]:  
Triangles:  
<5, 3, 13>  
<5, 11, 1>  
<5, 13, 4>  
<5, 11, 8>  
<8, 6, 14>  
<8, 6, 9>  
<8, 12, 2>  
<8, 11, 1>  
<12, 4, 13>  
<12, 4, 0>  
<12, 2, 1>  
<12, 11, 1>
