Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 2) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 5) (14, 11) (7, 16) (7, 6) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 15) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 9) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 11) (16, 3) (16, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 18) (18, 9) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (12, 11) (12, 15) (15, 5) (15, 12) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) 

Response:
The graph constructed from the given edges will look like below:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 5), (0, 10), (0, 17), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 11), (1, 13), (2, 3), (2, 10), (2, 11), (3, 6), (3, 13), (3, 16), (4, 13), (4, 17), (5, 8), (5, 15), (5, 19), (6, 7), (7, 16), (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 19), (9, 18), (9, 19), (10, 11), (10, 2), (11, 12), (11, 14), (12, 15), (13, 1), (13, 3), (13, 4), (14, 11), (15, 5), (15, 12), (16, 3), (16, 7), (17, 0), (17, 19), (17, 4), (18, 9), (19, 5), (19, 8), (19, 17)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes by degree: [4, 7, 10, 13, 13, 13, 13, 14, 14, 15, 17, 18, 18, 19, 20, 20, 21, 21, 21, 21]

Relabeled nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

Total triangles: [17]

Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 3>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 3, 11>, <1, 3, 9>, <3, 13, 4>, <3, 13, 4>, <1, 13, 4>, <1, 13, 4>, <3, 13, 1>, <3, 13, 1>, <1, 6, 3>, <1, 6, 3>, <13, 4, 17>, <13, 4, 17>, <0, 10, 17>, <0, 10, 17>
