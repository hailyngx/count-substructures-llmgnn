Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 4) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 10) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 10) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 13) (12, 1) (12, 6) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 9) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree and then labeling them accordingly.

The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4

By relabeling the nodes based on their degree in increasing order, we have:
- Node 1 -> Label 0
- Node 5 -> Label 1
- Node 12 -> Label 2
- Node 8 -> Label 3
- Node 2 -> Label 4
- Node 10 -> Label 5
- Node 6 -> Label 6
- Node 9 -> Label 7
- Node 4 -> Label 8
- Node 11 -> Label 9
- Node 13 -> Label 10
- Node 14 -> Label 11
- Node 7 -> Label 12
- Node 3 -> Label 13
- Node 0 -> Label 14

Now, we will analyze the edges while making sure that each triangle is counted only once.

By examining the edges and considering the labels, the total number of triangles is found to be [14].

Unique triangles found:
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 2, 14>
- <2, 9, 7>
- <2, 9, 13>
- <2, 10, 5>
- <4, 8, 10>
- <4, 11, 7>
- <6, 8, 14>
- <7, 9, 13>
- <7, 10, 8>
- <9, 11, 4>
- <9, 13, 6>
- <10, 11, 4>
- <10, 13, 6>
