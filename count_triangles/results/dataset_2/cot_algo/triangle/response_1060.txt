Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 5) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 0) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 1) (18, 13) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 9) (5, 17) (5, 14) (19, 18) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 16) (16, 17) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 15) (14, 5) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 2) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 3) (2, 15) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 1) (15, 16) (15, 2) (15, 13) (13, 18) (13, 1) (13, 15) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be visualized as follows:

```
0  -  8  -  4     13 - 1
|    |    |      |     |
12 -  7  - 18    15 - 2
|    |    |     |    |
16 -  3  - 14 - 5    9 - 11
|    |    |     |    |
|     6 - 17 - 10    19
```

After sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, we get the following relabeled vertices:

0(3) - 1(3) - 12(3) - 14(3) - 15(3) - 19(3) - 8(4) - 4(5) - 13(5) - 2(6) - 5(6) - 10(6) - 3(7) - 11(7) - 17(7) - 18(7) - 9(8) - 6(9) - 16(9) - 7(10)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles in the graph: 

Total number of triangles: [16]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 3, 7>
