Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (10, 9) (10, 12) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (11, 6) (11, 2) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(0, 6), (0, 9), (0, 14), (0, 8),
(1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 12), (1, 7),
(2, 9), (2, 3), (2, 13), (2, 11),
(3, 5), (3, 2), (3, 8),
(4, 5), (4, 12), (4, 1),
(5, 6), (5, 12), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 14),
(6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 11), (6, 0),
(7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 1), (7, 13), (7, 8),
(8, 0), (8, 14), (8, 3), (8, 7),
(9, 2), (9, 10), (9, 1), (9, 13), (9, 0),
(10, 9), (10, 12),
(11, 6), (11, 2),
(12, 5), (12, 4), (12, 10), (12, 1),
(13, 9), (13, 14), (13, 7), (13, 2),
(14, 5), (14, 0), (14, 8), (14, 13)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes Degree: 
{10: 1, 11: 1, 13: 4, 14: 4, 8: 4, 3: 3, 4: 3, 0: 4, 7: 4, 6: 5, 12: 4, 2: 4, 1: 5, 9: 5, 5: 6}

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will proceed with counting the triangles:

Triangles: [13] 
Unique triangles: <0, 6, 5>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 11>, <0, 9, 2>, <0, 9, 10>, <0, 9, 1>, <0, 9, 13>, <0, 9, 5>, <4, 1, 6>, <4, 1, 12>, <4, 1, 5>
