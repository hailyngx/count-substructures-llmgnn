Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 7) (1, 11) (1, 16) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 19) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 15) (8, 5) (8, 18) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (13, 4) (13, 2) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 12) (0, 18) (0, 19) (16, 1) (16, 12) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 18) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 18) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 7) (2, 13) (2, 9) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 9) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 10) (17, 7) (1, 11) (1, 16) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 15)
(11, 19) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 15) (8, 5) (8, 18) (5, 12) (13, 2) (15, 9) (0, 18)
(0, 19) (16, 12) (6, 10) (9, 7) (7, 17)

To count triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's sort the nodes by their number of connections, and then relabel the vertices accordingly:

Nodes sorted by degree: 17, 10, 18, 12, 15, 4, 9, 0, 19, 11, 5, 7, 1, 6, 8, 13, 3, 2, 14, 16

Now, let's analyze the edges:

(14, 17), (14, 6): Count 1 triangle <6, 14, 17>
(17, 10): No triangle
(17, 7): No triangle
(1, 11), (1, 16): No triangle
(3, 11): No triangle
(3, 19): No triangle
(3, 12): No triangle
(10, 15): Count 1 triangle <10, 15, 4>
(11, 19): Count 2 triangles <11, 19, 3>, <11, 19, 0>
(4, 9): No triangle
(4, 13): No triangle
(4, 15): No triangle
(8, 5): No triangle
(8, 18): No triangle
(5, 12): No triangle
(13, 2): No triangle
(15, 9): No triangle
(0, 18): No triangle
(0, 19): No triangle
(16, 12): No triangle
(6, 10): No triangle
(9, 7): No triangle
(7, 17): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [4]

The unique triangles found are:
<6, 14, 17>
<10, 15, 4>
<11, 19, 3>
<11, 19, 0>
