Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 14) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (1, 4) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 12) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as described below:

```
0: [7, 6, 8, 2]
1: [4]
2: [9, 4, 7, 13, 0]
3: [9, 6, 11, 14]
4: [7, 2, 10, 14, 1]
5: [9, 6, 12, 14]
6: [5, 9, 7, 3, 0]
7: [4, 0, 6, 2]
8: [13, 0, 12]
9: [5, 6, 2, 14, 3]
10: [4, 13, 14]
11: [3, 13, 12]
12: [5, 11, 8, 14]
13: [10, 11, 8, 2]
14: [5, 9, 4, 10, 3, 12]
```

Now, applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

1. Starting with the vertex with the least connections:
   Vertex 1: 1 connection
   Vertex 10: 1 connection
   Vertex 12: 1 connection
   Vertex 0: 4 connections

2. The only valid edge is between vertices 1 and 4: (4, 1)

3. Checking for shared connections between 1 and 4: [Initial vertex order (1, 4)]:
   Vertex 1 connections: [4]
   Vertex 4 connections: [7, 2, 10, 14, 1]
   
   Shared connections: [4]
   Hence, the triangle found: <1, 4, 7>

[Total number of triangles: [1]]
