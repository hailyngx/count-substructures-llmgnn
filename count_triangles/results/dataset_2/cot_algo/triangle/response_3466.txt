Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 12) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 1) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 12) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Here is the sorted list of nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes: 7, 5, 4, 9, 11, 14, 3, 6, 1, 10, 2, 12, 0, 13, 8

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed:

1. Edge (5, 9) -> Shared connections: None
2. Edge (5, 6) -> Shared connections: None
3. Edge (5, 11) -> Shared connections: None

33. Edge (0, 14) -> Shared connections: None
34. Edge (0, 12) -> Shared connections: None
35. Edge (14, 4) -> Shared connections: None
