Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 28) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 15) (21, 14) (2, 29) (2, 11) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 19) (22, 23) (22, 6) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 6) (4, 27) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 3) (15, 21) (15, 8) (15, 19) (20, 3) (20, 19) (20, 28) (20, 10) (6, 22) (6, 23) (6, 28) (28, 1) (28, 20) (28, 6) (28, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (24, 26) (26, 24) (26, 17) (27, 21) (27, 4) (27, 25) (27, 14) (19, 29) (19, 15) (19, 20) (19, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 17) (16, 4) (16, 10) (10, 20) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 9) (25, 2) (25, 23) (25, 27) (25, 9) (7, 29) (7, 19) (7, 9) (9, 10) (9, 25) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 13) (17, 26) (17, 0) (18, 10) (18, 11) (3, 8) (3, 20) (3, 9) (14, 21) (14, 27) (14, 13) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 12) (12, 11) (13, 28) (13, 9) (13, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. Let's relabel the nodes based on their degree:

Node 1 has degree 3
Node 2 has degree 3
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 3
Node 9 has degree 5
Node 10 has degree 4
Node 11 has degree 4
Node 12 has degree 1
Node 13 has degree 3
Node 14 has degree 3
Node 15 has degree 3
Node 16 has degree 2
Node 17 has degree 2
Node 18 has degree 2
Node 19 has degree 4
Node 20 has degree 4
Node 21 has degree 4
Node 22 has degree 2
Node 23 has degree 3
Node 24 has degree 1
Node 25 has degree 4
Node 26 has degree 2
Node 27 has degree 4
Node 28 has degree 4
Node 29 has degree 4

Now, we will list the triangles by following the method described earlier.

There are a total of [210] triangles in the graph. Some unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 21>
<0, 1, 28>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 17>
<0, 5, 17>
<1, 21, 15>
<1, 21, 27>
<1, 21, 28>
<2, 11, 8>
<2, 11, 18>
<2, 11, 12>
<2, 25, 23>
<2, 25, 27>
<2, 25, 9>
<3, 8, 15>
<3, 8, 19>
<3, 9, 13>
<3, 9, 20>
<3, 9, 25>
<3, 9, 7>
<4, 16, 10>
