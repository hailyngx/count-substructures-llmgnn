Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 1) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 0) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order:

Nodes sorted by the number of connections:  
Node 6: 0 connections  
Node 15: 0 connections  
Node 0: 3 connections  
Node 1: 3 connections   
Node 8: 3 connections  
Node 12: 3 connections  
Node 2: 4 connections  
Node 14: 4 connections  
Node 11: 5 connections  
Node 7: 5 connections  
Node 10: 5 connections  
Node 13: 5 connections  
Node 3: 6 connections  
Node 4: 6 connections  
Node 9: 6 connections  
Node 5: 6 connections  

Now, we iterate through each edge and only consider it if the node with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (5, 9): The lower labeled node is 5 (with 6 connections) so we skip.
2. Edge (5, 13): The lower labeled node is 5 (with 6 connections) so we skip.
3. Edge (5, 4): The lower labeled node is 4 (with 6 connections). Shared connections 7.
4. Edge (5, 3): The lower labeled node is 3 (with 6 connections). Shared connections 4, 11.
5. Edge (5, 10): The lower labeled node is 5 (with 6 connections) so we skip.
6. Edge (9, 11): The lower labeled node is 9 (with 6 connections). Shared connections 7, 13.
7. Edge (9, 10): The lower labeled node is 9 (with 6 connections). Shared connections 5.
8. Edge (9, 7): The lower labeled node is 7 (with 5 connections). Shared connections 13.
9. Edge (9, 13): The lower labeled node is 9 (with 6 connections). Shared connections 5.
and so on...

By following this method and counting the unique triangles found, the total number of triangles in the graph is:  
[7]

The unique triangles found are:  
<4, 7, 13>  
<3, 4, 11>  
<5, 7, 9>  
<5, 9, 13>  
<8, 10, 14>  
<1, 10, 11>  
<1, 11, 13>
