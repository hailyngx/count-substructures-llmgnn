Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 2) (17, 29) (17, 20) (17, 5) (7, 21) (7, 23) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 26) (21, 11) (21, 2) (22, 23) (22, 19) (23, 7) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 27) (10, 9) (11, 21) (8, 23) (8, 0) (1, 7) (1, 26) (1, 9) (1, 12) (26, 21) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 28) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 5) (29, 24) (19, 22) (19, 26) (19, 24) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 16) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 4) (28, 20) (20, 17) (20, 28) (20, 12) (20, 24) (16, 0) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 15) (4, 23) (4, 28) (4, 12) (12, 1) (12, 20) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (2, 14) (2, 21) (2, 6) (5, 17) (5, 29) (5, 16) (5, 12) (3, 12) (3, 6) (27, 23) (27, 29) (27, 13) (6, 2) (6, 3) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 24) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 18) (13, 27) (18, 16) (18, 15) (24, 29) (24, 19) (24, 20) (24, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort the nodes by their number of connections from least to most.

Here is the sorted list of nodes with their corresponding connections:
Node 13: 1 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 18: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 22: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 26: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 16: 5 connections
Node 19: 5 connections
Node 20: 5 connections
Node 21: 5 connections
Node 12: 5 connections
Node 5: 6 connections
Node 24: 6 connections
Node 28: 6 connections
Node 27: 6 connections
Node 29: 6 connections
Node 23: 7 connections

Now, we will count the triangles based on the sorted nodes and the given edges.
