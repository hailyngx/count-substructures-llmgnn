Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (12, 27) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 9) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 16) (8, 12) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 26) (8, 3) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 10) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 17) (28, 1) (28, 10) (9, 12) (9, 24) (9, 20) (22, 15) (22, 0) (4, 1) (4, 25) (18, 27) (18, 21) (26, 8) (5, 19) (5, 25) (5, 21) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (29, 7) (29, 25) (29, 10) (17, 11) (17, 20) (17, 6) (17, 24) (20, 9) (20, 17) (16, 27) (16, 21) (16, 15) (21, 18) (21, 5) (21, 16) (21, 2) (15, 22) (15, 19) (15, 16) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 0) (7, 19) (7, 29) (7, 24) (7, 14) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 8) (3, 2) (24, 8) (24, 9) (24, 17) (24, 7) (1, 28) (1, 4) (1, 2) (2, 21) (2, 3) (2, 1) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 6) (0, 25) (25, 4) (25, 5) (25, 29) (25, 0) (10, 23) (10, 28) (10, 29) (10, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. 

The sorted vertices based on their degree are:  

Vertex 2: degree 3  
Vertex 3: degree 3  
Vertex 18: degree 2  
Vertex 20: degree 2  
Vertex 22: degree 2  
Vertex 26: degree 2  
Vertex 28: degree 2  
Vertex 1: degree 2  
Vertex 4: degree 2  
Vertex 5: degree 4  
Vertex 6: degree 4  
Vertex 7: degree 4  
Vertex 9: degree 4  
Vertex 16: degree 4  
Vertex 24: degree 4  
Vertex 27: degree 4  
Vertex 19: degree 3  
Vertex 21: degree 4  
Vertex 29: degree 3  
Vertex 0: degree 4  
Vertex 8: degree 5  
Vertex 10: degree 5  
Vertex 11: degree 4  
Vertex 14: degree 5  

From the list above, we proceed with counting triangles based on the method described earlier.   

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [18].  
The unique triangles found are:  
<8, 9, 12>  
<0, 11, 17>  
<0, 6, 25>  
<0, 6, 22>  
<0, 25, 4>  
<8, 12, 27>  
<8, 12, 14>  
<8, 12, 9>  
<8, 12, 24>  
<8, 12, 26>  
<11, 17, 20>  
<11, 17, 24>  
<14, 6, 12>  
<5, 21, 16>  
<5, 21, 18>  
<5, 21, 2>  
<2, 1, 4>  
<25, 29, 7>
