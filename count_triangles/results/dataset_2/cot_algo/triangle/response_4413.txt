Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. 

The vertices sorted by their connections are: <0, 5, 9, 1, 8, 7, 2, 6, 3, 4>

Using the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections: 
- Looking at vertices 0 and 5, they share connections with vertices 4 and 7, forming triangles <0, 4, 5> and <0, 5, 7>.
- Vertices 0 and 9 share connections with vertices 7 and 8, forming two more triangles <0, 7, 9> and <0, 8, 9>.
- Vertices 1 and 6 share a connection with vertex 4, forming triangle <1, 4, 6>.
- Vertices 2 and 5 do not form any triangles as they have the same number of connections.
- Vertices 3 and 6 share connections with vertices 4 and 7, forming two triangles <3, 4, 6> and <3, 6, 7>. 

Total number of triangles: [5]
