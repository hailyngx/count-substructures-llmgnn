Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- 0: {9, 1, 3, 2, 8}
- 1: {7, 2, 0, 8}
- 2: {1, 8, 0, 3}
- 3: {6, 7, 0, 8}
- 4: {5, 6, 7, 5}
- 5: {9, 6, 8, 4}
- 6: {5, 9, 3, 4}
- 7: {9, 4, 3, 1}
- 8: {5, 1, 3, 2, 0}
- 9: {5, 6, 7, 0}

Now, let's employ the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Vertex 0, 1, 2, and 3 have a degree of 5.
- Vertex 8 has a degree of 4.
- Vertex 4, 7, and 9 have a degree of 4.
- Vertex 5 and 6 have a degree of 4.

Sorting the nodes based on their degrees from lowest to highest:
Vertices: 8, 4, 7, 9, 5, 6, 0, 1, 2, 3

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering on the edges:
- (8, 5): Forms a triangle with 0 and 1 <0, 1, 5>
- (4, 7): Forms a triangle with 6 and 9 <4, 6, 9>
- (7, 1): Forms a triangle with 4 and 3 <1, 3, 4>
- (9, 0): Forms a triangle with 8 and 5 <0, 5, 8>
- (5, 8): Forms a triangle with 0 and 3 <0, 3, 8>
- (6, 9): Forms a triangle with 4 and 7 <6, 7, 4>

Total number of triangles: [6]
