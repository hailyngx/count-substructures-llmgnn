- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 1
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 19: degree 3
- Node 21: degree 3
