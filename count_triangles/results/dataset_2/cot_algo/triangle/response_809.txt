Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. Here is the sorted list of vertices along with their connections:

Vertex 7: connected to 0, 1
Vertex 4: connected to 0, 8, 9
Vertex 5: connected to 0, 1, 3, 8
Vertex 3: connected to 0, 5, 6
Vertex 2: connected to 0, 6, 8, 9
Vertex 9: connected to 2, 4, 6, 8
Vertex 1: connected to 0, 5, 6, 7, 8
Vertex 6: connected to 1, 2, 3, 9
Vertex 8: connected to 1, 2, 4, 5, 9
Vertex 0: connected to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the triangles formed by shared connections in the graph:

- Triangle <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle <1, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
