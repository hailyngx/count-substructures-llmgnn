Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given 10 nodes and 40 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(0, 3, 5, 9)
(1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9)
(2, 4, 6)
(3, 6, 8, 9)
(4, 6, 7, 8)
(5, 7)
(6, 8, 9)
(7, 8, 9)

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method. We will relabel the nodes based on their degree:

Node 0: degree 4
Node 2: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 1: degree 6
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 7: degree 3
Node 9: degree 6

Since we have relabeled the nodes, let's proceed with counting the triangles:

Triangles: [<0, 3, 9>, <3, 6, 9>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
