Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 0), (5, 3), 
(9, 6), (9, 8), 
(6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 8), 
(4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), 
(7, 0), (7, 2), 
(2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 3), (2, 0), 
(8, 3), (8, 1), 
(0, 1)

Now, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees from least to most:

Vertices by degree: {4, 1, 7, 5, 9, 8, 6, 2, 3, 0}

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will process the edges as follows:

Triangles:
1. <9, 8, 6>
2. <3, 2, 0>

Total number of triangles: [2]
