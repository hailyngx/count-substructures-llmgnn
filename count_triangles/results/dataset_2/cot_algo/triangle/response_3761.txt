Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first using the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0 connects with: 7, 3, 1
- 1 connects with: 4, 9, 5, 2, 8, 0
- 2 connects with: 4, 6, 5, 1
- 3 connects with: 7, 6, 9, 0
- 4 connects with: 7, 2, 9, 1
- 5 connects with: 7, 2, 1
- 6 connects with: 7, 3, 2, 8
- 7 connects with: 4, 0, 3, 6, 5
- 8 connects with: 6, 9, 1
- 9 connects with: 4, 8, 3, 1

Now, let's order the vertices based on their degree:
0(3), 5(3), 8(3), 9(4), 3(4), 6(4), 2(4), 1(6), 7(5), 4(4)

Now, we will count the total number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <4, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [ 14 ]
