Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph constructed based on the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0 - 2
- 0 - 8
- 1 - 2
- 1 - 3
- 2 - 0
- 2 - 1
- 2 - 3
- 2 - 5
- 2 - 6
- 3 - 1
- 3 - 2
- 3 - 4
- 3 - 5
- 3 - 9
- 4 - 3
- 4 - 5
- 4 - 7
- 4 - 8
- 4 - 9
- 5 - 2
- 5 - 3
- 5 - 4
- 5 - 6
- 5 - 8
- 5 - 9
- 6 - 2
- 6 - 5
- 6 - 8
- 6 - 9
- 7 - 4
- 8 - 0
- 8 - 4
- 8 - 5
- 8 - 6
- 8 - 2
- 9 - 3
- 9 - 4
- 9 - 5
- 9 - 6

Now, we need to count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted by their degrees:
0 (degree 2), 1 (degree 2), 7 (degree 1), 9 (degree 4), 6 (degree 4), 7 (degree 1), 8 (degree 5), 3 (degree 5), 4 (degree 6), 5 (degree 6)

Triangles:
[10]
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 2, 3>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
