Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 20) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 25) (5, 12) (9, 17) (9, 24) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 27) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 27) (17, 21) (1, 26) (1, 19) (3, 28) (20, 11) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 22) (25, 11) (25, 16) (25, 20) (25, 23) (13, 11) (13, 4) (22, 20) (12, 5) (12, 21) (27, 14) (27, 17) (27, 10) (27, 19) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 15) (29, 17) (29, 4) (29, 18) (19, 1) (19, 27) (19, 26) (19, 4) (19, 6) (24, 9) (24, 26) (10, 27) (10, 7) (15, 26) (15, 0) (15, 18) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 23) (28, 3) (28, 18) (21, 17) (21, 12) (21, 8) (21, 23) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 19) (6, 7) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 6) (7, 18) (4, 13) (4, 29) (4, 19) (4, 23) (8, 20) (8, 21) (23, 25) (23, 0) (23, 21) (23, 4) (18, 29) (18, 15) (18, 28) (18, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:
Node degrees in ascending order:
0: 3
1: 2
2: 0
3: 2
4: 5
5: 2
6: 4
7: 4
8: 3
9: 3
10: 2
11: 5
12: 2
13: 2
14: 3
15: 3
16: 3
17: 5
18: 4
19: 5
20: 4
21: 4
22: 1
23: 4
24: 2
25: 4
26: 4
27: 4
28: 2
29: 3

By starting from the node with the lowest degree, we have the following ordering:
2: 0
22: 1
12: 2
28: 2
1: 2
3: 2
5: 2
9: 3
13: 2
24: 2
10: 2
0: 3
8: 3
15: 3
16: 3
18: 4
6: 4
7: 4
20: 4
21: 4
23: 4
26: 4
27: 4
4: 5
11: 5
17: 5
19: 5
25: 4
29: 3
14: 3

Counting the triangles:
Triangles: [<8, 21, 23>, <6, 19, 21>, <6, 7, 18>, <6, 11, 20>, <4, 23, 21>, <4, 23, 0>, <4, 19, 6>, <4, 19, 27>, <4, 19, 1>, <4, 13, 11>, <0, 23, 21>, <0, 15, 18>, <26, 19, 1>, <25, 23, 4>, <25, 11, 16>, <24, 26, 19>, <23, 25, 4>, <20, 11, 16>, <19, 27, 14>, <19, 27, 17>]

Total number of triangles: [20]
