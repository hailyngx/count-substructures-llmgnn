Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (14, 6) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 10) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently in the given graph. 

After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new order is: <6, 14, 11, 2, 7, 0, 10, 8, 12, 13, 5, 1, 4, 9, 3>.

Count of triangles []: 22

Unique triangles found <>: <6, 12, 13>, <4, 5, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 4, 10>, <0, 8, 11>, <2, 7, 11>, <2, 7, 13>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 10>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 12>, <3, 8, 9>, <3, 8, 12>, <4, 5, 13>, <4, 9, 13>, <5, 6, 13>, <7, 8, 11>, <7, 8, 13>, <9, 12, 13>, <10, 12, 13>, <10, 12, 4>, <0, 10, 12>.
