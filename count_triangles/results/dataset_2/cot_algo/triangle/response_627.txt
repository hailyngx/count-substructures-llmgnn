Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (5, 2), (5, 0), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 1), (9, 0), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 8), (4, 9), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 3), (4, 2), (8, 6), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 7), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 3), (0, 1), (7, 2), (7, 1), (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 0), (1, 7), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 0)

The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
Nodes sorted by degree: 7, 5, 8, 3, 7, 3, 4, 6, 6, 8
Relabeled nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, applying the method to count triangles:

Triangles [6]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 9>
