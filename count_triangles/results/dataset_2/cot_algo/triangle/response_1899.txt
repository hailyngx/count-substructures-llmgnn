Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 2) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 13) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 10) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, let's arrange the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

Nodes in decreasing order of degree:
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 13: 6 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 7: 2 connections

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph, making sure the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

1. (1, 3): Node 1 has 2 connections and Node 3 has 6 connections. No triangles.
2. (1, 8): Node 1 has 2 connections and Node 8 has 5 connections. No triangles.
3. (3, 1): Skip as Node 3 has more connections.
4. (3, 14): Node 3 has 6 connections and Node 14 has 5 connections. Forming a triangle with Node 14 & shared Node numbers 0 and 11 (triangle 3-14-0, 3-14-11, 14-0-11).
5. (3, 2): Node 3 has 6 connections and Node 2 has 4 connections. Forming a triangle with Node 2 & shared Node numbers 10 and 9 (triangle 3-2-10, 3-2-9, 2-10-9).
6. (3, 8): Skip as Node 3 has more connections.
7. (3, 4): Node 3 has 6 connections and Node 4 has 4 connections. Forming a triangle with Node 4 & shared Node numbers 8 and 13 (triangle 3-4-8, 3-4-13, 4-8-13).
8. Continue this process for all edges.

After counting the triangles using this method, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 14, 0>
<3, 14, 11>
<14, 0, 11>
