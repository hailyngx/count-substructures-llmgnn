Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 15) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 16) (2, 8) (2, 15) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 4) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 18) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 4) (13, 14) (13, 3) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 19) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 12) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 19) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 19) (16, 15) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 16) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are:
(1) 8 - degree 3
(2) 9 - degree 2
(3) 1, 2, 13 - degree 1
(4) 0, 3, 5, 6, 12 - degree 4
(5) 4, 7, 16 - degree 3
(6) 10, 14 - degree 3
(7) 11, 15, 18, 19 - degree 4
(8) 17 - degree 3

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
- Looking at each edge, we start with (8, 2) as vertex 2 has fewer connections.
  - Shared connections: 2 -> 8 (triangle <2, 8, 5>)
- Moving to the next edge (9, 8), we can form a triangle <9, 8, 5>.
- Moving on to the next edge (1, 0).
- For edge (1, 0), we cannot form a triangle as both vertices have the same degree.
- Evaluating edge (3, 13), we can form a triangle <3, 13, 14>.
- Continuing with the rest of the edges in the same manner, and counting triangles where applicable.

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [5].
