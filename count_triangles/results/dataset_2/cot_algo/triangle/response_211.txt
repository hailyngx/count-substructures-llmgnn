Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 13) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 18) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 11) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 10) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 2) (15, 11) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 0) (16, 7) (16, 17) (18, 5) (18, 13) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 3) (0, 2) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 3) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 15) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied to count the number of triangles in this graph. 
Let's relabel the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 15: degree 3
Node 16: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 18: degree 4
Node 4: degree 5
Node 7: degree 5
Node 13: degree 5
Node 19: degree 5
Node 2: degree 6
Node 11: degree 6
Node 9: degree 6
Node 14: degree 6
Node 8: degree 6

Based on the relabeling, we analyze the edges:
(5, 9) - Node 5 and Node 9 form a triangle with Node 11: <5, 9, 11>
(5, 18) - No triangle formed
(5, 11) - Already counted in (5, 9)
(5, 14) - No triangle formed
(9, 2) - Node 9 and Node 2 form a triangle with Node 0: <9, 2, 0>
(6, 13) - No triangle formed
(8, 4) - No triangle formed
(8, 19) - No triangle formed
(8, 7) - Node 8 and Node 7 form a triangle with Node 2: <8, 7, 2>
(13, 10) - Node 13 and Node 10 form a triangle with Node 3: <13, 10, 3>
(4, 14) - Node 4 and Node 14 form a triangle with Node 2: <4, 14, 2>
(7, 12) - Node 7 and Node 12 form a triangle with Node 11: <7, 12, 11>
(7, 16) - Node 7 and Node 16 form a triangle with Node 17: <7, 16, 17>
(7, 2) - Already counted in (8, 7)
(1, 17) - Node 1 and Node 17 form a triangle with Node 2: <1, 17, 2>
(1, 10) - No triangle formed
(17, 16) - Already counted in (7, 16)
(15, 11) - Node 15 and Node 11 form a triangle with Node 5: <15, 11, 5>
(3, 10) - Already counted in (13, 10)
(13, 18) - Node 13 and Node 18 form a triangle with Node 6: <13, 18, 6>
(0, 19) - No triangle formed
(10, 3) - Already counted in (13, 10)
(11, 12) - Already counted in (7, 12)
(11, 1) - Already counted in (1, 17)
(11, 15) - Already counted in (15, 11)
(2, 14) - Already counted in (4, 14)
(14, 19) - Already counted in (4, 14)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
