Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the graph. 
First, let's arrange the nodes in ascending order of their degree:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 9: 6 connections

Now, we will count the triangles:
1. For edge (0, 2), proceed as 0 has 2 connections and 2 has 5 connections, which is fine.
   Shared connections: None
2. For edge (0, 7), proceed as 0 has 2 connections and 7 has 3 connections, which is fine.
   Shared connections: 1
3. For edge (7, 5), proceed as 7 has 3 connections and 5 has 3 connections, which is fine.
   Shared connections: 1
4. For edge (5, 4), proceed as 5 has 3 connections and 4 has 5 connections, which is fine.
   Shared connections: 3
5. For edge (7, 2), proceed as 7 has 3 connections and 2 has 5 connections, which is fine.
   Shared connections: None
6. For edge (3, 2), proceed as 3 has 4 connections and 2 has 5 connections, which is fine.
   Shared connections: None
7. For edge (3, 5), proceed as 3 has 4 connections and 5 has 3 connections, which is fine.
   Shared connections: None
8. For edge (3, 8), proceed as 3 has 4 connections and 8 has 5 connections, which is fine.
   Shared connections: None

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8] and the unique triangles found are <0, 5, 4>, <0, 7, 5>, <3, 5, 4>, <3, 2, 5>, <3, 2, 8>, <0, 7, 2>, <0, 7, 5>, and <7, 5, 4>.
