Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}
Edges: 
- 0: {0, 15} {0, 13}
- 1: {1, 7} {1, 17}
- 2: {2, 22} {2, 24}
- 3: {3, 13} {3, 8}
- 4: {4, 15} {4, 22} {4, 6}
- 5: {5, 11} {5, 26} {5, 24}
- 6: {6, 25} {6, 4} {6, 21} {6, 26}
- 7: {7, 1} {7, 17} {7, 18} {7, 13}
- 8: {8, 3} {8, 20} {8, 19} {8, 29}
- 9: {9, 22} {9, 29} {9, 18}
- 10: {10, 17} {10, 19} {10, 24}
- 11: {11, 5} {11, 17} {11, 20}
- 12: {12, 15} {12, 27} {12, 20} {12, 22}
- 13: {13, 3} {13, 0} {13, 7}
- 14: {14, 19} {14, 18}
- 15: {15, 27} {15, 0} {15, 12} {15, 4}
- 16: {16, 21} {16, 29}
- 17: {17, 11} {17, 10} {17, 7}
- 18: {18, 9} {18, 14} {18, 7}
- 19: {19, 8} {19, 10} {19, 14} {19, 24}
- 20: {20, 11} {20, 12} {20, 8} {20, 23}
- 21: {21, 16} {21, 6} {21, 26}
- 22: {22, 23} {22, 9} {22, 2} {22, 4} {22, 12}
- 23: {23, 27} {23, 20} {23, 22}
- 24: {24, 10} {24, 19} {24, 2} {24, 5}
- 25: {25, 6}
- 26: {26, 27} {26, 21} {26, 6} {26, 5}
- 27: {27, 15} {27, 12} {27, 26} {27, 23}
- 28: {}
- 29: {29, 16} {29, 8} {29, 9}

After sorting the nodes based on their degrees, we have the following new labels for the nodes: 
{28, 1, 0, 2, 4, 14, 25, 3, 10, 18, 6, 11, 12, 13, 16, 20, 21, 5, 27, 8, 9, 7, 22, 24, 26, 15, 17, 19, 29, 23}

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
We find that there are [6] triangles in the graph:
<0, 13, 3>, <4, 6, 26>, <4, 6, 21>, <4, 6, 25>, <8, 29, 9>, <12, 20, 22>
