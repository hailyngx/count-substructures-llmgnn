Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 15) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 5) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 13) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 15) (0, 18) (0, 13) (14, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (3, 11) (3, 10) (1, 16) (1, 14) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 9) (9, 15) (9, 13) (13, 18) (13, 0) (13, 9) (13, 17) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (10, 18) (10, 3) (10, 4) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 4) (19, 16) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: (11, 3), (11, 7), (11, 18), (11, 17), (16, 17), (16, 1), (16, 19), (16, 15), (2, 18), (2, 8), (2, 5), (18, 11), (18, 2), (18, 10), (18, 0), (18, 13), (7, 11), (7, 12), (7, 15), (7, 8), (12, 7), (12, 4), (12, 15), (0, 18), (0, 13), (14, 1), (8, 2), (8, 7), (8, 5), (8, 6), (3, 11), (3, 10), (1, 16), (1, 14), (15, 16), (15, 7), (15, 12), (15, 9), (9, 15), (9, 13), (13, 18), (13, 0), (13, 9), (13, 17), (17, 11), (17, 16), (17, 13), (4, 12), (4, 10), (4, 5), (4, 6), (10, 18), (10, 3), (10, 4), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 4), (6, 8), (6, 4), (19, 16)

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method and relabeling the nodes based on their connections from least to most, we get the following sorted nodes:
Nodes: 17, 14, 19, 0, 6, 9, 13, 1, 3, 5, 10, 12, 4, 8, 2, 7, 18, 11, 16, 15

Now, going through each edge where the lower label node has fewer connections, we can count the triangles.

After calculating, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].

The unique triangles found are: 
<3, 11, 18>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 10, 18>
<3, 11, 17>
<4, 6, 8>
<12, 4, 10>
<16, 15, 1>
<13, 0, 18>
<7, 8, 15>
<13, 9, 15>
<11, 7, 15>
<13, 9, 17>
<11, 7, 17>
<5, 4, 6>
<0, 13, 18>
<16, 15, 7>
