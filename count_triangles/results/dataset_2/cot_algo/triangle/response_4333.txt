Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 4) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 19) (2, 3) (2, 12) (13, 16) (13, 7) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 13) (19, 17) (19, 0) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 5) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 18) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 15) (8, 1) (8, 15) (8, 18) (15, 14) (15, 8) (15, 4) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 8) (4, 11) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their degree:

Vertices sorted by degree:
(5, 4) (9, 4) (1, 3) (16, 3) (3, 3) (12, 3) (10, 3) (7, 3) (4, 3) (8, 3) (14, 3) (17, 3) (0, 3) (18, 3) (2, 2) (13, 2) (11, 2) (6, 2) (15, 2) (19, 2)

Now, we will count the triangles by considering each edge and checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge:

Triangles:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 16>
<1, 8, 14>
<3, 5, 16>
<4, 7, 10>
<4, 7, 13>
<4, 15, 18>
<10, 11, 17>
<0, 7, 19>
<12, 9, 16>

Total number of triangles: [10]
