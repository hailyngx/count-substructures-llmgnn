Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 8) (4, 23) (4, 28) (4, 21) (7, 24) (21, 4) (21, 25) (21, 2) (1, 13) (1, 19) (3, 13) (3, 18) (18, 22) (18, 3) (18, 5) (18, 24) (8, 22) (8, 23) (8, 9) (23, 4) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 6) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 11) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 28) (20, 11) (12, 10) (27, 20) (27, 11) (6, 23) (6, 29) (6, 25) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 20) (28, 16) (19, 1) (19, 26) (19, 29) (26, 0) (26, 19) (26, 17) (16, 28) (10, 12) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 25) (15, 23) (15, 10) (15, 2) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 24) (9, 2) (11, 0) (11, 20) (11, 27) (11, 14) (14, 13) (14, 11) (17, 26) (17, 24) (29, 6) (29, 19) (25, 21) (25, 6) (25, 10) (24, 7) (24, 18) (24, 0) (24, 9) (24, 17) (5, 18) (2, 21) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly. 

1. Node 13: 5 connections
2. Node 22: 4 connections
3. Node 4: 3 connections
4. Node 21: 3 connections
5. Node 1: 2 connections
6. Node 3: 2 connections
7. Node 18: 4 connections
8. Node 8: 3 connections
9. Node 23: 4 connections
10. Node 0: 4 connections
11. Node 20: 4 connections
12. Node 12: 1 connection
13. Node 27: 2 connections
14. Node 6: 3 connections
15. Node 28: 4 connections
16. Node 19: 2 connections
17. Node 26: 3 connections
18. Node 16: 1 connection
19. Node 10: 3 connections
20. Node 15: 3 connections
21. Node 9: 3 connections
22. Node 11: 4 connections
23. Node 14: 2 connections
24. Node 17: 2 connections
25. Node 29: 2 connections
26. Node 25: 3 connections
27. Node 7: 1 connection
28. Node 5: 1 connection
29. Node 2: 4 connections

Next, we will go through each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections and check for shared connections to find triangles.

From the given edges, we find the triangles and count them. 

The total number of triangles is [33].

The unique triangles found are:

<4, 21, 25>
<4, 23, 15>
<0, 20, 27>
