Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 11) (9, 3) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 11) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 11) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 12) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows: 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (0, 14), (0, 10), (0, 1), (0, 13), (1, 2), (1, 14), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 9), (3, 12), (4, 5), (4, 10), (4, 14), (5, 12), (5, 13), (6, 8), (6, 11), (6, 13), (7, 8), (7, 11), (7, 13), (7, 14), (8, 9), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 11), (9, 13), (10, 12), (10, 2), (11, 12), (11, 13), (12, 3)

Next step is to sort the nodes by their degree:

0: 4 connections
3: 3 connections
1: 3 connections
14: 3 connections
2: 4 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 3 connections
9: 4 connections
10: 3 connections
12: 3 connections
11: 4 connections
13: 4 connections

Now we can proceed with counting the number of triangles. By following the degree-based ordering approach and ensuring that each triangle is counted only once, the total number of triangles is [12].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 14>
<0, 10, 2>
<0, 10, 12>
<2, 3, 12>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 13>
<3, 9, 11>
<6, 7, 13>
<7, 8, 9>
