Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 13) (17, 19) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 1) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 15) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 13) (13, 17) (13, 18) (4, 16) (4, 6) (4, 15) (12, 16) (12, 2) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 18) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 5) (3, 14) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 8) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (5, 18) (5, 7) (5, 0) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 1) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

0 (degree 3), 2 (degree 3), 11 (degree 2), 16 (degree 2), 12 (degree 2), 1 (degree 3), 7 (degree 3), 5 (degree 3), 4 (degree 3), 6 (degree 3), 10 (degree 4), 9 (degree 4), 14 (degree 3), 19 (degree 4), 3 (degree 4), 18 (degree 4), 13 (degree 3), 17 (degree 2), 8 (degree 3), 15 (degree 3).

Let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 12]
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 5, 18>
<2, 12, 16>
<2, 12, 4>
<2, 14, 3>
<2, 14, 19>
<3, 7, 10>
<3, 7, 5>
<3, 14, 19>
<3, 18, 19>
<4, 6, 15>
<9, 10, 16>
