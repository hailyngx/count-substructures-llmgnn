Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 19) (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (17, 5) (17, 7) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 11) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 13) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 11) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 11) (7, 8) (7, 17) (7, 10) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 12) (18, 1) (18, 5) (18, 0) (12, 15) (12, 0) (12, 11) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 19) (11, 15) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 12) (16, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

- Node 16 has 1 edge.
- Node 1 has 2 edges.
- Nodes 10, 12, 17, 18, 7, 0, and 4 each have 3 edges.
- Nodes 5 and 11 have 4 edges.
- Nodes 8 and 13 each have 5 edges.
- Nodes 2 and 3 each have 6 edges.
- Nodes 6 and 9 each have 7 edges.
- Node 15 has 8 edges.
- Node 19 has 9 edges.

Now, we will go through each edge in ascending order of node labels:

1. (1, 15): Nodes 1 and 15 form a triangle with shared connection 15. Triangle: <1, 15, 10>.
2. (2, 6): Nodes 2 and 6 do not create a triangle.
3. (3, 9): Nodes 3 and 9 form a triangle with shared connection 9. Triangle: <3, 9, 19>.
4. (5, 17): Nodes 5 and 17 do not create a triangle.
5. (0, 15): Nodes 0 and 15 form a triangle with shared connection 15. Triangle: <0, 15, 12>.
6. (4, 5): Nodes 4 and 5 do not create a triangle.
7. (7, 8): Nodes 7 and 8 do not create a triangle.
8. (10, 15): Nodes 10 and 15 do not create a triangle.
9. (11, 15): Nodes 11 and 15 form a triangle with shared connection 15. Triangle: <11, 15, 4>.
10. (12, 15): Nodes 12 and 15 form a triangle with shared connection 15. Triangle: <12, 15, 0>.
11. (13, 19): Nodes 13 and 19 do not create a triangle.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <1, 15, 10>, <3, 9, 19>, <0, 15, 12>, <11, 15, 4>, and <12, 15, 0>.
