Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 3) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 10) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph by representing the given edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (6, 10), (6, 3), (6, 11), (6, 13), (9, 14), (9, 10), (9, 7), (9, 13), (4, 8), (4, 1), (4, 11), (8, 4), (8, 11), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 7), (5, 12), (5, 0), (5, 3), (13, 6), (13, 9), (13, 2), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 11), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 12), (11, 6), (11, 4), (11, 8), (11, 3), (11, 14), (11, 12), (0, 8), (0, 5), (0, 3), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 3), (7, 10), (12, 5), (12, 3), (12, 11), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 14), (1, 10), (14, 9), (14, 11), (14, 1), (14, 2), (2, 13), (2, 14), (2, 10), (10, 6), (10, 9), (10, 7), (10, 1), (10, 2)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on the number of their connections (degree-based ordering):

Nodes sorted by degree: [2, 5, 12, 14, 0, 4, 7, 1, 10, 8, 13, 9, 11, 6, 3]

Next, we will count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [13] 

Unique triangles: <0, 3, 5>
