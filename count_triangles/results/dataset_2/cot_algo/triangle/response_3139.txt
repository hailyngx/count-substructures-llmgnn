Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) 

Response:
Following the instructions for Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices: 
0 (degree 4)
1 (degree 3)
3 (degree 2)
8 (degree 4)
2 (degree 5)
4 (degree 4)
6 (degree 5)
7 (degree 4)
9 (degree 5)
5 (degree 6)

The sorted vertices are: 3, 1, 8, 0, 7, 4, 6, 9, 2, 5

Now, we will count the number of triangles by checking shared connections between vertices with lower labels in each edge:

Triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 7>, <7, 9, 6>

Total number of triangles: [10]
