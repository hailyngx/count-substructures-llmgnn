Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 29) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 24) (6, 18) (6, 20) (9, 24) (9, 10) (7, 21) (7, 3) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 12) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 17) (23, 25) (0, 21) (0, 10) (0, 5) (20, 6) (20, 2) (20, 11) (1, 26) (1, 27) (1, 8) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 3) (28, 26) (28, 17) (28, 14) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 15) (29, 13) (29, 19) (29, 24) (10, 9) (10, 21) (10, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 3) (12, 21) (12, 4) (3, 7) (3, 26) (3, 4) (3, 27) (19, 29) (19, 27) (14, 26) (14, 28) (11, 20) (11, 4) (8, 1) (8, 16) (8, 18) (25, 23) (25, 16) (15, 23) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 24) (15, 2) (17, 23) (17, 28) (27, 1) (27, 3) (27, 19) (27, 16) (2, 13) (2, 20) (2, 15) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 15) (16, 8) (16, 25) (16, 27) (24, 22) (24, 9) (24, 29) (24, 15) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with 30 nodes and 90 edges. 

To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices by their degree (number of connections):

Vertices sorted by degree:
(3, 4), (6, 2), (8, 3), (9, 2), (11, 2), (12, 2), (16, 3), (19, 2), (27, 3), (28, 3), (5, 3), (10, 4), (13, 4), (21, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (7, 2), (14, 2), (15, 5), (17, 3), (18, 3), (20, 3), (22, 3), (23, 4), (24, 4), (25, 2), (26, 4), (29, 3)

Now, we will check for triangles by examining the edges while following the rule that the lower labeled vertex must have fewer connections. 

Triangles found:
<7, 21, 10>, <3, 4, 12>, <3, 4, 11>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 12, 21>, <3, 26, 1>, <3, 26, 27>, <3, 27, 1>, <4, 8, 18>, <4, 11, 20>, <10, 0, 5>, <10, 0, 21>, <10, 9, 24>, <12, 21, 0>, <13, 5, 15>, <13, 15, 24>, <15, 18, 24>, <16, 8, 18>, <16, 8, 27>, <16, 25, 23>, <18, 15, 24>, <19, 27, 1>, <21, 12, 4>, <22, 13, 5>, <22, 13, 29>, <23, 17, 28>, <24, 15, 2>, <24, 15, 18>

Total number of triangles: [28]
