Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 13) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 12) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 12) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 12) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 6) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their respective connections:

0: 6 connections
8: 4 connections
12: 4 connections
14: 4 connections
1: 3 connections
3: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
10: 3 connections
2: 3 connections
5: 3 connections
9: 3 connections
4: 3 connections
7: 4 connections
11: 4 connections
13: 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles based on the given edges:

<0, 14, 13> (shared connection: 0)
<0, 4, 6> (shared connection: 4)
<0, 5, 8> (shared connection: 5)
<0, 10, 12> (shared connection: 10)
<3, 7, 13> (shared connection: 7)
<3, 8, 12> (shared connection: 8)
<3, 11, 1> (shared connection: 1)
<4, 2, 10> (shared connection: 2)
<4, 6, 11> (shared connection: 6)
<7, 5, 8> (shared connection: 5)
<7, 9, 11> (shared connection: 9)
<7, 13, 14> (shared connection: 13)
<8, 5, 7> (shared connection: 5)
<11, 1, 12> (shared connection: 1)
<12, 1, 6> (shared connection: 1)

Total number of triangles: [14]
