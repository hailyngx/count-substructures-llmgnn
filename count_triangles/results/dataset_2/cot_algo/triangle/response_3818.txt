Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 14) (11, 8) (11, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. 

After sorting the vertices based on the number of connections, the new ordering will be:
Node 11: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 12: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 14: 6 connections
Node 7: 7 connections
Node 10: 7 connections

Now, let's count the number of triangles based on the given edges while following the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The total number of triangles is [17].
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 14>
<0, 11, 8>
<1, 2, 13>
<1, 12, 4>
<1, 13, 8>
<1, 14, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 10, 12>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 12>
<3, 6, 12>
<3, 8, 13>
<5, 7, 14>
<8, 9, 13>
<10, 12, 14>
