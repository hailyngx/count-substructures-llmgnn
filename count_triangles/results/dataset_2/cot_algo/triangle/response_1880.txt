Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 14) (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 18) (2, 29) (2, 24) (2, 28) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 26) (29, 12) (29, 24) (7, 16) (7, 22) (7, 8) (21, 0) (21, 5) (21, 4) (6, 25) (6, 0) (9, 20) (0, 2) (0, 21) (0, 6) (0, 20) (20, 9) (20, 0) (20, 13) (1, 24) (26, 29) (26, 23) (26, 25) (17, 29) (17, 28) (3, 11) (4, 27) (4, 21) (4, 19) (4, 5) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 25) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 23) (12, 29) (12, 18) (23, 16) (23, 26) (23, 19) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 15) (14, 22) (22, 7) (22, 14) (22, 24) (28, 2) (28, 17) (28, 13) (18, 15) (18, 27) (18, 12) (10, 13) (5, 21) (5, 4) (25, 6) (25, 26) (25, 8) (24, 2) (24, 29) (24, 1) (24, 22) (13, 20) (13, 28) (13, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. Let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 1: 0 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 10: 1 connection
Vertex 11: 4 connections
Vertex 12: 2 connections
Vertex 13: 3 connections
Vertex 14: 4 connections
Vertex 15: 3 connections
Vertex 16: 5 connections
Vertex 17: 2 connections
Vertex 18: 3 connections
Vertex 19: 3 connections
Vertex 20: 3 connections
Vertex 21: 3 connections
Vertex 22: 3 connections
Vertex 23: 3 connections
Vertex 24: 4 connections
Vertex 25: 3 connections
Vertex 26: 3 connections
Vertex 27: 3 connections
Vertex 28: 3 connections
Vertex 29: 5 connections
Vertex 30: 0 connections

Now, we will calculate the triangles based on the sorted vertices and the provided edges.

Total number of triangles: [15]
