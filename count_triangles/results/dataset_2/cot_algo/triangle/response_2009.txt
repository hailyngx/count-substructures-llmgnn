Response:
The graph is as follows: 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 10, 3, 13
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 14
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 11, 1, 13
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 12, 0, 13
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 13, 14
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 8, 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 2, 12, 4
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 12
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 11, 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 14, 0
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 0, 12, 13
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 8, 2
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 10, 7, 14, 3
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 10, 4, 3, 0, 2, 14
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 12, 1, 13

Now, let's identify the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Label the nodes based on the number of connections:
   Node 1: (1 connections) - 1
   Node 14: (2 connections) - 2
   Node 11: (2 connections) - 2
   Node 7: (2 connections) - 2
   Node 1: (2 connections) - 2
   Node 4: (2 connections) - 2
   Node 9: (2 connections) - 2
   Node 0: (4 connections) - 7
   Node 3: (4 connections) - 7
   Node 8: (4 connections) - 7
   Node 10: (4 connections) - 7
   Node 12: (5 connections) - 11
   Node 2: (5 connections) - 11
   Node 5: (4 connections) - 7
   Node 6: (5 connections) - 11
   Node 13: (6 connections) - 14

2. Sort the nodes based on labels in ascending order: 
   1, 7, 7, 7, 11, 11, 11, 11, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7

3. Identify triangles:
   - There are 12 triangles in total.
