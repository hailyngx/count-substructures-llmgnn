Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are:
Vertices: 5 < 9 < 1 < 7 < 3 < 8 < 2 < 0 < 4 < 6

After relabeling the vertices, the edges to consider (vertex with lower label has fewer connections) are:
(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 8), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 9), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6)

Triangles found: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [4]
