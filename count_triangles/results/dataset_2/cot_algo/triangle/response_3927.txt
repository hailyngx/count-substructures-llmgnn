Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 19) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 3) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 3) (15, 4) (15, 10) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 0) (0, 11) (0, 19) (0, 3) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 17) (17, 12) (17, 5) (3, 18) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (2, 11) (2, 14) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 17) (5, 1) (14, 18) (14, 3) (14, 2) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 0 (Degree: 4), 1 (Degree: 3), 2 (Degree: 2), 3 (Degree: 4), 4 (Degree: 4), 5 (Degree: 4), 6 (Degree: 3), 7 (Degree: 4), 9 (Degree: 4), 10 (Degree: 3), 11 (Degree: 3), 12 (Degree: 5), 13 (Degree: 2), 14 (Degree: 3), 15 (Degree: 2), 16 (Degree: 3), 17 (Degree: 2), 18 (Degree: 4), 19 (Degree: 3)

Based on the degree-based ordering, we consider the edges in the following order:
(2, 14), (2, 11), (5, 17), (5, 16), (5, 7), (5, 1), (10, 15), (10, 3), (12, 17), (12, 13), (7, 10), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 13), (13, 12), (18, 14), (18, 3), (18, 4), (18, 1), (9, 6), (9, 16), (9, 4), (9, 6), (3, 0), (3, 14), (3, 18), (0, 3), (0, 19), (11, 2), (11, 0), (6, 9), (6, 12), (15, 10), (15, 4), (17, 5), (17, 12), (19, 1), (19, 6) 

Total number of triangles: [15]
Unique triangles: <3, 4, 18>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 14>, <3, 10, 15>, <0, 3, 11>, <0, 3, 19>, <4, 7, 9>, <6, 9, 16>, <3, 14, 18>, <1, 5, 19>, <5, 7, 17>, <6, 12, 13>, <5, 16, 17>, <9, 12, 16>, <2, 11, 14>
