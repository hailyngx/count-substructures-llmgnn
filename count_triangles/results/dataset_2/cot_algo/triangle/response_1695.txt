Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 4), (5, 0), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 7), (4, 7), (7, 1), (7, 8), (8, 2), (8, 6), (6, 3), (2, 1), (3, 0)  

Degree-Based Ordering:  
Nodes sorted by degree: 1, 4, 0, 3, 2, 6, 8, 7, 9, 5  

Triangles:
