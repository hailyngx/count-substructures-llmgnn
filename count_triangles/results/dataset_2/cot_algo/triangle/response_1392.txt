Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 13) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 13) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given edges:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (4, 12), (4, 13), (4, 10), (4, 5), (8, 5), (8, 14), (8, 11), (8, 3), (0, 14), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 13), (0, 9), (14, 8), (14, 0), (14, 2), (14, 13), (12, 4), (12, 13), (12, 3), (1, 2), (1, 10), (1, 7), (6, 10), (6, 3), (6, 11), (3, 8), (3, 0), (3, 12), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 5), (7, 1), (7, 3), (5, 4), (5, 8), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 10), (2, 14), (2, 1), (2, 13), (9, 0), (9, 11), (9, 10), (13, 4), (13, 0), (13, 14), (13, 12), (13, 2), (13, 11), (10, 4), (10, 1), (10, 6), (10, 5), (10, 9), (11, 8), (11, 6), (11, 9), (11, 13)
```

Next, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles. 

Vertices sorted by the number of connections (degree):
```
1(2), 2(2), 7(2), 9(3), 6(3), 0(5), 1(5), 4(5), 10(5), 12(5), 13(6), 11(5), 14(5), 3(6), 8(4)
```

Triangles found using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
```
[15]
<0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 13>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 13>, <0, 5, 14>, <0, 9, 10>, <0, 13, 14>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 13>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 10>, <3, 5, 13>, <3, 9, 10>, <5, 8, 14>
