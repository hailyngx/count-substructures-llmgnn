Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0: 5, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 9, 3, 2, 4, 8, 7
- Node 2: 9, 6, 1, 7
- Node 3: 5, 1, 0, 4, 8
- Node 4: 6, 1, 3, 8, 0
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 2, 8, 4
- Node 7: 1, 8, 0, 2
- Node 8: 6, 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 2, 1

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted nodes are: 5, 9, 0, 2, 7, 6, 8, 3, 4, 1
