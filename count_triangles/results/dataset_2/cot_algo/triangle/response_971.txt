Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 13) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 12) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 10) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 6) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree:
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 11: 2 connections
Node 13: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
Node 4: 6 connections

Looking at the edges, we will check the connections starting from the node with the lower label to the one with a higher label to avoid recounting triangles.

The total number of triangles found in the graph is [22]. The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 12>
<0, 5, 12>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 4>
