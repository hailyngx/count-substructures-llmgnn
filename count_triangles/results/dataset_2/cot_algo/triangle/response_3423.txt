Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 9) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 0) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 10) (14, 5) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method is as follows:

1. Label the nodes based on their number of connections in ascending order:
   Node 0: 6 connections
   Node 1: 3 connections
   Node 6: 3 connections
   Node 4: 5 connections
   Node 7: 3 connections
   Node 12: 3 connections
   Node 11: 4 connections
   Node 3: 5 connections
   Node 8: 4 connections
   Node 9: 4 connections
   Node 13: 4 connections
   Node 2: 6 connections
   Node 10: 4 connections
   Node 14: 1 connection
   Node 5: 4 connections

2. Evaluate each edge with the node having the lower label:
   - (4, 7): Node 4 has 5 connections, Node 7 has 3 connections. Evaluate based on Node 7.
     Shared connections with Node 7 (7, 0, 1).
   - (4, 2): Node 4 has 5 connections, Node 2 has 6 connections. Evaluate based on Node 4.
     Shared connections with Node 4 (4, 0, 3).
   - (4, 0): Node 4 has 5 connections, Node 0 has 6 connections. Evaluate based on Node 4.
     Shared connections with Node 4 (4, 7).
   - (4, 11): Node 4 has 5 connections, Node 11 has 4 connections. Evaluate based on Node 11.
     Shared connections with Node 11 (11, 13, 5).
   - (4, 3): Node 4 has 5 connections, Node 3 has 5 connections. Evaluate based on Node 3.
     Shared connections with Node 3 (3, 13, 0).

3. Count the number of triangles:
   - Triangles: <4, 7, 0>, <4, 0, 3>, <4, 11, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
