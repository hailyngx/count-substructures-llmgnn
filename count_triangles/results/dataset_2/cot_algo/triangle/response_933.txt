Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 0), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 0), (1, 7), (3, 7), (3, 4), (4, 8), (4, 5), (7, 9), (7, 3), (7, 5), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 2), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 2), (0, 4)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on the number of connections each has:

Node 3: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 4

Now, let's count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 9]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 1, 7>
<4, 1, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 2, 4>
<6, 7, 9>
