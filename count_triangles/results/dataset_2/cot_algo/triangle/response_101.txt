Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3)
