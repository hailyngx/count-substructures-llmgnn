Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 2) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 13) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted vertices with their corresponding degrees are as follows:

Node 7: degree 5
Node 11: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 14: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 8: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 10: degree 5
Node 4: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5

Now, we will check the edges in the order of the nodes based on their degrees:

Edges involving Node 11 and lower degree nodes:
- No edges involving Node 11 and lower degree nodes.

Edges involving Node 12 and lower degree nodes:
- No edges involving Node 12 and lower degree nodes.

Edges involving Node 9 and lower degree nodes:
- No edges involving Node 9 and lower degree nodes.

Edges involving Node 2 and lower degree nodes:
- No edges involving Node 2 and lower degree nodes.

Edges involving Node 8 and lower degree nodes:
- No edges involving Node 8 and lower degree nodes.

Edges involving Node 13 and lower degree nodes:
- No edges involving Node 13 and lower degree nodes.

Edges involving Node 5 and lower degree nodes:
- No edges involving Node 5 and lower degree nodes.

Edges involving Node 12 and lower degree nodes:
- No edges involving Node 12 and lower degree nodes.

Edges involving Node 11 and lower degree nodes:
- No edges involving Node 11 and lower degree nodes.

Next, let's look at Node 7 with degree 5:
- Shared connections with lower degree nodes: (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 1), (7, 0), (7, 9)
  - Triangles formed: <4, 3, 7>, <7, 1, 3>, <7, 0, 9>, <7, 3, 4>

Moving on to Node 6 with degree 5:
- Shared connections with lower degree nodes: (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 11), (6, 2)
  - Triangles formed: <4, 1, 6>, <4, 6, 1>, <6, 5, 10>, <6, 2, 11>, <6, 1, 4>

Now, Node 1 with degree 5:
- Shared connections with lower degree nodes: (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 12), (1, 8)
  - Triangles formed: <1, 3, 7>, <1, 8, 3>, <1, 6, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 7, 3>

Moving along to Node 10 with degree 5:
- Shared connections with lower degree nodes: (10, 4), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 5), (10, 14)
  - Triangles formed: <10, 11, 6>, <10, 5, 13>, <11, 10, 6>

Lastly, Node 3 with degree 5:
- Shared connections with lower degree nodes: (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 13), (3, 8)
  - Triangles formed: <3, 1, 7>, <3, 1, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 8, 1>

The total number of unique triangles in the given graph is 13.  
The triangles are: <4, 3, 7>, <7, 1, 3>, <7, 0, 9>, <7, 3, 4>, <4, 1, 6>, <6, 5, 10>, <6, 2, 11>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 8, 3>, <1, 6, 4>, <10, 11, 6>, <10, 5, 13>, <3, 1, 7>.
