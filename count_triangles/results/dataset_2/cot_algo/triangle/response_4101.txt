Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degrees:

1. Vertex 2 (degree 3)
2. Vertex 5 (degree 3)
3. Vertex 7 (degree 3)
4. Vertex 8 (degree 3)
5. Vertex 12 (degree 3)
6. Vertex 13 (degree 4)
7. Vertex 3 (degree 4)
8. Vertex 1 (degree 4)
9. Vertex 10 (degree 4)
10. Vertex 0 (degree 6)
11. Vertex 6 (degree 6)
12. Vertex 9 (degree 6)
13. Vertex 11 (degree 6)
14. Vertex 4 (degree 7)
15. Vertex 14 (degree 7)

Next, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed by shared connections.

Triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 6, 10>
<0, 6, 11>
<0, 6, 12>
<0, 9, 6>
<0, 9, 13>
<0, 9, 14>
<1, 4, 10>
<1, 7, 3>
<1, 7, 4>
<4, 10, 11>
<6, 9, 11>
<6, 10, 11>
<8, 9, 14>
<9, 11, 13>
<9, 13, 14>
<11, 13, 14>

After counting all the triangles, you should have found a total of 19 triangles. Therefore, the final output would be:
[19]
