Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 15) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 8) (4, 19) (8, 3) (8, 19) (17, 6) (17, 2) (9, 19) (9, 0) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 9) (19, 12) (2, 17) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 18) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 13) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 14) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 15) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 6) (13, 18) (13, 15) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degrees. Here are the nodes sorted by the number of connections they have:

Node 4: degree 1
Node 2: degree 1
Node 9: degree 2
Node 17: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 16: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 14: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 18: degree 5
Node 0: degree 6
Node 10: degree 4
Node 1: degree 5
Node 11: degree 4
Node 19: degree 5
Node 15: degree 5

Now, we will count the triangles based on the sorted nodes: 

1. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 12>
3. Triangle <0, 3, 14>
4. Triangle <0, 6, 10>
5. Triangle <0, 6, 14>
6. Triangle <0, 9, 19>
7. Triangle <1, 3, 5>
8. Triangle <1, 3, 7>
9. Triangle <3, 5, 15>
10. Triangle <3, 6, 14>
11. Triangle <3, 6, 7>
12. Triangle <3, 7, 14>
13. Triangle <5, 12, 15>
14. Triangle <6, 12, 14>
15. Triangle <11, 15, 16>
16. Triangle <11, 13, 15>
17. Triangle <11, 15, 18>
18. Triangle <11, 16, 15>
19. Triangle <12, 14, 6>
20. Triangle <12, 14, 3>
21. Triangle <0, 10, 18>
22. Triangle <0, 10, 6>
23. Triangle <9, 10, 19>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [23].
