Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 23) (16, 4) (5, 13) (5, 22) (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 29) (9, 15) (9, 14) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 6) (3, 1) (0, 12) (0, 23) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 18) (4, 16) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 25) (18, 20) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 28) (19, 26) (19, 8) (19, 27) (26, 19) (26, 24) (21, 24) (21, 6) (21, 25) (24, 16) (24, 26) (24, 21) (24, 29) (24, 25) (28, 18) (28, 14) (17, 1) (17, 2) (17, 7) (6, 1) (6, 21) (6, 2) (6, 27) (29, 9) (29, 24) (29, 15) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 22) (13, 5) (13, 23) (14, 9) (14, 28) (22, 5) (22, 4) (22, 8) (22, 27) (27, 19) (27, 6) (27, 22) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 13) (23, 7) (7, 20) (7, 17) (7, 23) (12, 0) (12, 20) (12, 18) (25, 4) (25, 21) (25, 24) (25, 15) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 29) (15, 25) (10, 5) (2, 17) (2, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 1: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 10: 1 connection
Node 11: 2 connections
Node 20: 3 connections
Node 27: 3 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 13: 2 connections
Node 19: 3 connections
Node 21: 3 connections
Node 28: 2 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 16: 4 connections
Node 18: 4 connections
Node 22: 4 connections
Node 26: 2 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 17: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 14: 2 connections
Node 24: 5 connections
Node 25: 4 connections
Node 29: 3 connections
Node 23: 4 connections

As per the Degree-Based Ordering method, we'll start counting triangles using the edges in the following order: (10, 5), (11, 16), (20,7), (27,19), (0,12), (13,23), (3,1), (6,21), (8,11), (18,20), (22,27), (26,24), (28,18), (17,2), (4,16), (14,28), (25,4), (9,29), (15,5), (17,1), (22,8), (24,16)

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is: [17]
The unique triangles found are: 
<3, 1, 6>, <3, 1, 17>, <8, 11, 16>, <5, 13, 23>, <6, 1, 17>, <6, 1, 3>, <15, 25, 4>, <18, 20, 12>, <18, 20, 7>, <22, 27, 6>, <16, 4, 18>, <16, 4, 22>, <9, 29, 15>, <9, 29, 24>, <9, 15, 5>, <24, 21, 25>, <8, 19, 27>
