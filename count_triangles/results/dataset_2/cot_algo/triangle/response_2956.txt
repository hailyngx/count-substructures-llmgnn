Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 2) (1, 4) (21, 1) (21, 16) (6, 22) (6, 19) (9, 28) (9, 17) (9, 20) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 19) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 13) (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 24) (27, 7) (27, 8) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 25) (0, 26) (2, 1) (8, 27) (8, 25) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 28) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 12) (3, 11) (3, 24) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 18) (11, 25) (13, 17) (13, 20) (13, 24) (23, 14) (23, 11) (23, 18) (23, 10) (23, 24) (16, 21) (16, 7) (16, 29) (4, 1) (4, 29) (4, 26) (22, 6) (7, 27) (7, 16) (10, 3) (10, 23) (10, 26) (26, 0) (26, 4) (26, 10) (29, 1) (29, 0) (29, 16) (29, 4) (20, 1) (20, 9) (20, 13) (20, 5) (5, 20) (18, 14) (18, 11) (18, 23) (24, 27) (24, 3) (24, 13) (24, 23) (12, 28) (12, 25) (25, 0) (25, 8) (25, 11) (25, 12) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are:
(5, 10, 12, 16, 22) -- degree: 1
(2, 6, 7, 19, 21) -- degree: 2
(0, 13, 15, 18) -- degree: 3
(3, 8, 17) -- degree: 4
(4, 9, 14) -- degree: 5
(1, 11, 20) -- degree: 6
(25, 26, 28) -- degree: 7
(24, 27) -- degree: 8
(23, 29) -- degree: 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following triangles:
