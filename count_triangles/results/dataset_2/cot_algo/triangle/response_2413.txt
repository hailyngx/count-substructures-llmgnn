Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to first sort the vertices by their number of connections and then proceed with counting the triangles. 

Here is the updated ordering of the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):
Node 2 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 2
Node 0 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 5
Node 6 has degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph, we have found the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 6>
<4, 9, 6>
<4, 9, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 6>
<6, 7, 9>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
