Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degrees. Let's find the degrees of each node:

- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5

Now we'll relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:

- Node 1: degree 3 -> Relabeled as node 0
- Node 2: degree 4 -> Relabeled as node 1
- Node 4: degree 4 -> Relabeled as node 2
- Node 5: degree 4 -> Relabeled as node 3
- Node 6: degree 4 -> Relabeled as node 4
- Node 8: degree 5 -> Relabeled as node 5
- Node 9: degree 5 -> Relabeled as node 6
- Node 0: degree 5 -> Relabeled as node 7
- Node 3: degree 5 -> Relabeled as node 8
- Node 7: degree 5 -> Relabeled as node 9

Now we look at the edges and count the triangles:

1. (1, 0): No triangles
2. (1, 2): No triangles
3. (1, 4): No triangles
4. (1, 3): No triangles
5. (1, 5): Triangle <1, 4, 5>
6. (1, 7): No triangles
7. (1, 6): No triangles
8. (0, 4): No triangles
9. (0, 6): No triangles
10. (0, 5): Triangle <0, 7, 5>
11. (2, 6): Triangle <1, 2, 4>
12. (2, 3): No triangles
13. (2, 1): No triangles
14. (4, 3): No triangles
15. (4, 6): Triangle <1, 2, 4>
16. (4, 5): Triangle <0, 4, 5>
17. (3, 5): Triangle <0, 3, 5>
18. (3, 7): Triangle <3, 5, 7>
19. (3, 8): Triangle <3, 5, 8>
20. (5, 7): Triangle <0, 5, 7>
21. (5, 2): No triangles
22. (5, 0): Triangle <0, 5, 7>
23. (5, 3): Triangle <0, 3, 5>
24. (5, 8): Triangle <3, 5, 8>
25. (6, 8): No triangles
26. (6, 1): No triangles
27. (6, 2): Triangle <1, 2, 4>
28. (6, 4): Triangle <1, 2, 4>
29. (7, 8): Triangle <3, 5, 8>
30. (7, 0): Triangle <0, 5, 7>
31. (7, 3): Triangle <3, 5, 7>
32. (7, 5): Triangle <0, 5, 7>
33. (8, 9): No triangles
34. (8, 3): Triangle <3, 5, 8>
35. (8, 6): No triangles
36. (8, 7): Triangle <3, 5, 8>
37. (8, 0): No triangles
38. (9, 7): Triangle <3, 5, 7>
39. (9, 1): No triangles
40. (9, 4): No triangles

The total number of triangles is 16, and the unique triangles found are:

<0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 8>
