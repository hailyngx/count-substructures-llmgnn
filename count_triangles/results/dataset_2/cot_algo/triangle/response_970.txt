Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (4, 7), (4, 8), (7, 0), (8, 0)
- 1: (5, 1), (6, 1), (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 8)
- 2: (4, 2), (2, 8)
- 3: (5, 3), (9, 3), (6, 3), (1, 3), (3, 8)
- 4: (6, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2)
- 5: (9, 5), (5, 7), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 8)
- 6: (9, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4)
- 7: (5, 7), (7, 0), (7, 8)
- 8: (1, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (8, 7), (8, 2), (8, 0)
- 9: (5, 9), (9, 6), (9, 3), (9, 1)

Next, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order and relabel them accordingly:
Nodes by degree: 0, 2, 7, 4, 6, 9, 8, 1, 3, 5

Now, we will calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 8]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 1, 5>
<3, 1, 9>
