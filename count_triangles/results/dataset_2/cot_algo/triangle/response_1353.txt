Response:
The given graph is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges:
(11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 22) (16, 27) (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 2) 
(27, 16) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 1) (27, 13) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 2) (25, 20) 
(25, 9) (25, 26) (25, 28) (25, 10) (15, 20) (17, 29) (17, 28) (17, 12) (17, 18) (29, 17) 
(29, 7) (29, 19) (29, 13) (24, 26) (24, 7) (26, 25) (26, 24) (9, 25) (9, 21) (8, 11) 
(8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 22) (8, 7) (19, 29) (19, 8) (4, 12) (4, 23) (12, 20) (12, 17) 
(12, 4) (12, 18) (21, 16) (21, 0) (21, 9) (21, 14) (5, 8) (5, 2) (14, 21) (2, 0)
(2, 20) (2, 5) (2, 22) (22, 16) (22, 8) (22, 2) (22, 10) (7, 11) (7, 29) (7, 24) 
(7, 8) (1, 11) (1, 27) (1, 18) (28, 0) (28, 25) (28, 17) (23, 4) (6, 10) (10, 25) 
(10, 22) (10, 6) (18, 27) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 1) (13, 27) (13, 29)

To count the number of triangles, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by degree:
Degree 2: {23, 6, 15, 4, 9, 14, 3}
Degree 3: {5, 13, 18, 1}
Degree 4: {10, 7, 0, 12, 22, 8, 19, 24}
Degree 5: {20, 16, 21, 25, 17, 28}
Degree 6: {26, 11, 29, 27}

By processing the edges according to the method mentioned earlier, we find that there are [18] triangles in the given graph.

Unique triangles:
<0, 21, 27>
<0, 21, 9>
<0, 21, 16>
<0, 2, 20>
<0, 2, 28>
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 27, 11>
<1, 18, 27>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 22>
<7, 11, 8>
<7, 11, 16>
<7, 8, 22>
<8, 19, 29>
