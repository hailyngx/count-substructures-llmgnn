Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 14) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 7) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 13) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 13) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 9: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 14: degree 6
Node 13: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 11: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
