Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 18) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 1) (17, 13) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 19) (4, 8) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 19) (5, 11) (6, 10) (6, 2) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 18) (0, 1) (16, 17) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 14) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 11) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 19) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 2) (15, 4) (15, 14) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 15) (3, 4) (3, 16) (3, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees, from least to most connected. The sorted vertices are then relabeled. Let's apply this method to the given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges:

Vertices sorted by their degrees:  
Vertex 5 has degree 1  
Vertex 12 has degree 1  
Vertex 7 has degree 2  
Vertex 8 has degree 3  
Vertex 5 has degree 1  
Vertex 12 has degree 1  
Vertex 3 has degree 2  
Vertex 14 has degree 3  
Vertex 15 has degree 2  
Vertex 4 has degree 3  
Vertex 6 has degree 3  
Vertex 11 has degree 4  
Vertex 1 has degree 3  
Vertex 19 has degree 4  
Vertex 18 has degree 4  
Vertex 9 has degree 4  
Vertex 0 has degree 4  
Vertex 2 has degree 4  
Vertex 16 has degree 4  
Vertex 10 has degree 4  
Vertex 17 has degree 7  

Relabeled vertices:  
Vertex 5 (degree 1) -> Vertex 1  
Vertex 12 (degree 1) -> Vertex 2  
Vertex 7 (degree 2) -> Vertex 3  
Vertex 8 (degree 3) -> Vertex 4  
Vertex 5 (degree 1) -> Vertex 5  
Vertex 12 (degree 1) -> Vertex 6  
Vertex 3 (degree 2) -> Vertex 7  
Vertex 14 (degree 3) -> Vertex 8  
Vertex 15 (degree 2) -> Vertex 9  
Vertex 4 (degree 3) -> Vertex 10  
Vertex 6 (degree 3) -> Vertex 11  
Vertex 11 (degree 4) -> Vertex 12  
Vertex 1 (degree 3) -> Vertex 13  
Vertex 19 (degree 4) -> Vertex 14  
Vertex 18 (degree 4) -> Vertex 15  
Vertex 9 (degree 4) -> Vertex 16  
Vertex 0 (degree 4) -> Vertex 17  
Vertex 2 (degree 4) -> Vertex 18  
Vertex 16 (degree 4) -> Vertex 19  
Vertex 10 (degree 4) -> Vertex 20  
Vertex 17 (degree 7) -> Vertex 21  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles in the graph is:
