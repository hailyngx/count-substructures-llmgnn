Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 10) (6, 12) (6, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently in the given graph. 

First, let's construct the graph with the nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
- 0: {8, 12, 3, 9}
- 1: {13, 12, 10}
- 2: {4, 12, 10, 11}
- 3: {13, 11, 0, 6, 14}
- 4: {7, 8, 9, 10, 2}
- 5: {8, 12}
- 6: {12, 3}
- 7: {4, 12, 9, 13}
- 8: {4, 5, 0}
- 9: {4, 7, 14, 0, 10}
- 10: {4, 13, 2, 14, 1, 9}
- 11: {2, 3, 14}
- 12: {7, 2, 5, 0, 6, 1}
- 13: {7, 3, 1, 10}
- 14: {13, 11, 9, 10}

Next, we label the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 5
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 5
- Node 10 has degree 6
- Node 11 has degree 3
- Node 12 has degree 6
- Node 13 has degree 4
- Node 14 has degree 4

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Total number of triangles: [15]

Unique triangles:
- <0, 9, 10>
- <0, 9, 14>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <0, 3, 12>
- <1, 10, 13>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <3, 10, 13>
- <3, 11, 14>
- <4, 7, 12>
- <4, 9, 10>
- <4, 9, 14>
- <4, 10, 13>
- <7, 9, 12>
- <9, 10, 13>
- <9, 10, 14>
