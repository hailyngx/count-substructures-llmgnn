Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 14) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 12) (0, 7) (0, 9) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 1) (10, 15) (10, 16) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 9) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 13) (18, 19) (11, 19) (11, 2) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 16) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 2) (2, 11) (2, 16) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 13) (1, 19) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 1) 

Response:
Let's first sort the vertices based on their degree:

Nodes: 
0 -> degree: 2
1 -> degree: 3 
2 -> degree: 3 
3 -> degree: 2 
4 -> degree: 5 
5 -> degree: 4 
6 -> degree: 4 
7 -> degree: 3 
8 -> degree: 3 
9 -> degree: 3 
10 -> degree: 2 
11 -> degree: 2 
12 -> degree: 4 
13 -> degree: 3 
14 -> degree: 4 
15 -> degree: 4 
16 -> degree: 3 
17 -> degree: 3 
18 -> degree: 2 
19 -> degree: 4 

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles formed by each edge.

Let's count the triangles: 

[Total number of triangles: 18] 
<0, 7, 9>, 
<0, 9, 13>, 
<1, 13, 19>, 
<2, 11, 16>, 
<4, 5, 8>, 
<4, 5, 6>, 
<4, 5, 14>, 
<4, 6, 12>, 
<4, 6, 17>, 
<4, 7, 9>, 
<4, 8, 12>, 
<4, 8, 14>, 
<4, 14, 19>, 
<4, 14, 16>, 
<5, 6, 17>, 
<9, 13, 1>, 
<12, 1, 19>, 
<14, 16, 2>
