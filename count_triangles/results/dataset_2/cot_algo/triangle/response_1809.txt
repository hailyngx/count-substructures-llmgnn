Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first and then count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 0), (9, 4), (9, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 0), (1, 8), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 2), (3, 8), (2, 9), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 7), (0, 6), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 5), (7, 6), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 0), (4, 6), (4, 9), (4, 1)

After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, the labeling of nodes will be as follows:
Nodes: 4, 9, 8, 7, 5, 2, 1, 0, 3, 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
- For each edge, check if the node with the lower label has fewer connections.
- Count the triangles formed by shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

After performing the calculations, the total number of triangles found in the graph is [9].

Unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <4, 6, 9>
