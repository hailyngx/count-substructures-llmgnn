Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (5, 8) (5, 7) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 
Node 0: degree 4
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 5
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 5
Node 1: degree 4
Node 9: degree 5
Node 4: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Using this method, we can find the following triangles:
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 4, 3>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 7, 1>
- <0, 7, 2>
- <0, 7, 5>
- <4, 8, 5>
- <4, 8, 7>
- <8, 7, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
