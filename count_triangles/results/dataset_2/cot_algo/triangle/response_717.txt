- (22, 11) with shared connection 23 forming triangle <11, 22, 23>
- (3, 25) with shared connection 7 forming triangle <3, 25, 7>
- (7, 3) with shared connection 11 forming triangle <3, 7, 11>
- (25, 3) with shared connection 6 forming triangle <3, 25, 6>
- (8, 1) with shared connection 28 forming triangle <1, 8, 28>
- (13, 29) with shared connection 11 forming triangle <13, 29, 11>
- (12, 20) with shared connection 18 forming triangle <12, 20, 18>
- (0, 12) with shared connection 14 forming triangle <0, 12, 14>
- (14, 16) with shared connection 24 forming triangle <14, 16, 24>
- (26, 28) with shared connection 10 forming triangle <26, 28, 10>
