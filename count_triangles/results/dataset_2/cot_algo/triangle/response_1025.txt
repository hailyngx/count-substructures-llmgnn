Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for triangle counting involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Let's relabel the vertices as follows:

Vertices sorted by their degree in increasing order:
0(3), 9(4), 2(4), 3(4), 8(4), 6(4), 1(5), 7(5), 4(5), 5(5)

Now, let's identify the triangles formed by the shared connections between the lower labeled vertices in each edge:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [18]
