Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 6) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 12) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 11) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 1) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 9) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 10) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 10) 

Response:
The vertices sorted based on their degrees are: 
0 (Degree: 4), 3 (Degree: 4), 11 (Degree: 4), 4 (Degree: 4), 12 (Degree: 4), 14 (Degree: 5), 2 (Degree: 5), 1 (Degree: 5), 9 (Degree: 5), 5 (Degree: 5), 6 (Degree: 5), 8 (Degree: 5), 13 (Degree: 6), 7 (Degree: 6), 10 (Degree: 6)

Therefore, the triangles formed are:
- <0, 5, 10>
- <0, 5, 12>
- <0, 9, 10>
- <0, 9, 12>
- <1, 2, 11>
- <1, 2, 12>
- <1, 10, 11>
- <1, 10, 12>
- <1, 11, 12>
- <2, 6, 12>
- <2, 9, 10>
- <2, 9, 11>
- <5, 6, 13>
- <5, 8, 13>
- <6, 7, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
