Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. 

The sorted vertices with their corresponding degree are as follows:
Node 6: degree 1
Node 2: degree 1
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 0: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 5: degree 5
Node 7: degree 6
Node 11: degree 6

Now, we will analyze the edges in the order specified based on the lower labeled node having fewer connections.
