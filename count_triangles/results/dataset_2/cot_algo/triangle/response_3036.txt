Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 4) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 14) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 18) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 1) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 12) (2, 12) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 7) (19, 5) (19, 0) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 7) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 1) (15, 12) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 14) (12, 18) (12, 2) (12, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 14) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 3) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 8), (0, 19), (0, 6),
(1, 4), (1, 15), (1, 7),
(2, 12),
(3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 14),
(4, 11), (4, 18), (4, 1),
(5, 9), (5, 19), (5, 15),
(6, 11), (6, 17), (6, 0),
(7, 10), (7, 8), (7, 1), (7, 3),
(8, 17), (8, 0), (8, 7),
(9, 5), (9, 15), (9, 14), (9, 3),
(10, 7), (10, 13), (10, 14),
(11, 18), (11, 6), (11, 4),
(12, 18), (12, 2), (12, 15),
(13, 10), (13, 17), (13, 14),
(14, 9), (14, 10), (14, 13), (14, 3),
(15, 5), (15, 9), (15, 1), (15, 12),
(17, 13), (17, 6), (17, 8), (17, 18),
(18, 11), (18, 17), (18, 4), (18, 12),
(19, 5), (19, 0)

Now, let's use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in this graph. Remember to output only the total number of triangles inside brackets [] and list the unique triangles found inside <> each only once in the answer.
