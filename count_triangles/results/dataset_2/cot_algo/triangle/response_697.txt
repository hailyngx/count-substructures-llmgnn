Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 14) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 3) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 6) (8, 9) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 17) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 19) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 14) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 6) (5, 2) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 0) (17, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the nodes by their degrees (number of connections). Then, for each edge, we only consider it if the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

After relabeling the nodes according to their degrees, we have the following list of edges that we will use to count triangles:

(0, 7), (0, 17), (0, 19), (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 19), (2, 5), (3, 14), (3, 18), (4, 7), (4, 10), (4, 16), (4, 17), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 19), (7, 4), (7, 14), (7, 15), (8, 9), (9, 10), (9, 14), (9, 8), (10, 4), (11, 13), (11, 17), (12, 13), (12, 16), (12, 17), (13, 0), (13, 11), (13, 12), (14, 7), (14, 9), (14, 15), (14, 18), (14, 3), (15, 7), (15, 14), (15, 18), (16, 4), (16, 7), (16, 12), (17, 0), (17, 4), (17, 11), (17, 12), (18, 3), (18, 14), (18, 15), (19, 0), (19, 1), (19, 6)

By examining the shared connections for each edge, we find the total number of triangles to be [22].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 7, 14>
<0, 7, 17>
<0, 13, 19>
<0, 14, 19>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 6, 19>
<4, 7, 14>
<4, 7, 16>
<4, 10, 16>
<7, 14, 15>
<9, 10, 14>
<9, 14, 18>
<9, 14, 19>
<10, 4, 16>
<13, 0, 12>
<13, 11, 17>
<14, 18, 15>
<15, 7, 16>
<15, 14, 18>
<16, 7, 12>
<17, 11, 12>
