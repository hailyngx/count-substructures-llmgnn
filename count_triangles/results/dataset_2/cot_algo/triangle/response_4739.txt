Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 12) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given graph and information, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort vertices by their degree in ascending order:
   Nodes: 12, 13, 8, 11, 2, 5, 4, 1, 3, 14, 7, 10, 6, 0, 9

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   New labels: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

3. Traverse the edges and count triangles:
   - (5, 6): Ignored since both have the same degree.
   - (5, 2): Ignored since 5 has a higher label than 2.
   - (5, 7): Forms a triangle <5, 7, 14>.
