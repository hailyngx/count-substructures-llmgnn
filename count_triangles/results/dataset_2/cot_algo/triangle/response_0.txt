Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 29) (1, 10) (3, 0) (3, 27) (3, 12) (20, 5) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 11) (20, 10) (25, 20) (25, 18) (10, 1) (10, 20) (10, 17) (17, 10) (19, 28) (28, 19) (28, 26) (28, 4) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 24) (13, 15) (26, 20) (26, 28) (26, 11) (26, 0) (29, 9) (29, 23) (29, 21) (7, 24) (7, 27) (7, 22) (16, 12) (16, 24) (16, 14) (4, 28) (4, 13) (4, 22) (22, 7) (22, 4) (22, 27) (22, 8) (11, 20) (11, 26) (11, 14) (11, 15) (11, 2) (14, 16) (14, 11) (14, 8) (12, 3) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 23) (18, 25) (18, 12) (18, 6) (18, 21) (0, 3) (0, 26) (24, 13) (24, 7) (24, 16) (8, 22) (8, 14) (8, 15) (2, 11) (2, 6) (27, 3) (27, 7) (27, 22) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 23) (23, 29) (23, 12) (23, 6) (15, 13) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 6) (21, 29) (21, 18) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's start by counting the triangles in the graph using Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The vertices are as follows:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

After sorting them by the number of connections, we get:
2, 1, 17, 0, 23, 14, 8, 6, 3, 18, 10, 16, 19, 13, 15, 12, 22, 4, 21, 11, 7, 9, 5, 26, 25, 20, 28, 27, 24, 29

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

[Total number of triangles: 55]
<0, 1, 10>, <1, 10, 17>, <1, 10, 20>, <1, 10, 28>, <1, 10, 4>, <1, 10, 25>, <1, 10, 11>, <1, 10, 26>, <1, 10, 14>, <1, 10, 8>, <2, 6, 15>, <2, 11, 26>, <3, 12, 23>, <3, 12, 18>, <3, 12, 16>, <3, 12, 27>, <4, 13, 22>, <4, 13, 24>, <4, 13, 7>, <4, 13, 15>, <4, 22, 27>, <4, 22, 7>, <4, 22, 8>, <4, 22, 13>, <5, 13, 24>, <6, 15, 23>, <6, 15, 13>, <6, 15, 11>, <6, 15, 8>, <6, 15, 2>, <7, 24, 16>, <7, 24, 13>, <7, 24, 16>, <7, 24, 27>, <8, 15, 6>, <8, 15, 13>, <8, 15, 11>, <8, 15, 14>, <9, 29, 23>, <11, 14, 8>, <11, 14, 16>, <11, 14, 26>, <11, 14, 15>, <11, 14, 16>, <14, 16, 8>, <15, 13, 11>, <15, 13, 6>, <15, 13, 8>, <20, 11, 26>, <21, 18, 29>, <22, 7, 27>, <24, 13, 7>, <26, 0, 3>, <27, 3, 7>
