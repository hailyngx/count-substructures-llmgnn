Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) 

Response:
The graph based on the given information is as follows:
```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
0: 9, 6, 8, 2
1: 9, 5, 4, 8
2: 5, 9, 0, 3
3: 5, 8, 2
4: 7, 1, 6
5: 6, 2, 1, 3, 7
6: 5, 9, 4, 7, 8, 0
7: 5, 4, 6
8: 6, 0, 3, 1
9: 6, 2, 1, 0
```

After relabeling based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the new node labels are:
```
Nodes ordered by degree: 4, 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 2, 5, 6
```

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and checking for triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
The unique triangles found are: 
<7, 4, 6>, 
<1, 5, 6>, 
<0, 9, 6>, 
<5, 7, 6>, 
<1, 4, 6>, 
<0, 8, 6>, 
<0, 2, 6>, 
<5, 6, 9>, 
<0, 6, 9>, 
<3, 2, 6>, 
<1, 6, 9>, 
<1, 8, 6>.
