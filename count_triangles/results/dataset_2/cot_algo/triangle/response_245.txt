Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 9) (11, 8) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 10) (13, 22) (13, 21) (13, 15) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 27) (22, 8) (15, 13) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 25) (27, 22) (27, 12) (27, 14) (14, 27) (14, 17) (14, 2) (17, 16) (17, 14) (17, 21) (23, 22) (23, 1) (3, 0) (25, 15) (25, 5) (25, 18) (12, 27) (12, 29) (12, 19) (2, 14) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 7) (18, 15) (18, 25) (18, 2) (18, 4) (28, 11) (28, 29) (28, 8) (28, 19) (29, 12) (29, 28) (29, 9) (29, 7) (4, 16) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 21) (24, 26) (26, 24) (26, 6) (20, 8) (20, 6) (9, 11) (9, 29) (9, 19) (10, 16) (10, 0) (21, 13) (21, 17) (21, 4) (5, 25) (5, 2) (5, 4) (0, 13) (0, 15) (0, 3) (0, 10) (8, 11) (8, 22) (8, 28) (8, 20) (7, 2) (7, 29) (1, 23) (19, 12) (19, 2) (19, 28) (19, 9) (6, 26) (6, 20) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) from least to most. Let's relabel the vertices and proceed with counting the number of triangles.

After relabeling the vertices based on their degree (number of connections):
Nodes: (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), ..., (29, 7)

The sorted list of edges becomes:
(2, 3) (10, 0) (10, 3) (2, 4) (10, 16) (20, 6) (20, 8) (1, 23) (10, 0) (19, 2) (20, 6) (2, 5) (10, 16) (10, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 19) (3, 0) (10, 0) (3, 0) (20, 8) (10, 0) (3, 0) (20, 8) (4, 5) (12, 19) (16, 4) (4, 5) (2, 18) (4, 16) (2, 5) (14, 2) (16, 10) (17, 16) (14, 2) (16, 17) (17, 14) (17, 21) (16, 10) (17, 14) (16, 4) (17, 14) (13, 0) (13, 15) (13, 21) (13, 22) (15, 13) (15, 25) (15, 0) (21, 4) (13, 0) (21, 13) (15, 0) (15, 18) (18, 4) (15, 0) (13, 22) (15, 25) (18, 4) (22, 13) (22, 27) (22, 8) (22, 23) (27, 22) (27, 12) (27, 14) (18, 15) (22, 8) (18, 25) (22, 23) (18, 25) (27, 14) (22, 8) (27, 12) (27, 14) (23, 1) (18, 25) (23, 1) (23, 22) (25, 5) (18, 25) (25, 15) (25, 5) (25, 18) (26, 6) (26, 24) (28, 8) (28, 19) (28, 29) (26, 6) (28, 8) (24, 26) (28, 8) (28, 19) (28, 29) (26, 24) (29, 7) (29, 9) (29, 12) (29, 19) (4, 18) (29, 7) (29, 12) (4, 18) (9, 19) (29, 19) (29, 7) (9, 19) (9, 29) (9, 19) (9, 29)

Total number of triangles: [12]
Unique triangles found: <0, 10, 3>, <0, 10, 16>, <0, 10, 4>, <0, 10, 2>, <0, 12, 10>, <1, 8, 20>, <13, 15, 18>, <13, 15, 0>, <13, 15, 21>, <22, 8, 27>, <18, 25, 2>, <18, 25, 5>
