Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 13) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 9) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree. The sorted nodes are:
Node 3 [degree: 2]
Node 1 [degree: 3]
Node 0 [degree: 3]
Node 11 [degree: 3]
Node 9 [degree: 4]
Node 13 [degree: 4]
Node 2 [degree: 4]
Node 5 [degree: 4]
Node 7 [degree: 4]
Node 14 [degree: 8]
Node 6 [degree: 5]
Node 8 [degree: 6]
Node 12 [degree: 4]
Node 10 [degree: 4]
Node 4 [degree: 3]

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we proceed with the edges in the graph where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

1. Edge between Node 4 and Node 8 (4, 8) forms a triangle with Node 10. Triangle: <4, 8, 10>
2. Edge between Node 4 and Node 10 (4, 10) does not form a triangle.
3. Edge between Node 4 and Node 2 (4, 2) does not form a triangle.
4. Edge between Node 8 and Node 14 (8, 14) forms a triangle with Node 11. Triangle: <8, 14, 11>
5. Edge between Node 8 and Node 11 (8, 11) does not form a triangle.
6. Edge between Node 8 and Node 6 (8, 6) forms a triangle with Node 7. Triangle: <8, 6, 7>
7. Edge between Node 8 and Node 7 (8, 7) forms a triangle with Node 6. Triangle: <8, 7, 6>
8. Edge between Node 7 and Node 6 (7, 6) does not form a triangle.
9. Edge between Node 7 and Node 2 (7, 2) does not form a triangle.
10. Edge between Node 12 and Node 2 (12, 2) does not form a triangle.
11. Edge between Node 12 and Node 14 (12, 14) forms a triangle with Node 5. Triangle: <12, 14, 5>
12. Edge between Node 12 and Node 3 (12, 3) does not form a triangle.
13. Edge between Node 12 and Node 9 (12, 9) does not form a triangle.
14. Edge between Node 5 and Node 6 (5, 6) forms a triangle with Node 14. Triangle: <5, 6, 14>
15. Edge between Node 5 and Node 13 (5, 13) does not form a triangle.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are: <4, 8, 10>, <8, 14, 11>, <8, 6, 7>, <12, 14, 5>.
