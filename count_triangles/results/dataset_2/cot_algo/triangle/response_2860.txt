Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 5) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 2) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 3) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 12) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count triangles efficiently. Let's assign labels to each node based on their degrees, from the lowest degree to the highest:

Node 0 has degree 3
Node 2 has degree 3
Node 12 has degree 3
Node 3 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 4
Node 13 has degree 5
Node 5 has degree 5
Node 8 has degree 6
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 5
Node 10 has degree 4
Node 14 has degree 3
Node 4 has degree 5
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 11 has degree 7

Now, let's write down the given edges considering the vertices with lower labels having fewer connections:

Edges to consider based on Degree-Based Ordering:
(4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 1) (10, 6) (11, 1) (8, 9) (13, 0) (0, 6) (14, 3) (9, 12) (2, 1) (5, 12)

Now, let's count the triangles formed by these edges:
[Total number of triangles: 7]
<4, 7, 1>
<4, 11, 1>
<4, 5, 12>
<7, 1, 11>
<8, 9, 13>
<13, 6, 0>
<13, 2, 1>
