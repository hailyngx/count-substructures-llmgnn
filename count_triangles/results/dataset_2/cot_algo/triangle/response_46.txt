Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 10) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 10), (9, 11), (9, 1), (9, 7), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 4), (1, 12), (3, 11), (3, 10), (3, 4), (0, 14), (0, 13), (0, 4), (14, 11), (14, 2), (14, 4), (13, 0), (13, 2), (13, 7), (7, 11), (7, 13), (11, 8), (11, 12), (8, 6), (8, 5), (6, 8), (2, 14), (2, 13), (2, 12), (2, 10), (2, 4), (12, 11), (10, 5), (10, 3), (10, 2), (10, 4)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by their degree:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 6: degree 2
Node 12: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 14: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 1: degree 5
Node 9: degree 5
Node 13: degree 4
Node 11: degree 6
Node 10: degree 4
Node 2: degree 6
Node 4: degree 7
Node 5: degree 5

Now, we will count the triangles using the given edges:

[Total number of triangles: 25]
