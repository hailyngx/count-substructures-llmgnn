Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
The degrees of the vertices in the graph are as follows:  
0: 3  
1: 3  
2: 5  
3: 5  
4: 6  
5: 4  
6: 5  
7: 2  
8: 3  
9: 4  

Reordering the vertices based on their degrees gives:  
0: 3  
1: 3  
7: 2  
8: 3  
9: 4  
4: 6  
5: 4  
6: 5  
2: 5  
3: 5  

Now let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

We will consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
[7, 2, 6]
[7, 2, 4]
[7, 2, 9]
[7, 2, 6]
[7, 2, 0]
[7, 2, 4]
[7, 2, 6]
[7, 6, 2]

Total number of triangles: [8]
