Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 2) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 2) (6, 14) (12, 5) (12, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly. 

The sorted vertices are:
(10, 6) (11, 5) (8, 5) (13, 5) (4, 5) (3, 4) (9, 4) (7, 4) (2, 4) (5, 4) (1, 4) (0, 3) (14, 3) (6, 2) (12, 2)

Using the sorted vertices, we can analyze the edges based on the instructions provided. 

As we go through the edges, we only consider cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

The triangles formed by the shared connections are:
<1, 5, 11> 
<1, 7, 14> 
<1, 9, 11> 
<2, 4, 10> 
<2, 13, 14> 
<5, 8, 10> 
<7, 9, 11> 

Finally, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
