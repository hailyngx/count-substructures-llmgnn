Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 1) (1, 13) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 3) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees, from least to most connections. The vertices with their respective degrees are as follows:

(1) 1: 0 connections
(2) 13: 1 connection
(3) 1: 1 connection
(4) 9: 2 connections
(5) 5: 2 connections
(6) 7: 2 connections
(7) 12: 2 connections
(8) 8: 3 connections
(9) 3: 4 connections
(10) 11: 4 connections
(11) 6: 4 connections
(12) 10: 5 connections
(13) 14: 5 connections
(14) 0: 5 connections
(15) 4: 6 connections

Based on the degrees, the vertex ordering is: 1, 13, 2, 9, 5, 7, 12, 8, 3, 11, 6, 10, 14, 0, 4.

Now, counting the number of triangles based on the sorted vertices:

- For the edge (4, 7): Both 4 and 7 have fewer connections than 12, so check for shared connections. Shared connections are 0 and 8. So, there is one triangle: <0, 4, 7>.
- For the edge (4, 9): Both 4 and 9 have fewer connections than 3, so check for shared connections. Shared connections are 2 and 11. So, there is one triangle: <2, 4, 9>.
- For the edge (4, 5): Both 4 and 5 have fewer connections than 6, so check for shared connections. Shared connections are 2 and 3. So, there is one triangle: <2, 4, 5>.
- For the edge (4, 11): Both 4 and 11 have fewer connections than 6, so check for shared connections. Shared connections are 0 and 9. So, there is one triangle: <0, 4, 11>.
- For the edge (4, 2): 4 has more connections than 2, so no triangle is formed.
- For any other remaining edges, no triangles are formed.

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 11>.
