Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 16) (18, 5) (18, 17) (18, 1) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 15) (1, 18) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 0) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 19) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 14) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 9) (12, 0) (11, 19) (14, 1) (14, 10) (3, 9) (16, 2) (16, 17) (16, 9) (17, 18) (17, 16) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 3) (9, 16) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 12) 

Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. 

The degree of each node is as follows:
0: 4 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 3 connections
9: 5 connections
10: 4 connections
11: 2 connections
12: 1 connection
13: 3 connections
14: 2 connections
15: 4 connections
16: 3 connections
17: 3 connections
18: 4 connections
19: 4 connections

By sorting the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order, we get the labels:
3, 11, 12, 14, 17, 7, 8, 16, 0, 1, 10, 15, 4, 5, 6, 2, 13, 18, 19, 9

Using the degree-based ordering method to count triangles, we find:
- Triangle <0, 1, 15>
- Triangle <0, 1, 18>
- Triangle <0, 5, 18>
- Triangle <1, 10, 14>
- Triangle <1, 15, 19>
- Triangle <4, 7, 10>
- Triangle <4, 13, 7>
- Triangle <5, 6, 15>
- Triangle <9, 16, 4>
- Triangle <9, 16, 17>
- Triangle <9, 16, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
