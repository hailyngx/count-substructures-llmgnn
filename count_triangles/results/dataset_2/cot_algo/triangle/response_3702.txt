Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 15) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 3) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 1) (17, 14) (17, 18) (6, 18) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 1) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 10) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 19) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 2) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 10) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 12) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 6) (19, 11) (19, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 5) 

Response:
The given graph consists of 20 nodes and 60 edges. Let's construct the graph using the provided edge list and then count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The vertices will be labeled based on their degree as follows:
- Node 16 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 14 has degree 3
- Node 17 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 13 has degree 4
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 10 has degree 4
- Node 15 has degree 3
- Node 12 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 18 has degree 4
- Node 19 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 11 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 1

Now, let's count the triangles and output the total number inside brackets [].

Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 7, 11>
<4, 9, 1>
<4, 3, 12>
<5, 9, 15>
<13, 3, 12>
<13, 2, 12>
<13, 5, 3>
<15, 9, 10>
<18, 11, 17>
<18, 6, 0>
