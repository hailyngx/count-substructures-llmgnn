Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 10) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (12, 9) (12, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and edges:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: {(6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 14), (6, 3), (9, 4), (9, 11), (9, 1), (9, 12), (4, 7), (4, 13), (4, 11), (4, 3), (7, 3), (7, 10), (7, 8), (7, 5), (8, 13), (8, 2), (8, 11), (13, 0), (2, 1), (2, 14), (2, 0), (0, 3), (14, 10), (5, 10), (3, 10), (12, 11)}

To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first relabel the nodes based on their number of connections in ascending order:
Nodes with their connections: 
(0: 3), (1: 3), (2: 4), (3: 5), (4: 5), (5: 3), (6: 4), (7: 4), (8: 4), (9: 4), (10: 4), (11: 6), (12: 2), (13: 3), (14: 3)

Using the sorted nodes, we will count the triangles present in the graph. 

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: 
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 3, 10>
<1, 2, 9>
<4, 7, 13>
<4, 11, 12>
