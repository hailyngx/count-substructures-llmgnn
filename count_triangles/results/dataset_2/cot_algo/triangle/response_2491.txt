Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 10) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 11) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 10, 11
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 12, 14
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 10, 13
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 12
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, 11
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 10, 14
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 12, 13
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, 10, 12, 13
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 9, 11, 12, 14
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, 10, 11
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 2, 8, 9, 10
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 11

Now, we will sort the nodes based on the number of connections:

Node 1: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 0: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 12: degree 5
Node 5: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 9: degree 6
Node 11: degree 5
Node 10: degree 6

Let's proceed with counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
