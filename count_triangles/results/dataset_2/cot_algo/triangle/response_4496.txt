Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be visually represented as follows:

```
0 --- 1           8 --- 9
|     |   \       |     |
|     |     2     |     |
|     |   /       |     |
4 --- 5 -- 7       6 --- 3
```

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Nodes in increasing order of degree: (2), (4, 6, 9), (0), (7), (5), (1, 8), (3)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- For edge (1,0): Ignore because both have the same degree.
- For edge (1,1): Ignore because the vertex with the lower label already has more connections.
- For edge (1,2): Ignore because both have the same degree.
- For edge (1,1): Ignore because the vertex with the lower label already has more connections.
- For edge (1,8): This forms a triangle <1, 0, 8>.

The total number of triangles is [1].
The unique triangles found are <1, 0, 8>.
