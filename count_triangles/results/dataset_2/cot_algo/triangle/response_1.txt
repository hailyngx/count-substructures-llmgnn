Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 12) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 3) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 13) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 12) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 14)
