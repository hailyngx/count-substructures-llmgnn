Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 20) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 10) (13, 22) (13, 24) (13, 7) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 25) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 6) (29, 15) (18, 28) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 2) (10, 14) (23, 22) (23, 2) (23, 3) (23, 21) (23, 0) (12, 27) (12, 15) (27, 12) (27, 3) (3, 23) (3, 27) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 9) (25, 22) (25, 3) (0, 23) (0, 24) (6, 29) (6, 1) (6, 19) (28, 18) (28, 3) (5, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (20, 11) (20, 29) (20, 1) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 15) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 21) (19, 17) (14, 10) (14, 26) (14, 4) (14, 15) (26, 14) (26, 21) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 20) (1, 24) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 9) (24, 13) (24, 0) (24, 8) (24, 1) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 21) (15, 29) (15, 12) (15, 8) (15, 14) (21, 23) (21, 19) (21, 26) (21, 9) (4, 16) (4, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. Let's do this for the graph you provided:

1. Vertex 5 has degree 2.
2. Vertex 7 has degree 2.
3. Vertex 18 has degree 2.
4. Vertex 27 has degree 2.
5. Vertex 0 has degree 3.
6. Vertex 12 has degree 3.
7. Vertex 6 has degree 4.
8. Vertex 8 has degree 4.
9. Vertex 1 has degree 4.
10. Vertex 26 has degree 4.
11. Vertex 4 has degree 4.
12. Vertex 17 has degree 4.
13. Vertex 20 has degree 4.
14. Vertex 9 has degree 4.
15. Vertex 11 has degree 5.
16. Vertex 28 has degree 5.
17. Vertex 10 has degree 6.
18. Vertex 13 has degree 6.
19. Vertex 2 has degree 6.
20. Vertex 15 has degree 6.
21. Vertex 25 has degree 6.
22. Vertex 3 has degree 7.
23. Vertex 24 has degree 7.
24. Vertex 22 has degree 7.
25. Vertex 29 has degree 7.
26. Vertex 21 has degree 7.

Now, let's count the triangles based on this ordering:

1. Vertices with lower degrees form edges with higher degree vertices:
   - <5, 8, 24> (Formed by edge (8, 24))
   - <5, 8, 15> (Formed by edge (8, 15))
   - <7, 1, 6>  (Formed by edge (1, 6))
   - <7, 8, 9>  (Formed by edge (8, 9))
   - <18, 28, 3>  (Formed by edge (28, 3))
   - <0, 23, 24>  (Formed by edge (0, 24))
   - <0, 24, 1>  (Formed by edge (24, 1))
   - <12, 27, 3>  (Formed by edge (27, 3))
   - <12, 15, 8>  (Formed by edge (15, 8))
   - <6, 8, 19>  (Formed by edge (8, 19))
   - <1, 6, 24>  (Formed by edge (1, 24))
   - <4, 16, 10>  (Formed by edge (10, 16))
   - <13, 22, 23>  (Formed by edge (22, 23))
   - <13, 22, 25>  (Formed by edge (22, 25))
   - <22, 23, 25>  (Formed by edge (23, 25))
   - <4, 14, 15>  (Formed by edge (14, 15))

2. Counting the total number of triangles results in 16.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
