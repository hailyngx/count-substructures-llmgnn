Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 9) (16, 19) (16, 5) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 18) (13, 6) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 7) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 1) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 8) (19, 2) (7, 17) (7, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 12) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 5) (9, 11) (10, 5) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (5, 16) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 18) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 5) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 18, 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8, 2, 4, 12
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 14, 19, 7, 1, 6
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 14, 4
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 1, 5
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 16, 4, 10, 18
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 13, 2, 18, 12
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 17, 2
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 19, 1
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 11
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 14, 9
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 17, 1, 6
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 17, 19, 18, 6
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11, 3, 2
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 19, 5
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 13, 12, 18, 7
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 0, 13, 17, 6, 5
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 16, 13, 8, 2

Now, we'll sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):
Nodes in ascending order of degrees: 10, 7, 9, 0, 4, 12, 3, 1, 8, 16, 11, 6, 5, 14, 2, 19, 17, 13, 18

After relabeling based on degrees:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19

Now, we'll go through each edge and count the triangles:
Triangles: [29]

Unique triangles: 
<2, 7, 17>
<0, 3, 14>
<0, 8, 19>
<0, 13, 18>
<1, 4, 12>
<2, 6, 13>
<2, 6, 18>
<2, 13, 19>
<4, 5, 18>
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 6, 12>
<1, 8, 19>
<1, 2, 14>
<5, 10, 18>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 13>
<1, 8, 0>
<1, 4, 3>
<2, 14, 3>
<2, 7, 17>
<4, 3, 0>
<4, 3, 14>
<2, 14, 11>
<6, 18, 0>
<6, 13, 17>
<6, 13, 19>
<6, 18, 5>
<18, 5, 16>
