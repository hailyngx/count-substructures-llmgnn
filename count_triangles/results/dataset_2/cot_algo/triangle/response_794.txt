Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0 -> 4, 1, 2
- 1 -> 3, 2, 0, 8
- 2 -> 7, 9, 1, 8, 5, 0
- 3 -> 7, 9, 1, 5, 8
- 4 -> 7, 0, 6
- 5 -> 3, 8, 2
- 6 -> 4, 7, 9
- 7 -> 4, 3, 6, 9, 2
- 8 -> 1, 3, 2, 5
- 9 -> 7, 6, 2, 3

After sorting the nodes based on the number of connections, we get the following relabeling:
Nodes: 0, 5, 6, 1, 8, 9, 3, 2, 7, 4

Now, we can count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Number of triangles: [13]

Unique triangles:
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 8, 5>
<1, 8, 3>
<1, 8, 2>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 8, 2>
<5, 2, 8>
<5, 8, 3>
<7, 9, 6>
<8, 5, 2>
<9, 7, 6>
