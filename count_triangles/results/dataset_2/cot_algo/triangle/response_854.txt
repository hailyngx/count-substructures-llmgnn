Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (9), (4), (1)
- 1: (4), (2), (0), (7)
- 2: (5), (6), (8), (1), (7)
- 3: (5), (9), (4), (8)
- 4: (5), (0), (1), (3)
- 5: (2), (8), (4), (3)
- 6: (7), (2), (8)
- 7: (9), (6), (8), (2), (1)
- 8: (5), (6), (2), (7), (3)
- 9: (3), (7), (0)

Now, sorting the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order: 0->1, 6, 2; 1->1, 4, 7, 2; 2->1, 7, 5, 6, 8; 3->1, 5, 8, 9; 4->1, 0, 1, 3, 5; 5->2, 3, 4, 8; 6->2, 7, 8; 7->2, 1, 8, 9, 6; 8->3, 2, 5, 6, 7; 9->1, 3, 7.

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given edges, we find the following triangles:
- <4, 0, 1>
- <7, 1, 4>
- <0, 9, 7>
- <8, 6, 7>
- <8, 6, 2>
- <8, 5, 2>
- <8, 5, 3>
- <8, 5, 4>
- <8, 3, 4>
- <3, 9, 7>
- <3, 5, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
