Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 4) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 6) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 9) (7, 1) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 10) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 4) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 6) 

Response:
The given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges:
(0, 7), (0, 11), (0, 5)
(14, 6), (14, 1), (14, 12)
(2, 13), (2, 3)
(8, 5), (8, 6)
(3, 2), (3, 11), (3, 6), (3, 13), (3, 9)
(11, 0), (11, 3), (11, 7), (11, 5), (11, 4)
(5, 0), (5, 8), (5, 11), (5, 13), (5, 10)
(13, 2), (13, 3), (13, 5), (13, 7), (13, 6)
(7, 0), (7, 11), (7, 13), (7, 9), (7, 1)
(4, 11), (4, 12), (4, 9), (4, 10), (4, 1)
(12, 14), (12, 4), (12, 10), (12, 6)
(6, 14), (6, 8), (6, 3), (6, 13), (6, 12), (6, 10)
(1, 14), (1, 7), (1, 4)
(9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 4)
(10, 5), (10, 4), (10, 12), (10, 6)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by number of connections:
0, 2, 8, 9, 12, 14, 1, 10, 4, 7, 5, 13, 3, 6, 11

Total number of triangles: [29]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 5, 11>
<1, 4, 12>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 14>
<3, 7, 11>
<3, 7, 13>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 12>
<5, 8, 13>
<5, 10, 12>
<6, 8, 13>
<6, 10, 12>
<7, 9, 11>
<8, 5, 13>
<10, 4, 12>
