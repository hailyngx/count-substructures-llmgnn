Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 10) (14, 7) (14, 11) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 5) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order. Then, the vertices are relabeled accordingly. Here is the sorted list of vertices and their respective labels:

(9) - 0 connections
(0, 4, 5, 8) - 1 connection each
(1, 3, 14) - 2 connections each
(7, 13) - 3 connections each
(2, 10) - 4 connections each
(6, 12) - 5 connections each
(11) - 6 connections

Now we will iterate through each edge while following the conditions mentioned earlier. We will count the triangles formed:
1. (6, 5) - Can form triangles with (5, 2, 6) and (5, 6, 11)
2. (6, 10) - Can form triangles with (10, 2, 6)

4. (6, 4) - Not applicable according to the conditions.
5. (6, 13) - Not applicable according to the conditions.
6. (9, 3) - Can form a triangle with (3, 8, 9)
7. (9, 13) - Not applicable according to the conditions.
8. (9, 0) - Not applicable according to the conditions.

After considering all the applicable edges following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11]. 
The unique triangles found are <5, 2, 6>, <10, 2, 6>, <11, 7, 6>, <3, 8, 9>, <7, 2, 4>, <12, 10, 7>, <12, 11, 7>, <11, 14, 7>, <8, 10, 7>, <3, 12, 8>, and <2, 5, 12>.
