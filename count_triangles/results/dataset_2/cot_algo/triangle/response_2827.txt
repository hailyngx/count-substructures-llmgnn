Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 10) (1, 19) (21, 0) (21, 4) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 27) (9, 19) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 23) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 11) (20, 25) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 10) (8, 27) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 7) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 18) (27, 5) (27, 9) (27, 8) (27, 12) (27, 26) (6, 25) (6, 17) (6, 11) (16, 4) (16, 19) (7, 13) (7, 23) (7, 26) (4, 21) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 23) (26, 5) (26, 27) (26, 7) (26, 29) (2, 5) (2, 11) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 24) (24, 11) (24, 10) (17, 3) (17, 6) (0, 21) (0, 23) (29, 26) (29, 23) (29, 22) (10, 1) (10, 25) (10, 12) (10, 24) (23, 3) (23, 7) (23, 4) (23, 0) (23, 29) (22, 29) (18, 12) (14, 5) (14, 15) (14, 20) (14, 13) (14, 19) (19, 1) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method.

First, let's sort the vertices based on the number of connections:
Vertices by degree: 
Node 0 - 2 neighbors
Node 1 - 2 neighbors
Node 2 - 2 neighbors
Node 3 - 4 neighbors
Node 4 - 4 neighbors
Node 5 - 5 neighbors
Node 6 - 3 neighbors
Node 7 - 3 neighbors
Node 8 - 1 neighbor
Node 9 - 3 neighbors
Node 10 - 4 neighbors
Node 11 - 4 neighbors
Node 12 - 4 neighbors
Node 13 - 3 neighbors
Node 14 - 5 neighbors
Node 15 - 4 neighbors
Node 16 - 2 neighbors
Node 17 - 2 neighbors
Node 18 - 1 neighbor
Node 19 - 5 neighbors
Node 20 - 2 neighbors
Node 21 - 2 neighbors
Node 22 - 1 neighbor
Node 23 - 5 neighbors
Node 24 - 2 neighbors
Node 25 - 3 neighbors
Node 26 - 5 neighbors
Node 27 - 5 neighbors
Node 29 - 4 neighbors

Next, we will label the vertices in increasing order of their degree:
Node 0 -> Node 22
Node 1 -> Node 18
Node 2 -> Node 8
Node 3 -> Node 16
Node 4 -> Node 0
Node 5 -> Node 1
Node 6 -> Node 17
Node 7 -> Node 20
Node 8 -> Node 10
Node 9 -> Node 24
Node 10 -> Node 2
Node 11 -> Node 21
Node 12 -> Node 6
Node 13 -> Node 7
Node 14 -> Node 25
Node 15 -> Node 5
Node 16 -> Node 15
Node 17 -> Node 26
Node 18 -> Node 13
Node 19 -> Node 11
Node 20 -> Node 9
Node 21 -> Node 27
Node 22 -> Node 12
Node 23 -> Node 19
Node 24 -> Node 3
Node 25 -> Node 4
Node 26 -> Node 14
Node 27 -> Node 29
Node 29 -> Node 23

Now, we will count the triangles based on the sorted vertices and the given edges. 

The total number of triangles is [12].

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 15, 14>
<5, 14, 20>
<5, 14, 19>
<5, 15, 13>
<5, 15, 14>
<5, 19, 14>
<5, 19, 16>
<9, 5, 27>
<14, 15, 13>
<19, 14, 15>
<19, 14, 16>
<26, 7, 23>
