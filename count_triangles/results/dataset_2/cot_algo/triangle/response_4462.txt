Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 11) (22, 17) (22, 7) (2, 29) (2, 17) (2, 15) (29, 2) (29, 16) (29, 18) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 26) (6, 19) (9, 22) (9, 6) (9, 15) (0, 27) (0, 25) (0, 8) (0, 23) (27, 13) (27, 0) (27, 19) (15, 2) (15, 9) (15, 20) (15, 8) (20, 15) (21, 4) (21, 24) (28, 14) (28, 25) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 12) (17, 22) (17, 2) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 16) (5, 25) (5, 7) (19, 6) (19, 27) (19, 24) (8, 0) (8, 15) (4, 21) (4, 12) (4, 24) (4, 16) (12, 1) (12, 4) (25, 0) (25, 28) (25, 17) (25, 5) (10, 26) (10, 14) (26, 6) (26, 10) (26, 3) (11, 22) (11, 24) (11, 18) (24, 21) (24, 19) (24, 4) (24, 11) (3, 26) (3, 14) (14, 28) (14, 10) (14, 3) (18, 29) (18, 11) (23, 0) (23, 7) (16, 29) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 4) (7, 22) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 23) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their degrees:

Vertex 28: degree 2
Vertex 10: degree 2
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 23: degree 2
Vertex 20: degree 2
Vertex 21: degree 2
Vertex 5: degree 2
Vertex 1: degree 3
Vertex 12: degree 3
Vertex 18: degree 3
Vertex 29: degree 3
Vertex 0: degree 4
Vertex 13: degree 4
Vertex 11: degree 4
Vertex 26: degree 4
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 4
Vertex 19: degree 4
Vertex 27: degree 4
Vertex 6: degree 4
Vertex 15: degree 4
Vertex 24: degree 5
Vertex 17: degree 5
Vertex 16: degree 5
Vertex 9: degree 5
Vertex 7: degree 5
Vertex 22: degree 5
Vertex 2: degree 5
Vertex 25: degree 5
Vertex 14: degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
