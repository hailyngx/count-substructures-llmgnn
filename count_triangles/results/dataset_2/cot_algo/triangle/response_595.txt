Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- 0: {1, 4, 2}
- 1: {9, 6, 4, 0, 8}
- 2: {5, 4, 6, 0, 7}
- 3: {7, 6, 4, 8}
- 4: {9, 1, 3, 8, 0, 2}
- 5: {9, 2}
- 6: {1, 3, 2}
- 7: {3, 8, 2}
- 8: {9, 1, 3, 4, 7}
- 9: {5, 8, 4, 1}

Now, to count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Sort nodes by their degrees in ascending order: {0, 5, 7, 9, 6, 2, 3, 8, 1, 4}
- Relabel the vertices accordingly: 
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, we will go through the edges and count the number of triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method while ensuring the conditions are met:

[Total number of triangles: 14]
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 6, 4>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 8, 9> 

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
