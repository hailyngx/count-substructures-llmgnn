Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 25) (5, 10) (9, 22) (9, 17) (9, 3) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 25) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 0) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 24) (18, 29) (22, 9) (22, 18) (22, 10) (22, 0) (22, 15) (8, 14) (8, 27) (23, 15) (23, 24) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 11) (13, 2) (13, 26) (26, 18) (26, 13) (26, 7) (26, 4) (3, 9) (3, 21) (3, 7) (21, 3) (21, 0) (21, 12) (21, 29) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 25) (28, 20) (19, 11) (1, 6) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 15) (7, 26) (7, 3) (7, 11) (11, 2) (11, 19) (11, 7) (11, 15) (0, 17) (0, 22) (0, 21) (0, 28) (0, 29) (20, 28) (20, 24) (20, 10) (25, 5) (25, 14) (25, 28) (15, 22) (15, 23) (15, 6) (15, 11) (29, 18) (29, 21) (29, 0) (29, 12) (10, 5) (10, 22) (10, 20) (10, 27) (10, 4) (27, 8) (27, 10) (12, 21) (12, 28) (12, 29) (24, 18) (24, 23) (24, 20) (4, 26) (4, 10) 

Response:
The graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges can be visually represented as:
```
0: 17 21 28 29
1: 6
2: 6 11 13
3: 7 9 21
4: 10 26
5: 10 25
6: 1 2 15
7: 3 11 26
8: 14 27
9: 3 9 17 22
10: 4 5 10 20 22 27
11: 2 6 7 15 19
12: 21 28 29
13: 2 26
14: 8 17 25
15: 6 11 15 22 23
17: 0 9 14
18: 22 24 26 29
19: 11
20: 10 20 24 28
21: 0 3 12 29
22: 9 10 15 18
23: 15 24
24: 18 20 23
25: 5 14 25 28
26: 4 13 18 26
27: 8 10
28: 0 12 20 25
29: 0 12 18 21
```

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices are: 1, 19, 4, 5, 8, 27, 13, 23, 24, 7, 19, 2, 26, 3, 8, 9, 20, 28, 28, 1, 7, 19, 0, 6, 14, 18, 22, 25, 29, 12

We will now count the number of triangles:
Within the given edges, the total count of triangles is: [39]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 17, 21>
<0, 17, 29>
<0, 21, 29>
<0, 22, 29>
<0, 28, 29>
<4, 10, 26>
<6, 11, 15>
<6, 15, 22>
<7, 11, 15>
<9, 17, 22>
<10, 20, 28>
<12, 21, 29>
<14, 17, 25>
<18, 22, 26>
<20, 24, 28>
<22, 25, 28>
<23, 24, 28>
<24, 25, 28>
<25, 26, 28>
<25, 28, 29>
