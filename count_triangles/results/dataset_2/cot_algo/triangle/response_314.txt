Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 10) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 10) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 10) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Let's begin by sorting the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices in ascending order of degree:
0 (Degree: 4)
9 (Degree: 4)
11 (Degree: 4)
12 (Degree: 4)
5 (Degree: 4)
6 (Degree: 4)
2 (Degree: 4)
4 (Degree: 5)
7 (Degree: 5)
8 (Degree: 5)
1 (Degree: 5)
13 (Degree: 7)
10 (Degree: 5)
3 (Degree: 7)
14 (Degree: 5)

Now, let's count the triangles by examining the edges:

Triangles found:
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 13>
<1, 10, 14>
<2, 0, 6>
<3, 0, 6>
<3, 0, 13>
<3, 4, 8>
<7, 1, 10>
<9, 2, 0>
<11, 12, 14>

Total number of triangles: [10]
