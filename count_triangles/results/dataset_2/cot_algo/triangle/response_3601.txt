Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 11) (9, 1) (26, 19) (26, 24) (15, 20) (15, 21) (27, 21) (27, 22) (27, 6) (27, 8) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 20) (29, 4) (4, 29) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 25) (7, 16) (7, 22) (8, 27) (8, 16) (8, 3) (23, 17) (23, 25) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 21) (0, 1) (20, 15) (20, 2) (20, 24) (20, 5) (17, 23) (17, 28) (17, 12) (17, 11) (19, 26) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 12) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 5) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 25) (24, 26) (24, 20) (3, 8) (3, 28) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 17) (25, 7) (25, 23) (25, 18) (28, 17) (28, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 27) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 12) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 12) (16, 22) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 16) (5, 20) (5, 14) (5, 3) (21, 15) (21, 27) (21, 0) (22, 27) (22, 7) (22, 16) (10, 4) (13, 19) (13, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections). Once the nodes are reordered, we can count the triangles in the graph. 

Given the edges provided, the reordered nodes based on their degrees are as follows:
Nodes with the lowest degree: 10, 29
Nodes with degree 1: 9, 26, 15, 3, 1, 5, 10
Nodes with degree 2: 24, 13, 18
Nodes with degree 3: 7, 23, 11, 22
Nodes with degree 4: 17, 25
Nodes with degree 5: 19, 0, 14
Nodes with degree 6: 12, 8, 21
Nodes with the highest degree: 27, 20, 6, 4, 2, 16

Based on the reordering, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph. After counting, the total number of triangles is [11], and the unique triangles found are:
<2, 6, 12>
<2, 6, 16>
<2, 19, 26>
<2, 14, 19>
<12, 16, 6>
<12, 16, 22>
<6, 12, 16>
<4, 6, 27>
<7, 16, 22>
<7, 16, 25>
<12, 16, 22>
