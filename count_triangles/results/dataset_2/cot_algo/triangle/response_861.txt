   Node 16: Degree 2
   Node 1: Degree 2
   Node 18: Degree 2
   Node 4: Degree 2
   Node 2: Degree 2
   Node 5: Degree 3
   Node 11: Degree 3
   Node 12: Degree 3
   Node 20: Degree 3
   Node 21: Degree 3
   Node 23: Degree 3
   Node 24: Degree 4
   Node 26: Degree 4
   Node 9: Degree 4
   Node 10: Degree 4
   Node 7: Degree 4
   Node 19: Degree 4
   Node 8: Degree 4
   Node 15: Degree 4
   Node 27: Degree 4
   Node 3: Degree 5
   Node 13: Degree 5
   Node 29: Degree 4
   Node 17: Degree 4
   Node 28: Degree 4
   Node 25: Degree 3
   Node 0: Degree 5
   Node 14: Degree 3
   Node 22: Degree 4

2. Count the number of triangles based on the sorted nodes and edges.
