Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves relabeling the vertices based on their degrees. 
After sorting the vertices by their degrees from least connected to most connected, the new labels for the vertices should be:
(0:1), (5:3), (6:3), (2:3), (4:4), (7:4), (1:4), (3:5), (8:5), (9:6).

Following the method of only counting triangles that involve the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections, we can count the triangles:

1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <0, 1, 6>
5. <0, 1, 4>
6. <0, 4, 5>
7. <0, 7, 9>
8. <1, 4, 6>
9. <1, 4, 5>
10. <1, 5, 7>
11. <1, 6, 7>
12. <1, 4, 9>
13. <1, 4, 9>
14. <3, 6, 8>
15. <3, 6, 7>
16. <3, 6, 4>
17. <3, 7, 8>
18. <3, 7, 9>
19. <3, 8, 9>
20. <4, 5, 9>
21. <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [21].
