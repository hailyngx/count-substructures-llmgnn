Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections). Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly. The edges are only considered if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

After sorting the nodes by their degrees, the new labels for the nodes are:
Node 0: Degree 4 (Neighbors: 3, 6, 2)
Node 1: Degree 4 (Neighbors: 5, 7, 3, 6)
Node 2: Degree 5 (Neighbors: 9, 4, 7, 6, 0)
Node 3: Degree 4 (Neighbors: 1, 0, 6, 8)
Node 4: Degree 6 (Neighbors: 5, 9, 7, 8, 2)
Node 5: Degree 3 (Neighbors: 9, 1, 4)
Node 6: Degree 5 (Neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 2, 0)
Node 7: Degree 4 (Neighbors: 4, 2, 1)
Node 8: Degree 5 (Neighbors: 9, 4, 3, 6, 2)
Node 9: Degree 5 (Neighbors: 5, 8, 4, 2, 0)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph. 

The total number of triangles is: [9]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
