Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 10) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 2) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 11) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
0 -- 11 -- 6 -- 5 -- 12 -- 2
|    |    |    |    |    |
13   7    8    |    |    10
|         |    3    |
14        1 -- 4    9
```

The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 

0 (degree 3), 13 (degree 3), 14 (degree 3), 10 (degree 4), 2 (degree 4), 4 (degree 4), 9 (degree 4), 7 (degree 4), 11 (degree 4), 6 (degree 5), 1 (degree 5), 8 (degree 5), 3 (degree 6), 5 (degree 6), 12 (degree 6).

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the given order and only count the triangles where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles is [17], and the unique triangles found are: 

<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 12>
<1, 7, 3>
<1, 7, 5>
<1, 12, 2>
<1, 12, 4>
<2, 4, 12>
<3, 7, 1>
<3, 7, 5>
<3, 8, 5>
<3, 8, 4>
<4, 8, 6>
<5, 7, 1>
<5, 7, 3>
<6, 8, 5>
<6, 11, 0>
<10, 2, 12>
