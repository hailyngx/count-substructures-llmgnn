Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 6, and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 3, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 1, 6, and 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 7, 1, and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 3, and 2.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 3, and 0.

Degree-Based Ordering:
Sorted nodes by degree: [0, 2, 8, 5, 7, 9, 1, 6, 4, 3]

Triangles:
- Possible triangles involve nodes 0, 5, and 9: <0, 5, 9>
- Possible triangles involve nodes 1, 3, and 6: <1, 3, 6>
- Possible triangles involve nodes 1, 4, and 6: <1, 4, 6>
- Possible triangles involve nodes 2, 3, and 8: <2, 3, 8>
- Possible triangles involve nodes 2, 4, and 8: <2, 4, 8>

Total number of triangles: [5]
