Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 7) (14, 3) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 8) (7, 16) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 19) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 3) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 3) (19, 13) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 0) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 18) (15, 7) (15, 1) (15, 4) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 10) (0, 8) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 13) (4, 16) (4, 15) (4, 2) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 19) (18, 1) (18, 10) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 10) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(11, 16), (11, 13), (11, 5), (16, 11), (16, 7), (16, 17), (16, 4), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (9, 7), 
(14, 3), (14, 5), (17, 16), (17, 8), (7, 16), (7, 9), (7, 12), (7, 15), (12, 7), 
(12, 2), (12, 19), (5, 11), (5, 6), (5, 14), (5, 19), (5, 3), (19, 12), (19, 5), (19, 3), 
(19, 13), (8, 17), (8, 10), (8, 0), (1, 6), (1, 15), (1, 18), (15, 7), (15, 1), (15, 4), 
(2, 6), (2, 12), (2, 4), (2, 10), (0, 8), (10, 8), (10, 2), (10, 18), (10, 13), (4, 16), 
(4, 15), (4, 2), (3, 14), (3, 5), (3, 19), (18, 1), (18, 10), (13, 11), (13, 19), (13, 10)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:

Degree-Based Ordering (from least connections to most):
Nodes with degree 1: 0, 9, 20
Nodes with degree 2: 3, 8, 18
Nodes with degree 3: 13, 14, 15, 17
Nodes with degree 4: 1, 4, 6
Nodes with degree 5: 5, 7, 19
Nodes with degree 6: 2, 12, 16
Nodes with degree 7: 10
Nodes with degree 8: 11

Now, let's find the number of triangles and list the unique triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 14]

Unique triangles:
<1, 2, 10>, <1, 2, 18>, <1, 6, 15>, <1, 15, 4>, <2, 6, 12>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 12, 19>, 
<6, 5, 19>, <7, 9, 12>, <7, 9, 15>, <7, 12, 15>, <15, 7, 2>, <16, 11, 13>, <16, 11, 5>
