Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 14) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 10) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 4) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 1) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 3) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 5) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows:

Vertices: 12 < 14 < 2 < 13 < 7 < 4 < 5 < 1 < 8 < 3 < 10 < 0 < 6 < 9 < 11

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (6, 9): Vertex 6 has 5 connections, vertex 9 has 5 connections. Since they have the same number of connections, we ignore this edge.
2. Edge (6, 7): Vertex 6 has 5 connections, vertex 7 has 4 connections. We proceed.
   - Shared connections: 0
3. Edge (6, 10): Vertex 6 has 5 connections, vertex 10 has 4 connections. We proceed.
   - Shared connections: 0
4. Edge (6, 11): Vertex 6 has 5 connections, vertex 11 has 5 connections. Since they have the same number of connections, we ignore this edge.
5. Edge (6, 0): Vertex 6 has 5 connections, vertex 0 has 5 connections. Since they have the same number of connections, we ignore this edge.
6. Edge (9, 4): Vertex 9 has 5 connections, vertex 4 has 5 connections. Since they have the same number of connections, we ignore this edge.
7. Edge (13, 8): Vertex 13 has 4 connections, vertex 8 has 4 connections. Since they have the same number of connections, we ignore this edge.
8. Edge (8, 11): Vertex 8 has 4 connections, vertex 11 has 5 connections. We proceed.
   - Shared connections: 0
