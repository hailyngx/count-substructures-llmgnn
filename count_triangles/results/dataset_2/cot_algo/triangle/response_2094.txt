Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree of connections. After relabeling the nodes based on their degree, we can evaluate the triangles in the graph.

Here is the relabeled graph with nodes sorted by degree:
(0) - Degree: 5
(1) - Degree: 4
(2) - Degree: 5
(3) - Degree: 4
(4) - Degree: 3
(5) - Degree: 4
(6) - Degree: 4
(7) - Degree: 4
(8) - Degree: 2
(9) - Degree: 4

Now we will consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 0>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 3>
<5, 3, 7>
<5, 3, 9>
<6, 4, 0>
<6, 4, 2>
<7, 5, 3>

Total number of triangles: [14]
