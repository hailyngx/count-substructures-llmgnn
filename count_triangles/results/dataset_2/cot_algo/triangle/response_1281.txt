Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 11) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 12), (5, 10), (5, 7), 
(9, 8), (9, 11), (9, 7), 
(6, 11), (6, 12), (6, 0), 
(0, 8), (0, 13), 
(14, 3), (14, 1), 
(2, 1), (2, 13), (2, 4), 
(8, 3), (8, 1), (8, 7), 
(3, 4), 
(11, 12), 
(10, 5), (10, 12), (10, 1), 
(7, 11), 
(1, 10)

Next, let's sort the nodes by their degree:
Nodes by degree: 4, 6, 10, 14, 0, 2, 9, 1, 8, 3, 11, 5, 13, 12, 7

Now, we'll relabel the nodes:
4 -> 0
6 -> 1
10 -> 2
14 -> 3
0 -> 4
2 -> 5
9 -> 6
1 -> 7
8 -> 8
3 -> 9
11 -> 10
5 -> 11
13 -> 12
12 -> 13
7 -> 14

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we look at each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- (5, 9)
- (6, 11)
- (6, 12)
- (0, 8)
- (14, 3)
- (2, 1)
- (8, 3)
- (11, 12)
- (10, 1)
- (7, 11)
- (1, 10)

Counting the number of triangles inside brackets []:
[13]

Unique triangles found inside <>:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 13>
<0, 8, 3>
<1, 10, 2>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 11>
<3, 8, 1>
<4, 8, 0>
<6, 11, 12>
<7, 11, 12>
<10, 1, 14>
<11, 12, 5>
<11, 12, 7>
