Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 14) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 11) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 1) (5, 11) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 12) (8, 4) (8, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (3, 4) (3, 11) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 15) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 12) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 13) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 9) (19, 2) (19, 13) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 19) (9, 17) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 14) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 9) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
(10, 0), (10, 1), (10, 14), (17, 6), (17, 0), (17, 9), (17, 11), (2, 18), (2, 19), (2, 11), 
(18, 2), (18, 16), (18, 1), (5, 11), (6, 17), (6, 15), (6, 12), (8, 4), (8, 0), (4, 8), 
(4, 3), (3, 4), (3, 11), (11, 17), (11, 2), (11, 5), (11, 3), (1, 10), (1, 18), (1, 15), 
(15, 6), (15, 1), (15, 12), (7, 16), (7, 14), (7, 9), (7, 13), (16, 18), (16, 7), (16, 13), 
(0, 10), (0, 17), (0, 8), (0, 13), (12, 6), (12, 15), (12, 9), (19, 2), (19, 13), 
(13, 7), (13, 16), (13, 0), (13, 19), (9, 17), (9, 7), (9, 12), (9, 14), (14, 10), (14, 7), (14, 9)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes by degree: 
Node 5 degree: 1
Node 8 degree: 1
Node 3 degree: 2
Node 5 degree: 2
Node 0 degree: 4
Node 1 degree: 4
Node 4 degree: 4
Node 6 degree: 4
Node 12 degree: 4
Node 18 degree: 4
Node 19 degree: 4
Node 7 degree: 5
Node 13 degree: 5
Node 11 degree: 6
Node 14 degree: 3
Node 16 degree: 3
Node 9 degree: 4
Node 15 degree: 3
Node 10 degree: 2
Node 17 degree: 4

Now, we'll count the triangles:
Triangles: [12]

Unique triangles:
<0, 10, 1>
<0, 17, 6>
<0, 17, 9>
<0, 8, 4>
<1, 10, 14>
<2, 11, 5>
<2, 11, 3>
<2, 18, 16>
<9, 17, 6>
<9, 17, 11>
<9, 12, 6>
<13, 7, 14>
