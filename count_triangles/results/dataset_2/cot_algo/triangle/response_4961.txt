Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 27) (1, 3) (1, 23) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 26) (3, 22) (7, 17) (21, 28) (21, 11) (10, 26) (10, 27) (10, 2) (10, 28) (11, 21) (11, 29) (11, 20) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 17) (8, 29) (19, 3) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 15) (26, 3) (26, 10) (26, 19) (26, 29) (28, 21) (28, 10) (28, 4) (28, 14) (5, 18) (5, 29) (13, 16) (13, 20) (25, 27) (25, 14) (25, 24) (25, 2) (27, 9) (27, 10) (27, 25) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 12) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 18) (2, 10) (2, 25) (2, 22) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 24) (22, 17) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 16) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 14) (14, 28) (14, 25) (14, 15) (23, 1) (23, 15) (29, 11) (29, 8) (29, 26) (29, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 24) (24, 25) (24, 22) (24, 12) (24, 20) (17, 7) (17, 4) (17, 0) (17, 22) (20, 11) (20, 13) (20, 24) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, we have the following labeled vertices:
- Node 8 (Degree 1)
- Node 13 (Degree 1)
- Node 1 (Degree 2)
- Node 5 (Degree 2)
- Node 7 (Degree 2)
- Node 18 (Degree 3)
- Node 19 (Degree 3)
- Node 0 (Degree 4)
- Node 2 (Degree 4)
- Node 14 (Degree 4)
- Node 15 (Degree 4)
- Node 21 (Degree 4)
- Node 3 (Degree 5)
- Node 25 (Degree 5)
- Node 29 (Degree 5)
- Node 6 (Degree 6)
- Node 4 (Degree 7)
- Node 10 (Degree 7)
- Node 16 (Degree 7)
- Node 22 (Degree 7)
- Node 9 (Degree 7)
- Node 12 (Degree 7)
- Node 24 (Degree 7)
- Node 26 (Degree 7)
- Node 11 (Degree 8)
- Node 17 (Degree 8)
- Node 20 (Degree 8)
- Node 28 (Degree 8)
- Node 27 (Degree 9)

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles and unique triangles as follows:

- Triangles: [78]
- Unique Triangles: <3, 26, 10>, <3, 26, 19>, <3, 10, 28>, <3, 10, 21>, <3, 10, 27>, <5, 29, 14>, <5, 29, 25>, <5, 29, 11>, <17, 18, 5>, <18, 15, 14>, <18, 16, 13>, <18, 16, 0>, <18, 16, 5>, <18, 13, 20>, <18, 5, 16>, <21, 11, 20>, <21, 28, 14>, <21, 10, 26>, <25, 27, 10>, <25, 27, 2>, <25, 27, 24>, <11, 20, 13>, <11, 20, 29>, <14, 28, 21>, <14, 28, 25>, <15, 14, 25>, <26, 29, 5>, <26, 27, 25>, <26, 27, 10>, <27, 25, 2>, <27, 10, 25>, <27, 10, 2>, <0, 16, 13>, <2, 22, 24>, <2, 22, 17>, <9, 4, 28>, <9, 4, 17>, <9, 28, 21>, <12, 6, 24>, <12, 0, 16>
