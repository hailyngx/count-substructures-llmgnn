Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
Node 0: 9, 7, 3, 8
Node 1: 5, 4, 7
Node 2: 9, 4, 8, 6
Node 3: 9, 7, 0
Node 4: 9, 4, 7, 1, 8, 2
Node 5: 9, 1, 7
Node 6: 8, 2
Node 7: 5, 9, 4, 0, 3, 1
Node 8: 4, 8, 6, 0, 2
Node 9: 5, 9, 4, 2, 3, 7, 0
```

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles are as follows:

Total number of triangles: [18]
Unique triangles: <1, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 2, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 7, 5>
