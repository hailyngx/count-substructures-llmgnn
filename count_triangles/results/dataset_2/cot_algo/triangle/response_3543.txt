Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves relabeling the vertices based on their degree. Here are the vertices sorted by their degree:

Vertex 0: degree 1
Vertex 5: degree 2
Vertex 8: degree 2
Vertex 9: degree 1
Vertex 7: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 5
Vertex 3: degree 5
Vertex 18: degree 2
Vertex 13: degree 5
Vertex 14: degree 4
Vertex 19: degree 4
Vertex 17: degree 5
Vertex 12: degree 5
Vertex 10: degree 4
Vertex 11: degree 6
Vertex 16: degree 3
Vertex 15: degree 2
