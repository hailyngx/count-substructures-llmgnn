Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 24) (11, 27) (11, 12) (16, 20) (0, 27) (0, 3) (0, 23) (27, 11) (27, 0) (27, 7) (27, 19) (7, 27) (7, 28) (21, 26) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 12) (23, 0) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 29) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 17) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 17) (18, 29) (26, 21) (26, 22) (26, 10) (9, 22) (9, 4) (9, 19) (4, 9) (4, 20) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 15) (20, 16) (20, 4) (10, 26) (10, 3) (12, 11) (12, 22) (12, 24) (12, 29) (24, 11) (24, 8) (24, 12) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 19) (29, 23) (29, 18) (29, 12) (1, 2) (1, 25) (1, 13) (14, 19) (14, 25) (14, 5) (15, 23) (15, 17) (15, 5) (15, 28) (25, 1) (25, 14) (25, 5) (25, 28) (6, 2) (6, 13) (5, 14) (5, 15) (5, 25) (28, 7) (28, 15) (28, 25) (19, 27) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 14) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their number of connections in increasing order. Then, relabel the nodes based on this sorted order. 

Here are the nodes sorted by their degree and their corresponding labels:
- Node 5 (Degree: 3)
- Node 6 (Degree: 2)
- Node 1 (Degree: 3)
- Node 2 (Degree: 3)
- Node 4 (Degree: 3)
- Node 8 (Degree: 3)
- Node 10 (Degree: 2)
- Node 13 (Degree: 2)
- Node 14 (Degree: 2)
- Node 15 (Degree: 3)
- Node 17 (Degree: 3)
- Node 18 (Degree: 3)
- Node 25 (Degree: 3)

Let's proceed with counting the triangles:
1. Node 5: No triangles.
2. Node 6: No triangles.
3. Node 1: <1, 13, 3>
4. Node 2: No triangles.
5. Node 4: <4, 20, 16>
6. Node 8: <8, 24, 12>
7. Node 10: No triangles.
8. Node 13: No triangles.
9. Node 14: No triangles.
10. Node 15: No triangles.
11. Node 17: <17, 15, 5>
12. Node 18: No triangles.
13. Node 25: No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <1, 13, 3>, <4, 20, 16>, <8, 24, 12>, <17, 15, 5>
