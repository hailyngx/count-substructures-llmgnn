Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 11) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 6) (14, 3) (14, 6) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: (5, 13), (5, 10), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 7), (9, 12), (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 3), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 12), (7, 0), (7, 10), (7, 1), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 0), (3, 4), (3, 1), (3, 14), (3, 12), (8, 13), (8, 10), (8, 11), (13, 5), (13, 8), (13, 2), (13, 11), (13, 10), (12, 9), (12, 7), (12, 3), (12, 2), (12, 0), (12, 11), (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 14), (6, 2), (11, 8), (11, 13), (11, 12), (11, 0), (0, 7), (0, 1), (0, 12), (0, 11), (10, 5), (10, 7), (10, 8), (10, 13), (2, 9), (2, 13), (2, 12), (2, 6), (14, 3), (14, 6)

Now, we will create a Degree-Based Ordering of the nodes based on their connections:

Nodes with their degrees in parenthesis:
1 (4), 5 (2), 8 (3), 14 (2), 6 (4), 11 (4), 2 (4), 12 (5), 0 (4), 3 (5), 9 (5), 13 (6), 7 (7), 4 (7), 10 (4)

Now, let's count the number of triangles and list them:

Total number of triangles: [7]

Unique triangles:
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 10>
<0, 12, 11>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 6, 4>
<3, 12, 7>
<4, 6, 2>
