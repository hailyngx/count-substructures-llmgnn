Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

0: 3, 8, 6, 4, 9
1: 6, 2, 7, 4
2: 9, 1, 8, 5, 4
3: 0, 9, 5
4: 1, 2, 0, 9
5: 3, 6, 2, 8, 7
6: 0, 1, 5, 8
7: 1, 5
8: 0, 5, 2, 6
9: 3, 2, 0, 4

Based on Degree-Based Ordering, the vertices are now labeled from 0 to 9 as shown above.

Now, we can count the triangles in the graph.
Triangles: [18]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 8, 3>, <0, 8, 5>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 9, 3>
