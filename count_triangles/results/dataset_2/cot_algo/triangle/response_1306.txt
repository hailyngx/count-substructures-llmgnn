Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 11) (2, 5) (8, 5) (8, 7) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 13) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 14) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (1, 3), (1, 14), (1, 4), (1, 12), (3, 1), (3, 11), (3, 7), (3, 13), (10, 11), (10, 6), (10, 9), (10, 14), (11, 3), (11, 10), (11, 9), (11, 12), (11, 2), (0, 14), (0, 5), (0, 13), (0, 6), (14, 1), (14, 10), (14, 0), (14, 6), (14, 7), (14, 13), (2, 11), (2, 5), (8, 5), (8, 7), (7, 3), (7, 14), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 12), (5, 4), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 13), (6, 10), (6, 0), (6, 14), (12, 1), (12, 11), (12, 5), (12, 9), (13, 3), (13, 0), (13, 14), (13, 4), (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 7), (9, 12)

Next, we need to perform Degree-Based Ordering to label the vertices from least connected to most connected:

Vertices by degree: 2, 8, 4, 6, 12, 13, 0, 10, 9, 1, 7, 3, 5, 14, 11

Now, we will count the triangles based on the vertices' labels and shared connections:

Triangles: [<1, 3, 11>, <3, 7, 11>]

Total number of triangles: [2]
