Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 12) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 11) (11, 0) (11, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree. Then, triangles are counted by checking shared connections among the nodes based on the node with the lower degree.

After sorting the nodes by their degree, the labels would be as follows:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 11: degree 3
Node 5: degree 5
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 14: degree 5
Node 1: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 12: degree 3
Node 6: degree 4
Node 13: degree 5
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 6
Node 7: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3

Using the degree-based ordering, we can count the number of triangles using the given edge information:
1. <1, 4, 6>
2. <1, 4, 8>
3. <1, 6, 8>
4. <2, 3, 13>
5. <2, 3, 9>
6. <2, 3, 10>
7. <4, 6, 3>
8. <4, 10, 8>
9. <5, 9, 13>
10. <5, 12, 14>
11. <6, 12, 14>
12. <8, 10, 3>

There are total of [12] triangles in the given graph.
