Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 10) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 15) (14, 1) (14, 19) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 18) (19, 4) (19, 14) (18, 7) (18, 15) (18, 5) (2, 16) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 6) (12, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (10, 16) (10, 5) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 18) (5, 10) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: (13)
- 1: (3, 7, 9, 14, 15) 
- 2: (6, 9, 13, 16)
- 3: (1, 5, 9, 12)
- 4: (7, 8, 17, 19)
- 5: (3, 5, 10, 11, 18)
- 6: (2, 7, 17)
- 7: (1, 4, 6, 18)
- 8: (4)
- 9: (1, 2, 3)
- 10: (5, 16)
- 11: (5, 15, 16, 17)
- 12: (3)
- 13: (0, 2)
- 14: (1, 19)
- 15: (0, 1, 11, 18)
- 16: (2, 10, 11)
- 17: (4, 6, 11)
- 18: (5, 7, 15)
- 19: (4, 14)

Next, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree in increasing order:
Nodes by degree: 0, 8, 12, 13, 14, 10, 4, 6, 18, 16, 2, 12, 3, 9, 1, 5, 7, 17, 11, 15

Using the degree-based ordering, we will now list the triangles:

Triangles: [35]

<0, 1, 15>
<0, 13, 15>
<0, 15, 18>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 3, 15>
<1, 5, 11>
<1, 5, 18>
<1, 9, 15>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 5, 18>
<3, 9, 2>
<4, 6, 17>
<4, 7, 18>
<4, 19, 14>
<5, 7, 18>
<5, 10, 16>
<6, 7, 18>
<6, 13, 2>
<7, 17, 11>
<9, 2, 13>
<11, 15, 18>
<11, 16, 10>
<14, 4, 19>
<15, 0, 13>
<16, 10, 5>
<16, 2, 13>
<17, 11, 5>
<18, 5, 3>
<18, 5, 7>
<18, 7, 1>
<18, 15, 0>
<19, 14, 1>
<1, 7, 18>
<4, 7, 6>
