Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 4) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 15) (1, 11) (1, 12) (15, 11) (15, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 16) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 7) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 7) (18, 14) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 13) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 5) (2, 9) (2, 16) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 4) (13, 15) (13, 12) (13, 18) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in calculating the number of triangles in the given graph efficiently. Let's proceed:

We first need to sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections).

Vertices sorted by degree:
0, 1, 6, 5, 2, 18, 4, 3, 16, 13, 15, 12, 9, 7, 11, 19, 14, 17, 8

Now we will relabel the vertices starting from 0 with the vertex with the lowest degree:
Vertex 0: 0
Vertex 1: 1
Vertex 2: 6
Vertex 3: 5
Vertex 4: 2
Vertex 5: 18
Vertex 6: 4
Vertex 7: 3
Vertex 8: 16
Vertex 9: 13
Vertex 10: 15
Vertex 11: 12
Vertex 12: 9
Vertex 13: 7
Vertex 14: 11
Vertex 15: 19
Vertex 16: 14
Vertex 17: 17
Vertex 18: 8

Now, we will count the triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 4]
<0, 14, 17>
<0, 8, 14>
<0, 3, 8>
<4, 12, 13>
