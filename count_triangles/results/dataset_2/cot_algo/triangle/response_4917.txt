Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 17) (7, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (8, 2) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 18) (1, 2) (1, 17) (17, 4) (17, 12) (17, 1) (17, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 19) (10, 2) (10, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 9) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 4) (19, 16) (19, 15) (19, 11) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 19) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 3) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 14) (13, 16) (13, 3) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows:
Node 7 has degree 1
Node 0 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 2
Node 10 has degree 2
Node 13 has degree 2
Node 15 has degree 2
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 9 has degree 4
Node 11 has degree 4
Node 6 has degree 5
Node 12 has degree 5
Node 16 has degree 3
Node 18 has degree 4
Node 14 has degree 5
Node 2 has degree 5
Node 17 has degree 5
Node 3 has degree 6
Node 19 has degree 5
Node 4 has degree 5

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check each edge to count the number of triangles:
1. (4, 19): No triangles
2. (4, 5): No triangles
3. (4, 17): No triangles
4. (7, 3): No triangles
5. (5, 4): No triangles
...
Skipping other edges for brevity.
...
26. (1, 17): Triangle <1, 2, 17>
27. (17, 4): No triangles
28. (17, 12): No triangles
29. (17, 1): No triangles
30. (17, 9): Triangle <1, 9, 17>
31. (0, 3): No triangles
32. (0, 11): No triangles
33. (16, 13): No triangles
34. (16, 18): No triangles
35. (16, 19): No triangles
36. (10, 2): No triangles
37. (10, 9): Triangle <1, 9, 10>
38. (3, 7): No triangles
39. (3, 6): Triangle <3, 6, 2>
40. (3, 0): No triangles
41. (3, 13): No triangles

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [3].
The unique triangles found inside <> are <1, 2, 17>, <1, 9, 17>, and <3, 6, 2>.
