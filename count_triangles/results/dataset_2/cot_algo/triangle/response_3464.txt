Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 18) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 1) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 2) (16, 15) (16, 9) (17, 4) (17, 13) (17, 5) (19, 10) (19, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (14, 15) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 18) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 16) (10, 19) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 1) (2, 15) (2, 6) (18, 8) (18, 3) (5, 17) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are labelled from 0 to 19. 
The Degree-Based Ordering would be:
Node 15 has degree 5,
Node 10 has degree 4,
Nodes 9, 14, 17, and 1 have degree 3,
Nodes 0, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 19 have degree 3,
Nodes 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 18 have degree 2,
Node 3 has degree 2.

Now let's count the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 11, 14>
<3, 5, 14>
<9, 15, 16>
<10, 12, 19>
<1, 10, 14>
<1, 10, 19>
<1, 12, 19>
<4, 6, 13>
<4, 13, 17>
<5, 11, 14>
<5, 14, 17>
<5, 14, 19>
<5, 3, 18>
<7, 9, 15>
<7, 9, 16>
<8, 18, 3>

Total number of triangles: [16]
