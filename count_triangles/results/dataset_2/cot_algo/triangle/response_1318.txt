Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 10) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are as follows:
1. Node 5 (Degree: 1)
2. Node 12 (Degree: 3)
3. Node 8 (Degree: 3)
4. Node 5 (Degree: 3)
5. Node 9 (Degree: 4)
6. Node 0 (Degree: 4)
7. Node 1 (Degree: 5)
8. Node 13 (Degree: 5)
9. Node 2 (Degree: 5)
10. Node 14 (Degree: 5)
11. Node 11 (Degree: 5)
12. Node 7 (Degree: 5)
13. Node 4 (Degree: 6)
14. Node 6 (Degree: 6)
15. Node 3 (Degree: 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting triangles:

1. For edges (5, 13):
   - Node 5 (Degree: 3) < Node 13 (Degree: 5) 
   - Shared connections: None

2. For edges (9, 11):
   - Node 9 (Degree: 4) < Node 11 (Degree: 5)
   - Shared connections: None

3. For edges (9, 14):
   - Node 9 (Degree: 4) < Node 14 (Degree: 5)
   - Shared connections: None

4. For edges (9, 3):
   - Node 9 (Degree: 4) < Node 3 (Degree: 6)
   - Shared connections: None

5. For edges (6, 14):
   - Node 6 (Degree: 6) < Node 14 (Degree: 5)
   - Shared connections: None

6. For edges (6, 7):
   - Node 6 (Degree: 6) < Node 7 (Degree: 5)
   - Shared connections: None

7. For edges (6, 10):
   - Node 6 (Degree: 6) < Node 10 (Degree: 4)
   - Shared connections: None

8. For edges (6, 3):
   - Node 6 (Degree: 6) < Node 3 (Degree: 6)
   - Shared connections: None

9. For edges (6, 0):
   - Node 6 (Degree: 6) < Node 0 (Degree: 4)
   - Shared connections: None

10. For edges (4, 7):
    - Node 4 (Degree: 6) < Node 7 (Degree: 5)
    - Shared connections: None
