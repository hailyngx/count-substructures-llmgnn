Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 16) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 12) (17, 8) (17, 1) (15, 19) (15, 2) (15, 16) (3, 6) (3, 18) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 16) (2, 14) (2, 15) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 1) (18, 3) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 19) 

Response:
The vertices with their corresponding connections are as follows:
- Vertices with 0 connections: 18, 9
- Vertices with 1 connection: 3, 2, 18, 10, 17
- Vertices with 2 connections: 7, 13
- Vertices with 3 connections: 15, 4
- Vertices with 4 connections: 12, 8
- Vertices with 5 connections: 5, 13, 7, 19
- Vertices with 6 connections: 6, 1
- Vertices with 7 connections: 0, 11
- Vertices with 8 connections: 14

Next, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

Total number of triangles: [34]
Unique triangles found: <6, 4, 1>, <11, 6, 1>, <14, 2, 16>, <11, 8, 12>, <13, 1, 4>, <15, 16, 19>, <1, 17, 8>, <0, 10, 11>, <6, 3, 14>, <16, 15, 19>, <14, 0, 19>, <0, 5, 9>, <16, 14, 2>, <6, 11, 4>, <17, 8, 1>, <14, 6, 3>, <6, 5, 4>, <1, 13, 7>, <4, 6, 5>, <4, 1, 9>, <6, 4, 11>, <4, 1, 13>, <4, 9, 5>, <4, 11, 6>, <8, 11, 12>, <19, 0, 14>, <17, 1, 13>, <2, 14, 16>, <11, 1, 13>, <19, 16, 15>, <7, 13, 1>, <15, 19, 16>, <12, 8, 11>, <19, 16, 14>
