Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering will be as follows:
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections

Now, we will count the triangles:
1. For edge (6, 9), as 6 has fewer connections than 9, we proceed with vertex 6. Checking for shared connections, we find a triangle with nodes (6, 9, 8).
2. For edge (6, 2), as 6 has fewer connections, we proceed with vertex 6. No shared connections with vertex 2.
3. For edge (6, 4), as 6 has fewer connections, we proceed with vertex 6. No shared connections with vertex 4.
4. For edge (9, 6), as 9 has more connections than 6, we do not proceed.
5. For edge (9, 8), as 9 has fewer connections, we proceed with vertex 9. Checking for shared connections, we find a triangle with nodes (9, 6, 4).
6. Continuing this process for all edges, the total number of triangles is 2.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2]. 
The unique triangles found are <6, 9, 8> and <9, 6, 4>.
