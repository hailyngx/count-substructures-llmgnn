Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 14) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 11) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 7) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 10) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 1) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows these steps to count triangles in the graph:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:
   - Node 6: degree 2
   - Node 8: degree 3
   - Node 10: degree 3
   - Node 11: degree 3
   - Node 1: degree 4
   - Node 7: degree 4
   - Node 0: degree 5
   - Node 14: degree 5
   - Node 2: degree 5
   - Node 12: degree 6
   - Node 4: degree 7
   - Node 5: degree 7
   - Node 13: degree 7
   - Node 3: degree 8
   - Node 9: degree 8

2. Relabel the vertices according to their degree in ascending order:
   - Node 6: A
   - Node 8: B
   - Node 10: C
   - Node 11: D
   - Node 1: E
   - Node 7: F
   - Node 0: G
   - Node 14: H
   - Node 2: I
   - Node 12: J
   - Node 4: K
   - Node 5: L
   - Node 13: M
   - Node 3: N
   - Node 9: O

3. Count the triangles by considering only edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. 
   Check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to find triangles.

After following the above steps, the total number of triangles in the graph is [67].
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 14>
<0, 11, 12>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 12>
<1, 10, 12>
<2, 4, 12>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 9, 12>
<3, 7, 12>
<3, 7, 13>
<3, 9, 13>
<4, 5, 12>
<4, 5, 13>
<4, 5, 3>
<4, 0, 14>
<5, 12, 13>
<7, 9, 13>
<11, 12, 0>
