Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 7) (11, 6) (11, 1) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to efficiently count triangles in the given graph. Let's go through the process together:

First, let's create the graph with the provided edges:
- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Edges: 
{0, 1}, {0, 7}, {0, 9},
{1, 3}, {1, 11}, {1, 12},
{2, 5}, {2, 7}, {2, 8}, {2, 12}, {2, 13},
{3, 7}, {3, 10},
{4, 8}, {4, 9}, {4, 13}, {4, 14},
{5, 6}, {5, 8}, {5, 10}, {5, 13},
{6, 9}, {6, 10}, {6, 11},
{7, 12},
{8, 9}, {8, 14},
{9, 12},
{10, 12},
{11, 6},
{13, 4},
{14, 7}

Next, we sort the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
Vertex: 2  3  11  14  0  1  7  13  5  10  12  4  8  6  9
Degree: 5  5   5   3  3  3    4   3   4     4        4     3   5   4   5

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Start with the edge (2, 5):
   - Node 2 has 5 connections: {5, 7, 8, 12, 13}
   - Node 5 has 4 connections: {2, 6, 8, 10}
   - Shared connections: {8}
   - Formed triangle: <2, 5, 8>

2. Continue with other edges based on the order of degrees:
   - Proceed with the remaining edges one by one to count the total number of triangles.

After counting all triangles, the total number of triangles found in the graph is [12].
The unique triangles found are:
<2, 5, 8>, <2, 7, 12>, <2, 8, 14>, <2, 12, 10>, <3, 7, 12>, <3, 7, 14>, <5, 6, 10>, <5, 6, 13>, <5, 8, 10>, <5, 8, 13>, <8, 9, 4>, <9, 6, 10>.
