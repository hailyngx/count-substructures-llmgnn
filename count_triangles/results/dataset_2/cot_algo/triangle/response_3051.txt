Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 3) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 12) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) 
(4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) 
(10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) 
(0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 8) 
(2, 1) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 3) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 8) 
(3, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) 
(1, 12) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and relabel them accordingly:

New vertex labels:  
0: 2 connections  
1: 3 connections  
2: 6 connections  
3: 4 connections  
4: 3 connections  
5: 2 connections  
6: 4 connections  
7: 5 connections  
8: 4 connections  
9: 4 connections  
10: 3 connections  
11: 5 connections  
12: 3 connections  
13: 6 connections  
14: 4 connections  

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 21]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 12, 1>
<0, 12, 2>
<1, 2, 13>
<2, 6, 12>
<2, 7, 13>
<2, 8, 3>
<3, 7, 11>
<4, 6, 2>
<6, 4, 7>
<7, 11, 10>
<7, 11, 3>
<8, 2, 13>
<8, 10, 11>
<8, 10, 3>
<9, 10, 11>
<9, 10, 8>
<9, 14, 2>
<10, 8, 3>
<13, 2, 7>
