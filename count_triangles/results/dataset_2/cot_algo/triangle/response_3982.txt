Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 17) (9, 2) (9, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 14) (15, 16) (10, 17) (10, 6) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 18) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 13) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 16) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 15) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (18, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 19) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 6) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 2) (16, 15) (16, 12) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 13) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: (5, 12), (5, 17), (9, 2), (9, 1), (3, 6), (3, 13), (3, 2), (15, 14), (15, 16), (10, 17), (10, 6), (17, 5), (17, 10), (17, 11), (17, 4), (4, 17), (4, 8), (4, 0), (8, 4), (8, 14), (8, 18), (7, 12), (7, 19), (7, 13), (12, 5), (12, 7), (12, 16), (0, 4), (0, 14), (0, 1), (0, 13), (0, 6), (14, 15), (14, 8), (14, 0), (14, 11), (18, 8), (2, 9), (2, 3), (2, 11), (1, 9), (1, 0), (1, 19), (19, 7), (19, 1), (19, 6), (11, 17), (11, 14), (11, 2), (16, 15), (16, 12), (6, 3), (6, 10), (6, 0), (6, 19), (6, 13), (13, 3), (13, 7), (13, 0), (13, 6)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree from least to most and relabel them accordingly:

New ordering: 16, 18, 9, 1, 5, 2, 10, 14, 3, 4, 6, 7, 0, 11, 17, 8, 12, 13, 15, 19

Now, for each edge, we will count the triangles:

Triangles: <0, 4, 17>, <0, 6, 13>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 14, 8>, <3, 2, 9>, <3, 6, 13>, <8, 14, 15>, <8, 14, 11>, <11, 2, 9>, <13, 6, 7>, <13, 6, 0>, <13, 3, 7>, <16, 12, 5>, <17, 5, 12>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [14]
