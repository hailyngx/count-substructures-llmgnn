Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 12) (16, 10) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 18) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 19) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 15) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 15) (2, 8) (2, 19) (0, 4) (0, 15) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 18) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 13) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 1) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 2) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 0) (18, 17) (18, 10) (18, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their degree (number of connections to other vertices).

Here are the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 6
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 5
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 3

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we relabel the nodes from least to most connected:
- Node 1 and Node 16 (degree 2)
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, Node 7, Node 8, Node 10, Node 11, Node 14, Node 15, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19 (degree 3)
- Node 3, Node 4, Node 12 (degree 4)
- Node 6, Node 13, Node 9 (degree 5)

Now, we can analyze the edges only where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Triangle <3, 9, 13>
- Triangle <6, 14, 17>
- Triangle <6, 11, 14>
- Triangle <6, 1, 14>
- Triangle <9, 7, 8>
- Triangle <9, 3, 5>
- Triangle <9, 3, 13>
- Triangle <9, 13, 12>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
