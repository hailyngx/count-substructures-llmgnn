Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 27) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 5) (2, 16) (2, 29) (2, 9) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 15) (29, 4) (7, 29) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 22) (21, 28) (21, 4) (21, 22) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 27) (13, 18) (0, 27) (27, 11) (27, 13) (27, 0) (27, 14) (27, 20) (28, 21) (28, 19) (28, 10) (28, 20) (22, 7) (22, 21) (22, 26) (22, 3) (26, 22) (26, 24) (24, 26) (24, 1) (24, 25) (1, 24) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 23) (1, 18) (15, 29) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 18) (25, 7) (25, 24) (25, 6) (10, 8) (10, 28) (10, 15) (19, 8) (19, 28) (19, 23) (14, 27) (14, 1) (14, 12) (5, 16) (5, 18) (17, 18) (12, 14) (20, 7) (20, 27) (20, 28) (20, 3) (20, 9) (9, 2) (9, 20) (3, 22) (3, 20) (3, 6) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 17) (4, 29) (4, 21) (6, 25) (6, 3) (23, 1) (23, 19) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 0: degree 1
Node 5: degree 1
Node 17: degree 1
Node 9: degree 2
Node 12: degree 1
Node 16: degree 2
Node 11: degree 2
Node 17: degree 1
Node 3: degree 3
Node 26: degree 2
Node 13: degree 2
Node 19: degree 3
Node 18: degree 4
Node 10: degree 3
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 4
Node 4: degree 2
Node 23: degree 2
Node 24: degree 3
Node 20: degree 4
Node 21: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 28: degree 4
Node 22: degree 4
Node 14: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 29: degree 4
Node 25: degree 3
Node 27: degree 6
Node 2: degree 4

Now, counting the triangles:
