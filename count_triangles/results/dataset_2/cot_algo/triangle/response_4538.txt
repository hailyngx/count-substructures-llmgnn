Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3), (9, 2), (9, 3), (4, 7), (4, 1), (4, 6), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 8), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 1), (2, 6), (8, 7), (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 6), (8, 3), (8, 1), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 2), (1, 8), (6, 4), (6, 2), (6, 8), (6, 3), (6, 0), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 6), (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 6)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections: 

Nodes sorted by degree: 0, 9, 7, 4, 5, 6, 1, 3, 8, 2

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we'll check each edge to count the triangles:

Triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 6, 8>
