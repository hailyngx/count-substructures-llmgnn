Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 0), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 0), (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (7, 6), (7, 2), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 0), (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 2), (3, 8), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 7), (2, 1), (2, 3), (8, 9), (8, 3), (8, 6), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 8), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 1)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes by degree: 7 (1), 5 (1), 8 (2), 1 (3), 7 (3), 0 (4), 6 (4), 3 (5), 2 (6), 9 (6)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:

Triangles: [17]

<5, 2, 4>, <5, 2, 9>, <2, 5, 4>, <4, 9, 2>, <9, 5, 4>, <2, 5, 9>, <9, 4, 0>, <9, 4, 1>, <9, 6, 4>, <4, 1, 0>, <4, 3, 1>, <4, 3, 2>, <4, 6, 7>, <3, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <0, 1, 4>
