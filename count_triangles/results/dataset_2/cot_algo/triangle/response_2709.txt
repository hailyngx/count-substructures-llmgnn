Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
The graph constructed based on the given edges is as follows:  

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 3), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 0), (6, 8), (4, 3), (7, 2), (8, 3), (2, 7), (1, 7), (3, 8), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 8)
```

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

1. Sort the nodes by their degree in ascending order:  
Node 1: degree 1  
Node 7: degree 1  
Node 4: degree 2  
Node 9: degree 2  
Node 8: degree 2  
Node 0: degree 3  
Node 6: degree 3  
Node 3: degree 3  
Node 2: degree 4  
Node 5: degree 6  

2. Relabel the nodes accordingly:  
Nodes: 1, 7, 4, 9, 8, 0, 6, 3, 2, 5

3. Check the edges with the lowest labeled node having fewer connections:  
Triangles found:  
- <0, 4, 8>    

4. Output the total number of triangles:
