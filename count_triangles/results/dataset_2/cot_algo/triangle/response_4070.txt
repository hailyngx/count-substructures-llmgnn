Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 14) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 6) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) 

Response:
The graph with nodes and edges can be constructed as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 10), (9, 4), (9, 14), (9, 10), (9, 13), (1, 3), (1, 11), (1, 14), (1, 0), (1, 8), (3, 6), (3, 2), (3, 12), (7, 11), (7, 10), (7, 8), (12, 13), (2, 11), (8, 7), (13, 14), (0, 6).

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes: {6, 2, 0, 7, 4, 5, 1, 3, 10, 14, 8, 11, 12, 13, 9}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 10), (9, 4), (9, 14), (9, 10), (9, 13), (1, 3), (1, 11), (1, 14), (1, 0), (1, 8), (3, 6), (3, 2), (3, 12), (7, 11), (7, 10), (7, 8), (12, 13), (2, 11), (8, 7), (13, 14), (0, 6).

Now, we will proceed using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 14>, <0, 6, 3>, <1, 3, 11>, <3, 6, 12>.
