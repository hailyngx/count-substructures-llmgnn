Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 10) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently in a graph. 
Let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

Nodes in decreasing order of degree: 
Node 6 (degree 5) 
Node 13 (degree 5) 
Node 4 (degree 5) 
Node 14 (degree 5) 
Node 0 (degree 5) 
Node 11 (degree 4) 
Node 2 (degree 4) 
Node 1 (degree 4) 
Node 3 (degree 4) 
Node 8 (degree 3) 
Node 12 (degree 3) 
Node 7 (degree 2) 
Node 9 (degree 4) 
Node 5 (degree 3) 
Node 10 (degree 3) 

Now, we will count the number of triangles:

Triangles []: 26
Unique triangles <>: <6, 0, 3>, <6, 0, 12>, <6, 0, 13>, <6, 0, 14>, <6, 2, 3>, <6, 2, 9>, <6, 2, 1>, <6, 13, 0>, <6, 13, 12>, <6, 13, 1>, <6, 13, 4>, <6, 4, 13>, <6, 4, 14>, <6, 14, 0>, <6, 14, 4>, <13, 0, 1>, <13, 0, 12>, <13, 0, 4>, <13, 12, 10>, <4, 14, 0>, <4, 14, 6>, <14, 0, 3>, <14, 0, 6>, <14, 6, 7>, <14, 6, 5>, <0, 3, 2>
