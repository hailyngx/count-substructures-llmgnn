Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (14, 18) (14, 4) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 15) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 19) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 19) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 3) (19, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 12) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 3) (16, 10) (16, 13) (16, 7) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 3) (3, 19) (3, 7) (3, 18) (3, 4) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (12, 19) (12, 15) (12, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Node 17: Degree 0
Nodes 5, 9, 10, 14, 7: Degree 1
Nodes 8, 13, 1, 0, 4, 12: Degree 2
Nodes 2, 6, 16: Degree 3
Nodes 15, 3, 19: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 5
Node 18: Degree 5

2. Proceed with edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Check (5, 9): No triangles.
- Check (5, 6): No triangles.
- Check (5, 1): No triangles.
- Check (5, 11): Triangle found: <1, 5, 11>.
- Check (9, 18): No triangles.
- Check (9, 2): No triangles.
- Check (14, 18): No triangles.
- Check (14, 4): No triangles.
- Check (10, 11): Triangle found: <10, 11, 15>.
- Check (10, 16): No triangles.
- Check (11, 15): No triangles.
- Check (11, 8): No triangles.
- Check (8, 13): No triangles.
- Check (8, 19): No triangles.
- Check (13, 16): No triangles.
- Check (6, 7): No triangles.
- Check (6, 0): No triangles.
- Check (2, 4): No triangles.
- Check (2, 0): No triangles.
- Check (19, 3): No triangles.
- Check (15, 12): No triangles.
- Check (7, 16): No triangles.
- Check (7, 3): No triangles.
- Check (16, 7): No triangles.
- Check (18, 14): No triangles.
- Check (18, 15): Triangle found: <11, 15, 18>.
- Check (18, 3): No triangles.
- Check (3, 4): No triangles.
- Check (4, 1): No triangles.
- Check (0, 2): No triangles.
- Check (12, 15): No triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <1, 5, 11>, <10, 11, 15>, and <11, 15, 18>.
