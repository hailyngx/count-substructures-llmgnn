Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new order is:  
Node 4 (degree 2)  
Node 8 (degree 3)  
Node 5 (degree 4)  
Node 0 (degree 4)  
Node 3 (degree 4)  
Node 7 (degree 4)  
Node 9 (degree 4)  
Node 2 (degree 5)  
Node 6 (degree 5)  
Node 1 (degree 5)   

Counting triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:  
- For the edge between 5 and 9:  
Node 5 < 4 connections, Node 9 < 4 connections  
Shared connections: 1, 3, 7  
Triangle: <5, 9, 1>  

- For the edge between 5 and 6:  
Node 5 < 4 connections, Node 6 < 5 connections  
Shared connections: None  

- For the edge between 5 and 1:  
Node 5 < 4 connections, Node 1 < 5 connections  
Shared connections: 0, 3, 7  
Triangle: <5, 1, 0>  

- For the edge between 5 and 7:  
Node 5 < 4 connections, Node 7 < 4 connections  
Shared connections: 0, 2, 3  
Triangle: <5, 7, 0>  

- For the edge between 9 and 4:  
Node 9 < 4 connections, Node 4 < 2 connections  
Shared connections: None  

- For the remaining edges, no additional triangles are found.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].  
The unique triangles found are: <5, 9, 1>, <5, 1, 0>, <5, 7, 0>.
