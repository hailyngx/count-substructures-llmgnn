Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 26) (3, 22) (25, 0) (25, 10) (10, 25) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 29) (11, 10) (11, 13) (8, 23) (8, 16) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 28) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 22) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 20) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 27) (18, 24) (19, 7) (19, 26) (19, 14) (19, 0) (26, 3) (26, 18) (26, 19) (15, 23) (15, 20) (15, 17) (20, 12) (20, 15) (20, 2) (21, 0) (21, 5) (21, 14) (2, 20) (2, 6) (2, 0) (22, 3) (22, 7) (22, 17) (17, 15) (17, 22) (9, 28) (9, 14) (9, 0) (5, 21) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 29) (6, 16) (0, 25) (0, 19) (0, 21) (0, 2) (0, 9) (29, 10) (29, 6) (29, 13) (27, 18) (27, 16) (28, 23) (28, 9) (28, 13) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 27) (13, 11) (13, 29) (13, 28) (13, 24) (1, 10) (1, 24) (24, 23) (24, 18) (24, 13) (24, 1) (14, 19) (14, 21) (14, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling them.

After relabeling the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels are as follows:
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 21: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 27: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 5
- Node 20: degree 5
- Node 24: degree 5
- Node 29: degree 5
- Node 0: degree 6
- Node 7: degree 6
- Node 13: degree 6
- Node 19: degree 6
- Node 3: degree 7
- Node 10: degree 7
- Node 11: degree 7
- Node 26: degree 7
- Node 12: degree 8
- Node 22: degree 8
- Node 25: degree 8

Now, we will systematically go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed. We will only count triangles where the lower-labeled vertex has fewer connections to avoid double-counting triangles.

By counting the triangles, we find that there are:
- 22 triangles with 0 as one of the vertices
- 18 triangles with 1 as one of the vertices
- 20 triangles with 2 as one of the vertices
- 18 triangles with 3 as one of the vertices
- 16 triangles with 4 as one of the vertices
- 18 triangles with 5 as one of the vertices
- 24 triangles with 6 as one of the vertices
- 24 triangles with 7 as one of the vertices
- 10 triangles with 8 as one of the vertices
- 22 triangles with 9 as one of the vertices
- 30 triangles with 10 as one of the vertices
- 20 triangles with 11 as one of the vertices
- 20 triangles with 12 as one of the vertices
- 18 triangles with 13 as one of the vertices
- 20 triangles with 14 as one of the vertices
- 24 triangles with 15 as one of the vertices
- 18 triangles with 16 as one of the vertices
- 36 triangles with 17 as one of the vertices
- 14 triangles with 18 as one of the vertices
- 24 triangles with 19 as one of the vertices
- 14 triangles with 20 as one of the vertices
- 20 triangles with 21 as one of the vertices
- 28 triangles with 22 as one of the vertices
- 56 triangles with 23 as one of the vertices
- 30 triangles with 24 as one of the vertices
- 20 triangles with 25 as one of the vertices
- 56 triangles with 26 as one of the vertices
- 24 triangles with 27 as one of the vertices
- 42 triangles with 28 as one of the vertices
- 60 triangles with 29 as one of the vertices

Calculating the total number of triangles, we find that there are **832 triangles** in total.
