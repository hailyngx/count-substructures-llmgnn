Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree of connections. Since there are 10 nodes, the degrees of each node based on the given edges are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5

Now, relabel the vertices in ascending order based on their degrees:
- Node 2: label 0
- Node 6: label 1
- Node 3: label 2
- Node 1: label 3
- Node 7: label 4
- Node 4: label 5
- Node 8: label 6
- Node 0: label 7
- Node 9: label 8
- Node 5: label 9

Next, consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 2): forms a triangle with shared connection 5
- Edge (0, 6): forms a triangle with shared connection 7
- Edge (0, 3): forms a triangle with shared connection 4
- Edge (1, 2): forms a triangle with shared connection 4
- Edge (1, 6): no action taken as both nodes have the same degree
- Edge (1, 3): forms a triangle with shared connection 4
- Edge (3, 2): forms a triangle with shared connection 4
