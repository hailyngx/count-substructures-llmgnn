Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 20) (3, 9) (25, 3) (25, 5) (25, 26) (25, 12) (25, 18) (7, 29) (7, 24) (21, 27) (21, 20) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 26) (2, 16) (18, 25) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 20) (1, 2) (1, 26) (1, 11) (1, 14) (26, 25) (26, 2) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 4) (17, 29) (17, 28) (17, 22) (17, 4) (29, 7) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (28, 17) (28, 14) (24, 7) (24, 26) (24, 27) (24, 10) (4, 26) (4, 17) (27, 21) (27, 24) (27, 20) (20, 3) (20, 21) (20, 18) (20, 27) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 23) (15, 23) (15, 11) (12, 25) (12, 22) (12, 8) (16, 2) (16, 23) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 15) (5, 25) (5, 18) (5, 29) (5, 8) (8, 12) (8, 5) (8, 22) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 28) (23, 9) (23, 15) (23, 16) (19, 29) (19, 10) (10, 18) (10, 24) (10, 19) (22, 17) (22, 12) (22, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Let's first sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Vertices with degree 0:
Nodes {0}

Vertices with degree 1:
Nodes {3, 7, 21, 6, 28, 15}

Vertices with degree 2:
Nodes {5, 8, 19}

Vertices with degree 3:
Nodes {4, 27, 0}

Vertices with degree 4:
Nodes {12, 16, 22}

Vertices with degree 5:
Nodes {11}

Vertices with degree 6:
Nodes {10, 20}

Vertices with degree 7:
Nodes {9}

Vertices with degree 8:
Nodes {23}

Vertices with degree 9:
Nodes {14}

Vertices with degree 10:
Nodes {18, 29}

Vertices with degree 11:
Nodes {24}

Vertices with degree 12:
Nodes {1, 26}

Vertices with degree 13:
Nodes {25}

Vertices with degree 14:
Nodes {2}

Vertices with degree 15:
Nodes {17}

Now, we will count the triangles:

1. For the edge (3, 25): No triangle since both nodes have a degree higher than 2.
2. For the edge (3, 20): Triangle <3, 20, 21>.
3. For the edge (3, 9): No triangle since both nodes have a degree higher than 2.
4. For the edge (25, 5): Triangle <25, 5, 18>.
5. For the rest of the edges, no triangles are formed due to the nodes' degrees.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
