Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 9)
(5, 4)
(5, 0)
(5, 3)
(9, 6)
(9, 2)
(9, 1)
(6, 7)
(6, 8)
(6, 0)
(6, 4)
(4, 8)
(4, 3)
(4, 1)
(4, 2)
(8, 0)
(0, 2)
(0, 7)
(2, 1)
(2, 3)
(7, 1)

Next, we will label the vertices based on their degree from least to most connected:

Node 5 (Degree 4)
Node 3 (Degree 4)
Node 7 (Degree 2)
Node 8 (Degree 2)
Node 9 (Degree 4)
Node 1 (Degree 3)
Node 6 (Degree 5)
Node 0 (Degree 5)
Node 4 (Degree 6)
Node 2 (Degree 5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we can identify the triangles as follows:
[Total number of triangles: 6]
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 7>
