Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) (18, 19) (18, 7) (5, 17) (5, 15) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 12) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 18) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 14) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 14) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 10) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 17) (3, 4) (3, 14) (17, 8) (17, 5) (17, 19) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 3) (14, 10) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 15) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree:
   - Node 1: 2 connections
   - Node 3: 2 connections
   - Node 18: 2 connections
   - Node 19: 3 connections
   - Node 8: 3 connections
   - Node 6: 3 connections
   - Node 5: 3 connections
   - Node 9: 3 connections
   - Node 0: 3 connections
   - Node 16: 3 connections
   - Node 10: 3 connections
   - Node 7: 4 connections
   - Node 12: 4 connections
   - Node 11: 4 connections
   - Node 2: 4 connections
   - Node 4: 5 connections
   - Node 14: 5 connections
   - Node 17: 5 connections
   - Node 15: 3 connections
   - Node 13: 4 connections

2. Relabel the nodes based on their degree:
   - Node 1: 1
   - Node 3: 2
   - Node 18: 3
   - Node 19: 4
   - Node 8: 5
   - Node 6: 6
   - Node 5: 7
   - Node 9: 8
   - Node 0: 9
   - Node 16: 10
   - Node 10: 11
   - Node 7: 12
   - Node 12: 13
   - Node 11: 14
   - Node 2: 15
   - Node 4: 16
   - Node 14: 17
   - Node 17: 18
   - Node 15: 19
   - Node 13: 20

3. Count the number of triangles:
   - Total number of triangles: [34]

Unique triangles found in the graph:
   - <1, 13, 12>
   - <1, 15, 17>
   - <1, 15, 9>
   - <2, 4, 14>
   - <3, 14, 10>
   - <7, 12, 9>
   - <8, 1, 9>
   - <8, 4, 2>
   - <8, 4, 3>
   - <8, 7, 12>
   - <8, 7, 16>
   - <8, 17, 5>
   - <11, 13, 19>
   - <11, 2, 14>
   - <12, 7, 14>
   - <12, 9, 15>
   - <13, 0, 11>
   - <16, 7, 14>
   - <19, 18, 7>
