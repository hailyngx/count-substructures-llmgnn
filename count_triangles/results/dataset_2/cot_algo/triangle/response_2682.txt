Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) is: <9, 8, 2, 1, 6, 7, 0, 5, 3, 4>.

Analyzing the edges based on the sorted order, we find the following triangles:
- Triangle <2, 6, 8>
- Triangle <0, 1, 6>
- Triangle <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle <0, 3, 4>
- Triangle <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle <0, 5, 7>
- Triangle <2, 7, 8>
- Triangle <3, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
