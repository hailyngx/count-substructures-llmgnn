Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (3, 10) (3, 19) (2, 28) (2, 11) (18, 4) (18, 16) (15, 20) (15, 17) (20, 15) (20, 29) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 24) (0, 23) (0, 6) (14, 23) (14, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 6) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 10) (9, 7) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 21) (16, 18) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 10) (21, 29) (21, 12) (21, 26) (21, 11) (17, 15) (17, 25) (17, 6) (25, 17) (25, 23) (25, 28) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 16) (10, 26) (26, 21) (26, 10) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 27) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 21) (11, 22) (12, 21) (12, 5) (12, 28) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 22) (22, 11) (22, 5) (22, 24) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 27) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 13) (24, 4) (24, 22) (28, 2) (28, 25) (28, 12) (23, 0) (23, 14) (23, 16) (23, 25) (27, 6) (27, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be used to count the triangles in the given graph.

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the labels are as follows:
0 -> 2 connections, 1 -> 1 connection, 2 -> 2 connections, 3 -> 2 connections, 4 -> 4 connections, 5 -> 3 connections, 6 -> 5 connections, 7 -> 4 connections, 8 -> 5 connections, 9 -> 5 connections, 10 -> 6 connections, 11 -> 4 connections, 12 -> 3 connections, 13 -> 4 connections, 14 -> 2 connections, 15 -> 2 connections, 16 -> 5 connections, 17 -> 4 connections, 18 -> 2 connections, 19 -> 3 connections, 20 -> 3 connections, 21 -> 4 connections, 22 -> 3 connections, 23 -> 4 connections, 24 -> 2 connections, 25 -> 3 connections, 26 -> 2 connections, 27 -> 2 connections, 28 -> 3 connections, 29 -> 4 connections

Starting with the edges between vertices where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- Triangle <0, 23, 25> found.
- Triangle <0, 6, 7> found.

Total number of triangles: [2]
