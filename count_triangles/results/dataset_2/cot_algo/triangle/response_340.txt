Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 9) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 8) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (0, 9) (4, 9) (4, 13) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 13) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 4) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 14) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method will help us count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Here is the sorted list of vertices based on the number of connections:
0: 1 connection
4: 1 connection
5: 3 connections
13: 3 connections
6: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
7: 4 connections
12: 4 connections
2: 5 connections
14: 5 connections
10: 5 connections
9: 5 connections
11: 5 connections
3: 6 connections
1: 6 connections

Now, let's count the triangles.

[Total number of triangles: 11]
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 12>
<1, 5, 11>
<1, 5, 12>
<2, 8, 10>
<2, 8, 14>
<2, 10, 14>
<3, 7, 12>
<3, 9, 7>
<10, 6, 14>
