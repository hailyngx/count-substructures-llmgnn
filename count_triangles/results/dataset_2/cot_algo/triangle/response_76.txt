Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 1) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 12) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 1) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degrees:
   - Vertex 4: degree 4
   - Vertex 7: degree 4
   - Vertex 6: degree 5
   - Vertex 9: degree 5
   - Vertex 8: degree 5
   - Vertex 13: degree 5
   - Vertex 0: degree 3
   - Vertex 14: degree 3
   - Vertex 2: degree 3
   - Vertex 11: degree 4
   - Vertex 3: degree 5
   - Vertex 1: degree 4
   - Vertex 5: degree 5
   - Vertex 12: degree 3
   - Vertex 10: degree 3

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
   - Vertex 0: degree 3
   - Vertex 10: degree 3
   - Vertex 12: degree 3
   - Vertex 14: degree 3
   - Vertex 2: degree 3
   - Vertex 4: degree 4
   - Vertex 11: degree 4
   - Vertex 1: degree 4
   - Vertex 7: degree 4
   - Vertex 6: degree 5
   - Vertex 9: degree 5
   - Vertex 8: degree 5
   - Vertex 13: degree 5
   - Vertex 3: degree 5
   - Vertex 5: degree 5

3. Count the triangles for each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
   - Triangles: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 10>, <0, 5, 12>, <0, 6, 13>, <2, 5, 1>, <3, 4, 13>, <3, 6, 13>, <3, 10, 5>, <4, 7, 13>, <6, 9, 13>

4. Output the total number of triangles: [10]
