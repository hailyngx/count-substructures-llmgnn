Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 3) (4, 12) (4, 19) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 12) (17, 13) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 19) (3, 13) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 15) (15, 9) (15, 1) (15, 11) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 1) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 16) (7, 9) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 10) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 16) 

Response:
Let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices in ascending order of connections:
0: 3 connections
1: 4 connections
3: 1 connection
4: 2 connections
7: 1 connection
5: 2 connections
6: 0 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 6 connections
10: 5 connections
11: 5 connections
12: 4 connections
13: 4 connections
14: 4 connections
15: 3 connections
16: 4 connections
17: 4 connections
19: 3 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- For each edge, we only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles: [<0, 10, 14>, <0, 12, 1>, <0, 14, 11>, <1, 10, 14>, <2, 8, 13>, <2, 11, 14>, <9, 11, 14>, <9, 11, 15>, <9, 11, 2>, <9, 11, 14>]

Total number of triangles: [10]
