Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 18) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 3) (18, 16) (18, 5) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (17, 11) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 14) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 19) (9, 12) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 19) (12, 4) (12, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 0) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (14, 1) (14, 10) (2, 19) (2, 3) (0, 15) (0, 6) (0, 19) (0, 5) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 3) (5, 0) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 16 has degree 3.
Node 4 has degree 3.
Node 7 has degree 2.
Node 8 has degree 4.
Node 18 has degree 3.
Node 1 has degree 3.
Node 17 has degree 1.
Node 10 has degree 4.
Node 15 has degree 3.
Node 9 has degree 4.
Node 13 has degree 3.
Node 12 has degree 2.
Node 6 has degree 2.
Node 19 has degree 5.
Node 3 has degree 4.
Node 14 has degree 2.
Node 2 has degree 2.
Node 0 has degree 4.
Node 5 has degree 4.
Node 11 has degree 4.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we count the number of triangles. 

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
The unique triangles found are <1, 11, 17>, <1, 11, 19>, <1, 14, 10>, <3, 5, 0>, <3, 8, 10>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 12, 9>, <5, 15, 0>, <5, 18, 16>, <6, 1, 11>, <9, 12, 4>, <9, 13, 19>, <9, 19, 11>, <10, 15, 0>.
