Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 2) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
- Edges: (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 10), (9, 6), (9, 11), (9, 14), (9, 12), (6, 7), (6, 14), (6, 11), (6, 12), (1, 3), (1, 11), (1, 13), (3, 10), (3, 12), (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 10), (7, 10), (2, 13), (2, 14), (8, 0), (8, 11), (8, 14), (12, 3), (12, 2), (13, 0)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their connections in ascending order:
- 0: 1 connection
- 4: 2 connections
- 10: 2 connections
- 13: 2 connections
- 2: 3 connections
- 3: 3 connections
- 7: 3 connections
- 8: 3 connections
- 11: 3 connections
- 12: 3 connections
- 1: 4 connections
- 9: 4 connections
- 14: 4 connections
- 6: 6 connections
- 5: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:

1. (5, 6): Shared connections: 14
2. (5, 2): Shared connections: None
3. (5, 1): Shared connections: 10
4. (5, 10): Shared connections: None
5. (9, 6): Shared connections: 11
6. (9, 11): Shared connections: 6
7. (9, 14): Shared connections: 12
8. (9, 12): Shared connections: 3
9. (6, 7): Shared connections: 10
10. (6, 14): Shared connections: None
11. (6, 11): Shared connections: 9
12. (6, 12): Shared connections: 3
13. (1, 3): Shared connections: 12
14. (1, 11): Shared connections: 6
15. (3, 10): Shared connections: 7

The triangles found are as follows:
- <5, 6, 14>
- <5, 1, 10>
- <9, 6, 11>
- <9, 11, 6>
- <9, 14, 12>
- <6, 7, 10>
- <1, 3, 12>
- <1, 11, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
