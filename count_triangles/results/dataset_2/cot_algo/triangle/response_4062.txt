Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 19) (21, 1) (21, 12) (21, 24) (14, 1) (14, 4) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 15) (17, 26) (7, 20) (12, 21) (12, 27) (12, 26) (27, 12) (27, 29) (27, 19) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 29) (0, 11) (0, 5) (20, 7) (20, 9) (20, 23) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 13) (24, 21) (24, 26) (24, 16) (26, 17) (26, 12) (26, 24) (16, 24) (16, 25) (16, 23) (5, 0) (29, 27) (29, 10) (29, 18) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (19, 1) (19, 27) (15, 17) (15, 18) (9, 17) (9, 20) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 28) (28, 9) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 23) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 29) (18, 15) (18, 13) (25, 16) (25, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 25) (4, 14) (4, 28) (4, 23) (23, 20) (23, 16) (23, 28) (23, 4) (23, 13) (22, 10) (22, 28) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 23)

22: 2
23: 5
24: 3
25: 2
26: 4
27: 3
28: 4
29: 4

Sorted Nodes based on Degrees:
5, 7, 14, 15, 22, 25, 20, 0, 6, 12, 16, 19, 1, 2, 4, 27, 24, 3, 26, 13, 11, 21, 28, 29, 18, 10, 9, 23, 17
