Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 16) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 15) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 15) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 6) (2, 11) (12, 15) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 17) (17, 8) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 5) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 17) (16, 9) (9, 0) (9, 16) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 12) (5, 18) (5, 17) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Then, we relabel the vertices and count the triangles.

Here is the list of vertices sorted by their degree:
0: 3 connections
1: 1 connection
2: 1 connection
3: 4 connections
4: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 5 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 2 connections
10: 3 connections
11: 4 connections
12: 1 connection
13: 5 connections
14: 4 connections
15: 3 connections
16: 4 connections
17: 4 connections
18: 3 connections
19: 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
0: 1
1: 3
2: 4
3: 5
4: 2
5: 14
6: 6
7: 8
8: 7
9: 15
10: 11
11: 9
12: 16
13: 10
14: 12
15: 18
16: 13
17: 17
18: 19
19: 20

We will now proceed to count the triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 11]
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 19>
<0, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 11>
<3, 7, 13>
<3, 11, 13>
<8, 13, 16>
<8, 13, 17>
<8, 13, 19>
<8, 16, 17>
<8, 17, 19>
