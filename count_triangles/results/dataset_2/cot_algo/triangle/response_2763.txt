Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 2) (15, 22) (15, 4) (2, 15) (2, 29) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 9) (4, 15) (4, 24) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 12) (9, 29) (9, 19) (22, 15) (22, 10) (26, 24) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 17) (28, 3) (28, 2) (28, 0) (28, 7) (24, 3) (24, 4) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 1) (7, 28) (7, 14) (7, 27) (25, 17) (25, 13) (20, 1) (17, 26) (17, 25) (17, 8) (17, 21) (23, 18) (23, 26) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 26) (11, 24) (11, 6) (11, 8) (1, 24) (1, 20) (1, 5) (1, 12) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 8) (8, 17) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 8) (21, 17) (21, 0) (19, 9) (19, 16) (19, 12) (27, 7) (27, 6) (13, 25) (13, 12) (13, 16) (12, 18) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 13) (12, 6) (16, 19) (16, 13) (5, 3) (5, 1) (6, 11) (6, 27) (6, 12) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 5: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 28: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 9: degree 2
Node 24: degree 5
Node 15: degree 4
Node 22: degree 2
Node 29: degree 2
Node 26: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 18: degree 4
Node 10: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 20: degree 1
Node 7: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 21: degree 2
Node 11: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 27: degree 2
Node 12: degree 5
Node 13: degree 3
Node 16: degree 3
Node 19: degree 3
Node 25: degree 2

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will now count the triangles:
- Edge (5, 3) is skipped since Node 5 has fewer connections than Node 3.
- Edge (0, 28) is skipped since Node 0 has fewer connections than Node 28.
- Edge (2, 15) forms a triangle <2, 15, 4>.
- Edge (2, 29) is skipped since Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 29.
- Edge (28, 3) forms a triangle <28, 3, 15>.
- Edge (9, 29) is skipped since Node 9 has fewer connections than Node 29.
- Edge (15, 22) is skipped since both nodes have the same degree.
- Edge (26, 24) forms a triangle <26, 24, 11>.
- Edge (28, 0) is skipped since Node 28 has more connections than Node 0.
- Edge (0, 8) forms a triangle <0, 8, 21>.
- Edge (8, 17) forms a triangle <8, 17, 26>.
- Edge (14, 7) forms a triangle <14, 7, 27>.
- Edge (21, 17) forms a triangle <21, 17, 26>.
- Edge (6, 12) forms a triangle <6, 12, 13>.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
