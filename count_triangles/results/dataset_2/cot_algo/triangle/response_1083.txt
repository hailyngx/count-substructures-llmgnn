Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles. Here are the steps:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections (degree):
   - Node 0: degree 3
   - Node 1: degree 4
   - Node 3: degree 4
   - Node 7: degree 4
   - Node 9: degree 4
   - Node 2: degree 4
   - Node 6: degree 4
   - Node 5: degree 6
   - Node 8: degree 4
   - Node 4: degree 6

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   - Node 0 -> Node A (degree 3)
   - Node 1 -> Node B (degree 4)
   - Node 3 -> Node C (degree 4)
   - Node 7 -> Node D (degree 4)
   - Node 9 -> Node E (degree 4)
   - Node 2 -> Node F (degree 4)
   - Node 6 -> Node G (degree 4)
   - Node 5 -> Node H (degree 6)
   - Node 8 -> Node I (degree 4)
   - Node 4 -> Node J (degree 6)

3. Process the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
   - <A, C> shared connections: (0, 1), (0, 3)
   - <A, D> shared connections: (0, 7)
   - <A, E> shared connections: (0, 1), (0, 9)
   - <C, E> shared connections: (3, 1), (3, 9)
   - <B, E> shared connections: (1, 9)
   - <C, F> shared connections: (3, 2)
   - <F, I> shared connections: (2, 8)
   - <D, E> shared connections: (7, 9)
   - <B, H> shared connections: (1, 5), (1, 3), (1, 7)
   - <B, J> shared connections: (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 4)
   - <C, H> shared connections: (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 1)
   - <D, H> shared connections: (7, 5), (7, 1), (7, 9)
   - <E, H> shared connections: (9, 5), (9, 1)
   - <F, H> shared connections: (2, 5), (2, 3), (2, 1)
   - <H, I> shared connections: (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 6)
   - <F, J> shared connections: (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 6)
   - <G, J> shared connections: (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 1)
   - <J, I> shared connections: (5, 8), (5, 6)

4. Total number of triangles: [18]
   Unique triangles:
   - <0, 1, 3>
   - <0, 1, 9>
   - <1, 5, 7>
   - <1, 5, 9>
   - <1, 6, 4>
   - <3, 1, 9>
   - <3, 2, 1>
   - <3, 5, 1>
   - <3, 5, 6>
   - <5, 4, 6>
   - <5, 4, 8>
   - <5, 6, 8>
   - <5, 6, 9>
   - <5, 8, 4>
   - <5, 8, 6>
   - <5, 8, 9>
   - <5, 9, 1>
   - <6, 4, 5>
