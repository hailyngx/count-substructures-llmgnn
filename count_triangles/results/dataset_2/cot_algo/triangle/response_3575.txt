Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 15) (1, 16) (1, 12) (3, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 7) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 15) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 9) (7, 13) (7, 0) (17, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 15) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 19) (19, 0) (19, 4) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 15) (18, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 18) (9, 0) (9, 17) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 15) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 12) (15, 2) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 14, 5, and 4
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 1, 2, 4, and 15
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 16 and 12
- Node 3 is connected to node 2
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 14, 10, and 0
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 12 and 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 11, 6, and 4
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 14, 10, and 15
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8, 7, 12, 19, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 13 and 0
- Node 17 is connected to node 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 11, 16, 5, and 19
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 0 and 4
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 13, 0, and 15
- Node 18 is connected to node 10
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 8, 6, and 18
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 17
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 16 and 3
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 16, 6, 14, 12, and 2

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) from least to most:

Nodes by degree: 3, 17, 18, 1, 7, 9, 2, 13, 10, 19, 5, 8, 3, 13, 18, 6, 4, 0, 15, 11

Now, we will analyze each edge according to the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.
After going through all edges, we find that the total number of triangles in the graph is [49].

Some of the unique triangles found are:
<3, 2, 15>
<2, 15, 16>
<16, 15, 14>
<6, 10, 18>
<5, 4, 11>
<13, 7, 0>
<0, 8, 14>
<12, 1, 16>
<10, 6, 15>
<4, 19, 0>
