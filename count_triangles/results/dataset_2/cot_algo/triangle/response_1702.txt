Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 12) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 13) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) 
(1, 6) (1, 9) 
(2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 14) 
(3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 12) 
(4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) 
(5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 14) 
(6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) 
(7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) 
(8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) 
(9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 0) 
(10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) 
(11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) 
(12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 5) 
(13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 14) 
(14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 13)

Next, let's label the nodes based on their degree in non-decreasing order:

Nodes Degree:
1: {1, 8}
2: {3, 4, 10}
3: {2, 9, 11, 14}
4: {5, 7, 12}
5: {6, 13}

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

Number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 12>
<0, 5, 12>
<0, 9, 4>
<2, 7, 14>
<2, 12, 14>
<3, 5, 12>
<4, 7, 14>
<5, 10, 13>
<5, 12, 14>
<9, 10, 13>
