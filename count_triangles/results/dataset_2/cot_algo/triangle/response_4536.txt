Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 3) (9, 19) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 16) (3, 9) (3, 15) (3, 20) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 18) (2, 29) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 13) (29, 12) (29, 4) (14, 23) (14, 4) (14, 10) (17, 16) (8, 13) (8, 25) (8, 21) (8, 1) (13, 29) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 27) (22, 26) (22, 11) (23, 14) (23, 11) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 19) (20, 3) (20, 15) (20, 11) (20, 10) (21, 8) (21, 0) (21, 24) (24, 21) (24, 4) (24, 5) (4, 29) (4, 14) (4, 24) (4, 27) (27, 13) (27, 4) (27, 7) (27, 6) (11, 22) (11, 23) (11, 20) (11, 19) (1, 8) (1, 13) (6, 27) (28, 18) (28, 25) (7, 29) (7, 13) (7, 27) (7, 16) (16, 26) (16, 17) (16, 7) (10, 26) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 20) (10, 18) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 11) (5, 24) (5, 18) (18, 15) (18, 28) (18, 10) (18, 5) (25, 8) (25, 28) (12, 29) (12, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees and then relabeling them accordingly. Let's calculate the triangles in the graph with the given edges.

First, let's construct the graph:
- 30 nodes: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29
- 90 edges: (9, 3), (9, 19), (26, 22), (26, 10), (26, 16), ..., (12, 29), (12, 0)

Next, we sort the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
Node 24 (degree 3)
Node 5 (degree 3)
Node 6 (degree 3)
Node 17 (degree 3)
Node 18 (degree 4)
Node 21 (degree 4)
Node 23 (degree 4)
Node 28 (degree 4)
Node 1 (degree 4)
Node 2 (degree 4)
Node 25 (degree 4)
Node 27 (degree 4)
Node 4 (degree 4)
Node 7 (degree 4)
Node 8 (degree 4)
Node 11 (degree 4)
Node 13 (degree 5)
Node 14 (degree 5)
Node 15 (degree 5)
Node 16 (degree 5)
Node 20 (degree 5)
Node 10 (degree 5)
Node 29 (degree 6)
Node 0 (degree 6)
Node 12 (degree 6)
Node 3 (degree 6)
Node 9 (degree 6)
Node 26 (degree 6)
Node 19 (degree 6)
Node 22 (degree 6)

Now, we consider the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
- (9, 3): Forms a triangle with 15 as shared connection
- (9, 19): No triangle
- (26, 22): No triangle
- (26, 10): Forms a triangle with 14 as shared connection
- (26, 16): Forms a triangle with 17 as shared connection
- (3, 9): Already counted
- (3, 15): Forms a triangle with 20 as shared connection
- ...
- ...
- (12, 29): No triangle
- (12, 0): Forms a triangle with 21 as shared connection

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles found: <3, 9, 15>, <10, 14, 26>, <0, 12, 21>
