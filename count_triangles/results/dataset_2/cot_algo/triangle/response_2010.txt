Response:
The graph can be visually represented as:

```
0 -- 1       6 -- 22
|    |       |    |
4 -- 8 -- 14 -- 19 -- 6
|    |    |    |    |
|    |    |    |    |
23 -- 12 -- 27 -- 21
|    |       |    |
|    |       |    |
|    18 -- 23    |    
|                |
|                |
|    2 -- 25 -- 3 |
29 -- 0       8 -- 13
|                 |   
|                 |
16 -- 20 -- 3 -- 25     
|    |        |   
|    |        |      
15 -- 26       5   
    |              
    |        
   11 -- 7    
```

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 17: 2 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 13: 2 connections
Node 18: 2 connections
Node 19: 2 connections
Node 20: 4 connections
Node 22: 2 connections
Node 24: 2 connections
Node 28: 3 connections
Node 29: 4 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 21: 4 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 16: 4 connections
Node 25: 4 connections
Node 27: 5 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 26: 2 connections

After relabeling, the sorted nodes are:
11, 15, 17, 9, 10, 13, 18, 19, 22, 24, 28, 2, 4, 5, 6, 16, 1, 7, 14, 20, 25, 3, 8, 26, 0, 12, 21, 27, 29
