Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 2) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 4) (7, 12) (7, 18) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 16) (4, 17) (4, 15) (18, 7) (18, 3) (3, 11) (3, 18) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 13) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 15) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 14) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 16) (0, 9) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 2) (2, 11) (2, 17) (2, 15) (2, 14) (13, 9) (13, 19) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves counting triangles in the graph based on the degrees of vertices. 

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new vertex labels and their degrees are as follows:
- Node 0, degree 1
- Node 3, degree 2
- Node 18, degree 2
- Node 13, degree 2
- Node 4, degree 2
- Node 7, degree 3
- Node 17, degree 3
- Node 1, degree 3
- Node 10, degree 4
- Node 12, degree 4
- Node 19, degree 4
- Node 8, degree 4
- Node 14, degree 4
- Node 2, degree 4
- Node 11, degree 4
- Node 15, degree 5
- Node 9, degree 5
- Node 16, degree 5
- Node 6, degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles formed by shared connections. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [34], and some of the unique triangles found are <3, 11, 2>, <11, 2, 4>, <3, 11, 18>, <4, 15, 2>, <7, 12, 10>, <16, 6, 15>.
