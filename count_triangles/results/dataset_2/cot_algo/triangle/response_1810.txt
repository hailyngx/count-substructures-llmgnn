Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 13) (3, 0) (3, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 11) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
The given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4)
(9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1)
(1, 9) (1, 13)
(3, 0) (3, 4)
(8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 7)
(13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6)
(6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4)
(2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4)
(12, 2) (12, 0)
(0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 11)
(10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 7)
(11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 14)
(14, 9) (14, 11)
(7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 10)
(4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2)

Now, we will perform Degree-Based Ordering on the nodes based on their connections:

0 (degree 4) <br>
1 (degree 2) <br>
3 (degree 2) <br>
7 (degree 3) <br>
13 (degree 3) <br>
12 (degree 2) <br>
4 (degree 4) <br>
6 (degree 5) <br>
14 (degree 2) <br>
2 (degree 6) <br>
8 (degree 5) <br>
10 (degree 6) <br>
11 (degree 5) <br>
5 (degree 6) <br>
9 (degree 5) <br>

Using the Degree-Based Ordering, we will now count the triangles:
Triangles = 41

[41]
