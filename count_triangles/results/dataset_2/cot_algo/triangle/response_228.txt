Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 5) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 16) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 2) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 10) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 0) (7, 9) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 11) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 6) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 2) (18, 19) (18, 6) (11, 19) (11, 13) (1, 13) (2, 17) (2, 4) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 9) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 1) (6, 8) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 18) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 16) (9, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. Then we relabel the vertices accordingly. Here is the sorted list of vertices along with their connections:

Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 18: 2 connections
Vertex 12: 2 connections
Vertex 11: 2 connections
Vertex 19: 3 connections
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 13: 4 connections
Vertex 15: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 17: 4 connections
Vertex 14: 5 connections
Vertex 16: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 10: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections

Now, we will count the triangles by iterating through the edges:

Triangle 1: <3, 5, 17>
Triangle 2: <3, 5, 9>
Triangle 3: <3, 5, 19>
Triangle 4: <3, 7, 9>
Triangle 5: <3, 12, 9>
Triangle 6: <5, 0, 17>
Triangle 7: <5, 16, 6>
Triangle 8: <5, 16, 9>
Triangle 9: <5, 16, 18>
Triangle 10: <5, 11, 19>
Triangle 11: <17, 0, 7>
Triangle 12: <17, 0, 10>
Triangle 13: <17, 0, 2>
Triangle 14: <17, 5, 19>
Triangle 15: <14, 17, 0>
Triangle 16: <14, 17, 5>
Triangle 17: <14, 17, 2>
Triangle 18: <14, 17, 4>
Triangle 19: <14, 17, 8>
Triangle 20: <14, 0, 7>
Triangle 21: <14, 4, 8>
Triangle 22: <14, 8, 6>
Triangle 23: <19, 5, 16>
Triangle 24: <19, 5, 18>
Triangle 25: <19, 5, 11>
Triangle 26: <16, 9, 7>
Triangle 27: <16, 9, 12>
Triangle 28: <16, 9, 6>
Triangle 29: <16, 12, 9>
Triangle 30: <16, 6, 10>
Triangle 31: <0, 10, 4>
Triangle 32: <0, 10, 6>
Triangle 33: <0, 10, 2>
Triangle 34: <7, 9, 12>
Triangle 35: <5, 12, 9>

There are total of [35] triangles in the given graph.
