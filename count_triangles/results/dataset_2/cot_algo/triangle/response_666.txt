Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) 

Response:
We will first sort the vertices based on their degrees and assign new labels accordingly. 

Vertices sorted with their degrees:
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 0 and Node 8: Degree 4
Node 2 and Node 6: Degree 4
Node 1 and Node 9: Degree 5
Node 5: Degree 6
Node 4: Degree 7

After re-labeling the nodes, the new edge list becomes:
(2, 0) (6, 2) (6, 1) (8, 1) (8, 0)

Now, we will count the triangles based on the shared connections between the vertices for the given edges.

Triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 2>
- Triangle <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle <1, 2, 6>
- Triangle <1, 2, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
