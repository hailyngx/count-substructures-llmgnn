Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the graph with nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (4, 8, 6)
- 1: (5, 4, 2, 7)
- 2: (4, 3, 1, 6)
- 3: (5, 9, 6, 2)
- 4: (5, 0, 1, 2)
- 5: (9, 8, 1, 4, 3)
- 6: (7, 0, 3, 2, 8)
- 7: (9, 6, 1, 8)
- 8: (5, 7, 0, 6)
- 9: (5, 3, 7)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Node degrees (in ascending order): 0(3), 3(4), 8(4), 7(4), 1(4), 2(4), 9(4), 4(4), 6(5), 5(5)

New Labels: 0 -> 0, 3 -> 1, 8 -> 2, 7 -> 3, 1 -> 4, 2 -> 5, 9 -> 6, 4 -> 7, 6 -> 8, 5 -> 9

Using Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through the edges and count the triangles:

Triangles:
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <6, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [14]
