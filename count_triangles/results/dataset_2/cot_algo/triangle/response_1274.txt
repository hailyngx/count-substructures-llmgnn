Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 8.

Next, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. By sorting the nodes by the number of connections, we get the following order: (0, 5), (4, 6, 9), (2, 7), (1, 3, 8).
2.  Counting the triangles, we find: 

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <1, 3, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 8>
