The edges are as follows: (0, 20) (0, 10) (0, 23) (27, 2) (10, 0) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 29) (13, 8) (13, 3) (23, 0) (23, 8) (23, 20) (23, 12) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 23) (20, 29) (20, 12) (14, 11) (14, 5) (4, 24) (4, 29) (18, 21) (18, 1) (18, 3) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 18) (26, 28) (26, 5) (26, 25) (28, 26) (28, 17) (28, 9) (28, 22) (5, 14) (5, 26) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 6) (1, 18) (1, 22) (15, 5) (15, 12) (29, 8) (29, 20) (29, 4) (29, 25) (6, 19) (6, 21) (6, 16) (21, 18) (21, 6) (21, 22) (2, 27) (2, 22) (2, 25) (22, 28) (22, 1) (22, 21) (22, 2) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 6) (16, 24) (24, 4) (24, 16) (24, 25) (9, 28) (9, 25) (25, 26) (25, 29) (25, 2) (25, 24) (25, 9) (12, 23) (12, 20) (12, 15) (7, 5) (7, 17) (17, 28) (17, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling the nodes accordingly.

After relabeling the nodes based on their degrees, the new order becomes:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 27: degree 1
Node 11: degree 2
Node 8: degree 4
Node 13: degree 2
Node 23: degree 4
Node 20: degree 4
Node 14: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 18: degree 3
Node 26: degree 3
Node 28: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 19: degree 3
Node 1: degree 2
Node 15: degree 2
Node 29: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3
Node 21: degree 3
Node 2: degree 2
Node 22: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4
Node 24: degree 3
Node 9: degree 2
Node 25: degree 4
Node 12: degree 3
Node 7: degree 2
Node 17: degree 2
Node 10: degree 2

Using this new order, we can find the triangles in the graph:
