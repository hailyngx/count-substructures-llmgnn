Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 6) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 14) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 18) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 9) (15, 16) (15, 19) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 19) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 19) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 14) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 18) (17, 8) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 17) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps in efficiently counting the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Sort the nodes based on their degrees:
   Nodes in increasing order of degrees:
   2, 5, 11, 7, 1, 15, 18, 19, 14, 12, 16, 6, 4, 10, 0, 17, 13, 8, 3, 9

2. Relabel the nodes accordingly:
   0->0, 1->1, 2->2, 3->3, 4->4, 5->5, ..., 19->19

3. Count the triangles:
   - For each edge, if the lower labeled node has fewer connections, check for shared connections to form triangles.
   - The total number of triangles found is [34].

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 19>, <0, 9, 17>, <0, 10, 13>, <0, 10, 2>, <0, 10, 9>, <0, 13, 8>, <0, 17, 8>, <1, 0, 10>, <1, 0, 9>, <1, 6, 16>, <1, 6, 19>, <2, 10, 13>, <2, 12, 14>, <3, 13, 8>, <3, 18, 4>, <3, 18, 9>, <3, 9, 17>, <4, 12, 14>, <4, 17, 8>, <4, 17, 9>, <5, 12, 14>, <6, 16, 19>, <9, 18, 14>, <9, 18, 3>, <9, 19, 6>, <10, 13, 14>, <10, 13, 3>, <10, 2, 12>, <13, 14, 12>, <14, 12, 18>, <16, 15, 19>, <17, 0, 9>, <17, 4, 3>
