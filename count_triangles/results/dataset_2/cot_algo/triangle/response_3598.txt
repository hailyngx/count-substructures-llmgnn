Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (2, 13) (0, 4) (0, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 14) (8, 1) (8, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 6) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 

0 (degree 2),
2 (degree 2),
8 (degree 2),
9 (degree 3),
12 (degree 3),
5 (degree 4),
6 (degree 4),
1 (degree 5),
10 (degree 5),
14 (degree 5),
3 (degree 5),
7 (degree 6),
11 (degree 6),
13 (degree 6),
4 (degree 7).

Let's now find the triangles: 

- For edge (4, 7): looking at vertex 4, it is connected to vertices 6 and 13. When checking vertex 7, it is connected to vertices 3 and 11. The shared connection is vertex 7, so we found a triangle <4, 7, 11>.

- Next, for edge (4, 13): vertex 4 is connected to vertices 6 and 7, and vertex 13 is connected to vertices 2, 3, and 6. The shared connection is vertex 6, forming a triangle <4, 13, 6>.

- Continuing this process for the remaining edges, we find additional triangles such as <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 10>, <1, 5, 11>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 13, 6>, <5, 10, 11>, <6, 7, 14>, <6, 13, 4>, <6, 13, 14>, <9, 11, 14>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 10, and they are: <4, 7, 11>, <4, 13, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 10>, <1, 5, 11>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 13, 6>, <5, 10, 11>, <6, 7, 14>, <6, 13, 4>. 

So, the answer is [10].
