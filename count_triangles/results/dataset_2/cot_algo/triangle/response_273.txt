Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The vertices with their corresponding degrees are:
Vertex 0 - degree 6  
Vertex 1 - degree 4  
Vertex 2 - degree 3  
Vertex 3 - degree 3  
Vertex 4 - degree 7  
Vertex 5 - degree 3  
Vertex 6 - degree 2  
Vertex 7 - degree 5  
Vertex 8 - degree 4  
Vertex 9 - degree 7  

After relabeling based on degrees, the new order is:
Vertex 6 (degree 2)  
Vertex 3 (degree 3)  
Vertex 2 (degree 3)  
Vertex 5 (degree 3)  
Vertex 1 (degree 4)  
Vertex 8 (degree 4)  
Vertex 0 (degree 6)  
Vertex 7 (degree 5)  
Vertex 4 (degree 7)  
Vertex 9 (degree 7)  

We will now iterate through the edges and count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The total number of triangles found is [26], and the unique triangles are <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 1, 9>, <5, 4, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 9, 1>, <6, 0, 4>, <7, 2, 1>, <7, 2, 8>, <7, 4, 0>, <7, 4, 6>, <7, 4, 8>, <8, 2, 1>, <8, 4, 0>.
