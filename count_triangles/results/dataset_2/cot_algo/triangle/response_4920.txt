Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 12) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 5) (11, 2) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 2) (3, 12) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) from least to most:

Nodes sorted by degree:
11 (degree 1)
3 (degree 2)
10 (degree 3)
4 (degree 3)
6 (degree 4)
11 (degree 5)
13 (degree 5)
12 (degree 5)
0 (degree 5)
14 (degree 5)
7 (degree 5)
1 (degree 6)
9 (degree 6)
8 (degree 6)
2 (degree 6)

Now, let's list the triangles by considering the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

Total number of triangles: [20]
Unique triangles: 
<1, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 7, 13>
<0, 1, 12>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 10>
<0, 6, 14>
<0, 9, 14>
<3, 5, 12>
<5, 7, 13>
<6, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 14>
<6, 9, 14>
<7, 12, 13>
<8, 12, 13>
<8, 12, 2>
