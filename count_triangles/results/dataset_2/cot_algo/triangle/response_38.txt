Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by degree from least to most connections:

Node 5 has degree 3
Node 9 has degree 7
Node 4 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 5
Node 3 has degree 5
Node 8 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 0 has degree 5

Now, starting with the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles. 

After going through all the edges, we find that there are a total of [18] triangles in the graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 8, 3>
<1, 8, 0>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 9, 2>
<1, 9, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 8, 1>
<3, 8, 0>
<3, 1, 9>
<6, 7, 1>
<6, 7, 2>
<6, 0, 7>
<7, 2, 1>
<7, 2, 9>
