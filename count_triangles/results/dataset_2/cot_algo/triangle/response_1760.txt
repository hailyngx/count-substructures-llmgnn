Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 4) (10, 17) (10, 9) (17, 13) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 12) (4, 13) (4, 15) (18, 9) (18, 3) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (5, 15) (5, 14) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 16) (19, 6) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 11) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 1) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 9) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 12) (9, 11) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 19) (14, 7) (14, 5) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 9) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are:  
Node 16 with degree 3  
Node 5 with degree 3  
Node 0 with degree 3  
Node 2 with degree 3  
Node 14 with degree 3  
Node 18 with degree 3  
Node 12 with degree 4  
Node 10 with degree 4  
Node 1 with degree 4  
Node 4 with degree 4  
Node 19 with degree 4  
Node 7 with degree 5  
Node 11 with degree 5  
Node 6 with degree 5  
Node 9 with degree 5  
Node 3 with degree 5  
Node 13 with degree 5  
Node 17 with degree 6  
Node 15 with degree 6  
Node 8 with degree 6  

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:  

[Total number of triangles: 18]  

Unique triangles:  
<1, 6, 8>  
<1, 6, 11>  
<1, 6, 16>  
<1, 8, 16>  
<4, 13, 8>  
<4, 13, 15>  
<5, 11, 15>  
<7, 14, 5>  
<7, 14, 15>  
<7, 14, 2>  
<7, 14, 19>  
<9, 11, 6>  
<9, 11, 15>  
<9, 11, 16>  
<9, 11, 1>  
<10, 9, 17>  
<10, 9, 12>  
<15, 8, 13>
