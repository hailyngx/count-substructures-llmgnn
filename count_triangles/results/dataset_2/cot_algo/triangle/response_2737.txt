Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Degree-Based Ordering:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5
Node 4: degree 6

Triangles:
Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <2, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 7>
