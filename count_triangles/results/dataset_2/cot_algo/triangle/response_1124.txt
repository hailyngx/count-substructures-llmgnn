Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices from least connected to most connected is as follows: 

Node 8 -> Node 0 -> Node 6 -> Node 2 -> Node 3 -> Node 5 -> Node 9 -> Node 4 -> Node 1 -> Node 7

Now, we will count the number of triangles formed using the edges provided:

1. For edge (6, 5):
    Node 5 is less connected than Node 6. Looking for shared connections:
    Shared connections between Node 5 and Node 6: 1
    Triangles formed: <5, 6, 1>

2. For edge (6, 1):
    Node 1 is less connected than Node 6. Looking for shared connections:
    Shared connections between Node 1 and Node 6: 1
    Triangles formed: <1, 6, 7>

3. For edge (6, 7):
    Node 7 is less connected than Node 6. Looking for shared connections:
    Shared connections between Node 6 and Node 7: 2
    Triangles formed: <5, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [3]
