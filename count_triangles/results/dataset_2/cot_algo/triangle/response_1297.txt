Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 9) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 14) (7, 10) (8, 4) (8, 0) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 0) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 1) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 12) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 9) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 17) (6, 15) (6, 12) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 2) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 2) (14, 13) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (12, 19) (12, 6) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 17) (9, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

edges = [(11, 3), (11, 19), (11, 18), (16, 0), (16, 3), (16, 9), (3, 11), (3, 16), (3, 15), (3, 4), (15, 3), (15, 10), (15, 6), (4, 3), (4, 8), (4, 18), (4, 14), (7, 10), (8, 4), (8, 0), (18, 11), (18, 4), (18, 14), (18, 0), (5, 19), (5, 2), (5, 1), (19, 11), (19, 5), (19, 12), (10, 15), (10, 7), (10, 9), (0, 16), (0, 8), (0, 18), (0, 17), (6, 15), (6, 12), (17, 0), (17, 9), (17, 2), (2, 5), (2, 17), (2, 1), (2, 14), (14, 4), (14, 18), (14, 2), (14, 13), (1, 5), (1, 2), (1, 9), (12, 19), (12, 6), (9, 16), (9, 10), (9, 17), (9, 1), (13, 14)]

Initially, sorting the nodes based on their degrees:
Degree of Node 0: 4
Degree of Node 1: 3
Degree of Node 2: 4
Degree of Node 3: 5
Degree of Node 4: 5
Degree of Node 5: 3
Degree of Node 6: 3
Degree of Node 7: 1
Degree of Node 8: 2
Degree of Node 9: 5
Degree of Node 10: 3
Degree of Node 11: 3
Degree of Node 12: 2
Degree of Node 13: 1
Degree of Node 14: 4
Degree of Node 15: 4
Degree of Node 16: 3
Degree of Node 17: 3
Degree of Node 18: 4
Degree of Node 19: 4

Relabeling the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes after relabeling: [7, 13, 8, 1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 12, 0, 16, 11, 17, 3, 4, 14, 15, 18, 19, 9]

Now, counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 15>
<0, 4, 18>
<0, 8, 16>
<0, 16, 17>
<1, 2, 14>
<1, 2, 17>
<3, 11, 18>
<3, 4, 14>
<3, 4, 15>
<4, 14, 18>
<9, 10, 15>
<9, 10, 17>
