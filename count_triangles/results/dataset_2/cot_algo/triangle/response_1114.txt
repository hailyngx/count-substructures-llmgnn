Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 12) (0, 1) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted in ascending order of the number of connections are:  
0 -> 2 connections  
4 -> 2 connections  
11 -> 2 connections  
14 -> 2 connections  
7 -> 3 connections  
10 -> 3 connections  
12 -> 4 connections  
3 -> 4 connections  
1 -> 4 connections  
5 -> 4 connections  
6 -> 4 connections  
13 -> 6 connections  
8 -> 6 connections  
9 -> 6 connections  
   
Considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:  
<0, 1, 3>  
<0, 1, 5>  
<0, 7, 12>  
<0, 12, 5>  
<1, 3, 8>  
<1, 3, 10>  
<1, 5, 6>  
<1, 5, 7>  
<1, 5, 12>  
<2, 4, 6>  
<2, 7, 12>  
<2, 10, 13>  
<2, 10, 14>  
<3, 7, 12>  
<3, 8, 13>  
<3, 10, 13>  
<3, 10, 14>  
<4, 6, 9>  
<5, 6, 7>  
<5, 6, 12>  
<6, 9, 13>  
<7, 12, 13>  
<8, 13, 14>  
<10, 13, 14>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [24].
