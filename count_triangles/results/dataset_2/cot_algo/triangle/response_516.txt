Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to efficiently count the number of triangles in the graph.

The sorted list of nodes based on their degrees is: <2, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1, 4, 3, 9, 5>.

By following the method and inspecting the edges, we can count the number of triangles:

Triangles: <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
