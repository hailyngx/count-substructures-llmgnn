Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (7, 29) (7, 14) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 20) (3, 16) (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 18) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 21) (9, 17) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 18) (27, 12) (27, 11) (27, 28) (28, 27) (28, 29) (28, 18) (29, 7) (29, 28) (21, 9) (21, 16) (21, 22) (11, 3) (11, 27) (11, 19) (17, 9) (20, 3) (20, 6) (20, 2) (20, 23) (18, 13) (18, 12) (18, 28) (18, 14) (16, 3) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 15) (24, 6) (24, 16) (24, 0) (24, 10) (24, 23) (25, 9) (25, 5) (25, 23) (25, 2) (5, 4) (5, 25) (15, 8) (15, 16) (15, 19) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 0) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 22) (14, 10) (22, 21) (22, 14) (22, 0) (2, 13) (2, 20) (2, 25) (2, 10) (0, 24) (0, 19) (0, 22) (10, 24) (10, 14) (10, 2) (23, 20) (23, 24) (23, 25) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph can be numbered from 0 to 29. Let's list the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 1: 5 connections
Node 29: 4 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 20: 4 connections
Node 16: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 18: 5 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 24: 5 connections
Node 21: 3 connections
Node 17: 2 connections
Node 27: 3 connections
Node 28: 4 connections
Node 25: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 22: 3 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 19: 3 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 23: 4 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles now.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [39].

Unique triangles found are:
