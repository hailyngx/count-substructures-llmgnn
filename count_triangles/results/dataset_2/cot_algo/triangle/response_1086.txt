Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 12) (15, 10) (15, 9) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 4) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 12) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 19) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 4) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 13) (16, 3) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 0) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 9) (12, 3) (12, 18) (7, 3) (7, 18) (7, 8) (5, 2) (5, 18) (6, 8) (6, 13) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 0) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) (1, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will now be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

After relabeling the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertices:
0 → 3 connections
1 → 1 connection
2 → 4 connections
3 → 2 connections
4 → 4 connections
5 → 2 connections
6 → 2 connections
7 → 4 connections
8 → 4 connections
9 → 4 connections
10 → 2 connections
11 → 2 connections
12 → 2 connections
13 → 3 connections
14 → 4 connections
15 → 2 connections
16 → 4 connections
17 → 4 connections
18 → 4 connections
19 → 3 connections

Now, let's count the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 4, 13>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 16>
<0, 4, 17>
<0, 4, 13>
<0, 4, 16>
<0, 4, 17>
<0, 4, 13>
<0, 4, 16>
<0, 4, 17>
<0, 16, 3>
<0, 16, 14>
<0, 16, 2>
<0, 16, 17>
<4, 10, 15>
<4, 10, 8>
<4, 10, 1>
<4, 17, 14>
<4, 17, 10>
<13, 11, 14>
<13, 0, 1>
<13, 0, 6>
<16, 3, 7>

<17, 14, 2>
<17, 4, 10>

Total number of triangles: [ 29 ]
