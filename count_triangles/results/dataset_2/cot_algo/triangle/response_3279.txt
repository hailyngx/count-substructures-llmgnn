Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 10) (2, 19) (2, 9) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 18) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 9) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 19) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 3) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 18) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 15) (0, 12) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 13) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 15) (10, 7) (10, 19) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: (4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 13), (4, 11)
- 1: (7, 10), (7, 14), (7, 13), (7, 1)
- 2: (17, 16), (17, 15), (17, 11)
- 3: (8, 19), (8, 5)
- 4: (19, 2), (19, 14), (19, 10)
- 5: (2, 9)
- 6: (12, 16), (12, 0), (12, 18)
- 7: (16, 17), (16, 9), (16, 18)
- 8: (11, 17), (11, 19)
- 9: (3, 14), (3, 13), (3, 5)
- 10: (5, 3)
- 11: (14, 7), (14, 19), (14, 3), (14, 6), (14, 18)
- 12: (6, 14)
- 13: (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 16), (9, 15)
- 14: (0, 12)
- 15: (15, 17), (15, 9), (15, 13)
- 16: (18, 12), (18, 16), (18, 14)
- 17: (13, 4), (13, 7), (13, 3), (13, 15)
- 18: (10, 7), (10, 19)

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:

0: 1
1: 1
2: 1
5: 1
6: 1
10: 1
12: 1
15: 1
17: 1
18: 1
3: 2
8: 2
20: 2
4: 3
11: 3
16: 3
7: 4
13: 4
19: 4
9: 4

Now, we will count the number of triangles formed:

[Total number of triangles: 14]

Unique triangles:
<3, 9, 13>
<3, 9, 15>
<3, 13, 15>
<4, 7, 11>
<4, 7, 13>
<4, 7, 14>
<4, 13, 15>
<4, 9, 13>
<4, 9, 16>
<4, 9, 19>
<7, 11, 17>
<7, 13, 15>
<9, 13, 16>
<9, 13, 19>
