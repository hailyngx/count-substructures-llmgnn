Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 5) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 2) (13, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 12) (1, 16) (1, 14) (17, 6) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 14) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 6) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 15) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 6) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 3) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (15, 14) (15, 5) (10, 19) (10, 6) (5, 16) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 15) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and edges:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (11, 16), (11, 9), (11, 8), (16, 11), (16, 1), (16, 8), (16, 5), (4, 19), (4, 5), (4, 2), (7, 9), (7, 5), (8, 11), (8, 16), (8, 2), (13, 9), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 18), (0, 12), (1, 16), (1, 14), (17, 6), (18, 0), (18, 19), (18, 14), (19, 4), (19, 18), (19, 10), (19, 3), (19, 6), (14, 1), (14, 18), (14, 12), (14, 15), (12, 0), (12, 14), (12, 6), (6, 17), (6, 19), (6, 12), (6, 10), (6, 3), (3, 0), (3, 19), (3, 6), (9, 11), (9, 7), (9, 13), (15, 14), (15, 5), (10, 19), (10, 6), (5, 16), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 15)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by degree in ascending order:
Vertices: 16(4), 1(2), 10(2), 11(2), 12(2), 13(2), 17(2), 18(2), 0(3), 5(5), 7(2), 15(2), 3(3), 6(5), 14(4), 2(4), 8(3), 9(3), 4(3), 19(5)

Triangles found: <5, 16, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 19>, <6, 12, 14>, <6, 12, 19>, <6, 14, 18>, <6, 14, 19>, <6, 19, 10>, <6, 19, 3>
Total number of triangles: [10]
