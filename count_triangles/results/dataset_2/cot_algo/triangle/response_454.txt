Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 16) (6, 17) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 18) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 17) (8, 9) (8, 13) (13, 6) (13, 8) (1, 3) (1, 15) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 14) (16, 15) (16, 14) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 19) (17, 6) (17, 11) (17, 19) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 2) (14, 18) (14, 16) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 17) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed based on the provided edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: 3, 9, 2
- 1: 3, 15
- 2: 0, 5, 12
- 3: 1, 0, 4
- 4: 3, 9, 7, 11, 18
- 5: 2, 10, 11
- 6: 17, 12, 19, 13
- 7: 4, 10, 18
- 8: 9, 13
- 9: 8, 4, 10, 0
- 10: 9, 7, 11, 5
- 11: 10, 4, 5, 17
- 12: 6, 2, 19
- 13: 6, 8
- 14: 18, 16
- 15: 1, 16
- 16: 15, 14
- 17: 6, 11, 19
- 18: 7, 4, 14
- 19: 6, 12, 17

Now, let's count the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [14]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 9, 4>
<0, 9, 10>
<1, 3, 15>
<4, 7, 10>
<4, 18, 14>
<6, 12, 19>
<6, 13, 8>
<10, 5, 11>
<11, 17, 6>
<14, 16, 18>
<16, 15, 1>
<17, 11, 6>
