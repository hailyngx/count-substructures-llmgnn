Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 16) (17, 8) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 15) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 1) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 15) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 15) (12, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 15) (3, 10) (3, 9) (16, 17) (16, 15) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 4) (15, 11) (15, 16) (19, 14) (19, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 

1. Node 16 has 2 connections.
2. Node 18 has 2 connections.
3. Node 6 has 2 connections.
4. Node 12 has 2 connections.
5. Node 2 has 3 connections.
6. Node 3 has 3 connections.
7. Node 8 has 3 connections.
8. Node 9 has 3 connections.
9. Node 19 has 3 connections.
10. Node 0 has 4 connections.
11. Node 1 has 4 connections.
12. Node 5 has 5 connections.
13. Node 4 has 5 connections.
14. Node 13 has 5 connections.
15. Node 17 has 5 connections.
16. Node 7 has 6 connections.
17. Node 15 has 6 connections.
18. Node 11 has 6 connections.
19. Node 10 has 6 connections.
20. Node 14 has 6 connections.

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the total number of triangles and unique triangles as follows:

Total number of triangles: [15]

Unique triangles:
1. <0, 7, 13>
2. <0, 1, 10>
3. <0, 7, 15>
4. <0, 1, 6>
5. <0, 10, 5>
6. <1, 6, 5>
7. <1, 6, 10>
8. <2, 18, 15>
9. <2, 18, 5>
10. <4, 19, 15>
11. <6, 1, 9>
12. <7, 14, 19>
13. <7, 14, 9>
14. <7, 13, 14>
15. <10, 0, 3>
