Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 15) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 10) (17, 11) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 16) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 15) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 19) (7, 9) (7, 15) (7, 16) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 7) (18, 12) (18, 0) (19, 6) (19, 12) (14, 4) (14, 11) (0, 6) (0, 18) (2, 13) (2, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph.

Here is the list of edges:
(5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 0) 
(8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 15) (10, 17) (10, 12) 
(17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 10) (17, 11) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (3, 5) (3, 11) 
(3, 16) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 15) 
(15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 19) (7, 9) (7, 15) 
(7, 16) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 7) (18, 12) (18, 0) (19, 6) (19, 12) (14, 4) 
(14, 11) (0, 6) (0, 18) (2, 13) (2, 11)

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 10: degree 2
Node 14: degree 2
Node 18: degree 2
Node 1: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 15: degree 3
Node 19: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 12: degree 5
Node 16: degree 5
Node 11: degree 6
Node 13: degree 6
Node 17: degree 6

Next, we will identify the triangles based on the shared connections of each edge:

- Triangle 1: <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle 2: <4, 9, 13>
- Triangle 3: <3, 5, 11>
- Triangle 4: <1, 5, 11>
- Triangle 5: <1, 11, 15>
- Triangle 6: <6, 8, 17>
- Triangle 7: <6, 10, 17>
- Triangle 8: <3, 11, 16>
- Triangle 9: <8, 13, 15>
- Triangle 10: <12, 17, 19>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
