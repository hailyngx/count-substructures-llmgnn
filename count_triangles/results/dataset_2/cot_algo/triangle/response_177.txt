Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 13) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 5) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 16) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 0) (7, 15) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 9) (1, 17) (1, 10) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 0) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 4) (11, 12) (11, 19) (11, 4) (4, 15) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 5) (10, 14) (10, 18) (10, 1) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
(3, 15), (3, 0), (3, 16), (3, 9), 
(15, 7), (15, 0), (15, 4), 
(14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 13), (14, 10), 
(17, 1), (17, 12), 
(8, 13), (8, 19), (8, 5), 
(18, 10), (18, 0), 
(7, 15), 
(12, 11), (12, 9), 
(1, 10), 
(5, 19), (5, 16), 
(19, 4), 
(0, 18), 
(11, 4), 
(4, 15), 
(9, 3), 
(16, 5), 
(10, 1)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees from least to most connections:
Nodes in sorted order: 7, 11, 17, 1, 16, 18, 10, 19, 8, 5, 9, 12, 14, 13, 0, 3, 15, 4

Next, we will iterate through the edges and count the number of triangles. We will only consider triangles where the lower labeled node has fewer connections.

<strong>The total number of triangles is [16].</strong>

Unique triangles:
<8, 13, 14>
<8, 13, 16>
<0, 3, 15>
<0, 4, 19>
<0, 4, 11>
<17, 12, 13>
<5, 8, 19>
<16, 5, 19>
<6, 10, 14>
<3, 15, 7>
<3, 0, 15>
<3, 0, 18>
<9, 3, 12>
<9, 3, 15>
<12, 11, 4>
<1, 10, 17>
