Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (6, 10) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 3) (5, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 12) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently.
Let's start by arranging the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 5 and Node 4 have the lowest degree: degree 1.
Node 7, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 0 have the next lowest degree: degree 2.
Node 3, Node 2, Node 6, Node 8, Node 12, and Node 14 have degree 3.
Node 1, Node 9, and Node 10 have the highest degree: degree 4.

Now, let's count the triangles:

1. For edge (4, 8):
    - Node 4 has neighbors: {8, 9}, Node 8 has neighbors: {4, 6, 0, 12}. Shared Neighbor: 8. Triangle found: <4, 8, 6>.

2. For edge (4, 9):
    - Node 4 has neighbors: {8, 9}, Node 9 has neighbors: {4, 3, 6, 0, 2}. Shared Neighbor: 4. Triangle found: <4, 9, 3>.

3. For edge (7, 0):
    - Node 7 has neighbors: {0, 11, 1}, Node 0 has neighbors: {7, 1, 11, 9, 8}. Shared Neighbor: 0. Triangle found: <7, 0, 1>.

4. For edge (7, 11):
    - Node 7 has neighbors: {0, 11, 1}, Node 11 has neighbors: {7, 1, 10, 0, 13}. Shared Neighbor: 7. Triangle found: <7, 11, 1>.

5. For edge (7, 1):
    - Node 7 has neighbors: {0, 11, 1}, Node 1 has neighbors: {7, 3, 11, 2, 13, 0}. Shared Neighbor: 1. Triangle found: <7, 1, 11>.

6. For edge (1, 3):
    - Node 1 has neighbors: {7, 3, 11, 2, 13, 0}, Node 3 has neighbors: {1, 9, 5}. Shared Neighbor: 3. Triangle found: <1, 3, 9>.

Successfully counted all the triangles. The total number of triangles is [6].
