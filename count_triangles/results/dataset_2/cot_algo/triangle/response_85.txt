Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 15) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 3) (1, 17) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 14) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 12) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 15) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 19) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 15) (19, 0) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 15) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 15) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 14) (13, 10) (13, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections each has. The sorted list of vertices with their degrees is as follows:
(0: 4), (19: 1), (18: 4), (7: 4), (2: 2), (8: 1), (4: 4), (5: 5), (3: 3), (1: 2), (6: 3), (9: 3), (13: 2), (16: 6), (11: 1), (12: 5), (17: 4), (10: 4), (14: 4), (15: 5).

Next, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
1. (11, 16):
    - Since vertex 11 has 1 connection and vertex 16 has 6 connections (more than 1), we proceed.
    - The shared connection between 11 and 16 is 1 (vertex 17).
    - So, we found a triangle <11, 16, 17>.
2. (16, 11): (Already counted in step 1)
3. (16, 12):
    - Vertex 16 has more connections than vertex 12, so we proceed.
    - The shared connections between 16 and 12 are 17 and 15.
    - So, we found triangles <16, 12, 17> and <16, 12, 15>.
4. (16, 17): (Already counted in steps 1 and 3)
5. (16, 15): (Already counted in step 3)

Repeat the above steps for the remaining edges to find all triangles formed by the given graph. Finally, denote the total number of triangles in brackets [].
