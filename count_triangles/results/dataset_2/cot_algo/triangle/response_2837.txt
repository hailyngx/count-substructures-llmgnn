Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 16) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 14) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 13) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 7) (4, 5) (4, 18) (4, 12) (18, 10) (18, 4) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 19) (11, 5) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 16) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 16) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 0) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 16) (16, 6) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the nodes is as follows:
Node 11: degree 2
Node 19: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 18: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 17: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 13: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 14: degree 5
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5
Node 15: degree 5
Node 16: degree 7
