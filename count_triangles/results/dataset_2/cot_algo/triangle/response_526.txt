Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 6) (0, 7) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 7) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (10, 4) (10, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 4) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 7) 

Response:
The graph given is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: (5, 13), (5, 11), (5, 3), (9, 14), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 12), (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 12), (1, 8), (1, 7), (3, 5), (3, 1), (3, 11), (3, 2), (3, 12), (8, 1), (8, 13), (8, 11), (8, 6), (8, 12), (13, 5), (13, 8), (13, 2), (13, 11), (13, 14), (13, 6), (0, 7), (14, 9), (14, 13), (14, 7), (11, 5), (11, 3), (11, 8), (11, 13), (11, 4), (7, 9), (7, 1), (7, 0), (7, 14), (7, 2), (4, 11), (4, 12), (4, 10), (4, 6), (12, 9), (12, 1), (12, 3), (12, 8), (12, 4), (12, 10), (10, 4), (10, 12), (6, 8), (6, 13), (6, 4), (2, 3), (2, 13), (2, 7)

Now, let's construct the Degree-Based Ordering and count the number of triangles.

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes sorted by degree: 0, 2, 10, 5, 14, 9, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 8, 13, 1, 3
Relabeled nodes: 0 -> A, 2 -> B, 10 -> C, 5 -> D, 14 -> E, 9 -> F, 4 -> G, 6 -> H, 7 -> I, 10 -> J, 12 -> K, 8 -> L, 13 -> M, 1 -> N, 3 -> O

Triangles:
[15]
<1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 0>, <1, 7, 14>, <1, 9, 7>, <1, 9, 14>, <1, 9, 12>, <1, 9, 3>, <3, 7, 0>, <3, 7, 14>, <3, 12, 0>, <3, 12, 10>, <3, 12, 4>, <3, 1, 12>, <3, 1, 0>, <3, 1, 8>
