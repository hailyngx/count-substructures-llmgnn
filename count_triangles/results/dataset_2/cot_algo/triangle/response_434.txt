Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 
- Node 4 has degree 4.
- Node 7 has degree 4.
- Node 6 has degree 3.
- Node 9 has degree 5.
- Node 5 has degree 4.
- Node 2 has degree 4.
- Node 8 has degree 3.
- Node 3 has degree 4.
- Node 1 has degree 4.
- Node 0 has degree 5.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Start with the edge (0, 6): Node 0 has fewer connections than Node 6, so proceed.
   - Shared connections with Node 0 and Node 6: Node 5.
   - Triangle found: <0, 5, 6>.

2. Move to the edge (5, 7): Node 5 has fewer connections than Node 7, so proceed.
   - Shared connections with Node 5 and Node 7: None.

3. Move to the edge (6, 4): Node 6 has fewer connections than Node 4, so proceed.
   - Shared connections with Node 6 and Node 4: None.

4. Move to the edge (9, 4): Node 9 has fewer connections than Node 4, so proceed.
   - Shared connections with Node 9 and Node 4: None.

5. Move to the edge (7, 3): Node 7 has fewer connections than Node 3, so proceed.
   - Shared connections with Node 7 and Node 3: None.

6. Move to the edge (7, 9): Node 7 has fewer connections than Node 9, so proceed.
   - Shared connections with Node 7 and Node 9: None.

7. Move to the edge (3, 8): Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 8, so proceed.
   - Shared connections with Node 3 and Node 8: None.

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [1].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 5, 6>.
