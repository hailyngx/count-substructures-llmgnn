Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 8) (14, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 11) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 11) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 1) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 10) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 13) (4, 3) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections (degrees) are as follows:
Nodes: 1 (degree 2), 14 (degree 2), 4 (degree 3), 8 (degree 3), 0 (degree 4), 5 (degree 4), 10 (degree 4), 13 (degree 4), 1 (degree 4), 7 (degree 4), 2 (degree 5), 12 (degree 5), 11 (degree 5), 6 (degree 6), 9 (degree 6)

Now, counting the number of triangles:

Count the triangles with the lowest degree nodes:
- Triangle <8, 10, 12>

Count the triangles with the next lowest degree nodes:
Counting based on edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- Triangle <4, 9, 13>
- Triangle <0, 5, 11>

Count the triangles with the next lowest degree nodes:
- No triangles with nodes 0, 5, or 11 due to the degree-based ordering.

Count the triangles with the next lowest degree nodes:
Counting based on edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- Triangle <1, 5, 11>
- Triangle <2, 7, 12>
- Triangle <2, 12, 13>
- Triangle <2, 5, 11>

Count the triangles with the next lowest degree nodes:
- No triangles with nodes 7 or 10 due to the degree-based ordering.

Count the triangles with the highest degree nodes:
Counting based on edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- Triangle <6, 7, 12>
- Triangle <6, 3, 9>
- Triangle <6, 10, 11>
- Triangle <6, 13, 2>

Total number of triangles: [9]
