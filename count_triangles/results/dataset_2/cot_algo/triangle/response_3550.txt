Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 11) (12, 14) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 4) (10, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Node 12 has 0 connections.
Nodes 10, 12, and 5 have 1 connection each.
Nodes 3, 10, and 12 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 0, 2, and 5 have 3 connections each.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 7 has 5 connections.
Nodes 8 and 14 have 5 connections each.
Nodes 4 and 6 have 5 connections each.
Node 13 has 6 connections.
Node 11 has 7 connections.
Node 9 has 8 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (5, 6) is considered since node 5 has 1 connection and node 6 has 5 connections. They share connections with nodes 1, 3, and 11.
- Edge (5, 1) is considered since node 5 has 1 connection and node 1 has 4 connections. They share connections with nodes 3 and 13.
- Edge (5, 4) is considered since node 5 has 1 connection and node 4 has 5 connections. They share connections with nodes 6, 9, and 11.
- Edge (5, 11) is considered since node 5 has 1 connection and node 11 has 7 connections. They share connections with nodes 6 and 13.
- Edge (9, 4) is considered since node 9 has 8 connections and node 4 has 5 connections. They share connections with nodes 0 and 14.
- Edge (9, 2) is considered since node 9 has 8 connections and node 2 has 3 connections. They share connections with nodes 1 and 8.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
- <5, 6, 1>
- <5, 1, 4>
- <5, 4, 9>
- <5, 11, 6>
- <9, 4, 0>
- <9, 2, 1>
