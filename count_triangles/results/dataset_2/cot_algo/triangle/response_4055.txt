Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 5) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 9) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 11) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 10) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

After sorting the nodes based on their degree:

0: degree 4, 
3: degree 4, 
13: degree 1, 
11: degree 3, 
9: degree 5, 
8: degree 4, 
2: degree 5, 
12: degree 4, 
6: degree 4, 
7: degree 7, 
1: degree 5, 
10: degree 5, 
5: degree 5, 
14: degree 6, 
4: degree 3

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles:
