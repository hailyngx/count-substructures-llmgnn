Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 19) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 12) (17, 6) (17, 3) (8, 11) (8, 12) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 14) (2, 15) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 19) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 15) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 0) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 15) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 15) (13, 9) (13, 16) (13, 18) (1, 0) (1, 16) (1, 18) (18, 5) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 11) (11, 8) (11, 18) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 16) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Here is the sorted list of vertices:

Vertices: 2, 8, 11, 17, 19, 18, 1, 5, 4, 6, 14, 7, 3, 0, 10, 12, 16, 13, 9, 15

Following the method, we count the triangles using the provided edges. 

The total number of triangles is [12].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 19>
<3, 17, 6>
<3, 17, 10>
<3, 17, 0>
<12, 15, 10>
<12, 15, 14>
<12, 15, 16>
<10, 15, 12>
<10, 15, 16>
<13, 16, 9>
