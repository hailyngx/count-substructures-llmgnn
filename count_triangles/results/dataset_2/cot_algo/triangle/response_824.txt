Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 1), (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 1), (7, 8), (1, 9), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 8), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 8), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 6), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 0), (2, 1), (2, 8), (0, 5), (0, 6)  

Degree-Based Ordering:  
Nodes sorted by their degrees (from least to most): 2, 0, 4, 6, 9, 2, 3, 1, 8, 8  
Relabeling the nodes:  
2 -> 1  
0 -> 2  
4 -> 3  
6 -> 4  
9 -> 5  
2 -> 6  
3 -> 7  
1 -> 8  
8 -> 9  
8 -> 10  

Edges to consider based on the ordering:  
(2, 8), (4, 8), (6, 8), (4, 6), (5, 9), (2, 9), (1, 7), (1, 3), (7, 8), (1, 8), (5, 6), (0, 6)  

Triangles found:  
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 8, 9>  

[Total number of triangles: 6]
