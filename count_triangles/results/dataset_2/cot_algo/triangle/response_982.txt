Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 10) (7, 18) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 14) (6, 16) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 18) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 10) (19, 0) (19, 1) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 1) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 13) (1, 18) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles in the given graph. 

Nodes and their corresponding degrees (number of connections):
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 5
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 2
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 2

Since there are 20 nodes in total, we will now sort them based on their degrees:

Nodes in sorted order: 4 (degree 2) < 7 (degree 2) < 12 (degree 2) < 17 (degree 2) < 19 (degree 2) 
< 11 (degree 3) < 14 (degree 3) < 15 (degree 3) < 16 (degree 3) < 18 (degree 3) 
< 0 (degree 5) < 2 (degree 4) < 3 (degree 4) < 5 (degree 4) < 6 (degree 4) < 8 (degree 4) < 9 (degree 4) < 10 (degree 5) < 1 (degree 6)

Now, we will follow the edges based on the node with the lower label and count the number of triangles.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 10, 12>, <1, 13, 15>, <1, 13, 18>, <1, 15, 18>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 10>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 10>, <4, 0, 10>, <4, 1, 13>, <5, 3, 6>, <6, 5, 10>, <8, 9, 15>, <9, 14, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [14].
