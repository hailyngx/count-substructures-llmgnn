Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 12) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 9) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 14) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles involves first arranging the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, then processing edges only if the lower-degree vertex is connected to the higher-degree vertex.

After examining the edges and sorting the vertices by their degrees, the vertices with their degrees are as follows:
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 4 connections
- Vertex 3: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 7: 4 connections
- Vertex 13: 4 connections
- Vertex 12: 5 connections
- Vertex 6: 5 connections
- Vertex 4: 5 connections
- Vertex 14: 5 connections
- Vertex 2: 5 connections
- Vertex 11: 5 connections
- Vertex 9: 5 connections
- Vertex 10: 5 connections
- Vertex 8: 5 connections

Using the degree-based ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. (4, 8) forms a triangle with node 10: <4, 8, 10>
2. (1, 11) forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 7: <1, 11, 5>
3. (1, 5) forms a triangle with nodes 11 and 7: <1, 5, 7>
4. (5, 13) forms a triangle with nodes 11 and 12: <5, 13, 12>
5. (13, 12) forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 11: <13, 12, 5>
6. (9, 10) forms a triangle with node 4: <9, 10, 4>
7. (4, 9) forms a triangle with node 10: <4, 9, 10>
8. (10, 13) forms a triangle with node 5: <10, 13, 5>
9. (10, 2) forms a triangle with node 14: <10, 2, 14>
10. (2, 14) forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 10: <2, 14, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
Output is in brackets [] to show the count of unique triangles.
