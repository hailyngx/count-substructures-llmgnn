Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 7) (8, 5) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 9) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 9) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, relabeling the vertices, and then counting the triangles.

After relabeling the vertices from 0 to 14 based on their degree of connections, the sorted list of vertices is as follows:

0: 2 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 6 connections
3: 3 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 5 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 4 connections
10: 3 connections
11: 4 connections
12: 4 connections
13: 4 connections
14: 5 connections

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

[10] total triangles

Unique triangles:
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 2, 14>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 14>
<1, 9, 14>
<2, 5, 14>
<3, 9, 13>
<4, 7, 14>
<5, 12, 14>
<6, 0, 14>
