Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 10) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 12) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 17) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 2) (17, 2) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 6) (8, 9) (8, 19) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 14) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 14) (0, 10) (16, 4) (16, 3) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 19) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to first sort the vertices based on their number of connections. Then we can count the triangles using the given edges.

Here is the sorted list of vertices based on their degree:
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 16: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 17: 3 connections
Node 19: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 18: 4 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Now, let's count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 8]
<4, 13, 18>
<3, 12, 2>
<3, 12, 1>
<5, 15, 14>
<5, 15, 14>
<11, 14, 15>
<10, 13, 4>
<6, 17, 19>
