Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 7) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 17) (17, 13) (17, 11) (17, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 15) (4, 2) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 9) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 13) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 1) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 18) (3, 5) (14, 6) (14, 16) (14, 5) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 19) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 5) (16, 10) (16, 14) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 6) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 15) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 1) (15, 4) (15, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in this graph. Let's first relabel the vertices based on their degree in ascending order.

1. Node 3, Degree: 1
2. Nodes 1, 18, 15, Degree: 2
3. Nodes 6, 5, 19, Degree: 3
4. Nodes 0, 2, 16, 14, 11, Degree: 4
5. Nodes 7, 18, 12, Degree: 5
6. Nodes 10, 17, 13, Degree: 6
7. Nodes 8, 9, Degree: 7
8. Node 4, Degree: 8

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph considering the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

Based on the provided edges and degree-based ordering, the triangles formed are:

1. <8, 9, 4>
2. <8, 9, 0>
3. <4, 9, 2>
4. <2, 9, 18>
5. <11, 10, 9>
6. <11, 17, 13>
7. <0, 12, 13>
8. <7, 17, 13>
9. <7, 19, 4>
10. <7, 1, 0>
11. <16, 14, 6>
12. <16, 10, 11>
13. <19, 7, 1>
14. <19, 4, 15>
  
Count of triangles: [14]
