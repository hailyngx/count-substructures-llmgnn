Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following connections:

Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7  
Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8  
Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 8  
Node 3: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9  
Node 4: 0, 5, 7, 8  
Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6  
Node 6: 2, 3, 5  
Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 8  
Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7  
Node 9: 3

Now we will sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:  
Node 9: 0 connections  
Node 2: 4 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 4: 4 connections  
Node 0: 4 connections  
Node 6: 4 connections  
Node 5: 5 connections  
Node 8: 5 connections  
Node 1: 5 connections  
Node 3: 5 connections  

Now, we will count the triangles by considering each edge while ensuring that the lower labeled node has fewer connections:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 7>  
<0, 1, 8>  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 2, 8>  
<0, 4, 7>  
<0, 4, 8>  
<1, 3, 5>  
<1, 3, 8>  
<2, 5, 6>  
<4, 7, 8>  

The total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
