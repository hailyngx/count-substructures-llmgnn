Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 21) (3, 19) (15, 10) (7, 21) (7, 16) (21, 3) (21, 7) (21, 14) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 28) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 1) (11, 4) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 6) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 6) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 16) (28, 10) (28, 12) (29, 26) (20, 17) (20, 12) (20, 18) (17, 23) (17, 20) (17, 26) (2, 13) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 25) (24, 11) (24, 27) (24, 9) (9, 24) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 19) (18, 20) (18, 9) (18, 27) (18, 12) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 27) (5, 22) (5, 23) (5, 8) (5, 12) (14, 21) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 13) (27, 24) (27, 18) (27, 1) (27, 26) (12, 28) (12, 20) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 14) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 1) (0, 9) (26, 29) (26, 17) (26, 27) (25, 10) (25, 16) (25, 6) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 6) (6, 22) (6, 23) (6, 25) (6, 13) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 29}

After sorting the nodes by their degree, we get the following labels:
Nodes by degree: {2, 0, 7, 3, 9, 15, 5, 13, 1, 4, 6, 8, 11, 10, 14, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges with the lower labeled node having fewer connections:
(0, 9), (1, 19), (2, 13), (3, 19), (4, 9), (5, 8), (5, 12), (5, 13), (5, 22), (5, 23), (6, 13), (6, 22), (6, 23), (6, 25), (7, 16), (7, 21), (9, 18), (9, 19), (9, 24), (10, 11), (10, 15), (10, 25), (10, 28), (11, 24), (11, 4), (12, 14), (12, 20), (12, 28), (13, 14), (14, 21), (14, 22), (14, 4), (14, 12), (16, 8), (16, 25), (17, 20), (17, 26), (18, 20), (18, 27), (19, 3), (20, 12), (20, 17), (20, 18), (21, 14), (21, 7), (22, 14), (23, 6), (24, 27), (25, 6), (26, 27)

Count of triangles: [14]
Unique triangles: <0, 9, 19>, <6, 13, 23>, <5, 8, 16>, <5, 12, 14>, <4, 9, 24>, <5, 22, 23>, <10, 11, 25>, <10, 15, 25>, <7, 16, 21>, <17, 20, 26>, <12, 14, 20>, <12, 14, 22>, <18, 20, 27>, <11, 24, 27>
