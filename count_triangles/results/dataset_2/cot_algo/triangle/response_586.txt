Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 10) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 5) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 18) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 3) (19, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 17) (5, 2) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 18) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 3) (15, 7) (15, 13) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 3) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 6) (13, 1) (13, 15) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 6) (6, 16) (6, 19) (6, 12) (6, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Count the number of connections for each node:
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 10: 5 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 13: 2 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 15: 2 connections
Node 16: 3 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 19: 4 connections

2. Sort the nodes based on the number of connections in ascending order and assign new labels to the nodes:
Node 1 (2 connections) -> Node A
Node 5 (2 connections) -> Node B
Node 7 (2 connections) -> Node C
Node 13 (2 connections) -> Node D
Node 15 (2 connections) -> Node E
Node 12 (3 connections) -> Node F
Node 8 (3 connections) -> Node G
Node 14 (3 connections) -> Node H
Node 18 (3 connections) -> Node I
Node 16 (3 connections) -> Node J
Node 11 (3 connections) -> Node K
Node 6 (4 connections) -> Node L
Node 0 (4 connections) -> Node M
Node 2 (4 connections) -> Node N
Node 17 (4 connections) -> Node O
Node 19 (4 connections) -> Node P
Node 3 (5 connections) -> Node Q
Node 10 (5 connections) -> Node R
Node 9 (4 connections) -> Node S
Node 4 (0 connections) -> Node T (Not connected in the given edges)

3. Reconstruct the edges based on the new labels:
(A, F) (A, N) (B, O) (B, N) (C, K) (C, E) (D, A) (D, H) (E, C) (E, H) (F, N) (F, R) (G, I) (G, H) (G, M) (H, D) (H, I) 
(I, G) (I, O) (J, F) (J, L) (J, P) (K, N) (K, R) (L, F) (L, P) (L, Q) (M, O) (M, F) (M, I) (N, O) (N, F) (N, K) 
(N, L) (O, I) (O, B) (O, P) (P, J) (P, L) (P, O) (Q, L) (Q, S) (R, F) (R, K) (S, O) (S, Q)

4. Count the triangles:
- Total number of triangles: [14]
- Unique triangles found: 
<B, N, O> 
<B, O, P> 
<G, H, I> 
<H, D, A> 
<I, O, P> 
<I, O, B> 
<L, F, N> 
<L, F, R> 
<L, P, O> 
<N, O, F> 
<N, O, I> 
<P, J, L> 
<P, L, O> 
<S, O, I>
