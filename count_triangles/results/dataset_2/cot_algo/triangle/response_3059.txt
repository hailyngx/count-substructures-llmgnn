Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 15) (9, 6) (9, 8) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 10) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 8) (18, 14) (18, 13) (17, 15) (17, 1) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 10) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 13) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 2) (16, 4) (16, 2) (12, 8) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 11) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 12) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 10) (13, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 13) 

Response:
I will now construct the graph based on the provided information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 2
- Node 1 is connected to Node 17, Node 14, Node 10
- Node 2 is connected to Node 3, Node 0, Node 16, Node 11
- Node 3 is connected to Node 15, Node 2, Node 8
- Node 4 is connected to Node 15, Node 13, Node 16
- Node 5 is connected to Node 19, Node 11, Node 10
- Node 6 is connected to Node 9, Node 19
- Node 7 is connected to Node 19, Node 14, Node 8
- Node 8 is connected to Node 3, Node 9, Node 7, Node 12
- Node 9 is connected to Node 15, Node 6, Node 8
- Node 10 is connected to Node 1, Node 5, Node 13
- Node 11 is connected to Node 5, Node 2, Node 13
- Node 12 is connected to Node 8, Node 14
- Node 13 is connected to Node 4, Node 18, Node 19, Node 10, Node 11
- Node 14 is connected to Node 1, Node 7, Node 18, Node 12
- Node 15 is connected to Node 3, Node 9, Node 17, Node 4
- Node 16 is connected to Node 4, Node 2
- Node 17 is connected to Node 15, Node 1
- Node 18 is connected to Node 14, Node 13
- Node 19 is connected to Node 6, Node 7, Node 5, Node 13

Now, I will sort the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order:
0, 1, 16, 5, 6, 12, 17, 7, 11, 18, 4, 8, 10, 13, 14, 2, 9, 3, 15, 19

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, I will now count the number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles found: 
<2, 3, 15>, <2, 4, 16>, <1, 10, 13>, <1, 7, 14>, <1, 10, 5>, <1, 13, 11>, <1, 14, 18>, <13, 19, 10>, <13, 14, 18>, <13, 14, 12>, <7, 14, 18>, <7, 8, 12>
