Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 28) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 20) (14, 3) (14, 27) (17, 29) (17, 25) (17, 23) (7, 21) (7, 12) (21, 7) (21, 29) (21, 24) (20, 9) (20, 25) (25, 17) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 23) (25, 12) (0, 10) (0, 28) (0, 19) (12, 7) (12, 25) (12, 22) (29, 9) (29, 17) (29, 21) (29, 11) (26, 28) (26, 16) (26, 6) (28, 5) (28, 0) (28, 26) (28, 13) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 8) (19, 22) (18, 5) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 6) (8, 22) (13, 25) (13, 28) (13, 3) (16, 26) (16, 3) (16, 27) (16, 15) (10, 0) (10, 4) (22, 12) (22, 19) (22, 8) (1, 11) (1, 23) (11, 29) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 2) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 16) (24, 21) (24, 8) (24, 23) (27, 14) (27, 16) (15, 5) (15, 16) (2, 11) (2, 4) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 1) (23, 24) (6, 26) (6, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices sorted by degree (ascending):
0 (degree 3)
1 (degree 4)
2 (degree 3)
9 (degree 4)
4 (degree 4)
6 (degree 2)
12 (degree 3)
14 (degree 2)
16 (degree 4)
18 (degree 1)
20 (degree 4)
22 (degree 4)
24 (degree 3)
26 (degree 3)
5 (degree 5)
19 (degree 5)
15 (degree 3)
3 (degree 3)
7 (degree 3)
21 (degree 3)
29 (degree 4)
11 (degree 4)
8 (degree 4)
13 (degree 3)
10 (degree 2)
17 (degree 5)
25 (degree 5)
27 (degree 2)
23 (degree 4)

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections to count triangles.

Counting triangles:
- Triangle <26, 28, 13>
- Triangle <12, 25, 29>
- Triangle <25, 20, 9>
- Triangle <25, 23, 17>
- Triangle <22, 19, 8>
- Triangle <22, 8, 6>
- Triangle <19, 5, 0>
- Triangle <28, 5, 19>
- Triangle <11, 29, 21>
- Triangle <11, 29, 17>
- Triangle <11, 4, 2>
- Triangle <4, 11, 2>
- Triangle <23, 24, 21>
- Triangle <23, 25, 17>
- Triangle <23, 1, 11>
- Triangle <15, 5, 16>
- Triangle <3, 14, 13>
- Triangle <3, 16, 27>
- Triangle <24, 21, 7>

Total number of triangles: [18]
