Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 19) (2, 6) (2, 18) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 16) (11, 13) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 15) (13, 14) (17, 15) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 8) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 15) (10, 0) (10, 4) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 19) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 7) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 13) (14, 8) (14, 12) (4, 1) (4, 10) (12, 1) (12, 14) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 17) (15, 16) 

Response:
The nodes and their connections can be represented as follows:

Node 0: 5, 3, 16, 10, 8
Node 1: 5, 3, 4, 19, 12
Node 2: 6, 18
Node 3: 1, 7, 0, 19
Node 4: 1, 10
Node 5: 9, 18, 1, 0
Node 6: 7, 2, 19, 13
Node 7: 6, 3, 19
Node 8: 0, 14
Node 9: 5
Node 10: 0, 4
Node 11: 13
Node 12: 1, 14
Node 13: 6, 11, 15, 14
Node 14: 13, 8, 12
Node 15: 18, 13, 17, 16
Node 16: 18, 0, 15
Node 17: 15
Node 18: 5, 2, 15, 16
Node 19: 6, 1, 3, 7

Next, let's count the number of triangles within the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Number of triangles: [20]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 16>
<0, 3, 19>
<0, 5, 18>
<1, 3, 19>
<1, 5, 18>
<6, 13, 15>
<6, 13, 19>
<13, 14, 15>
<13, 14, 19>
