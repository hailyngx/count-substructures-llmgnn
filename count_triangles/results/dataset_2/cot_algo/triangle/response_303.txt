Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: {(4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 3), (4, 2), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 1), (1, 5), (1, 8), (3, 0), (3, 8), (6, 9), (6, 0), (9, 6), (2, 8), (2, 5)}

To count the number of triangles in this graph using Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to label the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex degrees:
0: 4
1: 3
2: 5
3: 3
4: 4
5: 3
6: 3
7: 4
8: 3
9: 4

Based on the vertex degrees, the sorted list of vertices is: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 0, 9, 4, 7, 2

Now, we will check the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

1. Edge (4, 7): Check for shared connections between vertices 4 and 7. Triangle found: <4, 7, 2>
2. Edge (4, 9): Check for shared connections between vertices 4 and 9. No triangle found.
3. Edge (4, 3): Check for shared connections between vertices 4 and 3. Triangle found: <4, 3, 0>
4. Edge (4, 2): Check for shared connections between vertices 4 and 2. Triangle found: <4, 2, 8>
5. Edge (7, 2): Proceed to check shared connections.
6. Edge (7, 5): Proceed to check shared connections.
7. Edge (7, 1): Proceed to check shared connections.
8. Edge (1, 5): Check for shared connections between vertices 1 and 5. No triangle found.
9. Edge (1, 8): Check for shared connections between vertices 1 and 8. No triangle found.
10. Edge (3, 0): Check for shared connections between vertices 3 and 0. No triangle found.
11. Edge (3, 8): Check for shared connections between vertices 3 and 8. No triangle found.
12. Edge (6, 9): Proceed to check shared connections.
13. Edge (6, 0): Check for shared connections between vertices 6 and 0. No triangle found.
14. Edge (9, 6): Check for shared connections between vertices 9 and 6. No triangle found.
15. Edge (2, 8): Proceed to check shared connections.
16. Edge (2, 5): Proceed to check shared connections.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].

Unique triangles found: <4, 7, 2>, <4, 3, 0>, <4, 2, 8>.
