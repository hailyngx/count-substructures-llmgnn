Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 8) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) 

Response:
The sorted vertex list based on degree is as follows:
(7) - 1 connection
(2) - 2 connections
(7) - 3 connections
(9) - 4 connections
(4) - 4 connections
(12) - 4 connections
(1) - 4 connections
(8) - 4 connections
(13) - 4 connections
(0) - 5 connections
(3) - 5 connections
(6) - 5 connections
(14) - 6 connections
(11) - 6 connections
(5) - 6 connections

The triangles found are:
[<4, 6, 12>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 4, 10>, <0, 7, 4>, <1, 3, 10>, <1, 2, 14>, <11, 5, 13>, <5, 8, 12>, <5, 6, 12>, <11, 4, 13>, <9, 5, 6>, <9, 5, 12>, <9, 3, 1>, <9, 3, 12>, <9, 3, 10>, <9, 0, 4>, <9, 0, 13>, <6, 5, 12>, <13, 0, 4>, <13, 0, 9>]   

The total number of triangles is: [20]
