Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 13) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 16) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 1) (16, 14) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 4) (11, 14) (11, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 17) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 18) (17, 16) (17, 2) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 13) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 6) (9, 3) (9, 2) (6, 0) (6, 19) (10, 19) (10, 8) (18, 0) (18, 5) (18, 1) (8, 3) (8, 16) (8, 10) (13, 15) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 19) 

Response:
The graph has the following structure based on the provided edges:

Nodes: 20
Edges: 60

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

Node 12: degree 0
Node 20: degree 0
Node 9: degree 2
Node 17: degree 2
Node 6: degree 2
Node 2: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 14: degree 4
Node 18: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 3: degree 6
Node 4: degree 4
Node 11: degree 3
Node 15: degree 3
Node 13: degree 5
Node 16: degree 5

To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will take into consideration only the necessary edges based on the sorting above. This ensures efficient counting of triangles.

By counting the triangles, we find:
Total number of triangles: [12]

Here are the unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 18>
<0, 5, 18>
<0, 6, 19>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 7, 16>
<2, 5, 18>
<3, 8, 16>
<3, 9, 2>
<3, 13, 15>
<13, 15, 11>
<16, 4, 13>
