Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 5) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 12) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 2) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (5, 16) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (4, 10) (18, 10) (18, 9) (18, 3) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 0) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 9) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 2) (9, 14) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (15, 11) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 3) (2, 10) (2, 7) (3, 16) (3, 18) (3, 12) (0, 5) (0, 19) 

Response:
The graph representation of the given information is as follows:

Nodes: 20 (0, 1, 2, ..., 19)

Edges:
(11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 15)
(16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 5)
(14, 9) (14, 19)
(17, 12)
(10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 2)
(8, 13) (8, 6)
(13, 5)
(5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0)
(6, 1)
(18, 9) (18, 3)
(19, 0)
(1, 9)
(7, 2)
(9, 12)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes by degree:
0: 2
1: 2
2: 2
3: 3
4: 2
5: 4
6: 3
7: 3
8: 4
9: 5
10: 4
11: 3
12: 4
13: 3
14: 3
15: 1
16: 4
17: 1
18: 3
19: 3

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles. 

[Total number of triangles: 4]

<5, 6, 1>
<5, 9, 12>
<4, 10, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
