Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 14) (3, 14) (3, 12) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 4) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 6) (7, 11) (12, 3) (12, 17) (2, 8) (2, 17) (8, 15) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (19, 5) (19, 13) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 14) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 4) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 16) (13, 15) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 19) (4, 15) (4, 16) (4, 6) (4, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6)

Now, we will count the number of triangles by going through each edge and finding shared connections:

1. Edge (5, 9): Shared connections with vertices 5 and 9 are {14}. Therefore, one triangle <5, 9, 14>.
2. Edge (5, 19): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (5, 0): Shared connections with vertices 5 and 0 are {}. No triangles formed.
4. Edge (9, 18): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (9, 14): Shared connections with vertices 9 and 14 are {3}. One triangle <9, 14, 3>.
6. Edge (3, 14): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (3, 12): No triangles formed.
8. Edge (15, 8): Shared connections with vertices 15 and 8 are {4}. One triangle <15, 8, 4>.
9. Edge (15, 13): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (10, 13): Shared connections with vertices 10 and 13 are {11}. One triangle <10, 13, 11>.
11. Edge (10, 16): Shared connections with vertices 10 and 16 are {}. No triangles formed.
12. Edge (11, 7): No triangles formed.
13. Edge (11, 18): Shared connections with vertices 11 and 18 are {14}. One triangle <11, 18, 14>.
14. Edge (11, 13): Shared connections with vertices 11 and 13 are {15}. One triangle <11, 13, 15>.
15. Edge (11, 6): Shared connections with vertices 11 and 6 are {1}. One triangle <11, 6, 1>.
16. Edge (7, 11): No triangles formed.
17. Edge (12, 3): No triangles formed.
18. Edge (12, 17): No triangles formed.
19. Edge (2, 8): No triangles formed.
20. Edge (2, 17): No triangles formed.
21. Edge (8, 15): Shared connections with vertices 8 and 15 are {4}. One triangle <8, 15, 4>.
22. Edge (8, 2): No triangles formed.
23. Edge (8, 14): Shared connections with vertices 8 and 14 are {}. No triangles formed.
24. Edge (8, 1): No triangles formed.
25. Edge (19, 5): No triangles formed.
26. Edge (19, 13): No triangles formed.
27. Edge (16, 10): Shared connections with vertices 16 and 10 are {}. No triangles formed.
28. Edge (16, 17): No triangles formed.

33. Edge (6, 4): Shared connections with vertices 6 and 4 are {14}. One triangle <6, 4, 14>.
34. Edge (6, 0): No triangles formed.

The total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <5, 9, 14>, <9, 14, 3>, <15, 8, 4>, <10, 13, 11>, <11, 18, 14>, <11, 13, 15>, <11, 6, 1>, <16, 6, 1>, <6, 4, 14>.
