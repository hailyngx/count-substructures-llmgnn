Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 15) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 18) (9, 2) (9, 7) (3, 4) (7, 9) (7, 10) (6, 14) (6, 19) (6, 4) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 11) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 18) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 12) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 16) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 1) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 6) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 18) (15, 5) (15, 13) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 0) (16, 14) (16, 10) (12, 19) (12, 1) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 11) (18, 0) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
   Vertices: 2, 16, 3, 7, 12, 9, 1, 19, 0, 13, 17, 11, 6, 4, 10, 14, 18, 8, 15, 5

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   2 -> 0, 16 -> 1, 3 -> 2, 7 -> 3, 12 -> 4, 9 -> 5, 1 -> 6, 19 -> 7, 0 -> 8, 13 -> 9, 17 -> 10, 11 -> 11, 6 -> 12, 4 -> 13, 10 -> 14, 14 -> 15, 18 -> 16, 8 -> 17, 15 -> 18, 5 -> 19

3. Count the triangles:
   Total number of triangles: [6]
   
   Unique triangles:
   <1, 5, 7>
   <1, 7, 12>
   <10, 11, 14>
   <11, 13, 18>
   <16, 17, 18>
   <5, 8, 15>
