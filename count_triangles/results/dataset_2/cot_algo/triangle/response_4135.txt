Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 28) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 12) (22, 25) (3, 5) (15, 23) (15, 7) (15, 14) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 29) (4, 26) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 6) (28, 13) (28, 29) (28, 10) (28, 23) (29, 4) (29, 28) (29, 10) (0, 20) (0, 18) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 23) (20, 11) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 10) (2, 25) (18, 0) (18, 2) (18, 27) (18, 24) (18, 17) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (26, 4) (26, 20) (26, 14) (9, 22) (9, 1) (9, 27) (17, 18) (17, 6) (27, 18) (27, 9) (27, 19) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 2) (19, 27) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 6) (16, 24) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 19) (14, 15) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 19) (12, 22) (12, 10) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 23) (23, 15) (23, 28) (23, 20) (23, 24) (7, 15) (7, 1) (7, 5) (25, 22) (25, 2) (10, 28) (10, 29) (10, 2) (10, 12) (11, 20) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method proceeds as follows:

1. Sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections):
    - Node 13 has 2 connections
    - Node 1 has 3 connections
    - Node 5 has 3 connections
    - Node 11 has 3 connections
    - Node 16 has 3 connections
    - Node 17 has 3 connections
    - Node 3 has 3 connections
    - Node 7 has 3 connections
    - Node 12 has 3 connections
    - Node 18 has 5 connections
    - Node 27 has 3 connections
    - Node 8 has 4 connections
    - Node 6 has 4 connections
    - Node 0 has 4 connections
    - Node 20 has 4 connections
    - Node 4 has 6 connections
    - Node 2 has 6 connections
    - Node 26 has 4 connections
    - Node 9 has 3 connections
    - Node 28 has 5 connections
    - Node 29 has 4 connections
    - Node 24 has 3 connections
    - Node 19 has 5 connections
    - Node 25 has 2 connections
    - Node 15 has 4 connections
    - Node 10 has 4 connections
    - Node 14 has 4 connections
    - Node 22 has 5 connections

2. Relabel the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:
    - Node 13 -> Node 0
    - Node 1 -> Node 1
    - Node 5 -> Node 2
    - Node 11 -> Node 3
    - Node 16 -> Node 4
    - Node 17 -> Node 5
    - Node 3 -> Node 6
    - Node 7 -> Node 7
    - Node 12 -> Node 8
    - Node 18 -> Node 9
    - Node 27 -> Node 10
    - Node 8 -> Node 11
    - Node 6 -> Node 12
    - Node 0 -> Node 13
    - Node 20 -> Node 14
    - Node 4 -> Node 15
    - Node 2 -> Node 16
    - Node 26 -> Node 17
    - Node 9 -> Node 18
    - Node 28 -> Node 19
    - Node 29 -> Node 20
    - Node 24 -> Node 21
    - Node 19 -> Node 22
    - Node 25 -> Node 23
    - Node 15 -> Node 24
    - Node 10 -> Node 25
    - Node 14 -> Node 26
    - Node 22 -> Node 27

3. Calculate the number of triangles:
    Based on the sorted nodes, count the triangles formed by shared connections:
    - Triangles: [152]
    - Unique triangles: <0, 15, 26>, <0, 18, 2>, <0, 18, 27>, <0, 20, 23>, <0, 20, 26>, <1, 6, 19>, <1, 7, 5>, <2, 10, 28>, <2, 14, 8>, <2, 19, 5>, <2, 19, 27>, <4, 14, 19>, <4, 14, 26>, <4, 14, 8>, <4, 26, 20>, <5, 19, 27>, <8, 14, 26>, <8, 14, 19>, <10, 12, 22>, <10, 28, 23>, <10, 29, 28>, <11, 20, 26>, <12, 10, 28>, <15, 7, 5>, <15, 14, 19>, <15, 23, 28>, <18, 0, 20>, <18, 2, 19>, <18, 2, 27>, <18, 17, 6>, <18, 24, 23>
