Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. The relabeling process is as follows:

Node 5: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 0: 7 connections
Node 9: 8 connections

Using this relabeling, the edges to consider are:
(5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 2) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 6) (6, 2) (1, 0) (3, 0) (8, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 3)

Now, we will count the triangles and output the results:

Number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 8, 3>, <2, 3, 6>
