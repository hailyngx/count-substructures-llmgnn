Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: 4, 1, 8, 6
- 1: 9, 7, 3, 6, 0
- 2: 7, 6
- 3: 9, 4, 1, 6
- 4: 7, 0, 3
- 5: 9, 6, 8
- 6: 5, 1, 3, 8, 2, 0
- 7: 9, 4, 2, 1
- 8: 5, 9, 0, 6
- 9: 5, 8, 3, 1, 7

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by their degrees in increasing order:
0 -> 4 edges
2 -> 2 edges
5 -> 3 edges
8 -> 4 edges
7 -> 4 edges
4 -> 4 edges
3 -> 4 edges
1 -> 5 edges
6 -> 6 edges
9 -> 5 edges

Now, we will consider each edge and count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 4): No triangle
- Edge (2, 6): No triangle

By counting the triangles in this manner, we find that the total number of triangles is [5]. 

The unique triangles found are:
- <1, 3, 9>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <0, 6, 8>
