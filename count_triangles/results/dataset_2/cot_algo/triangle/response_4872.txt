Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees from least to most connected. Then, we assign new labels to the vertices starting from 0 for the least connected vertex.

Given the edges: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 0), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (1, 9), (1, 2), (1, 0), (1, 7), (3, 7), (3, 5), (3, 8), (4, 6), (4, 9), (8, 3), (8, 5), (5, 6), (5, 3), (5, 8), (5, 2), (5, 0), (5, 7), (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 5), (0, 6), (0, 9), (0, 1), (0, 5), (7, 6), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 5).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices with their respective degrees are:

(3: 3), (8: 2), (4: 2), (7: 3), (1: 3), (0: 3), (2: 4), (9: 4), (5: 6), (6: 7).

Now, let's count the number of triangles present in the graph. 

The total number of triangles is [27].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 9>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
