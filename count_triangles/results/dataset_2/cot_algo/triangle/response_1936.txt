Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 19) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 17) (17, 11) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 18) (18, 1) (18, 4) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 2) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 6) (12, 15) (12, 16) (6, 19) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 16) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 16) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 13) (0, 9) (0, 15) (0, 2) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph goes as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections (degree):
   - Node 1: 4 connections
   - Node 3: 4 connections
   - Node 7: 2 connections
   - Node 11: 2 connections
   - Node 19: 4 connections
   - Node 6: 2 connections
   - Node 8: 2 connections
   - Node 12: 2 connections
   - Node 10: 2 connections
   - Node 17: 2 connections
   - Node 18: 3 connections
   - Node 13: 4 connections
   - Node 4: 3 connections
   - Node 14: 3 connections
   - Node 0: 3 connections
   - Node 15: 5 connections
   - Node 2: 4 connections
   - Node 5: 5 connections
   - Node 9: 3 connections
   - Node 16: 4 connections

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   - Node 1: 0
   - Node 3: 1
   - Node 7: 2
   - Node 11: 3
   - Node 19: 4
   - Node 6: 5
   - Node 8: 6
   - Node 12: 7
   - Node 10: 8
   - Node 17: 9
   - Node 18: 10
   - Node 13: 11
   - Node 4: 12
   - Node 14: 13
   - Node 0: 14
   - Node 15: 15
   - Node 2: 16
   - Node 5: 17
   - Node 9: 18
   - Node 16: 19

3. Count the triangles:
   - Triangles: [233]
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 233.
