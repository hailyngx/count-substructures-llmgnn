Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 14) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 3) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 10) (1, 7) (1, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The vertices are then relabeled based on this order. 

The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is: <1, 8, 1, 8, 1, 1, 4, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 0>

Now, let's count the triangles in the graph:

1. For the edge (1, 7):
   - Vertex 1 has 1 connection and vertex 7 has 5 connections.
   - Proceed because vertex 1 has fewer connections.
   - Check for shared connections between 1 and 7: Shared connections with 7 are 3 and 9.
   - Formed triangle: <1, 3, 7>

2. For the edge (8, 7):
   - Vertex 8 has 4 connections and vertex 7 has 5 connections.
   - Proceed because vertex 8 has fewer connections.
   - Check for shared connections between 8 and 7: Shared connection with 7 is 1.
   - Formed triangle: <1, 7, 8>

3. For the edge (1, 9):
   - Vertex 1 has 1 connection and vertex 9 has 4 connections.
   - Proceed because vertex 1 has fewer connections.
   - Check for shared connections between 1 and 9: Shared connection with 9 is 3.
   - Formed triangle: <1, 3, 9>

There are no more valid edges to consider.
  
The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are: <1, 3, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 3, 9>.
