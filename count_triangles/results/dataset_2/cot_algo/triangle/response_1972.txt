Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 2) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 14) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 15 nodes and the given 60 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 11), (5, 14), (9, 5), (9, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 10), (1, 13), (1, 0), (1, 8), (3, 1), (3, 11), (3, 7), (3, 14), (3, 4), (8, 1), (8, 13), (8, 14), (8, 6), (8, 7), (13, 1), (13, 8), (13, 12), (13, 4), (13, 0), (10, 1), (10, 12), (10, 2), (11, 5), (11, 3), (11, 7), (11, 0), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 14), (6, 2), (4, 3), (4, 13), (4, 0), (12, 13), (12, 10), (12, 2), (2, 9), (2, 10), (2, 6), (2, 12), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 11), (7, 14), (14, 5), (14, 3), (14, 8), (14, 6), (14, 7), (0, 1), (0, 13), (0, 11), (0, 4)

Next, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices in increasing order of degrees: {5, 4, 9, 7, 12, 0, 2, 10, 6, 11, 13, 14, 8, 3, 1}

Now, we will count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles: 
<3, 4, 13>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 13>
<2, 6, 12>
<3, 7, 14>
<3, 11, 7>
