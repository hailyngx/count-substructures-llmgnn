Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 18) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 7) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 16) (13, 8) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 4) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 12) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 6) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 12) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 4) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 1) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 18) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the nodes by their number of connections. The sorted vertices are numbered as follows based on their degrees:

Node 16 (degree 3)  
Node 8 (degree 3)  
Node 10 (degree 3)  
Node 0 (degree 3)  
Node 6 (degree 3)  
Node 2 (degree 3)  
Node 5 (degree 2)  
Node 1 (degree 2)  
Node 12 (degree 2)  
Node 14 (degree 2)  
Node 17 (degree 2)  
Node 18 (degree 2)  
Node 7 (degree 4)  
Node 15 (degree 3)  
Node 13 (degree 2)  
Node 19 (degree 4)  
Node 4 (degree 4)  
Node 9 (degree 4)  
Node 3 (degree 4)  
Node 11 (degree 4)  

By considering only the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections than the higher labeled vertex, the triangles formed by shared connections are as follows:
