Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 20) (3, 16) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 16) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 25) (7, 16) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 20) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 23) (17, 0) (17, 11) (12, 27) (12, 29) (12, 22) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 14) (27, 26) (27, 6) (9, 4) (9, 22) (22, 12) (22, 9) (18, 3) (18, 26) (18, 21) (18, 29) (26, 27) (26, 18) (26, 23) (26, 11) (25, 7) (25, 0) (25, 14) (25, 2) (19, 4) (0, 17) (0, 25) (0, 16) (16, 3) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 1) (6, 27) (6, 20) (23, 10) (23, 26) (2, 4) (2, 25) (2, 5) (2, 14) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 14) (1, 7) (1, 16) (1, 11) (11, 8) (11, 17) (11, 26) (11, 1) (21, 27) (21, 18) (29, 12) (29, 18) (20, 3) (20, 13) (20, 6) (14, 27) (14, 25) (14, 2) (14, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we will first sort the vertices by their degrees in increasing order:    

Nodes sorted by degree:
17 -> 1 connection
29 -> 1 connection
8 -> 2 connections
0 -> 3 connections
12 -> 3 connections
19 -> 3 connections
21 -> 3 connections
23 -> 3 connections
24 -> 3 connections
28 -> 3 connections
18 -> 4 connections
22 -> 4 connections
7 -> 4 connections
9 -> 4 connections
10 -> 4 connections
13 -> 4 connections
3 -> 5 connections
4 -> 5 connections
6 -> 5 connections
26 -> 5 connections
5 -> 6 connections
14 -> 6 connections
15 -> 6 connections
25 -> 6 connections
1 -> 7 connections
11 -> 7 connections
16 -> 7 connections
2 -> 8 connections
27 -> 8 connections

Next, we will identify the triangles based on the connections between the vertices with lower labels and the shared connections. 

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is 34. 

Unique triangles found:
