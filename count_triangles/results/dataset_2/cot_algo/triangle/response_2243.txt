Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (13, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 14) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 4) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

First, we need to list the nodes with their degrees (number of connections):
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 6
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 1
- Node 14: degree 2

Now, let's relabel the nodes in increasing order of degree:
- Node 13 (degree 1)
- Node 0 (degree 2)
- Node 14 (degree 2)
- Node 10 (degree 3)
- Node 2 (degree 3)
- Node 4 (degree 4)
- Node 12 (degree 4)
- Node 6 (degree 4)
- Node 9 (degree 5)
- Node 1 (degree 5)
- Node 3 (degree 5)
- Node 5 (degree 5)
- Node 7 (degree 5)
- Node 8 (degree 5)
- Node 11 (degree 6)

Now, let's find the triangles based on the sorted order:
- (1, 10, 11) form a triangle
- (1, 10, 2) form a triangle
- (1, 10, 4) form a triangle
- (1, 12, 4) form a triangle
- (1, 12, 0) form a triangle
- (1, 12, 8) form a triangle
- (1, 12, 11) form a triangle
- (1, 0, 5) form a triangle
- (1, 4, 5) form a triangle
- (1, 3, 5) form a triangle
- (1, 7, 5) form a triangle
- (1, 8, 5) form a triangle
- (10, 2, 9) form a triangle
- (10, 7, 11) form a triangle
- (2, 9, 14) form a triangle
- (4, 5, 11) form a triangle
- (4, 3, 11) form a triangle
- (3, 5, 11) form a triangle
- (3, 4, 11) form a triangle
- (5, 7, 11) form a triangle
- (5, 7, 8) form a triangle

The total number of triangles is 21.

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 10, 11>
<1, 10, 2>
<1, 10, 4>
<1, 12, 4>
<1, 12, 0>
<1, 12, 8>
<1, 12, 11>
<1, 0, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 7, 5>
<1, 8, 5>
<10, 2, 9>
<10, 7, 11>
<2, 9, 14>
<4, 5, 11>
<4, 3, 11>
<3, 5, 11>
<3, 4, 11>
<5, 7, 11>
<5, 7, 8>
