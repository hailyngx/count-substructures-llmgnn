Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 10) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 5) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 5) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we need to first identify the vertices with their corresponding degrees:

Vertices: 
0 -> Degree: 3 
1 -> Degree: 3 
2 -> Degree: 4 
3 -> Degree: 3 
4 -> Degree: 4 
5 -> Degree: 5 
6 -> Degree: 2 
7 -> Degree: 4 
8 -> Degree: 5 
9 -> Degree: 5 
10 -> Degree: 3 
11 -> Degree: 3 
12 -> Degree: 4 
13 -> Degree: 5 
14 -> Degree: 5 

Next, we sort the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:

Sorted vertices: 
6, 11, 10, 0, 1, 3, 7, 4, 12, 2, 8, 13, 14, 5, 9

Now, we will check for triangles by examining the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

Triangles: 
<12, 1, 8> 
<12, 5, 0> 
<7, 4, 8> 
<7, 8, 9> 
<5, 0, 14> 
<5, 4, 2> 
<5, 10, 14> 
<13, 1, 8> 
<13, 1, 3> 
<13, 1, 5> 
<13, 3, 7> 
<13, 3, 10> 
<13, 2, 4> 
<13, 2, 8> 
<13, 2, 9> 
<13, 2, 13> 
<13, 2, 14> 
<13, 4, 8> 
<13, 4, 7> 
<13, 5, 10> 
<13, 5, 14> 
<13, 9, 14> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [21].
