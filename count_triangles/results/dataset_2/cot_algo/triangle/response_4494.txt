Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 
Node 9 - Degree 4
Node 8 - Degree 2
Node 0 - Degree 3
Node 6 - Degree 4
Node 5 - Degree 3
Node 3 - Degree 4
Node 7 - Degree 5
Node 1 - Degree 5
Node 2 - Degree 4
Node 4 - Degree 6
