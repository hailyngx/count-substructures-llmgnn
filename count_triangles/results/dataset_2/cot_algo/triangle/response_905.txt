Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on their degree and then checking for triangles in a specific order. 

After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for each node are:
Node 0 - Degree 3
Node 1 - Degree 5
Node 2 - Degree 4
Node 3 - Degree 3
Node 4 - Degree 2
Node 5 - Degree 4
Node 6 - Degree 5
Node 7 - Degree 5
Node 8 - Degree 3
Node 9 - Degree 5

Based on the edges provided, we need to follow the process for counting triangles. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 9, 7>
<1, 9, 8>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
