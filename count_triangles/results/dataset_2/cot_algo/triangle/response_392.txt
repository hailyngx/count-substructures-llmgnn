Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
Constructing the graph with the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 3), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 2), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 1), (3, 6), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 6), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 8), (2, 7), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 0), (0, 9), (0, 7), (0, 2)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes: 2(4), 1(3), 0(3), 6(3), 8(3), 5(3), 4(5), 7(5), 3(6), 9(6)

Now, we'll count the triangles:
Triangles:

<0, 2, 4> 
<0, 2, 7> 
<0, 3, 4> 
<0, 3, 7> 
<0, 4, 7> 
<1, 2, 4> 
<1, 2, 7> 
<1, 3, 4> 
<1, 4, 7> 
<2, 7, 8> 
<3, 4, 6> 
<3, 4, 7> 
<3, 4, 9> 
<3, 6, 8> 
<4, 7, 9> 
<5, 7, 9> 
<6, 7, 9>
