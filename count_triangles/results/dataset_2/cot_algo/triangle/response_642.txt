Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 5) (22, 7) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 11) (5, 22) (5, 28) (5, 7) (9, 21) (9, 11) (28, 5) (28, 18) (29, 6) (29, 14) (29, 24) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 23) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 26) (6, 29) (6, 19) (6, 4) (26, 22) (26, 8) (26, 14) (26, 17) (18, 28) (18, 21) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 17) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 29) (14, 26) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 4) (12, 24) (12, 25) (17, 26) (17, 19) (17, 23) (25, 12) (25, 27) (25, 0) (27, 13) (27, 25) (27, 10) (27, 20) (7, 22) (7, 5) (7, 19) (7, 20) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 0) (20, 27) (20, 7) (0, 25) (0, 11) (0, 21) (0, 23) (21, 9) (21, 18) (21, 0) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 23) (16, 1) (10, 8) (10, 27) (24, 29) (24, 12) (23, 2) (23, 17) (23, 0) (23, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then relabeling the vertices accordingly. 

After sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order and relabeling them, we have the following list of vertices with their corresponding degrees:

Vertex 16: Degree 1
Vertex 18: Degree 2
Vertex 9: Degree 2
Vertex 16: Degree 3
Vertex 1: Degree 3
Vertex 10: Degree 3
Vertex 28: Degree 3
Vertex 29: Degree 3
Vertex 25: Degree 3
Vertex 2: Degree 3
Vertex 12: Degree 3
Vertex 27: Degree 4
Vertex 6: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 4
Vertex 0: Degree 4
Vertex 4: Degree 4
Vertex 24: Degree 4
Vertex 21: Degree 4
Vertex 5: Degree 4
Vertex 7: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 4
Vertex 19: Degree 4
Vertex 17: Degree 4
Vertex 22: Degree 4
Vertex 11: Degree 4
Vertex 26: Degree 4
Vertex 14: Degree 5
Vertex 20: Degree 5
Vertex 23: Degree 5
Vertex 15: Degree 5
Vertex 13: Degree 5

For each edge, we will only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

By analyzing the shared connections between the two vertices of each edge, we can count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [124].

Here are some unique triangles found:
