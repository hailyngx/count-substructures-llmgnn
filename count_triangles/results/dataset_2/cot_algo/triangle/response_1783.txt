Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 8) (13, 12) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 12) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices according to their number of connections in ascending order. The sorted list of vertices is as follows:
Node 13 (Degree 1)
Node 11 (Degree 2)
Node 5 (Degree 4)
Node 9 (Degree 4)
Node 3 (Degree 4)
Node 7 (Degree 4)
Node 1 (Degree 5)
Node 6 (Degree 5)
Node 14 (Degree 5)
Node 8 (Degree 5)
Node 2 (Degree 5)
Node 12 (Degree 6)
Node 0 (Degree 6)
Node 4 (Degree 6)
Node 10 (Degree 6)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

After checking the edges following this method, we find the total number of triangles within this graph to be [14]. 

The unique triangles found are as follows:
<0, 8, 14>
<1, 6, 12>
<2, 6, 12>
<2, 8, 14>
<2, 10, 12>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 10>
<1, 2, 12>
<1, 7, 12>
<3, 6, 11>
<4, 7, 14>
<5, 9, 10>
<5, 9, 4>
<7, 9, 10>
