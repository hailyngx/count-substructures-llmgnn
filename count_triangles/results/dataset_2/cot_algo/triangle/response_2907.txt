Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with nodes and edges based on the information provided:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 0), (5, 10), (9, 6), (9, 1), (9, 13), (9, 12), (6, 12), (6, 0), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 14), (3, 0), (10, 12), (11, 2), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 14), (4, 2), (7, 13), (8, 12), (2, 11), (2, 14), (12, 13)

Since we want to use Degree-Based Ordering to count triangles, let's label the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):

Nodes sorted by degree:
11, 3, 7, 10, 0, 14, 5, 6, 1, 13, 2, 4, 8, 9, 12

Now, let's count the triangles by considering the ordered nodes and the given edges. 

There are a total of [11] triangles in this graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 7, 13>
