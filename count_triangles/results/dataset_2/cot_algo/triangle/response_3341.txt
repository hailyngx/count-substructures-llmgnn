Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 13) (17, 18) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 12) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (0, 8) (7, 5) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 12) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 16) (15, 14) (15, 12) (15, 4) (19, 13) (19, 10) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 10) (6, 13) (6, 12) (11, 18) (11, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 15) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 5) (10, 16) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 10) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following connections:
Node 0: 8
Node 1: 3, 8, 12
Node 2: 4, 8, 10, 16
Node 3: 1, 12
Node 4: 2, 9, 14, 15
Node 5: 7, 10, 11
Node 6: 12, 13
Node 7: 5
Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 10
Node 9: 2, 4, 12, 16
Node 10: 2, 5, 8, 10, 19
Node 11: 5, 18
Node 12: 1, 3, 6, 9, 15
Node 13: 6, 14, 17, 19
Node 14: 4, 13, 15
Node 15: 4, 12, 14
Node 16: 2, 9, 10, 18
Node 17: 13, 18
Node 18: 11, 13, 16, 17
Node 19: 10, 13

By Degree-Based Ordering, let's relabel the nodes from least to most connections:
Node 0 -> A
Node 7 -> B
Node 1 -> C
Node 3 -> D
Node 5 -> E
Node 6 -> F
Node 4 -> G
Node 9 -> H
Node 8 -> I
Node 11 -> J
Node 2 -> K
Node 10 -> L
Node 12 -> M
Node 13 -> N
Node 15 -> O
Node 14 -> P
Node 16 -> Q
Node 18 -> R
Node 17 -> S
Node 19 -> T

Counting the triangles, we find: 
Total number of triangles: [12]
Unique triangles: <E, K, I>, <E, K, R>, <E, K, L>, <E, R, J>, <E, R, L>, <E, R, Q>, <E, L, Q>, <F, O, M>, <I, O, P>, <K, P, G>, <K, N, G>, <R, N, S>
