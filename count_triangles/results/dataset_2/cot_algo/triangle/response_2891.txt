Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 8) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 17) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (18, 4) (18, 15) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 19) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 10) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 15) (15, 18) (15, 1) (9, 11) (9, 17) (19, 0) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 3) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 3) (7, 5) (7, 10) (2, 11) (2, 17) 

Response:
The graph given can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

(2, 17)

After sorting the nodes by their degree from least to most connections, the new labeling is as follows:

Nodes: 2, 7, 9, 1, 5, 19, 15, 18, 16, 4, 6, 0, 12, 3, 8, 10, 14, 17, 13, 11

Now, focusing on edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we identify the shared connections to count the triangles.

Number of triangles []: 8

Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 6, 10>
<0, 6, 14>
<3, 8, 10>
<4, 13, 17>
<5, 6, 10>
<5, 6, 14>
<10, 12, 17>
