Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 13) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (11, 12) (11, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree from least to most:
   Vertex 3 (degree 2)
   Vertex 6 (degree 2)
   Vertex 11 (degree 2)
   Vertex 2 (degree 3)
   Vertex 10 (degree 4)
   Vertex 1 (degree 4)
   Vertex 15 (degree 4)
   Vertex 5 (degree 5)
   Vertex 0 (degree 5)
   Vertex 13 (degree 5)
   Vertex 14 (degree 5)
   Vertex 12 (degree 6)
   Vertex 7 (degree 6)
   Vertex 8 (degree 6)
   Vertex 9 (degree 6)

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   Vertex 3 -> 0
   Vertex 6 -> 1
   Vertex 11 -> 2
   Vertex 2 -> 3
   Vertex 10 -> 4
   Vertex 1 -> 5
   Vertex 15 -> 6
   Vertex 5 -> 7
   Vertex 0 -> 8
   Vertex 13 -> 9
   Vertex 14 -> 10
   Vertex 12 -> 11
   Vertex 7 -> 12
   Vertex 8 -> 13
   Vertex 9 -> 14

3. Count triangles by considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
   - Triangles: <2, 9, 10>, <2, 9, 13>, <2, 9, 14>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 10>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 12>, <5, 7, 14>, <5, 8, 13>, <5, 8, 14>, <5, 10, 12>, <5, 10, 14>, <5, 12, 14>, <7, 8, 13>, <8, 9, 13>, <8, 9, 14>, <9, 12, 14>, <10, 12, 14>

   - Total number of triangles: [18]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 18.
