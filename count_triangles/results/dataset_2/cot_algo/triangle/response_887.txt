Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 15) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 3) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 17) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (15, 13) (15, 0) (15, 10) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 15) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 12) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 18) (17, 4) (17, 0) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 16) (19, 2) (19, 14) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 11) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 16) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 14) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their connections based on the provided edges:

0: 7, 15, 17
1: 6, 9, 8, 11
2: 10, 19, 16
3: 6, 9, 18
4: 8, 18, 16, 17
5: 8, 12, 10
6: 1, 3, 8
7: 0
8: 6, 4, 5, 1
9: 10, 3, 1, 12
10: 9, 5, 15, 2
11: 1, 12
12: 9, 13, 5, 11
13: 12, 15
14: 18, 19, 16
15: 13, 0, 10
16: 4, 2, 14
17: 4, 0
18: 4, 14, 3
19: 2, 14

After sorting the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order, we get:
7 < 11 < 19 < 0 < 2 < 3 < 6 < 13 < 16 < 10 < 5 < 12 < 1 < 18 < 4 < 14 < 17 < 9 < 8 < 15

Following the method of counting triangles using Degree-Based Ordering, we count the number of triangles and list the unique triangles found:
Total number of triangles: [20]

Unique triangles:
<0, 15, 17>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 9, 11>
<1, 12, 9>
<2, 10, 15>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 5>
<4, 16, 18>
<5, 10, 12>
<4, 14, 16>
<9, 10, 5>
<10, 15, 13>
<12, 11, 1>
<14, 18, 4>
<14, 19, 16>
<16, 2, 4>
<16, 14, 18>
<16, 19, 2>
<18, 3, 6>
<18, 14, 19>
