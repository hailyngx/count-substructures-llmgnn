Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 11) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 6) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 11), (0, 13), (0, 14)
(1, 3), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 10)
(2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 11), (2, 13)
(3, 10), (3, 12)
(4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 10)
(5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 14)
(6, 8), (6, 11)
(7, 8), (7, 12), (7, 14)
(8, 11)
(9, 11), (9, 12), (9, 14)
(10, 1), (10, 3)
(11, 0)
(12, 3), (12, 7)
(13, 0), (13, 2)
(14, 0), (14, 5)

Now, let's find the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes sorted by the number of connections: 
0, 4, 6, 9, 13, 10, 12, 14, 7, 8, 11, 1, 3, 2, 5

Triangles:
[22]
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 10>, <0, 1, 14>, <0, 3, 10>, <0, 1, 13>, 
<1, 3, 10>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 10>, <1, 8, 10>, <7, 8, 10>,
<2, 3, 13>, <2, 5, 13>, <3, 10, 12>, <9, 11, 12>, <9, 11, 14>,
<12, 7, 14>, <4, 6, 10>, <1, 4, 10>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 13, 12>, 
<7, 10, 14>, <7, 12, 14>
