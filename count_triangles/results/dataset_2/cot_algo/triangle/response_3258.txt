Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 7) (12, 9) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 12) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, for each edge, we will check for shared connections to find triangles. 

The vertices and their degrees are as follows:
0: 4
3: 4
6: 3
12: 2
4: 3
7: 4
10: 3
13: 4
1: 5
8: 4
2: 5
5: 5
9: 4
11: 5
14: 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections than the other vertex.

Triangles found:

<8, 1, 5>
<11, 0, 7>
<11, 1, 7>
