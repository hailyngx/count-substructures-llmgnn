Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 14) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 1) (0, 13) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 14) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 9) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 1) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
(10, 11), (10, 6), (10, 7), (11, 1), (11, 13), (11, 8), (8, 13), (8, 5), (8, 12), (8, 7), (13, 2), (13, 9), (13, 0), (4, 12), (4, 5), (4, 14), (5, 3), (5, 14), (6, 2), (12, 1)

Now, we will sort the nodes by their degrees:
0 (degree 2), 3 (degree 2), 6 (degree 2), 9 (degree 3), 4 (degree 3), 10 (degree 3), 7 (degree 4), 12 (degree 4), 14 (degree 5), 1 (degree 5), 2 (degree 5), 13 (degree 5), 8 (degree 6), 5 (degree 6), 11 (degree 6)

We will now count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, considering only edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: <4, 5, 14>, <1, 2, 12>, <1, 2, 13>, <1, 7, 8>, <8, 12, 13>
