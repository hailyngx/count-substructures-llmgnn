Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 6) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 12) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order, we have the following relabeled nodes:
- Node 0 (Degree 3)
- Node 11 (Degree 2)
- Node 10 (Degree 4)
- Node 9 (Degree 4)
- Node 7 (Degree 4)
- Node 8 (Degree 2)
- Node 2 (Degree 2)
- Node 1 (Degree 4)
- Node 6 (Degree 5)
- Node 3 (Degree 5)
- Node 12 (Degree 4)
- Node 13 (Degree 6)
- Node 5 (Degree 6)
- Node 14 (Degree 4)
- Node 4 (Degree 4)

Based on the relabeled nodes and the given edges, we can count the triangles as follows:
- Triangle <0, 3, 13>
- Triangle <1, 6, 10>
- Triangle <1, 6, 13>
- Triangle <1, 10, 13>
- Triangle <3, 6, 13>
- Triangle <4, 6, 13>
- Triangle <4, 1, 6>
- Triangle <4, 1, 13>
- Triangle <5, 9, 13>
- Triangle <5, 9, 10>
- Triangle <5, 10, 13>
- Triangle <5, 4, 1>
- Triangle <5, 4, 6>
- Triangle <5, 4, 13>
- Triangle <5, 1, 6>
- Triangle <5, 1, 13>
- Triangle <5, 6, 10>
- Triangle <5, 6, 13>
- Triangle <6, 10, 13>
- Triangle <6, 13, 1>
- Triangle <6, 13, 4>
- Triangle <6, 13, 5>

The total number of triangles in the graph is 22. Therefore, the count of triangles is [22].
