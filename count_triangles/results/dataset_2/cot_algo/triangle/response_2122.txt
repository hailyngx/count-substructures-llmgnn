Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 20) (22, 13) (22, 10) (22, 3) (1, 23) (3, 22) (3, 12) (8, 15) (8, 25) (8, 7) (23, 1) (23, 4) (23, 9) (6, 28) (6, 19) (28, 6) (28, 11) (28, 10) (0, 17) (0, 18) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 21) (11, 28) (11, 9) (11, 12) (17, 0) (17, 20) (17, 26) (20, 13) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 19) (7, 8) (7, 18) (25, 13) (25, 8) (25, 26) (19, 6) (19, 20) (19, 18) (19, 4) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 12) (10, 22) (10, 28) (10, 26) (26, 17) (26, 20) (26, 25) (26, 10) (26, 27) (9, 23) (9, 11) (9, 27) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 24) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 21) (16, 2) (24, 2) (27, 26) (27, 9) (27, 29) (27, 21) (29, 27) (29, 15) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 29) (4, 23) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 21) (21, 14) (21, 5) (21, 27) (21, 4) (21, 12) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 21) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree (number of connections) are:
Node 16 has 1 connection
Nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 16, 17, 24, 29 have 2 connections
Nodes 3, 5, 10, 15, 18, 19, 22, 25, 28 have 3 connections
Nodes 4, 8, 9, 11, 13, 20, 21, 23, 26, 27 have 4 connections
Node 12 has 5 connections
Node 14 has 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we start from nodes with the least connections and work our way to nodes with more connections:
1. For nodes with 2 connections:
   - No triangles can be formed since both nodes have the same degree.

2. For nodes with 3 connections:
   - Node 18 is connected to nodes 12 and 4. No triangle can be formed since 12 and 4 do not have a direct connection.

3. For nodes with 4 connections:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 23, 14, 19, and 21. 
     - (4, 23) does not form a triangle with (23, 14) since they are not directly connected.
     - (4, 23) does not form a triangle with (23, 12) since they are not directly connected.
     - (4, 23) does not form a triangle with (23, 9) since they are not directly connected.
     - (4, 14) forms a triangle with (14, 21) where the shared connection is 21.
     - (4, 19) does not form a triangle with (19, 20) since they are not directly connected.
     - (4, 19) does not form a triangle with (19, 18) since they are not directly connected.
     - (4, 19) does not form a triangle with (19, 21) since they are not directly connected.
     - (4, 21) does not form a triangle with (21, 14) since they are not directly connected.
     
4. For nodes with 5 connections:
   - Node 12 is connected to nodes 3, 11, 18, 21, and 3. 
     - (12, 3) forms a triangle with (3, 22) where the shared connection is 3.
   
The total number of triangles found is [1] and the unique triangles are <12, 3, 22>.
