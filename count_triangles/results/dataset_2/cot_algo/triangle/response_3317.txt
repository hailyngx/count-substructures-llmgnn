Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 1) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 14) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 1) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 10) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
0: 4, 7, 11, 1
1: 0, 10, 12
2: 8, 12, 5, 13
3: 7, 8, 14
4: 6, 9, 7, 8, 0, 10
5: 2, 13, 12, 14
6: 9, 10, 11, 4
7: 4, 0, 3, 13
8: 4, 2, 14, 3
9: 6, 4, 10
10: 9, 4, 6, 12, 1
11: 6, 0, 12, 14
12: 2, 5, 10, 11, 1
13: 2, 5, 7
14: 8, 5, 11, 3
```

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices by their degrees:
```
1: 4
3: 4
5: 4
6: 4
9: 3
13: 3
8: 3
0: 3
2: 4
14: 4
10: 5
12: 5
11: 4
7: 4
4: 6
```

Now, counting triangles by examining the edges:
- Triangle: (10, 12, 1)
- Triangle: (0, 4, 7)
- Triangle: (0, 4, 11)
- Triangle: (0, 1, 12)
- Triangle: (2, 5, 13)
- Triangle: (3, 7, 13)
- Triangle: (3, 8, 14)
- Triangle: (4, 8, 14)
- Triangle: (6, 9, 10)
- Triangle: (6, 4, 9)
- Triangle: (11, 12, 14)

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [11]
```
Output: [11]
