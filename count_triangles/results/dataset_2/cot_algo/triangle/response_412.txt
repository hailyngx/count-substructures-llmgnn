Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows the steps below:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):
- Node 5 and Node 9 have 5 connections,
- Node 3 and Node 4 have 6 connections,
- Node 0, Node 2, and Node 8 have 4 connections,
- Node 1 and Node 6 and Node 7 have 3 connections.

2. Relabel the vertices from 0 to 9 accordingly:
- Node 5 → Node 0
- Node 9 → Node 1
- Node 3 → Node 2
- Node 4 → Node 3
- Node 0 → Node 4
- Node 2 → Node 5
- Node 8 → Node 6
- Node 1 → Node 7
- Node 6 → Node 8
- Node 7 → Node 9

3. Go through each edge in increasing order of the lower labeled vertex and count the triangles:
- For each edge, check for shared connections between the two vertices of the edge to find triangles.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [16]. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 7>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <5, 6, 8>.
