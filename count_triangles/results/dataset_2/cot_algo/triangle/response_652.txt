Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices from least connected to most connected is as follows:
Vertices: 5, 9, 6, 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 0

Using the degree-based ordering, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:
Number of triangles: [14]

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 2, 8>
<5, 2, 0>
<5, 1, 7>
<5, 1, 3>
<5, 1, 8>
<9, 2, 6>
<9, 2, 0>
<6, 2, 4>
<6, 2, 0>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 3>
<4, 6, 0>
<4, 6, 8>
<7, 1, 3>
