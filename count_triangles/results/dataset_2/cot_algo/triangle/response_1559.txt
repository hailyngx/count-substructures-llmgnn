Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles involves analyzing the number of connections each node has and sorting the nodes accordingly.

Let's assign labels to the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Node 9: Degree 2
- Node 1: Degree 2
- Node 9: Degree 2
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 1: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 8: Degree 5
- Node 7: Degree 6
- Node 4: Degree 6

Now, we will traverse the edges according to the labels.
When the lower labeled node has fewer connections, we check for shared connections to count triangles.
By doing so, we find that the total number of triangles is [6] in this graph.

The unique triangles found are:
- <2, 5, 8>
- <6, 7, 3>
- <4, 7, 2>
- <8, 9, 3>
- <5, 8, 0>
- <0, 4, 6>
