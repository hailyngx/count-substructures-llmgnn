Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 28) (1, 27) (21, 10) (21, 16) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 29) (12, 8) (12, 27) (12, 17) (12, 11) (27, 1) (27, 12) (28, 1) (28, 3) (28, 14) (29, 23) (29, 25) (29, 4) (26, 1) (26, 18) (26, 10) (26, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (22, 0) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 24) (13, 20) (13, 15) (18, 26) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 17) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 16) (3, 28) (3, 20) (3, 6) (6, 26) (6, 3) (6, 24) (24, 5) (24, 6) (24, 7) (16, 21) (16, 10) (16, 14) (11, 12) (11, 5) (0, 8) (0, 22) (0, 25) (2, 23) (2, 9) (2, 25) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 15) (14, 8) (14, 28) (14, 16) (14, 7) (4, 29) (4, 5) (4, 20) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 17) (20, 13) (20, 3) (20, 4) (20, 19) (7, 24) (7, 14) (19, 10) (19, 20) (25, 29) (25, 0) (25, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 28, 29
Edges: (1, 26), (1, 28), (1, 27), (21, 10), (21, 16), (8, 23), (8, 14), (8, 0), (8, 12), (23, 8), (23, 2), (23, 29), (12, 8), (12, 27), (12, 17), (12, 11), (27, 1), (27, 12), (28, 1), (28, 3), (28, 14), (29, 23), (29, 25), (29, 4), (26, 1), (26, 18), (26, 10), (26, 6), (9, 2), (9, 15), (22, 0), (5, 11), (5, 4), (5, 24), (13, 20), (13, 15), (18, 26), (18, 10), (18, 15), (18, 17), (10, 21), (10, 26), (10, 18), (10, 19), (10, 16), (3, 28), (3, 20), (3, 6), (6, 26), (6, 3), (6, 24), (24, 5), (24, 6), (24, 7), (16, 21), (16, 10), (16, 14), (11, 12), (11, 5), (0, 8), (0, 22), (0, 25), (2, 23), (2, 9), (2, 25), (17, 12), (17, 18), (17, 15), (14, 8), (14, 28), (14, 16), (14, 7), (4, 29), (4, 5), (4, 20), (15, 9), (15, 13), (15, 18), (15, 17), (20, 13), (20, 3), (20, 4), (20, 19), (7, 24), (7, 14), (19, 10), (19, 20), (25, 29), (25, 0), (25, 2)

Next, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices with their degrees:
0: 4
1: 3
2: 3
3: 4
4: 4
5: 3
6: 3
7: 2
8: 4
9: 2
10: 6
11: 3
12: 4
13: 2
14: 4
15: 4
16: 3
17: 3
18: 5
19: 2
20: 4
21: 2
22: 1
23: 3
24: 3
25: 3
26: 4
27: 3
28: 3
29: 4

Based on the degree-based ordering, the vertices in ascending order are:
22, 21, 19, 13, 9, 7, 1, 2, 5, 6, 23, 25, 3, 11, 16, 17, 27, 28, 0, 4, 8, 12, 14, 24, 29, 10, 15, 18, 20, 26

Now, we go through each edge and count the number of triangles. Count only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

<1, 26, 28>
<1, 26, 27>
<1, 27, 12>
<1, 27, 28>
<8, 23, 29>
<8, 12, 27>
<23, 12, 27>
<3, 6, 24>
<5, 11, 12>
<5, 11, 12>
<5, 4, 29>
<18, 26, 10>
<18, 26, 15>
<18, 26, 17>
<18, 26, 15>
<18, 26, 17>
<18, 10, 16>
<18, 10, 19>
<18, 10, 15>
<18, 10, 15>
<18, 17, 12>
<18, 17, 15>
<18, 17, 15>
<10, 21, 16>
<10, 16, 14>
<15, 9, 2>
<15, 13, 20>
<20, 4, 29>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [27].
