Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 12) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 5) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 11) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first:

Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 11), (0, 14)
(1, 3), (1, 10)
(2, 8), (2, 10), (2, 13)
(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 10), (3, 14)
(4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 13)
(5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 11), (5, 12), (5, 13), (5, 14)
(6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 12)
(7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 8), (7, 14)
(8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 12)
(9, 6), (9, 11), (9, 12)
(10, 1), (10, 2), (10, 3), (10, 6)
(11, 0), (11, 5), (11, 9), (11, 13)
(12, 5), (12, 6), (12, 8)
(13, 2), (13, 4), (13, 5), (13, 11)
(14, 0), (14, 3), (14, 5), (14, 7)

Now, let's relabel the vertices by their degree:
Node 1 has degree 1
Node 4 has degree 2
Nodes 2, 9, 10, 13 have degree 3
Nodes 0, 7, 11, 12, 14 have degree 4
Nodes 3, 5, 6, 8 have degree 5

Now we will count the triangles. 

Triangles:
<0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 14>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 14>, <0, 7, 14>, <3, 5, 14>, <4, 7, 8>, <5, 11, 13>, <5, 12, 13>, <8, 12, 6>

Total number of triangles: [10]
