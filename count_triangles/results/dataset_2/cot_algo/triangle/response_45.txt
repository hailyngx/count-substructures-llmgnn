Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 12) (26, 14) (26, 15) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 29) (5, 21) (5, 16) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 7) (2, 15) (29, 5) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 25) (4, 7) (4, 22) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (8, 16) (8, 21) (13, 12) (3, 7) (3, 25) (3, 17) (3, 6) (25, 29) (25, 3) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 20) (27, 12) (0, 28) (20, 29) (20, 12) (20, 11) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 24) (6, 1) (10, 11) (10, 23) (10, 28) (11, 4) (11, 20) (11, 10) (11, 18) (23, 10) (23, 15) (23, 16) (24, 6) (24, 17) (24, 28) (21, 5) (21, 8) (14, 26) (14, 4) (14, 28) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 1) (19, 2) (19, 18) (22, 4) (22, 28) (1, 6) (1, 18) (1, 16) (17, 3) (17, 24) (15, 26) (15, 2) (15, 23) (28, 0) (28, 10) (28, 24) (28, 14) (28, 22) (16, 5) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then relabel the vertices accordingly. 

After performing the sort and relabeling, the new list of edges becomes:
(0, 28) (28, 0)
(1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 18) (6, 1) (16, 1) (18, 1)
(2, 29) (29, 2)
(3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 25) (6, 3) (7, 3) (25, 3)
(4, 14) (4, 7) (14, 4) (7, 4)
(5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 21) (5, 16) (9, 5) (21, 5) (6, 5) (16, 5)
(8, 21) (21, 8) (8, 16) (16, 8)
(10, 11) (10, 23) (11, 10) (23, 10)
(11, 18) (18, 11)
(12, 9) (9, 12) (12, 13) (13, 12) (12, 20) (20, 12) (27, 12)
(14, 26) (26, 14) (14, 28) (28, 14)
(15, 23) (23, 15) (15, 26) (26, 15) (15, 2) (2, 15) (15, 23) (23, 15)
(17, 24) (24, 17) (17, 3) (3, 17)
(18, 19) (19, 18)
(19, 2) (2, 19) (19, 18) (18, 19)
(20, 29) (29, 20) (20, 12) (12, 20) (20, 11) (11, 20)
(22, 28) (28, 22) (22, 4) (4, 22)
(24, 6) (6, 24) (24, 17) (17, 24) (24, 28) (28, 24)
(25, 29) (29, 25) (25, 3) (3, 25)

From here, we can count the number of triangles formed in the graph. After calculating, the total number of triangles in the graph is 25.

[25] 

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<2, 15, 23> <1, 6, 16> <16, 8, 21> <2, 19, 18> <10, 11, 23> <12, 13, 20> <4, 7, 14> <3, 17, 24> <5, 6, 16> <11, 18, 19> <14, 26, 28> <9, 12, 20> <4, 22, 28> <9, 5, 21> <4, 7, 14> <6, 24, 17> <3, 25, 29> <2, 15, 23> <10, 23, 15> <11, 18, 19> <10, 28, 24> <5, 9, 21> <7, 3, 25> <6, 3, 17> <2, 19, 18>
