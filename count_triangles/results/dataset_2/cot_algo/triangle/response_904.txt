Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 0) (7, 9) (12, 0) (12, 6) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 2) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 13) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 18) (15, 14) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 14) (18, 16) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 17) (17, 3) (17, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 6) (6, 12) (6, 8) (14, 15) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 16) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 9) (13, 19) (13, 16) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. After relabeling the nodes accordingly, the sorted vertices are: 

Nodes: 7, 15, 17, 13, 10, 4, 6, 5, 12, 0, 3, 8, 18, 1, 16, 2, 14, 11, 9, 19 

Now, let's count the number of triangles by considering each edge and their shared connections:

Total number of triangles: [29]

Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 11>, <0, 3, 10>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 2>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 16>, <0, 8, 3>, <0, 8, 10>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 8, 16>, <0, 10, 8>, <0, 10, 18>, <0, 12, 6>, <0, 12, 4>, <2, 3, 17>, <2, 3, 11>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 16>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 5, 11>, <2, 5, 16>, <2, 5, 19>, <3, 8, 10>, <3, 11, 5>, <3, 11, 9>, <3, 11, 19>, <3, 17, 2>, <5, 11, 2>
