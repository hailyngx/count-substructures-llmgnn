Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 2) (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 4) (5, 3) (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 13) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 15) (14, 19) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 19) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15) (4, 1) (12, 17) (12, 19) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 10) (18, 16) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 10) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 8) (6, 11) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 12) 

Response:
- Vertices sorted by degree: 
    - Node 11: degree 5 
    - Node 16: degree 4 
    - Node 13: degree 4 
    - Node 5: degree 4 
    - Node 15: degree 3 
    - Node 8: degree 3 
    - Node 1: degree 3 
    - Node 4: degree 3 
    - Node 2: degree 3 
    - Node 9: degree 2 
    - Node 19: degree 2 
    - Node 0: degree 2 
    - Node 17: degree 2 
    - Node 7: degree 2 
    - Node 10: degree 2 
    - Node 3: degree 2 
    - Node 14: degree 2 
    - Node 18: degree 1 
    - Node 12: degree 2 
    - Node 6: degree 1 

Now, we will count the triangles by examining the edges:
- Triangles: <11, 4, 15>, <11, 4, 1>, <11, 13, 17>, <11, 13, 10>, <16, 2, 7>, <16, 2, 1>, <16, 17, 13>, <5, 1, 4>, <5, 1, 0>, <5, 1, 2>, <5, 8, 7>, <5, 8, 10>, <5, 8, 0>, <9, 13, 17>, <9, 13, 10>

[Total number of triangles: 15]
