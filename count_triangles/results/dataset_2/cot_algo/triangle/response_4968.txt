Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 0: Degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Start with the edge (5, 6) since node 5 has the lower label and fewer connections than node 6.
  This edge creates triangles with nodes 6, 5, and 9. <6, 5, 9>
- Proceed to the edge (5, 1) creating triangles <5, 1, 3> and <5, 1, 2>.
- Next, the edge (5, 3) forms a triangle with nodes 3, 5, and 1. <3, 5, 1>
- Continue with the edge (9, 6) creating a triangle <9, 6, 7>.
- The edge (9, 8) also forms a triangle <9, 8, 7>.
- Proceed to the edge (9, 7) creating a triangle <9, 7, 6>.
- The edge (9, 0) forms a triangle with nodes 9, 0, and 4. <9, 0, 4>
- Moving on to the edge (6, 7) creating a triangle <6, 7, 4>.
- The edge (6, 2) also forms a triangle <6, 2, 1>.
- Next, the edge (4, 7) creates a triangle with nodes 4, 7, and 8. <4, 7, 8>
- The edge (4, 8) forms a triangle <4, 8, 9>.
- Proceed to the edge (4, 0) creating a triangle <4, 0, 9>.
- Move on to the edge (7, 8) forming a triangle <7, 8, 9>.
- The edge (1, 3) also forms a triangle <1, 3, 5>.
- Next, the edge (1, 2) creates a triangle with nodes 1, 2, and 6. <1, 2, 6>.
- The edge (1, 0) forms a triangle <1, 0, 5>.
- Proceed to the edge (3, 2) creating a triangle <3, 2, 6>.
- The edge (8, 9) also forms a triangle <8, 9, 6>.
- Move on to the edge (8, 4) forming a triangle <8, 4, 7>.
- The edge (8, 7) creates a triangle with nodes 8, 7, and 6. <8, 7, 6>.
- Finally, the edge (8, 2) forms a triangle <8, 2, 1>.

Total number of triangles: [20]
