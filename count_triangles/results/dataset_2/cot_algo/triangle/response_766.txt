Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 21) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 17) (1, 29) (1, 23) (21, 11) (21, 23) (21, 2) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 26) (8, 6) (23, 1) (23, 21) (23, 9) (2, 21) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 24) (19, 26) (26, 3) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 15) (26, 4) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 4) (28, 17) (28, 10) (28, 15) (5, 26) (5, 13) (5, 22) (5, 4) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 20) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 20) (7, 27) (20, 13) (20, 7) (20, 27) (29, 1) (29, 25) (29, 22) (25, 29) (25, 27) (27, 7) (27, 20) (27, 25) (22, 5) (22, 29) (22, 17) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 28) (17, 22) (24, 18) (24, 4) (24, 15) (15, 26) (15, 28) (15, 24) (9, 11) (9, 23) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 28) (14, 18) (4, 26) (4, 6) (4, 5) (4, 24) (12, 11) (12, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their degree (number of connections). Let's label the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 2
Vertex 2: degree 4
Vertex 3: degree 3
Vertex 4: degree 5
Vertex 5: degree 4
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 2
Vertex 9: degree 4
Vertex 10: degree 3
Vertex 11: degree 4
Vertex 12: degree 2
Vertex 13: degree 3
Vertex 14: degree 1
Vertex 15: degree 3
Vertex 16: degree 3
Vertex 17: degree 4
Vertex 18: degree 3
Vertex 19: degree 1
Vertex 20: degree 3
Vertex 21: degree 3
Vertex 22: degree 3
Vertex 23: degree 3
Vertex 24: degree 3
Vertex 25: degree 2
Vertex 26: degree 5
Vertex 27: degree 3
Vertex 28: degree 3
Vertex 29: degree 3

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Number of triangles: [73]
