Response:
The given graph has the following edges:
- (2, 29), (29, 2), (29, 1), (29, 16), (29, 25), (29, 21), (18, 22), (18, 14), (18, 21), (18, 13), (22, 18), (22, 11), (22, 0), (23, 15), (23, 10), (23, 9), (12, 7), (12, 5), (12, 17), (27, 6), (7, 12), (7, 26), (7, 17), (15, 23), (15, 20), (15, 8), (20, 15), (20, 21), (20, 3), (20, 16), (20, 28), (19, 26), (19, 6), (26, 7), (26, 19), (26, 24), (26, 21), (11, 22), (11, 13), (11, 4), (28, 20), (28, 0), (28, 25), (24, 26), (24, 14), (24, 5), (1, 29), (1, 5), (5, 12), (5, 24), (5, 1), (5, 8), (16, 29), (16, 20), (16, 21), (21, 29), (21, 18), (21, 20), (21, 26), (21, 16), (14, 18), (14, 24), (6, 27), (6, 19), (6, 17), (6, 8), (17, 12), (17, 7), (17, 6), (17, 3), (3, 20), (3, 17), (3, 13), (9, 23), (25, 29), (25, 28), (25, 13), (8, 15), (8, 5), (8, 6), (0, 22), (0, 28), (0, 13), (4, 11), (13, 18), (13, 11), (13, 3), (13, 25), (13, 0), (10, 23).

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows:
0: 8 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 2 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 1 connections
5: 5 connections
6: 6 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 3 connections
9: 2 connections
10: 1 connections
11: 4 connections
12: 4 connections
13: 6 connections
14: 2 connections
15: 3 connections
16: 4 connections
17: 4 connections
18: 4 connections
19: 2 connections
20: 6 connections
21: 7 connections
22: 3 connections
23: 4 connections
24: 4 connections
25: 4 connections
26: 6 connections
27: 1 connections
28: 4 connections
29: 7 connections

After sorting and relabeling, the unique triangles found are:
<0, 8, 21>
<3, 17, 20>
<3, 13, 21>
<4, 11, 22>
<5, 12, 17>
<5, 13, 24>
<6, 8, 17>
<7, 12, 17>
<12, 17, 24>
<13, 18, 21>
<13, 18, 26>
<13, 21, 26>
<15, 20, 23>
<16, 20, 21>
<20, 21, 26>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
