Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 4) (15, 7) (15, 14) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (18, 10) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 16) (6, 10) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 18) (10, 6) (10, 0) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 19) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 9) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 13) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 9) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 9) (12, 19) (12, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 9) (9, 1) (9, 16) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 19) 

Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. 

Let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 16 has 4 connections.
Nodes 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 19 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18 have 2 connections each.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges to count the number of triangles:
(2, 7) - Forms a triangle with node 4: <2, 4, 7>
(2, 13) - No triangles can be formed.
(7, 2) - No triangles can be formed.
(7, 1) - Forms a triangle with node 11: <1, 7, 11>
(1, 11) - No triangles can be formed.
(1, 9) - No triangles can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
The unique triangles found are <2, 4, 7> and <1, 7, 11>.
