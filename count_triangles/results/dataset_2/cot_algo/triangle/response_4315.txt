Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 15) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 19) (14, 3) (14, 16) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 13) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 9) (13, 1) (13, 12) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (19, 0) (19, 11) (19, 10) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 8) (12, 15) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 9) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 19) (11, 5) (3, 14) (3, 8) (6, 8) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 12) (9, 17) (9, 16) (10, 19) (10, 5) (5, 0) (5, 11) (5, 10) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(4, 7), (4, 11), (4, 17), (7, 4), (7, 15), (2, 18), (2, 1), (2, 16), (2, 15), (18, 2), 
(18, 11), (18, 1), (0, 11), (0, 5), (0, 19), (14, 3), (14, 16), (1, 2), (1, 18),
(1, 17), (1, 13), (17, 4), (17, 1), (17, 12), (17, 9), (13, 1), (13, 12), (8, 16), 
(8, 6), (8, 12), (8, 3), (19, 0), (19, 11), (19, 10), (12, 17), (12, 13), (12, 8),
(12, 15), (16, 2), (16, 14), (16, 8), (16, 9), (11, 4), (11, 18), (11, 0), (11, 19), 
(11, 5), (3, 14), (3, 8), (6, 8), (15, 7), (15, 2), (15, 12), (9, 17), (9, 16), 
(10, 19), (10, 5), (5, 0), (5, 11), (5, 10)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes by degree:
6: 2
0: 3
3: 3
5: 3
7: 3
9: 3
10: 3
14: 3
15: 3
12: 4
13: 4
16: 4
18: 4
1: 5
8: 5
17: 5
2: 5
11: 5
4: 5
19: 3

Now, we will count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 2]

Unique triangles:
<1, 2, 18>
<4, 11, 17>
