Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 2) (16, 8) (16, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 17) (1, 15) (1, 2) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 18) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 14) (8, 16) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 18) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 17) (17, 7) (17, 15) (17, 5) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 15) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 1) (19, 12) (19, 9) (14, 10) (14, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 17) (5, 18) (18, 3) (18, 8) (18, 5) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 19) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 9) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 19) (9, 13) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the provided edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: (12), (5), (9)
- 1: (2), (15)
- 2: (1), (7), (11)
- 3: (4), (11), (18)
- 4: (3), (8)
- 5: (0), (11), (17), (18)
- 6: (8), (15), (16)
- 7: (2), (13), (17)
- 8: (4), (6), (12), (16), (18)
- 9: (0), (10), (13), (19)
- 10: (9), (11), (14)
- 11: (2), (3), (5), (10)
- 12: (0), (8), (19)
- 13: (7), (9), (14)
- 14: (10), (13)
- 15: (1), (6), (17)
- 16: (6), (8)
- 17: (5), (7), (15)
- 18: (3), (5), (8)
- 19: (9), (12)

Now, let's sort the vertices based on the number of connections (degrees):

Vertices in ascending order of degree: 1, 12, 16, 19, 0, 14, 4, 6, 13, 10, 3, 17, 15, 18, 8, 2, 5, 7, 11, 9

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start counting the triangles. 
We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

<0, 12, 19>
<0, 12, 8>
<0, 12, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 11>
<1, 15, 17>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 18>
<5, 11, 17>
<5, 11, 18>
<6, 8, 15>
<7, 13, 17>
<9, 10, 13>
<9, 10, 19>

Total number of triangles: [13]
