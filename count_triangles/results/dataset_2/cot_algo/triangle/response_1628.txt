Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we construct the following graph:
    
    Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    Edges: (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3), (9, 6), (9, 1), (9, 7), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 3), 
           (6, 2), (6, 4), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 1), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 8), (8, 5), (8, 7), 
           (8, 0), (8, 3), (2, 6), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 4), (1, 2), 
           (1, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 0), (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 3)
           
Next, we will sort the nodes by their degree: [2, 7, 3, 9, 4, 0, 8, 5, 6, 1]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles by considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles is [15].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, 
<0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 3>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 3>, <1, 6, 9>.
