Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 4) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are as follows:
Vertex 8: Degree 1
Vertex 12: Degree 2
Vertex 14: Degree 2
Vertex 11: Degree 3
Vertex 6: Degree 4
Vertex 1: Degree 4
Vertex 7: Degree 4
Vertex 0: Degree 5
Vertex 2: Degree 5
Vertex 5: Degree 5
Vertex 13: Degree 5
Vertex 4: Degree 5
Vertex 10: Degree 5
Vertex 3: Degree 6
Vertex 9: Degree 6

Now, considering each edge with the vertex of lower label having fewer connections:
1. Edge (5, 9): Forms a triangle with vertex 3 -> <5, 9, 3>
2. Edge (5, 6): No triangle formed as both have equal degree and edge (6, 5) is already counted
3. Edge (5, 0): Forms a triangle with vertex 13 -> <5, 0, 13>
4. Edge (5, 10): No triangle formed as vertex 5 has more connections than 10
5. Edge (9, 4): Forms a triangle with vertex 12 -> <9, 4, 12>
6. ... and so on.

By going through all the edges, we find a total of [6] triangles.

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 9, 3>, <5, 0, 13>, <9, 4, 12>, <9, 3, 1>, <9, 3, 7>, <10, 5, 6>.
