Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 13) (11, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 8) (10, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 10) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Edges: 
  - (5, 13), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 10), (5, 14)
  - (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 11), (9, 1)
  - (6, 9), (6, 2), (6, 8), (6, 0)
  - (4, 9), (4, 0), (4, 14)
  - (7, 12), (7, 11), (7, 10), (7, 13), (7, 1)
  - (12, 7), (12, 13), (12, 11)
  - (13, 5), (13, 7), (13, 12), (13, 11), (13, 10), (13, 14)
  - (3, 11)
  - (11, 9), (11, 7), (11, 12), (11, 13), (11, 3)
  - (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 7), (1, 2), (1, 8)
  - (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 4), (0, 8)
  - (10, 5), (10, 7), (10, 13), (10, 8), (10, 2)
  - (14, 5), (14, 4), (14, 13)
  - (2, 6), (2, 1), (2, 10)
  - (8, 6), (8, 1), (8, 0), (8, 10)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their degree (number of connections) from least to most:

Degree-based ordering:
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 12: 3 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 14: 4 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 10: 5 connections
- Node 7: 5 connections
- Node 1: 5 connections
- Node 11: 6 connections
- Node 13: 6 connections
- Node 5: 6 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. Since there are quite a few edges and nodes, let's calculate the triangles and their counts:

Triangles: <0, 5, 13>, <0, 5, 14>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 14>, <1, 5, 13>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 10>, <1, 7, 11>, <1, 7, 13>, <1, 7, 10>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 10>, <1, 8, 6>, <1, 8, 10>, <1, 0, 4>, <1, 10, 2>, <1, 10, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 10>, <3, 11, 13>, <4, 9, 11>, <4, 9, 14>, <5, 13, 7>, <5, 13, 10>, <5, 13, 14>, <6, 9, 11>, <6, 9, 4>, <6, 9, 1>, <6, 9, 0>, <6, 4, 14>, <6, 0, 8>, <7, 12, 13>, <7, 12, 11>, <7, 11, 9>, <7, 11, 13>, <7, 11, 12>, <8, 6, 9>, <8, 6, 10>, <8, 6, 2>, <8, 1, 10>, <8, 1, 0>, <9, 6, 4>, <9, 4, 0>, <11, 9, 4>, <11, 9, 7>, <11, 7, 13>, <11, 7, 12>, <11, 7, 10>, <12, 7, 13>, <12, 7, 11>, <13, 5, 10>, <13, 5, 14>

Total number of triangles: [53]
