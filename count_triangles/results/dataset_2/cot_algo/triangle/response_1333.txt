Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 7) (16, 20) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 22) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 24) (0, 21) (27, 26) (27, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 10) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 3) (22, 5) (22, 23) (22, 10) (22, 20) (22, 3) (23, 22) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 28) (18, 17) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 26) (1, 14) (26, 27) (26, 1) (21, 0) (28, 18) (28, 8) (28, 25) (28, 20) (17, 18) (17, 29) (17, 25) (17, 6) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 3) (13, 5) (24, 9) (24, 10) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 19) (20, 16) (20, 22) (20, 28) (20, 3) (10, 4) (10, 22) (10, 24) (10, 15) (10, 3) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 1) (25, 28) (25, 17) (8, 11) (8, 27) (8, 28) (19, 4) (19, 29) (19, 15) (19, 6) (6, 16) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 19) (3, 7) (3, 22) (3, 29) (3, 20) (3, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method begins by sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices in order of least to most connections:
1. Node 0: 1 connection
2. Node 13: 1 connection
3. Node 26: 2 connections
4. Node 2: 2 connections
5. Node 5: 2 connections
6. Node 15: 2 connections
7. Node 11: 2 connections
8. Node 21: 2 connections
9. Node 27: 2 connections
10. Node 25: 2 connections
11. Node 12: 3 connections
12. Node 1: 3 connections
13. Node 29: 3 connections
14. Node 23: 3 connections
15. Node 19: 3 connections
16. Node 10: 4 connections
17. Node 24: 4 connections
18. Node 20: 4 connections
19. Node 8: 4 connections
20. Node 16: 4 connections
21. Node 9: 4 connections
22. Node 4: 4 connections
23. Node 14: 4 connections
24. Node 7: 4 connections
25. Node 6: 4 connections
26. Node 3: 5 connections
27. Node 18: 5 connections
28. Node 22: 5 connections
29. Node 17: 5 connections
30. Node 28: 5 connections

Now, let's count the triangles by considering the edges where the vertices with lower labels have fewer connections:

Triangles:
1. <1, 12, 14>
2. <3, 20, 22>
3. <3, 20, 28>
4. <3, 22, 29>
5. <4, 7, 16>
6. <4, 9, 10>
7. <6, 16, 20>
8. <9, 10, 24>
9. <10, 19, 29>
10. <12, 14, 2>
11. <15, 19, 29>
12. <16, 20, 22>
13. <16, 6, 12>
14. <18, 2, 14>
15. <18, 9, 5>
16. <18, 9, 4>
17. <19, 15, 10>
18. <20, 22, 28>

Total number of triangles: [18]
