Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 11) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 6) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 0) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 7) (5, 19) (5, 2) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 19) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 13) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 8) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 6) (16, 0) (16, 9) (16, 6) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 16) (18, 3) (18, 14) (18, 11) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 16) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 18) 

Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. Let's proceed with counting the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows:
```
Node 16: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 17: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 18: 5 connections
Node 12: 5 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
```

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
Counting the number of triangles, we find the following unique triangles:

<0, 8, 1>
<0, 8, 15>
<0, 6, 16>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 8, 15>
<3, 4, 12>
<3, 4, 13>
<3, 9, 15>
<4, 7, 12>
<4, 12, 14>
<6, 7, 12>
<6, 7, 16>
<6, 7, 17>
<7, 10, 2>
<7, 10, 6>
<9, 3, 15>
<12, 4, 13>
<13, 14, 4>
<13, 19, 7>
<14, 18, 11>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
