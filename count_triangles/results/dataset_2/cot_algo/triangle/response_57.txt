Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (14, 13) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 19) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 18) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 2) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 4) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 18) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 0) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 18) (1, 8) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 7) (2, 9) (2, 19) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 8) (18, 13) (18, 15) (18, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method works as follows:
- Start by sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections).
- Relabel the nodes from 0 to 19 based on their sorted order.

Here is the list of nodes with their degrees:
Node 5 : 3
Node 13 : 6
Node 19 : 4
Node 3 : 4
Node 17 : 4
Node 10 : 3
Node 12 : 4
Node 4 : 3
Node 1 : 4
Node 6 : 3
Node 8 : 4
Node 9 : 2
Node 14 : 1
Node 15 : 3
Node 2 : 4
Node 7 : 3
Node 0 : 4
Node 18 : 3

Next, we will use these relabeled nodes to count the triangles.

Calculating the triangles, we find the following:
Total number of triangles: [54]
Unique triangles found: 
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 12, 4>, <0, 12, 8>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 1, 18>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 8, 17>, <1, 13, 15>, <1, 13, 18>, <1, 6, 13>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 8, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 12>, <2, 7, 3>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 19>, <2, 9, 12>, <2, 9, 19>, <2, 12, 4>, <2, 12, 9>, <2, 19, 17>, <2, 19, 5>, <3, 5, 17>, <3, 7, 17>, <3, 7, 2>, <4, 10, 12>, <4, 10, 15>, <4, 12, 0>, <4, 12, 10>, <4, 12, 2>, <4, 12, 9>, <4, 12, 10>, <4, 2, 7>, <4, 2, 9>, <4, 2, 12>, <4, 9, 12>, <6, 8, 1>, <6, 8, 17>, <8, 1, 13>, <8, 1, 6>, <8, 1, 18>, <8, 1, 6>, <8, 1, 13>, <8, 6, 1>, <8, 6, 17>, <8, 7, 2>, <8, 7, 3>, <8, 7, 6>, <8, 7, 17>, <8, 7, 3>, <8, 7, 6>, <8, 7, 17>, <8, 7, 3>, <12, 0, 17>, <12, 2, 4>, <12, 2, 9>, <13, 1, 6>, <13, 1, 18>, <13, 15, 18>
