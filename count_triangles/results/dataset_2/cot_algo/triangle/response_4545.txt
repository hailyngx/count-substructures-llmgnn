Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 8) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 14) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
After constructing the graph and sorting the nodes by their degree of connections, we have the following new labeling:

Nodes: 
0 (degree 4)
1 (degree 4)
5 (degree 4)
9 (degree 7)
4 (degree 4)
7 (degree 2)
6 (degree 5)
3 (degree 4)
10 (degree 4)
11 (degree 4)
8 (degree 4)
2 (degree 7)
12 (degree 3)
14 (degree 4)
13 (degree 6)

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Since the edge (5, 9) has nodes (5) and (9), both with a degree of 4, we check for shared connections. They have one shared connection with node 0 forming a triangle {5, 9, 0}.
- Since the edge (5, 2) has nodes (5) and (2), with degrees 4 and 7 respectively, we skip this edge as 5 < 2.
- Edge (5, 0) creates a triangle {5, 9, 0}.
- Edge (9, 5) was already considered.
- Edge (9, 6) creates a triangle {9, 4, 6}.
- Edge (9, 4) creates a triangle {9, 4, 6}.
- Edge (9, 1) creates a triangle {9, 4, 1}.
- Edge (9, 7) also creates a triangle {9, 4, 7}.
- Edge (4, 9) was already considered.
- Edge (4, 12) creates a triangle {4, 9, 12}.
- Edge (4, 6) creates a triangle {4, 9, 6}.
- Edge (4, 3) creates a triangle {4, 9, 3}.
- Edge (7, 9) was already considered.
- Edge (7, 0) creates a triangle {7, 9, 0}.
- Edge (6, 9) was already considered.
- Edge (6, 4) creates a triangle {6, 9, 4}.
- Edge (6, 10) creates a triangle {6, 9, 10}.
- Edge (6, 2) creates a triangle {6, 9, 2}.
- Edge (6, 13) creates a triangle {6, 9, 13}.
- Edge (10, 6) was already considered.
- Edge (10, 11) creates a triangle {10, 6, 11}.
- Edge (10, 8) creates a triangle {10, 6, 8}.
- Edge (10, 13) creates a triangle {10, 6, 13}.
- Edge (10, 2) creates a triangle {10, 6, 2}.
- Edge (11, 10) was already considered.
- Edge (11, 3) creates a triangle {11, 10, 3}.
- Edge (11, 1) creates a triangle {11, 10, 1}.
- Edge (11, 8) creates a triangle {11, 10, 8}.
- Edge (12, 4) was already considered.
- Edge (12, 13) creates a triangle {12, 4, 13}.
- Edge (12, 14) creates a triangle {12, 4, 14}.
- Edge (3, 4) was already considered.
- Edge (3, 11) creates a triangle {3, 4, 11}.
- Edge (3, 13) creates a triangle {3, 4, 13}.
- Edge (3, 2) creates a triangle {3, 4, 2}.
- Edge (0, 5) was already considered.
- Edge (0, 7) was already considered.
- Edge (0, 8) creates a triangle {0, 7, 8}.
- Edge (0, 2) creates a triangle {0, 7, 2}.
- Edge (14, 12) creates a triangle {14, 12, 4}.
- Edge (14, 2) creates a triangle {14, 12, 2}.
- Edge (14, 13) creates a triangle {14, 12, 13}.
