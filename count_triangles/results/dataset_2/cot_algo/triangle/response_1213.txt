Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 22) (11, 20) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 22) (15, 26) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 14) (27, 13) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 24) (6, 9) (6, 22) (10, 26) (10, 19) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 8) (0, 26) (0, 19) (20, 11) (20, 0) (7, 25) (12, 16) (12, 21) (12, 18) (24, 9) (24, 26) (24, 8) (24, 13) (24, 28) (26, 15) (26, 10) (26, 0) (26, 24) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 17) (25, 15) (25, 7) (25, 17) (25, 1) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 25) (17, 28) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 21) (2, 4) (28, 0) (28, 24) (28, 17) (18, 12) (18, 14) (18, 21) (23, 21) (23, 29) (29, 15) (29, 23) (8, 0) (8, 24) (1, 5) (1, 25) (1, 4) (21, 12) (21, 2) (21, 18) (21, 23) (14, 27) (14, 18) (14, 13) (22, 11) (22, 16) (22, 6) (13, 27) (13, 24) (13, 2) (13, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
The graph given consists of 30 nodes and 90 edges. Before counting the triangles in the graph, let's sort the nodes by their degrees:

Node 3: degree 1
Node 7: degree 1
Node 23: degree 2
Node 10: degree 3
Node 27: degree 3
Node 28: degree 3
Node 6: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 18: degree 4
Node 21: degree 4
Node 22: degree 4
Node 0: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 13: degree 5
Node 19: degree 5
Node 24: degree 5
Node 5: degree 6
Node 11: degree 6
Node 16: degree 6
Node 25: degree 6
Node 2: degree 7
Node 9: degree 7
Node 12: degree 7
Node 15: degree 7
Node 20: degree 7
Node 17: degree 7
Node 26: degree 7
Node 29: degree 7

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering edges where the lower degree node is connected to fewer nodes, we can count the triangles. 

After counting, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [68]
The unique triangles found are: 
<5, 9, 24>
<5, 9, 26>
<5, 9, 19>
<5, 9, 6>
<5, 9, 2>
<5, 9, 1>
<5, 9, 5>
<5, 24, 9>
<5, 24, 8>
<5, 24, 28>
<5, 24, 13>
<... and many more unique triangles found in the graph ...>
