Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 12) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 19) (15, 19) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 19) (6, 18) (12, 18) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 11) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 12) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 11) (19, 3) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 0) (11, 12) (11, 19) (3, 17) (3, 9) (3, 19) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles in this graph:

Vertices sorted by the number of connections (degrees):
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 11: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 12: 5 connections
Node 18: 5 connections
Node 16: 5 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 19: 6 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 15: 1 connection
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 14: 4 connections

Triangles found: 
[<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 13>, <0, 5, 13>, <2, 5, 13>, <3, 17, 5>, <3, 9, 19>, <9, 19, 11>, <12, 16, 18>]

Total number of triangles: [8]
