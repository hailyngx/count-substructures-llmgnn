Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 6) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 16) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 8) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 2) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 15) (18, 14) (18, 7) (0, 16) (14, 18) (14, 4) (13, 5) (13, 7) (15, 1) (15, 2) (15, 16) (16, 5) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 7) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 19) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 12) (7, 18) (7, 13) (7, 16) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 19) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Let's start by sorting the vertices based on their degree:

| Node | Degree |
|------|--------|
| 0    | 1      |
| 8    | 3      |
| 14   | 3      |
| 5    | 4      |
| 9    | 4      |
| 1    | 4      |
| 13   | 4      |
| 7    | 4      |
| 15   | 4      |
| 19   | 4      |
| 2    | 5      |
| 12   | 5      |
| 6    | 5      |
| 18   | 5      |
| 3    | 5      |
| 16   | 6      |
| 4    | 6      |
| 17   | 6      |
| 10   | 6      |
| 11   | 6      |

Now, let's label the nodes accordingly and list the edges in the order of the labels:

| Node | Label |
|------|-------|
| 0    | 1     |
| 8    | 2     |
| 14   | 3     |
| 5    | 4     |
| 9    | 5     |
| 1    | 6     |
| 13   | 7     |
| 7    | 8     |
| 15   | 9     |
| 19   | 10    |
| 2    | 11    |
| 12   | 12    |
| 6    | 13    |
| 18   | 14    |
| 3    | 15    |
| 16   | 16    |
| 4    | 17    |
| 17   | 18    |
| 10   | 19    |
| 11   | 20    |

Ordered edges:
(0, 16) (4, 6) (4, 14) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 16) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 16) (7, 13) (7, 16) (8, 17) (8, 11) (8, 19) (9, 6) (10, 12) (10, 11) (10, 17) 
(11, 19) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 19) (13, 7) (14, 4) (14, 18) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 16) (16, 7) (16, 5) (16, 6) (16, 0) (17, 2) (17, 8) (17, 10) (18, 7) (18, 14) (19, 11) (19, 8)

Let's now count the number of triangles found in the graph. 

**Total number of triangles: [12]**

Unique triangles:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 16>
<4, 6, 12>
<5, 9, 6>
<8, 11, 19>
<8, 17, 10>
<13, 7, 16>
<14, 4, 6>
<15, 2, 1>
<17, 8, 11>
