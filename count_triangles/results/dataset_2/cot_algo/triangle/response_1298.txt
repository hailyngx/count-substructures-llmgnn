Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 0), (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 3), (9, 1), (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 0), (4, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 3), (8, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 3), (2, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 7), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 0), (7, 2), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 2), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 0)

Next, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees from least to most: 
Degree of Node 9: 3
Degree of Node 5: 4
Degree of Node 4: 3
Degree of Node 8: 4
Degree of Node 1: 4
Degree of Node 7: 4
Degree of Node 3: 4
Degree of Node 2: 4
Degree of Node 0: 5
Degree of Node 6: 6

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly: 
Node 9 -> A
Node 5 -> B
Node 4 -> C
Node 8 -> D
Node 1 -> E
Node 7 -> F
Node 3 -> G
Node 2 -> H
Node 0 -> I
Node 6 -> J

We will only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(A, J), (A, G), (A, E), (B, J), (B, F), (B, D), (B, I), (C, G), (C, E), (C, H), (D, E), (E, I), (F, J), (F, I), (G, I)

Now, we will check for shared connections to count the triangles:
1. Triangle <A, B, J>
2. Triangle <A, E, I>
3. Triangle <A, G, I>
4. Triangle <D, E, I>
5. Triangle <F, J, I>

Finally, the total number of triangles inside brackets is: [5]
