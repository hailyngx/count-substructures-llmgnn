Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 13) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 0) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 14) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges:
(6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 10) 
(9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) 
(1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) 
(3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) 
(4, 11) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (0, 7) 
(0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 13) (7, 6) (7, 9) 
(7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) 
(12, 8) (12, 0) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) 
(10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) 
(11, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2) 
(5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (2, 3) (2, 10) 
(2, 14) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 11)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes by degree: [0, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 7, 11, 1, 3, 8, 4]

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph:

[34] triangles found. 

<6, 9, 7> <1, 3, 5> <3, 4, 12> <1, 4, 8> <0, 7, 11> <1, 13, 3> <4, 11, 7> <0, 10, 9> <2, 10, 14> <1, 13, 11> <0, 12, 7> <3, 5, 11> <2, 3, 13> <1, 5, 11> <0, 13, 11> <0, 10, 14> <0, 7, 14> <1, 3, 13> <4, 8, 12> <1, 3, 2> <6, 9, 7> <7, 4, 11> <6, 7, 9> <1, 4, 12> <6, 11, 7> <0, 12, 8> <0, 13, 7> <0, 12, 3> <0, 13, 1> <1, 5, 3> <4, 12, 8> <4, 14, 7> <5, 11, 3> <2, 14, 10> <3, 12, 4>
