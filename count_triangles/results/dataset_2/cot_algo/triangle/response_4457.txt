Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 2) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 13) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 0), (4, 1), (7, 6), (7, 13), (7, 5), (7, 8), (10, 11), 
(10, 0), (10, 1), (10, 2), (10, 9), (10, 5), (11, 10), (11, 9), (11, 6), (11, 12), 
(8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 1), (5, 7), (5, 10), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (6, 7), (6, 11), 
(6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 12), (6, 13), (2, 10), (2, 12), (2, 14), (12, 11), (12, 6), 
(12, 2), (0, 4), (0, 10), (0, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 13), (14, 2), (14, 9), 
(14, 13), (9, 4), (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 14), (1, 4), (1, 10), (1, 8), (1, 5), 
(1, 0), (13, 7), (13, 6), (13, 3), (13, 14)

After sorting the nodes by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are:
{3, 2, 14, 12, 13, 0, 8, 9, 5, 1, 11, 6, 10, 4, 7}

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and examining the edges, we count the triangles and get the result: 
[35]

Unique triangles found:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 9>
