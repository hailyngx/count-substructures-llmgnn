Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
The nodes and edges of the given graph are as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 4), (9, 6), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0), (4, 6), (4, 3), (4, 1), (8, 5), (8, 3), (8, 7), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 0), (5, 7), (2, 1), (2, 0), (0, 9), (0, 5), (0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 1), (7, 8), (7, 5), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 1), (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 7), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 2), (1, 0), (1, 7)

Next, we will label the nodes based on their degrees, starting with the node with the lowest degree.

Nodes and their degrees:
Node 2: degree 2
Node 4: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 0: degree 5
Node 7: degree 5
Node 5: degree 5
Node 3: degree 6
Node 9: degree 6
Node 6: degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the triangles in the graph:

Triangles: [<0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 8>]

Total number of triangles: [12]
