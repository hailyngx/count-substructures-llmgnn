Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 19) (0, 27) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 1) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 2) (1, 0) (1, 26) (3, 21) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 4) (18, 6) (18, 19) (18, 5) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 25) (12, 6) (12, 27) (12, 29) (12, 8) (23, 11) (23, 2) (23, 10) (15, 20) (20, 3) (20, 22) (20, 15) (17, 25) (17, 4) (17, 7) (29, 12) (29, 8) (29, 21) (21, 3) (21, 29) (21, 28) (28, 21) (2, 27) (2, 23) (2, 14) (8, 12) (8, 29) (8, 10) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 11) (26, 16) (11, 23) (11, 26) (16, 0) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 19) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 7) (25, 22) (25, 17) (25, 5) (5, 18) (5, 26) (5, 25) (5, 14) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 14) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 24) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 17) (10, 6) (10, 23) (10, 8) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method works as follows: 
- Firstly, we sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. 
- Next, we enumerate the vertices starting from 0 to n-1, where n is the total number of vertices. 
- For each edge, if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections than the other, we proceed to count triangles. 

Given the edges provided, let's first construct the graph by listing the vertices and their connections:

Vertices:
0: [27, 16, 4, 1]
1: [0, 26]
2: [27, 23, 14]
3: [21, 14, 20, 4]
4: [0, 3, 17]
5: [18, 26, 25, 14]
6: [10, 18, 12, 13]
7: [17, 19, 13]
8: [12, 29, 10]
9: [19]
10: [6, 23, 8]
11: [23, 26]
12: [6, 27, 29, 8]
13: [6, 7]
14: [3, 2, 5, 24]
15: [20]
16: [0, 26, 24, 19]
17: [25, 4, 7]
18: [6, 19, 5]
19: [9, 18, 16, 7]
20: [3, 22, 15]
21: [3, 29, 28]
22: [20, 24, 25]
23: [11, 2, 10]
24: [22, 16, 14]
25: [22, 17, 5]
26: [1, 5, 11, 16]
27: [0, 12, 2]
28: [21]
29: [12, 8, 21]


Now, counting the triangles:
[13, 7, 19] and [12, 7, 13] and [19, 7, 17]

Total number of triangles: [3] 

Unique triangles:
<13, 7, 19>
