Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (14, 6) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 4) (2, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 0) (1, 17) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 12) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 3) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 18) (18, 7) (19, 15) (19, 3) (3, 16) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 4) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 10) (4, 3) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then we will relabel the nodes accordingly.

Sorted nodes by degree:
(8, 2), (1, 3), (18, 3), (19, 3), (6, 4), (13, 4), (0, 5), (5, 5), (12, 5), (9, 6), (10, 6), (7, 6), (17, 6), (14, 7), (16, 7), (11, 8), (3, 8), (15, 8), (4, 9)

Now we will count the triangles:

Triangles:
