Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 2) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 14) 

Response:
The nodes and edges in the graph are as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: {(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 3), (9, 2), (4, 8), (4, 3), (7, 3), (7, 11), (7, 10), (7, 8), (10, 0), (10, 2), (11, 1), (11, 6), (11, 12), (8, 0), (8, 1), (6, 14), (0, 13), (13, 12), (2, 14), (3, 12), (1, 14)}

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by number of connections (degree):
{1, 4, 13} - 0 connections
{0, 8, 14} - 2 connections
{2, 7, 9, 12} - 3 connections
{3, 6, 11} - 4 connections
{5, 10} - 5 connections

Now, following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

Triangles: <0, 8, 1>, <2, 12, 13>

Total number of triangles: [2]
