Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 6) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 6) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 6) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 14 and the edges are as listed. Let's proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph.

Using the given edges, let's determine the degree of each node:

Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 1
Node 11: degree 5
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 5
Node 14: degree 4

Now we'll relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:

Node 10: degree 1
Node 1: degree 2
Node 3: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 5
Node 7: degree 5
Node 11: degree 5
Node 14: degree 5

Now, we will go through the edges and count the triangles:

1. For edge (0, 4) -> Node 0 (degree 4) < Node 4 (degree 4): Check shared connections: {5, 7, 12}
2. For edge (0, 3) -> Node 0 (degree 4) < Node 3 (degree 3): Check shared connections: {6, 12}
3. For edge (0, 6) -> Node 0 (degree 4) < Node 6 (degree 4): Check shared connections: {12}
4. For edge (1, 3) -> Node 1 (degree 2) < Node 3 (degree 3): Check shared connections: {13}
5. For edge (2, 6) -> Node 2 (degree 4) < Node 6 (degree 4): Check shared connections: {12}
6. For edge (5, 9) -> Node 5 (degree 4) < Node 9 (degree 4): Check shared connections: {12}
7. For edge (7, 8) -> Node 7 (degree 5) < Node 8 (degree 4): Check shared connections: {4, 13}
8. For edge (7, 12) -> Node 7 (degree 5) < Node 12 (degree 4): Check shared connections: {5, 14}
9. For edge (7, 13) -> Node 7 (degree 5) < Node 13 (degree 5): Check shared connections: {4, 6, 8}
10. For edge (7, 14) -> Node 7 (degree 5) < Node 14 (degree 5): Check shared connections: {3, 11, 6}
11. For edge (8, 9) -> Node 8 (degree 4) < Node 9 (degree 4): Check shared connections: {4, 7}
12. For edge (11, 14) -> Node 11 (degree 5) < Node 14 (degree 5): Check shared connections: {7, 3, 6}
13. For edge (13, 6) -> Node 13 (degree 5) < Node 6 (degree 4): Check shared connections: {7}
