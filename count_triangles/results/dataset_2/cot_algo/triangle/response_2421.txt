Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}  
Edges:  
(0, 5)  
(0, 8)  
(1, 2)  
(1, 3)  
(1, 4)  
(1, 5)  
(1, 8)  
(2, 5)  
(2, 6)  
(3, 4)  
(3, 5)  
(3, 6)  
(4, 5)  
(4, 6)  
(4, 9)  
(5, 0)  
(5, 1)  
(5, 2)  
(5, 3)  
(5, 4)  
(5, 9)  
(6, 2)  
(6, 3)  
(6, 4)  
(6, 7)  
(6, 8)  
(7, 6)  
(7, 8)  
(7, 9)  
(8, 0)  
(8, 1)  
(8, 6)  
(8, 7)  
(9, 4)  
(9, 5)  
(9, 7)  
(9, 9)  

Next, we will create the Degree-Based Ordering based on the number of connections each node has.

Sorted nodes based on degree:  
{0, 2, 7, 8, 9, 1, 6, 3, 4, 5}

Now, we will count the triangles by considering the edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections. 

Based on the given graph and the Degree-Based Ordering, the total number of triangles is [6].  

The unique triangles found are:  
<1, 2, 5>  
<1, 3, 4>  
<1, 3, 6>  
<1, 4, 5>  
<2, 3, 6>  
<2, 5, 6>
