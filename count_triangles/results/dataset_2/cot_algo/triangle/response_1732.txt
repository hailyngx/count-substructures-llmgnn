Response:
The graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are provided below:
(11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 15) (16, 0) (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 28) (13, 23) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 6) (22, 12) (6, 22) (6, 9) (6, 18) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 20) (1, 3) (1, 26) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 14) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 21) (20, 9) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 21) (25, 20) (25, 19) (25, 21) (25, 2) (8, 23) (8, 29) (8, 26) (23, 13) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 29) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 12) (5, 29) (5, 0) (5, 10) (26, 1) (26, 8) (2, 18) (2, 25) (2, 15) (2, 0) (21, 18) (21, 20) (21, 25) (21, 10) (29, 20) (29, 8) (29, 23) (29, 5) (29, 10) (10, 5) (10, 21) (10, 29) (10, 12) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 2) (28, 13) (28, 3) (28, 15) (12, 11) (12, 22) (12, 4) (12, 10) (14, 3) (14, 23) (14, 7) (17, 7) (27, 13) (7, 14) (7, 17) (19, 25) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 2) (15, 28)

Now let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

First, let's sort the nodes by their degree:
0 (4), 1 (2), 3 (4), 5 (4), 7 (2), 8 (3), 10 (4), 16 (1), 19 (1), 20 (4), 25 (4), 26 (2), 27 (1), 2 (4), 4 (6), 6 (4), 9 (4), 11 (4), 12 (4), 13 (5), 14 (3), 15 (4), 17 (2), 18 (4), 21 (4), 22 (3), 23 (4), 28 (3), 29 (5)

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the edges, we will count the triangles in the graph.

The total number of triangles is [36].
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 15>, <0, 2, 25>, <0, 5, 10>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 3, 28>, <2, 15, 18>, <2, 15, 21>, <2, 18, 21>, <3, 13, 4>, <3, 13, 28>, <3, 14, 23>, <4, 11, 13>, <4, 11, 28>, <5, 10, 21>, <5, 10, 29>, <5, 21, 29>, <6, 9, 22>, <6, 9, 29>, <8, 23, 26>, <8, 23, 29>, <9, 11, 12>, <9, 11, 22>, <10, 12, 21>, <13, 22, 27>, <14, 23, 29>, <15, 18, 21>, <15, 22, 23>, <15, 28, 13>, <18, 21, 25>, <18, 21, 29>, <20, 21, 25>, <20, 21, 29>, <20, 25, 29>, <25, 21, 29>, <25, 21, 10>.
