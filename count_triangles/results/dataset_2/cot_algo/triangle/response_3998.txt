Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 0) (22, 4) (22, 17) (22, 25) (2, 18) (2, 28) (2, 12) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 20) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 21) (5, 28) (8, 25) (8, 1) (19, 25) (19, 24) (19, 16) (4, 22) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 29) (12, 2) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 27) (7, 3) (16, 19) (16, 7) (16, 14) (16, 15) (17, 22) (17, 5) (17, 25) (17, 28) (25, 22) (25, 8) (25, 19) (25, 17) (25, 26) (23, 26) (23, 1) (26, 25) (26, 23) (26, 0) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (1, 8) (1, 23) (1, 29) (29, 4) (29, 1) (29, 11) (11, 18) (11, 7) (11, 29) (11, 14) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 26) (0, 10) (0, 3) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (14, 16) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 15) (15, 16) (15, 14) (21, 5) (21, 24) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 27) (28, 2) (28, 5) (28, 17) (28, 27) (20, 18) (24, 19) (24, 21) (27, 7) (27, 9) (27, 28) 

Response:
The sorted nodes based on their degree are: 

0(5), 1(3), 26(3), 28(4), 29(3), 3(3), 9(4), 12(2), 13(2), 15(2), 20(1), 23(2), 7(4), 4(4), 5(4), 6(0), 8(2), 10(3), 11(4), 14(4), 16(4), 17(4), 2(4), 18(4), 21(2), 24(2), 25(5), 19(3), 22(4), 27(3)

By following the degree-based ordering and going through the edges while considering only cases where the vertex with the lower label has a smaller degree, we can count the triangles formed by the shared connections. 

After counting the triangles, the total number of triangles is found to be [21].
The unique triangles are: 
<0, 4, 26>, <0, 4, 10>, <0, 4, 3>, <1, 8, 23>, <1, 8, 29>, <1, 23, 26>, 
<8, 23, 26>, <3, 0, 4>, <3, 0, 26>, <9, 4, 10>, <9, 4, 3>, <9, 4, 27>, 
<4, 22, 17>, <4, 17, 28>, <5, 13, 17>, <5, 17, 25>, <5, 17, 28>, 
<16, 7, 11>, <16, 11, 14>, <16, 11, 29>, <16, 14, 15>.
