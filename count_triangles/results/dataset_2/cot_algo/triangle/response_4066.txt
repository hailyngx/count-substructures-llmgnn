Node 19: Degree 2
Node 16: Degree 3
Node 11: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 10: Degree 3
Node 12: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 15: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 18: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 22: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 6

Node 25: Degree 3
Node 29: Degree 3

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [60]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 12, 5>, <0, 12, 14>, <1, 13, 18>, <1, 13, 4>, <1, 18, 22>, <3, 20, 27>, <3, 9, 12>, <3, 9, 0>, <3, 4, 13>, <4, 13, 18>, <7, 17, 19>, <10, 18, 22>, <10, 21, 29>, <14, 15, 16>, <14, 14, 16>, <14, 14, 26>, <14, 15, 1>, <14, 14, 22>, <15, 16, 11>, <16, 14, 22>, <20, 24, 27>, <21, 24, 27>, <21, 24, 20>, <21, 25, 29>, <22, 18, 26>, <22, 14, 26>, <24, 27, 20>
