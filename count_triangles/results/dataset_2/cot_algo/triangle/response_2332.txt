Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 5), (0, 9)
(1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 9)
(2, 4), (2, 1), (2, 8)
(3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 9)
(4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 6), (4, 2)
(5, 7), (5, 0), (5, 8)
(6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 9), (6, 0)
(7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 5)
(8, 9), (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 5)
(9, 4), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 0)

Now, we will sort the nodes by their degree:

Nodes by degree:
0: 4
1: 4
2: 3
3: 3
5: 3
7: 4
8: 4
4: 4
6: 5
9: 6

Now, we will count the triangles. 

Triangles: [4]

Triangles found: 
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 1, 4>
