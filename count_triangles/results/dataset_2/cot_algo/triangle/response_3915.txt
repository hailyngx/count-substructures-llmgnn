Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 15) (26, 20) (26, 4) (13, 29) (13, 1) (13, 19) (22, 10) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 25) (17, 23) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 27) (7, 8) (21, 20) (21, 12) (1, 26) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 5) (2, 23) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 5) (0, 12) (4, 26) (4, 18) (4, 23) (3, 11) (3, 20) (3, 16) (3, 19) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 6) (27, 7) (27, 10) (27, 16) (27, 5) (25, 14) (25, 7) (25, 12) (25, 10) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 3) (19, 24) (19, 23) (16, 3) (16, 27) (16, 15) (24, 19) (24, 29) (15, 26) (15, 16) (15, 8) (28, 9) (28, 5) (5, 1) (5, 18) (5, 27) (5, 28) (5, 8) (8, 7) (8, 15) (8, 5) (20, 26) (20, 21) (20, 3) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 23) (23, 17) (23, 2) (23, 4) (23, 19) (23, 6) (12, 21) (12, 0) (12, 25) (10, 22) (10, 27) (10, 25) (29, 13) (29, 24) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to efficiently count the number of triangles in the graph. Let's proceed with sorting the vertices and counting the triangles.

After sorting the vertices by their degrees from least connected to most connected, we have the following labels:
0 - 6
1 - 4
2 - 2
3 - 5
4 - 4
5 - 6
6 - 4
7 - 4
8 - 4
9 - 2
10 - 4
11 - 4
12 - 3
13 - 4
14 - 3
15 - 3
16 - 4
17 - 1
18 - 3
19 - 5
20 - 3
21 - 2
22 - 1
23 - 5
24 - 2
25 - 4
26 - 5
27 - 4
28 - 2
29 - 2

Now, let's count the triangles formed by the edges while considering the degree-based ordering:

Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles found: 
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 13, 19>
<1, 14, 25>
<3, 11, 6>
<3, 16, 27>
<4, 18, 5>
<5, 8, 15>
<7, 25, 12>
<13, 19, 3>
<19, 23, 6>
