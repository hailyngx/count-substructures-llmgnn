Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 5) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 15) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 2) (17, 15) (6, 9) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 10) (4, 11) (4, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 19) (5, 16) (5, 17) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 13) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 13) (18, 12) (18, 10) (19, 12) (19, 1) (19, 13) (3, 7) (3, 2) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 19) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 3) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 19) (0, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. The vertices with their corresponding degrees are:

(0: 1), 
(1: 3), 
(2: 3), 
(3: 2), 
(4: 3), 
(5: 3), 
(6: 2), 
(7: 3), 
(8: 2), 
(9: 4), 
(10: 4), 
(11: 4), 
(12: 5), 
(13: 3), 
(14: 3), 
(15: 5), 
(16: 3), 
(17: 4), 
(18: 2), 
(19: 3)

Now, we can start counting the triangles by considering the edges based on the vertex labels and their degrees. We count the triangles and output the result:

Total number of triangles: [13]

Unique triangles found: 
<6, 9, 15>, 
<6, 9, 10>, 
<9, 10, 15>, 
<1, 8, 19>, 
<0, 12, 19>, 
<2, 3, 7>, 
<2, 3, 16>, 
<2, 3, 17>, 
<10, 13, 19>, 
<10, 13, 15>, 
<9, 13, 15>, 
<12, 18, 10>, 
<12, 18, 19>
