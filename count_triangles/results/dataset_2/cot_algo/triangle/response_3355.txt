Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 17) (10, 3) (10, 16) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 19) (2, 11) (2, 15) (18, 14) (18, 15) (7, 16) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 15) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 3) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 17) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 15) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 15) (14, 18) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 4) (0, 11) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 19) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 16) (15, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles step by step:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 11 - degree 3
Node 0 - degree 1
Node 1 - degree 3
Node 2 - degree 2
Node 3 - degree 5
Node 4 - degree 4
Node 5 - degree 4
Node 6 - degree 5
Node 7 - degree 2
Node 8 - degree 4
Node 9 - degree 3
Node 10 - degree 2
Node 12 - degree 2
Node 13 - degree 4
Node 14 - degree 1
Node 15 - degree 5
Node 16 - degree 5
Node 17 - degree 3
Node 18 - degree 2
Node 19 - degree 4

Nodes relabeled based on degree:
Node 0 - degree 1
Node 14 - degree 1
Node 2 - degree 2
Node 7 - degree 2
Node 10 - degree 2
Node 12 - degree 2
Node 18 - degree 2
