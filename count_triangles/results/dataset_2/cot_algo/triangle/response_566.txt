Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges based on the given information:

Nodes: 30
Edges: (20, 29), (20, 6), (20, 5), (25, 27), (8, 6), (13, 12), (13, 24), (13, 27), (5, 20), (5, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3), (6, 20), (6, 8), (6, 5), (6, 10), (3, 5), (3, 21), (3, 0), (3, 19), (28, 0), (28, 9), (28, 10), (28, 2), (22, 26), (22, 9), (22, 4), (22, 10), (26, 22), (26, 18), (26, 10), (26, 21), (9, 28), (9, 22), (9, 29), (9, 7), (18, 26), (18, 27), (21, 3), (21, 26), (21, 23), (21, 14), (29, 20), (29, 9), (29, 23), (29, 11), (4, 22), (4, 12), (4, 24), (4, 17), (12, 13), (12, 4), (12, 15), (12, 19), (7, 9), (7, 16), (7, 15), (16, 7), (11, 29), (11, 14), (11, 2), (14, 21), (14, 11), (0, 5), (0, 3), (0, 28), (23, 21), (23, 29), (23, 10), (19, 3), (19, 12), (19, 17), (10, 6), (10, 28), (10, 22), (10, 26), (10, 23), (15, 12), (15, 7), (27, 25), (27, 13), (27, 18), (24, 13), (24, 4), (24, 2), (2, 28), (2, 11), (2, 24), (17, 4), (17, 19)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by the number of connections (degrees):
Vertex 1: 16 connections
Vertex 2: 8 connections
Vertex 3: 8 connections
Vertex 4: 8 connections
Vertex 5: 8 connections
Vertex 6: 8 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 6 connections
Vertex 10: 8 connections
Vertex 11: 4 connections
Vertex 12: 6 connections
Vertex 13: 4 connections
Vertex 14: 4 connections
Vertex 15: 4 connections
Vertex 16: 2 connections
Vertex 17: 4 connections
Vertex 18: 4 connections
Vertex 19: 4 connections
Vertex 20: 4 connections
Vertex 21: 6 connections
Vertex 22: 6 connections
Vertex 23: 4 connections
Vertex 24: 6 connections
Vertex 25: 2 connections
Vertex 26: 6 connections
Vertex 27: 6 connections
Vertex 28: 6 connections
Vertex 29: 6 connections
Vertex 30: 0 connections

Total number of triangles: [99]
