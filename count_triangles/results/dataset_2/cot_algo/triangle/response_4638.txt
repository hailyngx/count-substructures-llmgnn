Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 16) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 14) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 17) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 10) (12, 19) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 0) (15, 5) (15, 1) (15, 19) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 2) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 18) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 18) (16, 4) (16, 1) (11, 14) (11, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 3) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 13) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (18, 5) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 10) (18, 11) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: {(6, 9), (6, 3), (9, 4), (4, 16), (8, 2), (8, 14), (8, 10), (5, 18), (5, 15), (5, 7), (5, 14), (2, 3), (2, 17), (7, 10), (7, 14), (12, 10), (12, 19), (1, 15), (1, 16), (1, 0), (13, 19), (17, 2), (0, 10), (10, 18), (11, 14), (14, 3), (19, 15), (3, 6), (18, 13), (18, 11)}

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order:
Nodes by degree: {11, 13, 16, 17, 1, 6, 7, 12, 0, 8, 9, 5, 19, 18, 4, 2, 14, 15, 3, 10}

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles by looking at shared connections between vertices. 

Total number of triangles: [10]
Unique triangles found: <3, 14, 11>, <7, 5, 14>, <7, 10, 12>, <1, 15, 19>, <0, 18, 10>, <0, 18, 5>, <2, 17, 3>, <1, 16, 4>, <0, 1, 10>, <13, 19, 18>
