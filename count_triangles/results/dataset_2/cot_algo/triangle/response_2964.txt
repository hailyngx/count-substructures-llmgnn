Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on the number of connections are:  

Nodes in increasing order of connections:  
0, 7  
2, 8  
4  
1, 6, 9  
3  
5  

Now, we will only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

(0, 7)  
(2, 8)  
(4, 6)  
(1, 6)  
(1, 9)  
(3, 6)  
(3, 8)  
(5, 6)  
(5, 9)  

Now, we will count the triangles formed by these edges:  

Count of triangles: [8]  
Unique triangles:  
<0, 7, 8>  
<1, 6, 9>  
<1, 6, 4>  
<1, 6, 3>  
<3, 6, 5>  
<1, 6, 5>  
<1, 9, 5>  
<3, 8, 5>
