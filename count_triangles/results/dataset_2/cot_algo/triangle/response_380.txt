Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (17, 7) (17, 19) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 8) (19, 17) (19, 18) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 15) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 11) (11, 18) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 6) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 16) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 6) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (6, 16) 

Response:
Based on the provided edges, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19  
Edges:
- 0: [8, 13, 14]
- 1: [2, 3, 12]
- 2: [1, 6, 9, 16]
- 3: [1, 7, 12, 14]
- 4: [6, 12, 16]
- 5: [9, 15]
- 6: [2, 4, 13, 16]
- 7: [3, 17]
- 8: [0, 9, 14, 15]
- 9: [2, 5, 8, 13]
- 11: [18]
- 12: [1, 3, 4]
- 13: [0, 6, 9, 16]
- 14: [0, 3, 8]
- 15: [5, 8, 15, 18]
- 16: [2, 4, 13, 15]
- 17: [7, 19]
- 18: [11, 15, 19]
- 19: [17, 18]

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Sort nodes by their number of connections in ascending order:
Nodes by degree: 11, 17, 19, 0, 1, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8, 3, 12, 14, 16, 13, 15, 9, 18
2. Relabel the nodes accordingly for easier reference.

Triangles found:
<0, 8, 14>
<1, 3, 12>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 13, 16>
<3, 14, 8>
<4, 12, 16>
<6, 13, 16>
<8, 15, 18>

Total number of triangles: [9]
