Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 14) (14, 15) (14, 18) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 17) (9, 6) (9, 1) (2, 13) (2, 7) (18, 14) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 10) (4, 17) (4, 6) (4, 10) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 2) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (19, 11) (19, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 19) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 2) (13, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, relabel the vertices based on their sorted order. 

After relabeling the vertices, the new order is as follows:
Node 0 (Degree 3)
Node 7 (Degree 1)
Node 10 (Degree 2)
Node 18 (Degree 2)
Node 2 (Degree 2)
Node 4 (Degree 4)
Node 14 (Degree 4)
Node 19 (Degree 4)
Node 6 (Degree 4)
Node 8 (Degree 3)
Node 9 (Degree 4)
Node 1 (Degree 4)
Node 3 (Degree 4)
Node 17 (Degree 3)
Node 5 (Degree 5)
Node 11 (Degree 6)
Node 12 (Degree 5)
Node 15 (Degree 3)
Node 13 (Degree 5)
Node 16 (Degree 2)

Now, we will count the triangles using the given edges. Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- We will start with the edge (3, 0) because node 3 has the lowest label and fewer connections than node 0.
- Then, the triangles involving this edge will be formed using shared connections with node 3 and node 0.
- We will continue this process for each edge, counting the number of triangles formed in the graph.

By following this method, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9]. 

And the unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 9, 17>
<1, 9, 4>
<3, 1, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<11, 12, 19>
