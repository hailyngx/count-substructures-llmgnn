Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 4) (10, 1) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 4) (17, 7) (7, 17) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 16) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 9) (9, 19) (9, 4) (4, 15) (4, 17) (4, 9) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 18) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 0) (11, 5) (11, 19) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 13) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 13) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 18) (18, 16) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 13) 

Response:
The graph is constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: (3, 15), (3, 14), (3, 5), (3, 8), (15, 0), (15, 4), (10, 1), (17, 6), (17, 0), (17, 4), (17, 7), (2, 8), (2, 5), (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 6), (5, 2), (5, 19), (5, 11), (5, 16), (19, 11), (19, 9), (9, 4), (4, 17), (4, 9), (16, 1), (16, 18), (1, 10), (1, 18), (6, 17), (6, 0), (11, 19), (14, 13)

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Node 10: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 17: degree 5
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- (5, 2): Forms a triangle with nodes 19 and 11: <5, 2, 19>
- (8, 2): Forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 0: <8, 2, 6>
- (3, 8): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 15: <3, 8, 15>

Total number of triangles: [3]
