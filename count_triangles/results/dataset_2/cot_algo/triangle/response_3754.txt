Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 9) (21, 0) (21, 23) (21, 29) (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 19) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 28) (25, 24) (12, 17) (12, 15) (12, 9) (27, 7) (27, 9) (5, 23) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (22, 26) (22, 0) (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 10) (28, 25) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 7) (17, 20) (17, 12) (13, 6) (13, 29) (13, 0) (19, 20) (19, 6) (0, 21) (0, 22) (0, 13) (0, 16) (16, 20) (16, 0) (16, 24) (16, 18) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 29) (11, 15) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (10, 8) (10, 26) (10, 9) (10, 23) (23, 21) (23, 5) (23, 10) (23, 18) (15, 12) (15, 11) (24, 25) (24, 16) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 23) (18, 29) (18, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (9, 27) (9, 28) (9, 10) (4, 14) (29, 21) (29, 13) (29, 11) (29, 18) (7, 1) (7, 27) (7, 28) (7, 14) (3, 2) (3, 18) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the given nodes and edges. Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will sort the vertices and proceed to count the number of triangles.

The sorted vertices are as follows:
Vertex 5 has degree 1.
Vertex 4 has degree 2.
Vertex 2 has degree 2.
Vertex 15 has degree 2.
Vertex 6 has degree 3.
Vertex 1 has degree 3.
Vertex 12 has degree 4.
Vertex 22 has degree 4.
Vertex 14 has degree 4.
Vertex 27 has degree 4.
Vertex 3 has degree 5.
Vertex 24 has degree 5.
Vertex 11 has degree 5.
Vertex 26 has degree 5.
Vertex 18 has degree 5.
Vertex 19 has degree 5.
Vertex 20 has degree 5.
Vertex 21 has degree 5.
Vertex 25 has degree 5.
Vertex 16 has degree 5.
Vertex 0 has degree 6.
Vertex 10 has degree 6.
Vertex 13 has degree 6.
Vertex 23 has degree 6.
Vertex 17 has degree 6.
Vertex 28 has degree 6.
Vertex 7 has degree 6.
Vertex 9 has degree 7.
Vertex 29 has degree 7.
Vertex 8 has degree 8.

Proceeding with the edges, we find the following triangles:
[<9, 10, 23>, <9, 10, 28>, <10, 11, 26>, <10, 11, 29>, <10, 18, 23>, <11, 14, 29>, <11, 15, 12>, <13, 6, 18>, <13, 0, 21>, <14, 7, 27>, <18, 16, 24>, <18, 16, 25>, <19, 6, 18>, <20, 16, 24>, <20, 16, 25>, <20, 17, 12>, <20, 17, 12>, <20, 17, 12>, <21, 0, 22>, <23, 10, 26>]

There are 20 unique triangles in total. So, the answer is:
[20]
