Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 11) (9, 24) (9, 23) (26, 24) (26, 23) (26, 2) (26, 28) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 24) (2, 26) (2, 3) (2, 20) (2, 14) (29, 19) (29, 16) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 21) (22, 18) (22, 4) (22, 28) (22, 12) (20, 2) (20, 25) (20, 14) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 8) (0, 16) (8, 25) (8, 23) (8, 19) (8, 6) (8, 1) (23, 9) (23, 26) (23, 8) (23, 6) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 12) (17, 6) (17, 12) (24, 9) (24, 26) (24, 15) (24, 11) (24, 13) (5, 13) (13, 24) (13, 5) (13, 11) (21, 18) (1, 15) (1, 8) (1, 28) (1, 10) (7, 3) (7, 25) (7, 11) (19, 29) (19, 8) (16, 29) (16, 0) (12, 22) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 10) (11, 9) (11, 24) (11, 13) (11, 7) (6, 8) (6, 23) (6, 17) (10, 1) (10, 12) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 20) (28, 26) (28, 22) (28, 20) (28, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the graph efficiently. 

Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will follow the steps for the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
   Nodes with their respective degrees:
   (0: 1), (5: 1), (6: 3), (9: 3), (16: 2), (19: 2), (21: 1), (25: 3), (29: 2), (17: 2), (18: 4), (20: 4), (22: 4), (4: 4), (8: 5), (1: 4), (10: 2), (12: 4), (2: 4), (3: 4), (7: 3), (11: 4), (13: 3), (15: 3), (23: 4), (24: 5), (26: 4), (14: 3), (28: 4)

2. Relabel the vertices according to their sorted degrees:
   (0: 1), (5: 2), (6: 3), (9: 4), (16: 5), (19: 6), (21: 7), (25: 8), (29: 9), (17: 10), (18: 11), (20: 12), (22: 13), (4: 14), (8: 15), (1: 16), (10: 17), (12: 18), (2: 19), (3: 20), (7: 21), (11: 22), (13: 23), (15: 24), (23: 25), (24: 26), (26: 27), (14: 28), (28: 29)

3. Calculate the total number of triangles and list unique triangles found in the graph:
   Number of triangles: [40]
   
   Unique triangles:
   <9, 11, 24>
   <9, 11, 13>
   <9, 15, 24>
   <9, 23, 24>
   <16, 0, 29>
   <8, 6, 23>
   <16, 29, 19>
   <4, 12, 22>
   <20, 2, 26>
   <20, 2, 3>
   <8, 1, 15>
   <2, 3, 14>
   <2, 14, 20>
   <22, 4, 18>
   <22, 4, 12>
   <22, 4, 17>
   <25, 20, 28>
   <25, 7, 11>
   <1, 10, 12>
   <8, 25, 7>
   <23, 9, 26>
   <23, 9, 24>
   <26, 24, 11>
   <13, 5, 24>
   <21, 18, 22>
   <1, 15, 3>
   <1, 15, 24>
   <26, 23, 9>
   <1, 15, 8>
   <2, 28, 1>
   <2, 28, 20>
