Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on the number of connections each node has. In this case, we will list the nodes based on their degrees from least to most connections:

Nodes: (0) - degree: 4
        (6) - degree: 4
        (9) - degree: 4
        (7) - degree: 4
        (2) - degree: 5
        (3) - degree: 5
        (5) - degree: 5
        (8) - degree: 6
        (4) - degree: 6
        (1) - degree: 6

Next, we will analyze each edge in the graph based on the Degree-Based Ordering:

1. Edge (1, 3): Both nodes 1 and 3 have degree 6. No triangle is formed.
2. Edge (1, 2): Node 1 has degree 6, and node 2 has degree 5. No triangle is formed.
3. Edge (1, 5): Node 1 has degree 6, and node 5 has degree 5. No triangle is formed.
4. Edge (1, 4): Node 1 has degree 6, and node 4 has degree 6. Potential triangle: (1, 4, 8).
5. Edge (1, 0): Node 1 has degree 6, and node 0 has degree 4. No triangle is formed.
6. Edge (3, 1): This edge was already covered above when analyzing edge (1, 3).
7. Edge (3, 7): Node 3 has degree 5, and node 7 has degree 4. No triangle is formed.
8. Edge (3, 8): Node 3 has degree 5, and node 8 has degree 6. No triangle is formed.
9. Edge (4, 1): This edge was already covered above when analyzing edge (1, 4).
10. Edge (4, 8): Node 4 has degree 6, and node 8 has degree 6. Potential triangle: (4, 8, 9).

19. Edge (5, 2): Node 5 has degree 5, and node 2 has degree 5. No triangle is formed.
20. Edge (5, 0): Node 5 has degree 5, and node 0 has degree 4. No triangle is formed.
21. Edge (5, 7): Node 5 has degree 5, and node 7 has degree 4. No triangle is formed.
