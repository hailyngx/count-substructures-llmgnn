Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Degree of each node:
0: 4
1: 5
2: 5
3: 4
4: 3
5: 5
6: 5
7: 4
8: 1
9: 4

Edges (sorted by nodes with lower degree):
(8, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (0, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3), (3, 7), (3, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (5, 6), (5, 9), (9, 6), (9, 5), (6, 2), (6, 3), (1, 7), (1, 5), (2, 4), (0, 4), (0, 2), (0, 5), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 7), (7, 1), (7, 5), (5, 1), (6, 7), (6, 9), (9, 1), (9, 0), (6, 5), (6, 7), (5, 7), (5, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1)

Total number of triangles: [11]
Unique triangles: <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 0>, <2, 4, 3>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 1, 7>, <5, 6, 7>
