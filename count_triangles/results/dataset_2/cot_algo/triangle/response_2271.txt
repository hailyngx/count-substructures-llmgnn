Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (3), (6), (8)
- 1: (3), (6), (8), (9)
- 2: (3), (5), (8), (9)
- 3: (0), (1), (2), (4)
- 4: (3), (6)
- 5: (2), (5), (6), (7), (8)
- 6: (0), (1), (4), (5), (7), (8)
- 7: (5), (6), (8), (9)
- 8: (0), (1), (2), (5), (6), (7), (9)
- 9: (1), (2), (7)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the nodes by the number of connections:
Nodes in order: 0, 4, 7, 9, 2, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6

Now, let's count the triangles:
Triangles: [18]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 1>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>
