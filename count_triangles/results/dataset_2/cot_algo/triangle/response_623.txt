Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 18) (16, 19) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 14) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 6) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 18) (17, 0) (17, 9) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 14) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 15) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 6) (0, 2) (0, 17) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 12) (9, 15) (9, 17) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort the nodes based on the number of connections they have from least to most:
Node 11 - 3 edges
Node 16 - 2 edges
Node 1 - 2 edges
Node 3 - 3 edges
Node 10 - 3 edges
Node 2 - 3 edges
Node 8 - 3 edges
Node 5 - 4 edges
Node 13 - 4 edges
Node 15 - 3 edges
Node 17 - 2 edges
Node 12 - 4 edges
Node 18 - 3 edges
Node 19 - 3 edges
Node 0 - 2 edges
Node 14 - 4 edges
Node 9 - 2 edges
Node 6 - 3 edges
Node 4 - 4 edges
Node 7 - 4 edges

2. Relabel the nodes in increasing order:
Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, ..., Node 19

3. Count the triangles:
The total number of triangles is [18].
The unique triangles found are <0, 12, 14>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 6, 13>, <0, 17, 9>, <1, 15, 18>, <2, 10, 8>, <2, 5, 13>, <3, 12, 5>, <4, 12, 14>, <5, 12, 14>, <5, 13, 6>, <7, 4, 12>, <7, 4, 6>, <8, 10, 2>, <13, 5, 12>, <13, 6, 19>, <14, 7, 4>, <15, 1, 18>.
