Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 24) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 20) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 16) (8, 4) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 11) (21, 14) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 19) (28, 13) (19, 15) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 1) (26, 19) (26, 17) (10, 21) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 20) (2, 22) (2, 14) (22, 2) (22, 0) (22, 29) (22, 7) (0, 28) (0, 22) (0, 29) (0, 23) (16, 4) (16, 14) (6, 18) (24, 5) (24, 13) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 20) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 10) (7, 22) (7, 29) (29, 22) (29, 0) (29, 7) (29, 11) (25, 9) (13, 28) (13, 24) (23, 0) (23, 1) (23, 20) (1, 19) (1, 23) (17, 26) (17, 11) (11, 5) (11, 21) (11, 29) (11, 17) (27, 3) (20, 9) (20, 10) (20, 18) (20, 23) (20, 14) (14, 5) (14, 21) (14, 2) (14, 16) (14, 20) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied to count the number of triangles. First, we will list the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:

Vertices: 
3, 6, 13, 16, 1, 2, 26, 17, 8, 24, 25, 16, 9, 22, 29, 7, 18, 0, 10, 27, 4, 23, 6, 28, 15, 19, 1, 21, 5, 11

After numbering the nodes from 0 to 29, we will list the unique triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 5]
<2, 7, 22>
<4, 14, 16>
<7, 10, 21>
<7, 14, 20>
<9, 18, 20>
