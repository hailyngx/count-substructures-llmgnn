Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 1) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 16) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 19) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 0) (15, 10) (0, 9) (0, 16) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 0) (18, 9) (18, 17) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 12) (17, 4) (17, 18) (17, 19) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 12) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 19) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 19) 

Response:
The vertices and their connections sorted by degree from least to most are as follows:

Node 0: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 18: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 15: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 16: Degree 4
Node 17: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 5
Node 14: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 13: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 19: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

For the edge (4, 16), proceed since node 4 has fewer connections than node 16. Shared connections with (4, 16): 0
For the edge (4, 17), proceed since node 4 has fewer connections than node 17. Shared connections with (4, 17): 0
For the edge (7, 11), proceed since node 7 has fewer connections than node 11. Shared connections with (7, 11): 1
For the edge (7, 1), proceed since node 7 has fewer connections than node 1. Shared connections with (7, 1): 1
For the edge (10, 15), proceed since node 10 has fewer connections than node 15. Shared connections with (10, 15): 0
For the edge (10, 1), proceed since node 10 has fewer connections than node 1. Shared connections with (10, 1): 2
For the edge (10, 13), proceed since node 10 has fewer connections than node 13. Shared connections with (10, 13): 1
For the edge (11, 7), proceed since node 7 has fewer connections than node 11. Shared connections with (11, 7): 1
For the edge (11, 3), proceed since node 11 has fewer connections than node 3. Shared connections with (11, 3): 1
For the edge (11, 1), proceed since node 7 has fewer connections than node 1. Shared connections with (11, 1): 2
For the edge (2, 8), proceed since node 2 has fewer connections than node 8. Shared connections with (2, 8): 1
For the edge (2, 5), proceed since node 2 has fewer connections than node 5. Shared connections with (2, 5): 1
For the edge (2, 9), proceed since node 2 has fewer connections than node 9. Shared connections with (2, 9): 2
