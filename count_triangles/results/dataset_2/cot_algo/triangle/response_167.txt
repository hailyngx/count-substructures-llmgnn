Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 0) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 14) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 6) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 0), (5, 10), (5, 7), (9, 10), (9, 3), (1, 3), (1, 14), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 14), (3, 6), (10, 11), (10, 6), (10, 12), (10, 13), (11, 7), (4, 12), (8, 2), (2, 7), (0, 13), (12, 14), (6, 13)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree of connectivity:
2 (Degree: 2)
13 (Degree: 2)
14 (Degree: 2)
1 (Degree: 3)
4 (Degree: 3)
6 (Degree: 3)
8 (Degree: 3)
11 (Degree: 3)
12 (Degree: 3)
0 (Degree: 4)
7 (Degree: 4)
9 (Degree: 4)
3 (Degree: 5)
10 (Degree: 6)
5 (Degree: 6)

Next, we will go through the edges based on the degree-based ordering to count the number of triangles:

Triangles: [9]

The unique triangles found are: <3, 1, 4>.
