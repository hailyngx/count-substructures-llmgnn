Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 16) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 2) (4, 1) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 0) (18, 12) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 8) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 19) (7, 10) (7, 8) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 14) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 2) (16, 9) (16, 17) (16, 14) (15, 4) (15, 19) (17, 6) (17, 11) (17, 16) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (14, 19) (14, 2) (14, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles requires sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Here is the reordered list of nodes based on their degree:

Nodes: [7, 19, 3, 5, 6, 16, 1, 10, 0, 8, 13, 2, 12, 4, 14, 17, 11, 18, 9, 15]

Now, we will count the number of triangles by checking shared connections between vertices of each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. 
After going through all edges, we found the following unique triangles:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 18>
<2, 11, 12>
<2, 11, 13>
<3, 5, 13>
<4, 13, 15>
<4, 13, 5>
<4, 13, 18>
<7, 8, 10>
<14, 16, 19>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
