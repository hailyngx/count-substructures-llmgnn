Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 2) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 2) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 19) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 2) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (7, 8) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 19) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 6) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 14) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 1) (1, 18) (1, 8) (11, 0) (11, 13) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 16) (4, 15) (4, 9) (4, 6) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 18) (14, 9) (14, 13) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (13, 11) (13, 14) (19, 10) (19, 16) (19, 6) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 19) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
(0, 11), (0, 5), (0, 8)
(1, 18), (1, 8)
(2, 3), (2, 15), (2, 17), (2, 16)
(3, 17), (3, 6), (3, 2)
(4, 15), (4, 9), (4, 6)
(5, 15), (5, 0), (5, 18)
(6, 3), (6, 12), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 19)
(7, 8)
(8, 0), (8, 7), (8, 1), (8, 6)
(9, 16), (9, 18), (9, 4), (9, 14)
(10, 17), (10, 12), (10, 19)
(11, 0), (11, 13)
(12, 10), (12, 16), (12, 6)
(13, 11), (13, 14)
(14, 9), (14, 13)
(15, 5), (15, 4), (15, 2)
(16, 12), (16, 2), (16, 9), (16, 19)
(17, 3), (17, 10), (17, 2)
(18, 9), (18, 5), (18, 1)
(19, 10), (19, 16), (19, 6)

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph.
