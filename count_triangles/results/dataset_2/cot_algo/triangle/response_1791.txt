Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 19) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 15) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 18) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 12) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 14) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 11) (15, 11) (15, 13) (16, 0) (16, 1) (12, 2) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 5) (19, 9) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 13) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 11) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the graph.

The nodes and their respective connections are as follows:

Node 0: 6, 2, 16, 18
Node 1: 8, 5, 13, 16
Node 2: 4, 0, 12
Node 3: 4, 10, 11
Node 4: 7, 3, 17, 2
Node 5: 7, 18, 1, 14
Node 6: 17, 14, 0
Node 7: 4, 5, 8
Node 8: 7, 9, 1
Node 9: 8, 18, 19
Node 10: 3, 13
Node 11: 3, 14, 17, 15
Node 12: 2
Node 13: 10, 1, 15, 14
Node 14: 6, 11, 5, 13
Node 15: 11, 13
Node 16: 0, 1
Node 17: 4, 6, 11
Node 18: 9, 0, 5
Node 19: 9

Calculating the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <0, 5, 18>
- Triangle <0, 6, 17>
- Triangle <0, 16, 1>
- Triangle <1, 5, 8>
- Triangle <1, 5, 13>
- Triangle <1, 13, 14>
- Triangle <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle <3, 4, 10>
- Triangle <3, 4, 11>
- Triangle <3, 10, 13>
- Triangle <4, 7, 8>
- Triangle <4, 11, 17>
- Triangle <5, 7, 14>
- Triangle <5, 14, 13>
- Triangle <9, 18, 19>
- Triangle <11, 14, 17>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
