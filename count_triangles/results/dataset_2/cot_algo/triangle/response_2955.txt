Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 18) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 12) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 14) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 9) (7, 16) (7, 5) (7, 13) (16, 7) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 15) (12, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 4) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 18) (9, 13) (18, 3) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 17) (0, 3) (0, 17) (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 17) (14, 1) (14, 2) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 0) (17, 11) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Sort the vertices by their connections in ascending order and relabel them.
- Update the edges according to the new vertex labels and only consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

After relabeling the vertices:
- (0) -> 4 connections
- (1) -> 4 connections
- (2) -> 4 connections
- (3) -> 2 connections
- (4) -> 3 connections
- (5) -> 2 connections
- (6) -> 4 connections
- (7) -> 3 connections
- (8) -> 4 connections
- (9) -> 4 connections
- (10) -> 2 connections
- (11) -> 3 connections
- (12) -> 2 connections
- (13) -> 2 connections
- (14) -> 2 connections
- (15) -> 3 connections
- (16) -> 1 connection
- (17) -> 4 connections
- (18) -> 4 connections
- (19) -> 4 connections

Considering only the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- (3, 0)
- (15, 1)
- (1, 6)
- (8, 6)
- (7, 5)
- (2, 0)
- (12, 10)
- (14, 10)
- (8, 4)
- (13, 5)

Total number of triangles: [4]
