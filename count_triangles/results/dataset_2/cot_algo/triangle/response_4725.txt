Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
The graph with the nodes and edges listed can be visually represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (5, 9), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 10), (5, 14), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 13)
- 1: (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 1), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 14), (1, 12)
- 2: (4, 7), (3, 2), (2, 9), (2, 3)
- 3: (7, 6), (10, 3), (3, 5), (3, 1)
- 4: (4, 7), (4, 14), (11, 4)
- 5: (10, 5), (5, 9), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 14)
- 6: (7, 6), (0, 6), (6, 12), (6, 13), (6, 14)
- 7: (4, 7), (1, 7)
- 8: (9, 8), (11, 8)
- 9: (9, 8)
- 10: (10, 5), (10, 3), (11, 10), (10, 12)
- 11: (4, 11), (11, 10), (11, 14), (11, 13), (13, 11)
- 12: (12, 1), (12, 10), (6, 12)
- 13: (0, 13), (13, 11), (13, 6)
- 14: (5, 14), (14, 4), (1, 14), (14, 11), (14, 6)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):
Nodes by degree: [8, 9, 1, 2, 7, 5, 3, 6, 4, 0, 10, 11, 14, 12, 13]

As per the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Then we will count the number of triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [15]

Unique triangles:
<0, 5, 14>
<0, 6, 13>
<1, 3, 10>
<1, 3, 14>
<1, 7, 14>
<2, 3, 9>
<4, 5, 14>
<4, 7, 14>
<4, 11, 14>
<5, 9, 14>
<6, 7, 14>
<6, 12, 13>
<8, 9, 11>
<10, 11, 14>
<10, 12, 14>
