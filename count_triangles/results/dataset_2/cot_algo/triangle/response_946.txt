Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Below is the list of nodes (vertices) and their respective degrees:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 5: 6 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 4: 6 connections

Next, we will start counting the triangles following the steps mentioned earlier. 

- Start with the vertices with the lowest degrees:
    - Node 0 (2 connections): No triangle
    - Node 2 (4 connections): No triangle
    - Node 6 (4 connections): No triangle
    - Node 9 (4 connections): No triangle
    - Node 7 (4 connections): No triangle

- Moving on to the next set of vertices:
    - Node 3 (5 connections) and Node 1 (6 connections) share connections with Node 5.
        - Triangle <3, 1, 5> is found.
    - Node 3 (5 connections) shares connections with Node 4 and Node 9.
        - Triangle <3, 4, 9> is found.
    - Node 3 (5 connections) shares connections with Node 6.
        - Triangle <3, 6, 1> is found.
    - Node 1 (6 connections) shares connections with Node 0, Node 2, and Node 5.
        - Triangle <1, 0, 7> is found.
        - Triangle <1, 2, 5> is found.
    - Node 5 (6 connections) shares connections with Node 8.
        - Triangle <5, 8, 2> is found.

- Lastly, checking the remaining vertices:
    - Node 4 (6 connections) shares connections with Node 5.
        - Triangle <4, 5, 1> is found.
        - Triangle <4, 5, 6> is found.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6] with unique triangles being <3, 1, 5>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 1>, <1, 0, 7>, <1, 2, 5>, and <5, 8, 2>.
