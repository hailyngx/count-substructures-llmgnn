Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 19) (11, 9) (11, 15) (4, 18) (4, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (19, 10) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 0) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 16) (16, 7) (16, 14) (12, 1) (12, 10) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 17) (17, 6) (17, 15) (14, 3) (14, 16) (14, 15) (14, 13) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 15) (0, 13) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 14) (15, 0) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 0) (9, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order. 

Here is the sorted list of nodes with their respective degrees:
Node 11 - Degree 1
Node 16 - Degree 2
Node 9 - Degree 2
Node 1 - Degree 2
Node 5 - Degree 2
Node 12 - Degree 2
Node 17 - Degree 2
Node 4 - Degree 2
Node 3 - Degree 3
Node 10 - Degree 3
Node 8 - Degree 3
Node 6 - Degree 3
Node 7 - Degree 4
Node 14 - Degree 4
Node 2 - Degree 5
Node 18 - Degree 5
Node 19 - Degree 5
Node 0 - Degree 5
Node 15 - Degree 5
Node 13 - Degree 5

Now, we will count the triangles based on the edges provided considering the lower labeled node to have fewer connections:

1. (1, 3) - Node 1 and Node 3 both connect to Node 2, forming a triangle <1, 3, 2>.
