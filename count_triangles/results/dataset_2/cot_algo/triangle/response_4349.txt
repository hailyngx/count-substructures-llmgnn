Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with nodes and edges based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: (9, 7, 1, 3, 8)
- 1: (5, 7, 6, 2, 0)
- 2: (9, 1, 3)
- 3: (5, 4, 0, 2)
- 4: (9, 7, 8, 3)
- 5: (6, 1, 3, 7)
- 6: (5, 9, 1)
- 7: (5, 4, 0, 8, 1)
- 8: (4, 7, 0)
- 9: (6, 4, 2, 0)

Now, let's list the nodes based on the number of connections they have in ascending order:
- Node 2 (degree 3)
- Node 8 (degree 3)
- Node 9 (degree 4)
- Node 0 (degree 5)
- Node 3 (degree 4)
- Node 4 (degree 5)
- Node 6 (degree 3)
- Node 1 (degree 5)
- Node 7 (degree 5)
- Node 5 (degree 4)

Now, we'll calculate the triangles as per the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. For each edge, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
2. Check for shared connections between the two vertices to form triangles.

Triangles found in the graph: 
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <4, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [10]
