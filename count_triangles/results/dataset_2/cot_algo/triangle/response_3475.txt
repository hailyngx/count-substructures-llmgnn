Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's start by computing the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 6, 11, 12, 7, 1, 5, 4, 10, 0, 14, 2, 13, 8, 9, 3.

Based on the sorted vertices, let's count the triangles formed by the edges:

1. Triangle <6, 4, 0>
2. Triangle <11, 2, 3>
3. Triangle <12, 0, 7>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
