Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 10) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 11) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 14) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 
(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 14),
(1, 3), (1, 8), (1, 10), (1, 11), (1, 12),
(2, 3), (2, 9), (2, 11),
(3, 4), (3, 5),
(4, 6), (4, 14),
(5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 9), (5, 14),
(6, 12),
(7, 8), (7, 14),
(8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 13),
(9, 12), (9, 13),
(10, 11), (10, 13),
(11, 2),
(12, 1)

By sorting the nodes based on their degree, we get the following sequence:
0(4), 7(2), 2(3), 6(2), 10(3), 12(2), 11(2), 14(2), 4(3), 13(3), 8(4), 1(5), 3(5), 5(5), 9(5)

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Triangles:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <0, 4, 6>
4. <0, 4, 14>
5. <3, 4, 6>
6. <4, 6, 14>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
