Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (6, 17) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 1) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 16) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 15) (8, 6) (8, 5) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 15) (0, 3) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 13) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (1, 9) (1, 15) (1, 2) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 1) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 7) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 3) (16, 10) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 3) (11, 13) (11, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in the graph efficiently. 

First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
(14, 17), (14, 2), (17, 14), (17, 10), (17, 6), (6, 17), (6, 8), (9, 4), (9, 15), (9, 1), 
(10, 17), (10, 12), (10, 13), (10, 5), (10, 16), (4, 9), (4, 18), (4, 15), 
(8, 6), (8, 5), (18, 4), (18, 19), (18, 15), (0, 3), (5, 10), (5, 8), (5, 13), 
(13, 10), (13, 5), (13, 11), (13, 3), (1, 9), (1, 15), (1, 2), (15, 9), (15, 4), 
(15, 18), (15, 1), (19, 18), (19, 11), (19, 2), (19, 7), (2, 14), (2, 1), (2, 19), 
(2, 12), (2, 7), (12, 10), (12, 2), (12, 3), (16, 10), (3, 0), (3, 13), (3, 12), 
(3, 7), (7, 19), (7, 2), (7, 3), (11, 13), (11, 19)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order:

Degree: 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5

With the sorted nodes, we will count the number of triangles formed based on the lower labeled vertex with fewer connections. 

After counting the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles is [5].

The unique triangles found are: <1, 9, 15>, <2, 10, 12>, <2, 10, 13>, <2, 12, 3>, <5, 8, 6>.
