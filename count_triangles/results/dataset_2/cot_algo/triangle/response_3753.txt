Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 10) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 13) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 7) 

Response:
The nodes can be sorted based on their degrees as follows:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 11: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 1: degree 5
Node 10: degree 5
Node 12: degree 5
Node 3: degree 6
Node 9: degree 6
Node 7: degree 6
Node 5: degree 8
Node 14: degree 8

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 
Counting the triangles formed by these edges, we find:
