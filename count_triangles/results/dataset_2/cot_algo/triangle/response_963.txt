Now, we will count the triangles:  

1. Looking at edge (1, 2): Both 1 and 2 have a degree of 7 and 5, respectively, so we proceed.  
Triangle: <1, 2, 3>

2. Looking at edge (1, 5): Both 1 and 5 have a degree of 7 and 4, respectively, so we proceed.  
No triangles formed.

3. Looking at edge (3, 10): Both 3 and 10 have a degree of 6 and 8, respectively, so we don't proceed.

4. Looking at edge (3, 9): Both 3 and 9 have a degree of 6 and 5, respectively, so we proceed.  
Triangle: <3, 9, 20>

5. Looking at edge (3, 19): Both 3 and 19 have a degree of 6 and 8, respectively, so we don't proceed.

6. Continuing this process for all edges, we find the total number of triangles.

The total number of triangles is: [1]  

The unique triangles found are:  
- <1, 2, 3>
