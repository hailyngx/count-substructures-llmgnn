Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to first sort the nodes by their number of connections from least to most. 

The sorted list of nodes is: (5, 8), (9, 5), (1, 4), (7, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (0, 6), (6, 5), (8, 3), (4, 5).

Now, we will go through each edge keeping in mind to consider only the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

Using the given edges, we can find the triangles in the graph.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [17].

The unique triangles found are: <4, 6, 9>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 7>.
