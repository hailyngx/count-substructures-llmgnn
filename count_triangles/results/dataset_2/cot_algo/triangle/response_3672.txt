Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for this graph is as follows:  

1. Node 5: 4 connections  
2. Node 9: 5 connections  
3. Node 4: 4 connections  
4. Node 7: 4 connections  
5. Node 1: 4 connections  
6. Node 3: 3 connections  
7. Node 8: 2 connections  
8. Node 6: 3 connections  
9. Node 0: 5 connections  
10. Node 2: 6 connections  

Now, we will go through each edge carefully following the rules mentioned earlier to count the number of triangles.  

[Total number of triangles: 10]

<> Unique triangles:  
<1, 9, 5>  
<1, 9, 2>  
<1, 9, 7>  
<1, 7, 0>  
<1, 7, 2>  
<1, 2, 0>  
<3, 9, 6>  
<3, 6, 0>  
<2, 9, 5>  
<2, 9, 1>
