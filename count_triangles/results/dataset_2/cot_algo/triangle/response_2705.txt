Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows:  

Vertices: 3, 9, 5, 6, 1, 2, 0, 4, 8, 7  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections than the other vertex.
