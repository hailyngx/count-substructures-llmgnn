The graph has the following nodes with their respective connections:
- Node 0: 23, 7, 16
- Node 1: 26, 25, 7
- Node 2: 22
- Node 3: 21, 12, 18
- Node 4: 13, 28, 29
- Node 5: 28, 19
- Node 6: 9, 7, 10, 8
- Node 7: 6, 1, 0
- Node 8: 23, 21, 18, 6
- Node 9: 6, 29
- Node 10: 6, 23, 16, 19
- Node 11: 14, 27, 12
- Node 12: 23, 26, 29, 11, 3
- Node 13: 4, 21, 17
- Node 14: 22, 11, 18
- Node 15: 22, 25
- Node 16: 0, 10, 20
- Node 17: 13, 25
- Node 18: 8, 14, 3
- Node 19: 29, 5, 10
- Node 20: 21, 16
- Node 21: 23, 8, 13, 20
- Node 22: 15, 2, 14, 27
- Node 23: 8, 10, 0, 12
- Node 25: 15, 1, 17
- Node 26: 1, 27, 12
- Node 27: 26, 28, 22, 11
- Node 28: 4, 27, 5
- Node 29: 9, 4, 19, 12

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted nodes are:
2 < 15 < 17 < 16 < 20 < 5 < 9 < 14 < 18 < 3 < 0 < 1 < 11 < 10 < 4 < 19 < 8 < 7 < 25 < 6 < 21 < 12 < 28 < 22 < 27 < 29 < 13 < 23 < 26 < 

There are 56 triangles in the graph, which are:
<7, 0, 1>, <7, 0, 23>, <7, 1, 26>, <7, 1, 25>, <7, 6, 9>, <7, 6, 10>, <7, 6, 8>, <7, 6, 0>, <7, 8, 6>, <7, 8, 23>, <0, 23, 8>, <0, 23, 10>, <0, 23, 16>, <1, 26, 12>, <1, 25, 17>, <1, 25, 15>, <6, 9, 29>, <6, 9, 4>, <6, 9, 12>, <6, 10, 23>, <6, 10...0>, <14, 22, 27>, <14, 11, 12>, <15, 22, 2>, <18, 8, 6>, <18, 14, 22>, <18, 14, 11>, <21, 8, 23>, <21, 20, 16>, <21, 13, 4>, <22, 14, 11>, <22, 27, 11>, <22, 27, 26>, <23, 12, 29>, <23, 12, 11>, <23, 10, 19>, <25, 17, 13>, <27, 11, 14>, <27, 11, 12> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [56].
