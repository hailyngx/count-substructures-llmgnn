Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: 4, 2
- 1: 6, 3, 4, 7
- 2: 9, 6, 3, 4, 0
- 3: 5, 9, 6, 1, 7, 2
- 4: 6, 1, 0, 2
- 5: 9, 8, 0, 3
- 6: 9, 1, 3, 2, 4
- 7: 1, 3, 8
- 8: 5, 7
- 9: 5, 6, 2, 3

Now, let's count the number of triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by degree: 0 < 8 < 7 < 5 < 1 < 4 < 2 < 9 < 6 < 3

Triangles: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 7>
Triangles found: [2]
