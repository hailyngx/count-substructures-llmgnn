Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
Nodes sorted based on their degree:
```
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
```
