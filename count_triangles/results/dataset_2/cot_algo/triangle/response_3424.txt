Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 0) (15, 14) (6, 7) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 2) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 11) (17, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (0, 15) (0, 7) (14, 15) (14, 1) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 18) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (19, 4) (8, 3) (8, 17) (8, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 19) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 8) (16, 3) (18, 10) (18, 13) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 16: degree 1
Node 19: degree 1
Node 6: degree 1
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 18: degree 2
Node 11: degree 2
Node 12: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 10: degree 5
Node 4: degree 6
Node 9: degree 6
Node 17: degree 6
Node 13: degree 7
Node 15: degree 9
Node 3: degree 9

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will now count the triangles:
1. For edge (3, 15): 
   Shared connections = none

2. For edge (3, 16): 
   Shared connections = none

3. For edge (3, 13): 
   Shared connections = none

4. For edge (3, 5): 
   Shared connections = none

5. For edge (3, 8): 
   Shared connections = none

6. For edge (15, 7): 
   Shared connections = none

7. For edge (15, 9): 
   Shared connections = 7
   Therefore, a triangle is formed <9, 7, 15>.

8. For edge (15, 0): 
   Shared connections = none

9. For edge (15, 14): 
   Shared connections = none

10. For edge (6, 7): 
    Shared connections = none
    
11. For edge (9, 15):
    Shared connections = 7
    Therefore, a triangle is formed <9, 7, 15>.

12. For edge (9, 4):
    Shared connections = none

13. For edge (9, 7):
    Shared connections = none

14. For edge (9, 12):
    Shared connections = none

15. For edge (10, 18):
    Shared connections = none

16. For edge (10, 4):
    Shared connections = none

17. For edge (10, 2):
    Shared connections = none

18. For edge (17, 13):
    Shared connections = none

19. For edge (17, 8):
    Shared connections = none

20. For edge (17, 11):
    Shared connections = none

21. For edge (17, 4):
    Shared connections = none

22. For edge (5, 2):
    Shared connections = none

23. For edge (5, 12):
    Shared connections = none

24. For edge (0, 7):
    Shared connections = none

25. For edge (14, 1):
    Shared connections = none
    
26. For edge (7, 6):
    Shared connections = none

27. For edge (7, 9):
    Shared connections = 15
    Therefore, a triangle is formed <7, 9, 15>.

28. For edge (7, 0):
    Shared connections = none

29. For edge (7, 1):
    Shared connections = none

30. For edge (13, 17):
    Shared connections = none

31. For edge (13, 11):
    Shared connections = none

32. For edge (13, 18):
    Shared connections = none

33. For edge (1, 14):
    Shared connections = none

34. For edge (1, 2):
    Shared connections = none

35. For edge (2, 5):
    Shared connections = none

36. For edge (2, 1):
    Shared connections = none

37. For edge (11, 17):
    Shared connections = none

38. For edge (11, 13):
