Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. After relabeling the vertices, the sorted list of vertices is: 

Vertex 0: Degree 2
Vertex 18: Degree 1
Vertex 10: Degree 1
Vertex 5: Degree 3
Vertex 19: Degree 3
Vertex 16: Degree 2
Vertex 29: Degree 3
Vertex 8: Degree 2
Vertex 4: Degree 4
Vertex 12: Degree 4
Vertex 21: Degree 4
Vertex 27: Degree 4
Vertex 7: Degree 3
Vertex 20: Degree 4
Vertex 17: Degree 4
Vertex 2: Degree 3
Vertex 23: Degree 4
Vertex 6: Degree 4
Vertex 22: Degree 4
Vertex 1: Degree 4
Vertex 15: Degree 5
Vertex 24: Degree 4
Vertex 25: Degree 5
Vertex 11: Degree 2
Vertex 9: Degree 2
Vertex 13: Degree 2
Vertex 14: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 3
Vertex 26: Degree 2
