Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: 4, 1, 6, 8, 9
- 1: 4, 6, 5, 0
- 2: 7, 3, 5, 9
- 3: 6, 2, 8
- 4: 7, 0, 1, 6
- 5: 1, 6, 2
- 6: 4, 1, 3, 5, 0
- 7: 4, 2, 9, 8
- 8: 7, 3, 0, 9
- 9: 7, 0, 8, 2

Next, we will sort the vertices based on their degree from lowest to highest:

Nodes in order of degree: 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 1, 7, 0, 6, 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 8]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
