Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 0) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 10) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 0) (19, 12) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 4) (18, 19) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 7) (15, 16) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 7) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 16) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 13) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree (number of connections) are:  
Vertex 0: degree 4  
Vertex 1: degree 3  
Vertex 3: degree 2  
Vertex 7: degree 2  
Vertex 9: degree 2  
Vertex 15: degree 1  
Vertex 18: degree 1  
Vertex 17: degree 2  
Vertex 13: degree 3  
Vertex 5: degree 4  
Vertex 19: degree 5  
Vertex 10: degree 3  
Vertex 4: degree 5  
Vertex 12: degree 4  
Vertex 6: degree 4  
Vertex 8: degree 3  
Vertex 2: degree 5  
Vertex 11: degree 2  
Vertex 14: degree 5  
Vertex 16: degree 5  

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will now check the triangles formed by the edges in the graph.  

The total number of triangles in the graph is [12].  

The unique triangles found are:  
<5, 0, 19>  
<5, 4, 12>  
<5, 16, 19>  
<5, 10, 16>  
<19, 0, 13>  
<19, 12, 4>  
<19, 16, 10>  
<4, 12, 1>  
<4, 12, 10>  
<4, 12, 19>  
<4, 10, 16>  
<12, 1, 16>
