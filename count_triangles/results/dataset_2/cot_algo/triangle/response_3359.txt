Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 26) (11, 12) (11, 29) (11, 20) (16, 13) (16, 14) (15, 27) (15, 25) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 2) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 6) (22, 9) (22, 12) (23, 26) (23, 14) (23, 7) (23, 9) (2, 27) (2, 5) (2, 14) (18, 26) (18, 9) (18, 8) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 4) (28, 8) (28, 7) (26, 11) (26, 23) (26, 18) (26, 25) (9, 22) (9, 23) (9, 18) (9, 4) (17, 20) (17, 21) (20, 11) (20, 17) (20, 5) (0, 21) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 24) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 22) (12, 5) (8, 18) (8, 28) (8, 10) (8, 21) (19, 1) (19, 24) (5, 2) (5, 20) (5, 12) (5, 7) (25, 15) (25, 26) (21, 27) (21, 17) (21, 0) (21, 8) (21, 4) (29, 11) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 21) (7, 23) (7, 28) (7, 5) (7, 24) (24, 10) (24, 19) (24, 7) (24, 13) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 24) (14, 16) (14, 23) (14, 2) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: 
0, 3, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 28 have degree 1
1, 4, 7, 10, 16, 23, 24, 29 have degree 2
5, 6, 8, 9, 13, 14 have degree 3
2, 15, 25, 26, 27, 12, 11, 21 have degree 4

Next, we will label the vertices according to their degree:
Nodes with degree 1: 0 -> 0, 3 -> 1, 17 -> 2, 18 -> 3, 19 -> 4, 20 -> 5, 22 -> 6, 28 -> 7
Nodes with degree 2: 1 -> 8, 4 -> 9, 7 -> 10, 10 -> 11, 16 -> 12, 23 -> 13, 24 -> 14, 29 -> 15
Nodes with degree 3: 5 -> 16, 6 -> 17, 8 -> 18, 9 -> 19, 13 -> 20, 14 -> 21
Nodes with degree 4: 2 -> 22, 15 -> 23, 25 -> 24, 26 -> 25, 27 -> 26, 12 -> 27, 11 -> 28, 21 -> 29

Now we will go through each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
