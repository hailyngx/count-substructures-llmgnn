Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13) (18, 10) (18, 15) (19, 13) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 18) (3, 0) (17, 4) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 16) (8, 5) (8, 11) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 6) (2, 17) (2, 13) (9, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 16) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 6) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 15) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 13) (6, 12) (6, 16) (6, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be used to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

After sorting the vertices based on the number of connections (degree), the labels for the nodes will be as follows:
Node 3: 1 connection
Nodes 0, 2, 9, 7, 8, 18, 19: 2 connections
Nodes 1, 6, 5, 10, 11, 13, 15: 3 connections
Nodes 4, 12, 14, 17, 16: 4 connections

Now, we will check each edge to count the triangles:
1. (4, 7) forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 4, 7>
2. (4, 10) forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 4, 10>
3. (4, 14) forms a triangle with node 13: <4, 13, 14>
4. (4, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 16: <1, 4, 5> and <1, 4, 16>
5. (4, 17) forms a triangle with nodes 12 and 16: <12, 16, 17>
6. (7, 12) forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 16: <7, 12, 1> and <7, 12, 16>
7. (12, 17) forms a triangle with node 16: <12, 16, 17>
8. (12, 6) forms a triangle with node 11: <6, 11, 12>
9. (12, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 4, 5, and 16: <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 16>, <1, 5, 16>, <1, 12, 16>
10. (0, 10) forms a triangle with node 4: <0, 4, 10>
11. (0, 3) forms a triangle with node 14: <0, 3, 14>
12. (0, 11) forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 8: <0, 6, 11> and <0, 8, 11>
13. (14, 15) forms a triangle with node 13: <13, 14, 15>
14. (18, 15) forms a triangle with node 13: <13, 15, 18>
15. (5, 8) forms a triangle with node 11: <5, 8, 11>
16. (16, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 5: <1, 4, 16> and <1, 5, 16>
17. (16, 6) forms a triangle with node 11: <6, 11, 16>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
