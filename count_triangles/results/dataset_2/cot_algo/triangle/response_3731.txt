Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 8) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 11) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 4) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 10) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 11)
(1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 10), (1, 11)
(2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 12), (2, 13)
(3, 2), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 14)
(4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 9), (4, 11), (4, 12), (4, 13), (4, 14)
(5, 0), (5, 13), (5, 6)
(6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 10)
(7, 3), (7, 11), (7, 13), (7, 14)
(8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 10), (8, 12)
(9, 4), (9, 10)
(10, 1), (10, 6), (10, 8), (10, 9), (10, 12), (10, 13)
(11, 0), (11, 1), (11, 4), (11, 7)
(12, 2), (12, 4), (12, 8), (12, 10)
(13, 2), (13, 4), (13, 5), (13, 7), (13, 10)
(14, 3), (14, 4), (14, 7)

Next, we sort the nodes by their degree in ascending order:
(0: 3), (1: 4), (3: 4), (7: 4), (9: 2), (5: 3), (6: 3), (8: 4), (2: 5), (4: 7), (11: 4), (12: 4), (13: 5), (10: 6), (14: 3)

Now, we will count the triangles:
[26]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 11>
<0, 5, 13>
<1, 6, 10>
<1, 8, 3>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 12>
<2, 4, 13>
<3, 7, 11>
<3, 7, 14>
<4, 10, 12>
<4, 10, 13>
<4, 13, 7>
<4, 13, 10>
<7, 11, 4>
<8, 10, 12>
<10, 12, 4>

<11, 0, 1>
<11, 4, 7>
<12, 2, 4>
<13, 4, 10>
<13, 4, 7>
<14, 3, 7>
<14, 4, 13>
