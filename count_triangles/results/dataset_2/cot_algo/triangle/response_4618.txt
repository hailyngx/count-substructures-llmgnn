Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 22) (21, 20) (21, 29) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 22) (23, 26) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 15) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 15) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 24) (20, 21) (20, 17) (20, 18) (3, 7) (3, 22) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 12) (26, 23) (26, 25) (26, 6) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 25) (6, 26) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 27) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 24) (18, 20) (18, 10) (16, 17) (16, 4) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 22) (25, 26) (25, 11) (25, 28) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 19) (19, 14) (19, 4) (29, 21) (29, 24) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 24) (24, 17) (24, 14) (24, 29) (24, 10) (24, 28) (27, 6) (27, 10) (27, 28) (15, 5) (15, 13) (15, 6) (22, 1) (22, 8) (22, 3) (22, 12) (28, 25) (28, 24) (28, 27) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their degree and then relabeling them accordingly. 

After sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections), the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 16 has degree 2
- Node 18 has degree 2
- Node 19 has degree 2
- Node 20 has degree 4
- Node 21 has degree 2
- Node 23 has degree 2
- Node 28 has degree 3
- Node 29 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 10 has degree 4
- Node 14 has degree 4
- Node 24 has degree 5
- Node 27 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 3
- Node 12 has degree 3
- Node 25 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 11 has degree 4
- Node 17 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 13 has degree 5
- Node 15 has degree 3
- Node 22 has degree 4
- Node 26 has degree 4

Now, we will start counting the triangles.
