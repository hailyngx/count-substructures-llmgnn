Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 4) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 15) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 13) (3, 10) (3, 16) (11, 6) (11, 2) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 8) (8, 19) (8, 9) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (18, 14) (18, 0) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 2) (15, 7) (15, 5) (10, 3) (10, 13) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 16) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 18) (2, 17) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 16) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degrees is as follows:  

Node 11 -> Degree: 2
Node 8 -> Degree: 2
Node 10 -> Degree: 2
Node 3 -> Degree: 2
Node 18 -> Degree: 2
Node 19 -> Degree: 3
Node 15 -> Degree: 3
Node 13 -> Degree: 3
Node 6 -> Degree: 3
Node 1 -> Degree: 4
Node 5 -> Degree: 4
Node 8 -> Degree: 4
Node 9 -> Degree: 4
Node 0 -> Degree: 4
Node 12 -> Degree: 5
Node 4 -> Degree: 5
Node 16 -> Degree: 5
Node 2 -> Degree: 5
Node 7 -> Degree: 6
Node 17 -> Degree: 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Nodes with lower degree form edges with nodes of higher degree (Starting from Node 11).
2. Count triangles by finding shared connections.

The total number of triangles is [31] and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 17>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 4, 17>, <0, 4, 18>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 16>, <1, 4, 17>, <1, 4, 12>, <1, 4, 16>, <2, 7, 16>, <2, 7, 17>, <2, 7, 11>, <2, 16, 17>, <3, 10, 13>, <3, 10, 16>, <4, 12, 17>, <5, 12, 15>, <5, 12, 19>, <6, 11, 19>, <6, 11, 2>, <6, 13, 10>, <6, 13, 11>, <6, 13, 10>, <7, 14, 17>, <7, 14, 2>, <7, 14, 18>, <7, 16, 17>, <8, 19, 9>, <9, 12, 4>, <9, 12, 8>.
