Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 27) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 24) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 24) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 29) (13, 26) (13, 20) (13, 14) (26, 18) (26, 13) (26, 15) (26, 25) (26, 16) (6, 19) (21, 0) (21, 25) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 21) (25, 1) (16, 26) (28, 8) (28, 17) (28, 20) (27, 4) (27, 3) (27, 23) (0, 21) (0, 5) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 20) (19, 6) (19, 5) (19, 10) (2, 1) (2, 11) (8, 28) (8, 10) (8, 1) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 1) (17, 28) (17, 23) (17, 22) (3, 27) (3, 9) (3, 29) (1, 25) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 11) (15, 26) (15, 23) (15, 9) (14, 13) (14, 22) (14, 9) (22, 17) (22, 14) (20, 12) (20, 13) (20, 28) (20, 5) (23, 27) (23, 17) (23, 15) (23, 29) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 14) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 10) (10, 19) (10, 8) (10, 24) (29, 18) (29, 3) (29, 23) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}
Edges: 
(0, 21), (0, 5), 
(1, 25), (1, 2), (1, 8), (1, 11), 
(2, 1), (2, 11), 
(3, 27), (3, 9), (3, 29), 
(4, 7), (4, 18), (4, 27), 
(5, 0), (5, 19), (5, 20), 
(6, 19), 
(7, 4), (7, 12), (7, 25), (7, 11), (7, 24), 
(8, 28), (8, 10), (8, 1), 
(9, 3), (9, 15), (9, 14), 
(10, 19), (10, 8), (10, 24), 
(11, 7), (11, 2), (11, 1), 
(12, 7), (12, 20), (12, 24), 
(13, 26), (13, 20), (13, 14), 
(14, 13), (14, 22), (14, 9), 
(15, 26), (15, 23), (15, 9),

(28, 8), (28, 17), (28, 20), 
(29, 18), (29, 3), (29, 23)

After sorting based on the number of connections, the labels for each node will be:
0->2, 1->4, 2->3, 3->4, 4->4, 5->3, 6->2, 7->5, 8->3, 9->4, 10->3, 11->3, 12->3, 13->3, 14->3, 15->3, 16->1, 17->3, 18->3, 19->3, 20->4, 21->2, 22->2, 23->4, 24->3, 25->4, 26->5, 27->3, 28->3, 29->3

Now, let's count the triangles:
Triangles: [27]

Unique triangles: 
<3, 4, 26>, <3, 4, 25>, <3, 4, 13>, <3, 4, 15>, <3, 4, 27>, <1, 2, 21>, <2, 3, 29>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 27>, <2, 3, 9>, <4, 13, 26>, <4, 13, 20>, <4, 25, 21>, <26, 25, 21>, <26, 25, 1>, <10, 24, 7>, <10, 24, 12>, <10, 8, 1>, <7, 12, 24>, <7, 25, 21>, <7, 11, 1>, <28, 17, 22>, <28, 17, 23>, <17, 23, 29>, <9, 15, 26>, <20, 5, 19>
