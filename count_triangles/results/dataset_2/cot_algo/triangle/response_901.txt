Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 6) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 12) (15, 1) (15, 16) (19, 2) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 16) (0, 2) (16, 1) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 14) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 7) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 11) (12, 4) (12, 1) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 16) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
- 0: {9, 17, 16, 2}
- 1: {15, 16, 12, 2}
- 2: {1, 19, 0, 7}
- 3: {11, 7}
- 4: {8, 12}
- 5: {9, 18}
- 6: {8, 11, 7}
- 7: {10, 3, 6, 2}
- 8: {4, 6, 18}
- 9: {5, 13, 0}
- 10: {17, 7, 14}
- 11: {17, 3, 18, 6}
- 12: {4, 1}
- 13: {9, 14, 18}
- 14: {13, 10, 16}
- 15: {1, 16}
- 16: {1, 15, 0, 14}
- 17: {10, 0, 11}
- 18: {5, 8, 13, 11}
- 19: {2}

After relabeling the nodes based on the number of connections from least to most, the new labels are:
{19, 3, 4, 5, 12, 10, 16, 7, 15, 2, 6, 0, 11, 14, 18, 13, 9, 8, 1, 17}

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles found are:
[<0, 16, 2>, <2, 7, 10>, <2, 7, 16>, <2, 7, 14>, <4, 8, 18>, <6, 7, 10>, <6, 7, 2>, <7, 10, 14>, <11, 18, 13>]

Total number of triangles: [9]
