Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 9) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 10) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 18) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 5) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 14) (0, 8) (0, 7) (1, 15) (1, 2) (15, 11) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 2) (19, 18) (19, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 5) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 2) (17, 12) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 15) (2, 3) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(11, 16), (11, 14), (11, 15), (16, 11), (16, 9), (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 2), (9, 16), (9, 6), (9, 14), (9, 10), (8, 13), (8, 4), (8, 10), (8, 0), (13, 8), (13, 15), (13, 7), (4, 8), (4, 18), (4, 12), (4, 10), (7, 13), (7, 0), (7, 3), (12, 4), (12, 17), (12, 18), (18, 4), (18, 12), (18, 19), (18, 5), (5, 6), (5, 18), (5, 14), (0, 8), (0, 7), (1, 15), (1, 2), (15, 11), (15, 13), (15, 1), (15, 2), (19, 18), (19, 3), (14, 11), (14, 9), (14, 5), (3, 7), (3, 19), (3, 2), (17, 12), (2, 6), (2, 1), (2, 15), (2, 3), (10, 9), (10, 8), (10, 4)

Now, let's proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles. 

The degrees of the nodes are as follows (sorted in ascending order):
0(2), 1(2), 17(2), 19(2), 7(3), 12(3), 16(3), 18(4), 3(4), 5(4), 14(4), 15(4), 17(4), 6(5), 13(5), 11(5), 1(5), 9(6), 10(6), 4(6), 8(6)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Consider edges where the lower-degree vertex is listed first:
- (16, 11), (9, 16), (9, 6), (6, 2), (13, 8), (15, 11), (7, 13), (18, 5), (0, 8), (1, 15), (14, 11), (5, 6), (0, 7), (2, 6)

2. Count the number of triangles formed by the shared connections of the vertices in each edge:
- We find a total of 6 unique triangles: <8, 0, 7>, <16, 11, 15>, <13, 7, 15>, <5, 6, 2>, <6, 9, 16>, <11, 14, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
