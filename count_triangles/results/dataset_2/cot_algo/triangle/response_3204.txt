Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (5, 6) (5, 3) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 4) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) 
(9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) 
(10, 11) 
(11, 7) (11, 1) 
(5, 3) 
(0, 14) (0, 1) 
(14, 12) (14, 13) 
(2, 8) (2, 4) 
(8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) 
(7, 12) (7, 1) 
(12, 4) 
(13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 14) 
(4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 12) 

Next, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees from least to most:
Nodes with degrees: (0: 2), (5: 2), (10: 2), (12: 2), (13: 3), (2: 3), (7: 3), (8: 3), (4: 3), (11: 4), (9: 6), (1: 6), (14: 6), (3: 6), (6: 7)

Using Degree-Based Ordering, we start counting triangles with edges where the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles:
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 6, 14>
<1, 9, 6>
<1, 9, 3>
<1, 6, 11>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 0>
<6, 14, 0>
<6, 14, 1>
<6, 14, 12>
<6, 14, 13>
<6, 9, 3>
<6, 9, 10>
<6, 9, 2>
<6, 9, 11>
<6, 9, 1>
<6, 9, 7>
<6, 9, 8>
<3, 6, 5>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 1>
<3, 6, 14>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 13>
<3, 9, 6>
<3, 9, 10>
<3, 9, 11>
<3, 9, 1>
<3, 9, 7>
<14, 6, 0>
<14, 6, 1>
<14, 6, 12>
<14, 6, 13>
<9, 6, 2>
<9, 6, 10>
<9, 6, 11>
<9, 6, 1>
<9, 6, 14>
<9, 6, 3>
<9, 6, 8>
