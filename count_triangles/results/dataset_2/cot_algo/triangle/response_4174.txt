Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 14) (9, 25) (9, 10) (26, 18) (26, 29) (26, 6) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 0) (22, 12) (22, 1) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 15) (23, 16) (4, 1) (8, 24) (8, 20) (15, 23) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 21) (20, 8) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 19) (11, 28) (11, 0) (28, 11) (28, 14) (28, 10) (5, 13) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 19) (13, 27) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 29) (21, 15) (21, 13) (21, 16) (21, 14) (18, 26) (18, 23) (18, 15) (18, 29) (17, 16) (17, 2) (16, 23) (16, 21) (16, 17) (16, 24) (19, 22) (19, 20) (19, 13) (19, 24) (12, 22) (7, 3) (6, 26) (6, 10) (6, 27) (0, 22) (0, 11) (0, 3) (24, 8) (24, 16) (24, 19) (24, 2) (27, 13) (27, 6) (29, 26) (29, 3) (29, 18) (2, 17) (2, 24) (1, 22) (1, 4) (1, 20) (1, 25) (25, 9) (25, 1) (10, 9) (10, 28) (10, 6) (14, 9) (14, 28) (14, 21) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count triangles efficiently. Let's label the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):

Degree 0: 7, 17, 2  
Degree 1: 5, 7, 4, 8, 11, 12, 17, 26, 27, 29  
Degree 2: 10, 18, 19, 25, 28  
Degree 3: 0, 3, 6, 13, 14, 21, 22, 23, 24  
Degree 4: 1, 16, 20  
Degree 5: 15  
Degree 6: 9  

Now, let's count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 23]
