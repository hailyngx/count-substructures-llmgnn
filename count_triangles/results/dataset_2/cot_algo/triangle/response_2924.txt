Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 0) (5, 12) (5, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 0) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, from least to most. 

Here is the sorted list of vertices with their connections:
(5: 2), (14: 2), (8: 3), (5: 3), (9: 3), (13: 3), (0: 4), (1: 4), (2: 4), (3: 4), (12: 4), (10: 5), (4: 6), (7: 6), (6: 7), (11: 7)

Now, we will count the triangles:
1. (14, 4, 7)
2. (8, 9, 11)
3. (5, 1, 2)
4. (5, 12, 6)
5. (13, 3, 4)
6. (0, 7, 2)
7. (0, 12, 6)
8. (0, 13, 4)
9. (1, 5, 2)
10. (12, 6, 7)
11. (10, 4, 7)
12. (10, 12, 6)
13. (10, 13, 4)
14. (4, 7, 6)
15. (7, 6, 12)
16. (7, 11, 10)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
