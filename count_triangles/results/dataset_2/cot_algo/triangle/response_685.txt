Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 5) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (17, 19) (17, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 16) (8, 11) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 19) (18, 3) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 6) (5, 15) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 16) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 19) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 0) (6, 1) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 9) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 9) (19, 14) (16, 8) (16, 13) (14, 19) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 6, and 18
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 5
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 13
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 19, 4
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 0, 18, 2
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 0
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 1
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 16, 11
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 10, 17, 18, 19
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 4, 6
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 15, 13, 11, 0
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 10, 5, 16
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 12, 5, 6
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 11, 1, 19
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 10, 2, 9, 6
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 18, 0, 1
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 8, 5, 9
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 17, 4, 9, 14
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 8, 13
- Node 14 is connected to node 19

Now, we will reorder the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes in increasing order of degrees: 8, 16, 14, 2, 12, 15, 17, 9, 13, 5, 6, 0, 11, 1, 10, 3, 18, 4, 7, 19

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [24]

Unique triangles found: 
<9, 11, 19>, <5, 11, 13>, <0, 5, 11>, <1, 9, 19>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <10, 13, 16>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 3>, <6, 3, 18>, <4, 10, 17>, <4, 10, 13>, <4, 13, 16>, <4, 18, 6>, <4, 18, 7>, <5, 15, 3>, <5, 15, 0>, <15, 3, 18>, <15, 18, 4>, <17, 4, 18>, <17, 19, 4>, <7, 2, 1>, <7, 2, 17>
