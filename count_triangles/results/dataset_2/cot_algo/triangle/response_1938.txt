Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 2) (1, 17) (1, 18) (8, 15) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 18) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 10) (17, 1) (17, 6) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 19) (12, 5) (12, 19) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 17) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 12) (9, 16) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 7) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 1) (18, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on their degree of connectivity. 

The sorted nodes with their degrees are as follows:
Node 3: degree 3
Node 9: degree 1
Node 0: degree 2
Node 17: degree 2
Node 12: degree 2
Node 19: degree 4
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 18: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 4: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 4
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 16: degree 3

Now, we will identify the triangles in the graph based on the sorted vertices:
