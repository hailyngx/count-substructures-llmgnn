Node 24 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 3
Node 16 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 10 has degree 4
Node 14 has degree 4
Node 26 has degree 4
Node 22 has degree 4
Node 27 has degree 4
Node 29 has degree 4
Node 0 has degree 5
Node 12 has degree 5
Node 21 has degree 5
Node 7 has degree 6
Node 8 has degree 6
Node 18 has degree 6
Node 19 has degree 6
Node 23 has degree 6
Node 25 has degree 6
Node 9 has degree 7
Node 15 has degree 7
Node 17 has degree 7
Node 2 has degree 8
Node 28 has degree 8
