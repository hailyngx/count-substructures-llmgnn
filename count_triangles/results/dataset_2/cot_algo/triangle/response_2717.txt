Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections), assigning new labels to the nodes accordingly, and then checking for triangles following the given rules.

Here is the process of counting triangles in the given graph:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 5 : degree = 3
Node 1 : degree = 3
Node 3 : degree = 3
Node 2 : degree = 4
Node 8 : degree = 4
Node 7 : degree = 4
Node 6 : degree = 3
Node 4 : degree = 5
Node 0 : degree = 7
Node 9 : degree = 5

Now, we will go through the edges and count the triangles according to the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. (5, 9):
   - Node 5 < Node 9
   - Shared connections with 5: 8, 7
   - Triangle: (5, 8, 9) <5, 8, 9>

2. (5, 8):
   - Node 5 < Node 8
   - Shared connections with 5: 9
   - Triangle: (5, 9, 8) <5, 9, 8>

3. (5, 7):
   - Node 5 < Node 7
   - Shared connections with 5: none

4. (9, 4):
   - Node 4 < Node 9
   - Shared connections with 9: 3, 1
   - Triangle: (9, 3, 4) <9, 3, 4>

5. (9, 3):
   - Node 3 < Node 9
   - Shared connections with 9: 4, 1
   - Triangle: (9, 1, 3) <9, 1, 3>

6. (9, 0):
   - Node 0 < Node 9
   - Shared connections with 9: 4
   - Triangle: (9, 4, 0) <9, 4, 0>

7. (1, 3):
   - Node 1 < Node 3
   - Shared connections with 1: 4
   - Triangle: (1, 4, 3) <1, 4, 3>

8. (1, 4):
   - Node 1 < Node 4
   - Shared connections with 1: 3
   - Triangle: (1, 3, 4) <1, 3, 4>

9. (1, 8):
   - Node 1 < Node 8
   - Shared connections with 1: none

[Output: 8 triangles in total: <5, 8, 9>, <5, 9, 8>, <9, 3, 4>, <9, 1, 3>, <9, 4, 0>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 3, 4>, <5, 9, 8>]
