Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 11) (4, 18) (7, 23) (7, 13) (7, 8) (3, 20) (25, 20) (25, 21) (20, 3) (20, 25) (20, 24) (20, 6) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 29) (22, 1) (23, 7) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 12) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 24) (2, 11) (29, 22) (29, 14) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 10) (6, 20) (6, 5) (6, 18) (0, 11) (14, 29) (14, 27) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 16) (13, 26) (13, 7) (13, 12) (24, 20) (24, 23) (24, 2) (24, 17) (16, 18) (16, 17) (16, 27) (28, 19) (10, 26) (10, 5) (10, 21) (10, 8) (21, 25) (21, 10) (21, 15) (12, 23) (12, 13) (12, 8) (1, 22) (1, 11) (1, 8) (11, 26) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 28) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 27) (17, 24) (17, 16) (17, 19) (15, 23) (15, 5) (15, 21) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 1) (27, 14) (27, 16) (27, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is applied as described in the instructions. 

The nodes are relabeled based on the number of connections:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 11: 6 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 14: 2 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 16: 4 connections
Node 17: 3 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 19: 3 connections
Node 20: 4 connections
Node 21: 3 connections
Node 22: 4 connections
Node 23: 5 connections
Node 24: 4 connections
Node 25: 3 connections
Node 26: 4 connections
Node 27: 3 connections
Node 28: 1 connection
Node 29: 3 connections

After relabeling the nodes, we proceed with checking and counting the triangles.
The total number of triangles found is: [17]
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 8, 11>
<2, 8, 23>
<2, 15, 21>
<3, 6, 20>
<3, 7, 23>
<5, 6, 10>
<5, 6, 15>
<5, 10, 21>
<7, 8, 23>
<10, 21, 26>
<11, 19, 27>
<12, 13, 23>
<16, 17, 19>
<16, 17, 27>
<18, 6, 20>
<22, 2, 23>
