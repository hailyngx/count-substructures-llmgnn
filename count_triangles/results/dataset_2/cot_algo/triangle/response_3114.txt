Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 10) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 19) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 7) (17, 9) (17, 14) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 18) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 19) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 6) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 12) (19, 16) (19, 9) (19, 4) (0, 1) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 6) (6, 18) (6, 15) (6, 12) 

Response:
The graph with nodes and edges can be represented as:
```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (11, 16), (11, 4), (16, 19), (16, 10), (16, 15), (5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 2), (9, 8), (9, 17), (9, 14), (14, 17), (14, 7), (17, 14), (1, 3), (1, 0), (1, 7), (3, 10), (8, 13), (8, 2), (8, 18), (13, 18), (2, 8), (4, 19), (15, 12), (19, 0), (10, 12), (7, 3), (6, 18)
```

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Sort the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order:
```
Nodes: 0, 16, 17, 18, 2, 7, 10, 12, 15, 11, 1, 4, 13, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 14, 19
```
2. Relabel the nodes:
```
New Labels: 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
```
3. Check each edge starting from the nodes with lower labels and count the triangles:
   - The triangles found are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 8, 13>, <3, 7, 14>, <4, 11, 16>, <5, 13, 18>, <6, 12, 15>, <8, 13, 18>
   
So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 8, 13>, <3, 7, 14>, <4, 11, 16>, <5, 13, 18>, <6, 12, 15>, <8, 13, 18>.
