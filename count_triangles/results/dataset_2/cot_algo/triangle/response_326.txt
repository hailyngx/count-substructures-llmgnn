Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 6), (4, 3), (7, 9), (7, 5), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 3), (8, 1), (0, 9), (9, 1), (3, 2), (3, 0)

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes sorted by connections: 0, 2, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5, 6, 4, 3

Triangles:
[15]
<3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 9>
