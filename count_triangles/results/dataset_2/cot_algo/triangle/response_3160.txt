Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 5) (8, 13) (8, 19) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 7) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 4) (15, 0) (15, 1) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 4) (19, 16) (19, 8) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 3) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 17) (4, 10) (5, 16) (5, 18) (5, 17) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 14) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
(0, 15), (0, 4), (0, 9)
(1, 18), (1, 17), (1, 15), (1, 9)
(2, 18), (2, 10), (2, 3), (2, 4)
(3, 2), (3, 14), (3, 6)
(4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 17), (4, 10)
(5, 16), (5, 18), (5, 17)
(6, 11), (6, 7), (6, 17), (6, 3)
(7, 12), (7, 6), (7, 10)
(8, 13), (8, 19)
(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 14)
(10, 13), (10, 2), (10, 7), (10, 4)
(11, 16), (11, 6)
(12, 7)
(13, 8), (13, 10), (13, 14)
(14, 13), (14, 3), (14, 9)
(15, 0), (15, 1)
(16, 11), (16, 19), (16, 5)
(17, 1), (17, 6), (17, 5), (17, 4)
(18, 2), (18, 5), (18, 1)
(19, 16), (19, 8)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and relabel them accordingly:
New labels: 
0 (degree 3), 1 (degree 4), 2 (degree 4), 3 (degree 3), 4 (degree 4), 5 (degree 3), 6 (degree 4), 7 (degree 3), 8 (degree 2), 9 (degree 3), 10 (degree 4), 11 (degree 2), 12 (degree 1), 13 (degree 3), 14 (degree 3), 15 (degree 2), 16 (degree 3), 17 (degree 4), 18 (degree 3), 19 (degree 2).

Based on degree-based ordering, we will proceed with counting triangles only for edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This will help us avoid counting the same triangle multiple times.

By following this method, we find that the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5], and the unique triangles found are: 
<6, 11, 16>, 
<1, 2, 18>, 
<1, 9, 15>, 
<3, 6, 17>, 
<4, 10, 17>.
