Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 7), (4, 9), (4, 6), (4, 3), (7, 9), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 8), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 1), (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 0), (2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 6), (2, 3), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 1), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 6), (1, 0), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 2)

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections) from least to most:

Nodes by degree: {0, 6, 4, 1, 2, 7, 3, 8, 9, 5}

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's count the number of triangles:

Triangles: [<1, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 9>]

Total number of triangles: [6]
