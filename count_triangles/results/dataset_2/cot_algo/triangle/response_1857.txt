Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows with the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: [5, 3, 6, 2, 7]
- 1: [5, 3, 6, 8]
- 2: [9, 8, 0]
- 3: [9, 1, 7, 0, 4]
- 4: [3, 8]
- 5: [6, 1, 0, 7]
- 6: [5, 1, 7, 0]
- 7: [5, 3, 8, 6, 0]
- 8: [9, 1, 4, 2, 7]
- 9: [8, 2, 3]

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes by degree: 4, 2, 9, 6, 1, 7, 0, 5, 3, 8

Now, we list the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- (0, 5)
- (0, 6)
- (0, 7)
- (0, 2)
- (1, 3)
- (1, 6)
- (1, 8)
- (2, 9)
- (3, 4)
- (3, 7)

Now, we check for shared connections between the vertices of each edge:
Triangles:
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 3, 8>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [6]
