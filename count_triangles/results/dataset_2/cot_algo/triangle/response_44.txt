Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 2) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 10) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 0) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 14) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are as follows:
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 11: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 5: 6 connections
Node 10: 6 connections

The edges that satisfy the condition for counting triangles are:
<3, 6, 13>
<3, 1, 6>
<3, 1, 12>
<3, 0, 11>
<3, 0, 2>
<6, 1, 12>
<6, 1, 7>
<6, 2, 14>
<6, 13, 5>
<1, 7, 4>
<1, 12, 9>
<0, 11, 13>
<0, 11, 3>
<0, 2, 14>
<12, 9, 5>
<8, 9, 12>
<8, 9, 0>
<8, 4, 7>
<8, 0, 11>
<9, 5, 4>
<9, 5, 13>
<9, 12, 1>
<4, 7, 10>
<4, 7, 1>
<4, 10, 14>
<4, 10, 5>

There are a total of [25] triangles in the given graph.
