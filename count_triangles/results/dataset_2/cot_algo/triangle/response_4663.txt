Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 10) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 0) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 13) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 0), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 11), (8, 7), (8, 3), (7, 10), (7, 14), (12, 10), (12, 9), (2, 6), (2, 14), (2, 0), (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 3), (6, 1), (6, 10), (13, 1), (13, 10), (13, 14), (1, 11), (1, 14), (11, 9), (3, 14)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:

Nodes by degrees: 4, 1, 9, 12, 0, 7, 11, 3, 10, 13, 5, 6, 2, 14, 8

After relabeling, the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections are:
(0, 4), (0, 13), (1, 6), (1, 11), (1, 13), (2, 0), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 14), (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 3)

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Triangles: [18]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 13, 5>, <0, 13, 10>, <0, 13, 14>, <2, 0, 4>, <2, 0, 13>, <2, 6, 1>, <2, 8, 4>, <2, 8, 5>, <2, 8, 11>, <2, 8, 7>, <2, 14, 7>, <2, 14, 13>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 13>, <3, 8, 4>, <3, 9, 4>
