Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Node 5 - 3 connections
Node 9 - 4 connections
Node 7 - 4 connections
Node 4 - 4 connections
Node 1 - 4 connections
Node 6 - 4 connections
Node 2 - 4 connections
Node 0 - 6 connections
Node 8 - 6 connections
Node 3 - 3 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find that there are 12 triangles in total.

[12]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 1>
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 2, 8>
<4, 7, 0>
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 0, 7>
<8, 0, 6>
