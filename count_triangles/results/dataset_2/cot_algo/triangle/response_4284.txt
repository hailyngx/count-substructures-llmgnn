Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 15) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 21) (9, 24) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 29) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 16) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 19) (27, 29) (27, 11) (27, 2) (27, 13) (4, 6) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 7) (29, 22) (29, 27) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 25) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 7) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 18) (21, 6) (21, 9) (21, 11) (18, 1) (18, 26) (18, 0) (26, 18) (26, 14) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 25) (3, 22) (3, 24) (3, 20) (20, 3) (20, 13) (20, 24) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 26) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 18) (2, 27) (2, 16) (5, 24) (24, 9) (24, 3) (24, 20) (24, 5) (24, 25) (7, 8) (7, 17) (7, 15) (16, 23) (16, 1) (16, 2) (16, 13) (13, 27) (13, 1) (13, 20) (13, 16) (25, 10) (25, 15) (25, 24) (25, 11) (11, 27) (11, 8) (11, 21) (11, 25) (19, 12) (19, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly.

Here is the sorted list of nodes with their degree:
Node 5: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 1
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 18: Degree 2
Node 26: Degree 2
Node 22: Degree 4
Node 23: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 27: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 16: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 4
Node 20: Degree 4
Node 19: Degree 4
Node 14: Degree 4
Node 24: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 12: Degree 5
Node 0: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 21: Degree 5
Node 11: Degree 5
Node 25: Degree 5
Node 17: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 15: Degree 5
Node 29: Degree 5
