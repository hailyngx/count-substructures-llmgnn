Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows with the nodes and their connections:

```
0: 7, 8, 1
1: 5, 4, 8, 2, 0
2: 5, 9, 4, 8, 1
3: 5, 9, 4, 7
4: 7, 1, 3, 2
5: 9, 2, 1, 3
6: 9, 7, 8
7: 4, 0, 3, 6
8: 6, 2, 0, 1
9: 5, 6, 2, 3
```

Now, we will list the edges in increasing order based on the degree of the nodes:

- Node 0 (degree 3): (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 1)
- Node 6 (degree 3): (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 8)
- Node 8 (degree 4): (8, 6), (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 1)
- Node 3 (degree 4): (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 7)
- Node 4 (degree 4): (4, 7), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 2)
- Node 1 (degree 5): (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 2), (1, 0)
- Node 9 (degree 4): (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 3)
- Node 2 (degree 5): (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 1)
- Node 7 (degree 4): (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 6)
- Node 5 (degree 4): (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 3)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- There are [13] triangles in the graph.
- The unique triangles are: 
    - <1, 2, 5>
    - <1, 2, 8>
    - <1, 4, 7>
    - <1, 4, 5>
    - <1, 0, 7>
    - <2, 5, 9>
    - <2, 5, 1>
    - <3, 7, 4>
    - <4, 5, 7>
    - <4, 5, 3>
    - <6, 9, 5>
    - <6, 7, 4>
    - <8, 2, 1>
