Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 23) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 2) (27, 20) (27, 19) (18, 12) (18, 28) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 21) (20, 27) (20, 7) (20, 28) (23, 0) (23, 22) (5, 4) (5, 17) (6, 0) (6, 22) (6, 15) (19, 27) (19, 26) (19, 17) (19, 24) (19, 3) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 13) (26, 10) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 28) (9, 11) (9, 16) (28, 18) (28, 20) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 7) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 15) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 3) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 11) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 19) (17, 13) (10, 0) (10, 26) (10, 21) (21, 22) (21, 10) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 14) (2, 27) (12, 18) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 24) (24, 19) (24, 8) (24, 11) (3, 19) (3, 13) (7, 20) (7, 28) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 15) (1, 12) (1, 14) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. The list of nodes with their degrees is as follows:

(1: 2), (2: 2), (3: 2), (5: 2), (11: 2), (12: 2), (18: 2), (20: 2), (21: 2), (24: 2), (28: 2), (7: 2), (13: 3), (14: 3), (15: 3), (16: 3), (22: 4), (26: 4), (9: 5), (10: 5), (19: 5), (4: 6), (8: 6), (17: 6), (27: 6), (6: 7), (0: 7)

Based on the list above, in each edge pair, if the lower degree node is connected with the higher degree node, we proceed to count the triangles.

After calculating, the total number of triangles is [63].

Here are some unique triangles found:
<0, 17, 19>, <0, 17, 5>, <0, 17, 13>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 6, 15>, <0, 6, 22>, <0, 6, 23>, <0, 6, 15>, <0, 6, 17>, <0, 15, 4>, <0, 15, 6>, <0, 15, 8>, <0, 15, 14>, <0, 22, 6>, <0, 22, 15>, <0, 22, 21>, <0, 22, 9>, <0, 22, 27>, <0, 23, 6>, <0, 23, 22>, <0, 27, 2>, <0, 27, 19>, <0, 27, 20>, <0, 27, 6>, <0, 27, 19>, <0, 27, 10>, <0, 27, 23>, <0, 10, 26>, <0, 10, 21>, <0, 13, 17>, <0, 13, 3>, <0, 19, 17>, <0, 19, 26>, <0, 19, 3>, <0, 19, 24>, <0, 26, 13>, <0, 26, 10>, <0, 26, 28>, <0, 3, 13>, <0, 3, 19>, <2, 27, 19>, <2, 27, 20>, <3, 13, 17>, <3, 19, 24>, <3, 19, 26>, <3, 19, 18>, <4, 5, 17>, <4, 5, 15>, <4, 5, 16>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 16, 14>, <4, 6, 15>, <4, 6, 16>, <4, 6, 17>, <4, 16, 8>, <4, 16, 14>, <5, 17, 19>, <5, 17, 13>, <5, 17, 15>, <5, 13, 17>, <5, 17, 19>, <5, 17, 26>, <5, 15, 6>, <5, 15, 4>, <5, 13, 17>, <5, 13, 3>, <6, 22, 23>, <6, 22, 15>, <6, 23, 22>, <6, 15, 22>, <6, 15, 8>, <6, 15, 14>, <8, 15, 14>, <8, 15, 16>, <8, 15, 6>, <8, 15, 4>, <8, 15, 14>, <8, 15, 11>, <8, 15, 16>, <8, 15, 17>, <9, 22, 23>, <9, 22, 21>, <9, 22, 28>, <9, 22, 6>, <9, 22, 8>, <9, 22, 16>, <9, 22, 28>, <9, 22, 9>, <9, 22, 7>, <9, 22, 11>, <9, 22, 14>, <9, 22, 6>, <9, 28, 20>, <9, 28, 26>, <9, 28, 7>, <9, 28, 16>, <9, 28, 9>, <9, 28, 22>, <10, 21, 22>, <10, 21, 26>, <10, 21, 27>, <10, 21, 20>, <10, 26, 21>, <10, 26, 28>, <11, 9, 24>, <11, 9, 8>, <11, 9, 16>, <11, 24, 19>, <11, 24, 8>, <12, 1, 14>, <13, 3, 17>, <13, 17, 26>, <13, 17, 19>, <13, 17, 5>, <14, 16, 8>, <14, 16, 14>, <14, 16, 15>, <14, 16, 9>, <15, 6, 22>, <15, 6, 23>, <16, 9, 22>, <16, 9, 28>, <16, 9, 11>, <16, 9, 14>, <16, 9, 6>, <16, 9, 8>, <16, 4, 5>, <16, 4, 15>, <16, 4, 8>, <16, 4, 6>, <16, 14, 15>, <16, 14, 9>, <16, 14, 2>, <21, 10, 26>, <22, 21, 10>, <22, 21, 26>, <22, 21, 27>, <22, 21, 20>, <22, 21, 22>, <22, 21, 23>, <22, 21, 28>, <26, 19, 3>, <26, 19, 24>, <26, 19, 17>, <26, 19, 28>, <26, 19, 26>, <26, 10, 21>, <26, 10, 27>, <26, 10, 13>, <26, 28, 7>, <26, 28, 9>, <26, 28, 20>, <26, 28, 26>, <27, 2, 27>, <27, 2, 19>, <27, 2, 20>, <27, 2, 28>, <27, 2, 9>, <27, 20, 7>, <27, 20, 28>, <28, 7, 20>
