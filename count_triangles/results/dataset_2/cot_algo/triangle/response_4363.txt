Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 12) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 2) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently.

Here is the sorted list of nodes based on their degree:
- Node 14 (Degree 5)
- Node 9 (Degree 2)
- Node 0 (Degree 4)
- Node 1 (Degree 4)
- Node 6 (Degree 4)
- Node 12 (Degree 3)
- Node 10 (Degree 3)
- Node 8 (Degree 5)
- Node 4 (Degree 3)
- Node 13 (Degree 3)
- Node 5 (Degree 4)
- Node 2 (Degree 6)
- Node 3 (Degree 4)
- Node 11 (Degree 6)
- Node 7 (Degree 8)

Now, we will go through the list of edges and count the number of triangles:

1. (4, 7) - Both nodes are connected to nodes 5 and 14. Only 1 triangle <4, 5, 14>.
2. (4, 5) - Both nodes are connected to nodes 2 and 14. Only 1 triangle <4, 2, 14>.
3. (4, 14) - Both nodes are connected to nodes 5 and 0. No new triangles.
4. (7, 4) - Already counted.
5. (7, 11) - Both nodes are connected to nodes 1, 10, 8, and 13. 1 triangle <7, 1, 13>.
6. (7, 6) - Both nodes are connected to nodes 2 and 12. No new triangles.
7. (7, 13) - Both nodes are connected to nodes 3 and 11. 1 triangle <7, 3, 11>.
8. (7, 8) - Both nodes are connected to nodes 1, 10, and 11. 1 triangle <7, 1, 11>.
9. (1, 3) - Both nodes are connected to nodes 2 and 11. 1 triangle <1, 2, 11>.
