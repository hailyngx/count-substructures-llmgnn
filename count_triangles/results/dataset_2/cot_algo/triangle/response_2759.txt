Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 10) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 14) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 12) (17, 13) (17, 2) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (10, 16) (10, 8) (12, 5) (12, 13) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 18) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 17) (19, 15) (19, 7) (18, 16) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 7) 

Response:
We will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, we list the vertices by their degree in ascending order:
Nodes with degree 1: 0, 7, 12, 17, 19
Nodes with degree 2: 3, 10
Nodes with degree 3: 5, 6, 13
Nodes with degree 4: 8, 18
Nodes with degree 5: 4
Nodes with degree 6: 2
Nodes with degree 7: 9
Nodes with degree 8: 1, 15
Nodes with degree 9: 16
Nodes with degree 10: 11
Nodes with degree 11: 14

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

1. Edge (11, 16): No triangles.
2. Edge (11, 14): No triangles.
3. Edge (11, 1): No triangles.
4. Edge (11, 9): Triangle formed with shared connection 11 ➔ 16 ➔ 9 ➔ 11.
5. Edge (11, 2): No triangles.
6. Edge (16, 11): No triangles.
7. Edge (16, 18): No triangles.
8. Edge (16, 9): No triangles.

13. Edge (6, 1): No triangles.
14. Edge (6, 18): Triangle formed with shared connection 6 ➔ 4 ➔ 8 ➔ 6.
15. Edge (6, 8): No triangles.
16. Edge (6, 4): No triangles.
