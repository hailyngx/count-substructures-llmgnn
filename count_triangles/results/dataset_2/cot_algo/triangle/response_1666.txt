Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 14) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 13) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 3) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given information:

Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (4, 8, 6)
- 1: (10, 4, 7, 13)
- 2: (6, 3, 14, 7)
- 3: (5, 2, 13)
- 4: (5, 8, 0, 1, 14)
- 5: (9, 11, 4, 3, 10)
- 6: (7, 2, 0, 13)
- 7: (11, 1, 6, 2, 14, 13)
- 8: (11, 4, 0, 12)
- 9: (5, 14)
- 10: (5, 11, 12, 1)
- 11: (5, 10, 7, 8)
- 12: (10, 8, 14)
- 13: (1, 6, 7, 3)
- 14: (9, 4, 2, 12, 7)

Now, let's calculate the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices by Degree: 0(3), 3(3), 9(2), 12(2), 6(4), 2(4), 13(4), 5(5), 1(4), 10(4), 4(5), 8(4), 11(4), 14(5), 7(6)

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
Relabeled Vertices: 0(1), 3(2), 9(3), 12(4), 6(5), 2(6), 13(7), 5(8), 1(9), 10(10), 4(11), 8(12), 11(13), 14(14), 7(15)

3. Check for triangles using the sorted order of vertices:
Triangles: [38] 
Unique Triangles: <4, 8, 0>, <14, 12, 8>, <14, 12, 10>, <14, 7, 6>, <14, 7, 13>, <2, 3, 13>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 7, 13>, <7, 11, 8>, <7, 11, 4>, <7, 13, 1>, <1, 10, 12>, <1, 10, 5>, <1, 7, 13>, <4, 14, 7>, <4, 14, 9>, <4, 8, 0>, <8, 11, 4>, <8, 11, 5>, <8, 12, 10>, <10, 11, 5>, <10, 12, 14>, <10, 5, 11>, <5, 11, 7>, <5, 4, 8>, <5, 9, 14>, <13, 7, 6>, <13, 7, 14>, <13, 3, 2>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 2>
