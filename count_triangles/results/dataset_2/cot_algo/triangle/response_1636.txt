Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted list of vertices with their corresponding degrees is as follows:

(2: 3), (3: 3), (6: 3), (1: 4), (7: 4), (8: 4), (5: 5), (9: 6), (0: 6), (4: 6)

Now, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 9, 2>
<4, 9, 6>
<5, 7, 0>
<5, 8, 0>
<6, 9, 1>
<7, 0, 5>
<7, 3, 4>
<8, 0, 5>
<9, 2, 4>
<9, 4, 6>

Total number of triangles: [20]
