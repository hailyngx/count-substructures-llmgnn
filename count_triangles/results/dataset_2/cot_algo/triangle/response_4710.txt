Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows these steps:
1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order.
2. Relabel the vertices based on the sorting.
3. For each edge, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
4. Check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to find triangles.

The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are:
Vertex 9 has 2 connections.
Vertex 2 has 3 connections.
Vertex 5 has 3 connections.
Vertex 7 has 3 connections.
Vertex 0 has 4 connections.
Vertex 8 has 6 connections.
Vertex 1 has 4 connections.
Vertex 4 has 6 connections.
Vertex 6 has 4 connections.
Vertex 3 has 5 connections.

Now, we will count the triangles using the given edges while following the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Triangles found:
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 7, 4>
- <3, 8, 9>
- <4, 6, 3>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <4, 8, 7>
- <4, 8, 5>
- <5, 7, 8>
- <6, 7, 8>
