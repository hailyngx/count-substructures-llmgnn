Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (10, 5) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 8) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 12) (0, 15) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 2) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 16) (13, 4) (13, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 1) (12, 4) (11, 9) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 2) (19, 15) (19, 4) (19, 3) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 8) (18, 10) (8, 17) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 3) (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are: 
Node 0: 2 edges
Node 13: 2 edges
Node 18: 3 edges
Node 11: 4 edges
Node 3: 4 edges
Node 12: 4 edges
Node 16: 4 edges
Node 6: 4 edges
Node 19: 4 edges
Node 4: 4 edges
Node 7: 4 edges
Node 14: 4 edges
Node 9: 4 edges
Node 1: 4 edges
Node 17: 5 edges
Node 8: 5 edges
Node 10: 5 edges
Node 15: 5 edges
Node 5: 6 edges
Node 2: 6 edges

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles found are:
[<2, 6, 8> <2, 6, 3> <2, 6, 7> <6, 8, 3> <6, 8, 7> <2, 8, 3> <2, 8, 7> <3, 8, 7> <4, 12, 1> <4, 12, 19> <4, 1, 19> <12, 1, 19> <10, 7, 1> <10, 7, 17> <10, 1, 17> <7, 1, 17> <14, 11, 9> <14, 11, 5> <14, 9, 5> <11, 9, 5> <15, 16, 5> <15, 16, 8> <15, 5, 8> <16, 5, 8>] 

Total number of triangles: [23]
