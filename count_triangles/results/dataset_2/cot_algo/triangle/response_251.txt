Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 6) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 12) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 6) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 12) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method provides a systematic way to count the number of triangles in the graph. 
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices: 
(3) - Degree: 4
(8) - Degree: 4
(5) - Degree: 4
(1) - Degree: 4
(14) - Degree: 4
(9) - Degree: 3
(11) - Degree: 5
(6) - Degree: 6
(12) - Degree: 6
(10) - Degree: 3
(4) - Degree: 6
(0) - Degree: 4
(2) - Degree: 7
(7) - Degree: 3
(13) - Degree: 4

Now, we will count the triangles by examining each edge:
- (1, 2): Can form triangles with (0, 1, 9), (1, 9, 10)
- (1, 10): No triangles
- (1, 9): No triangles

- (2, 7): Can form triangles with (6, 7, 11)
- (2, 11): Can form triangles with (5, 11, 6), (5, 11, 8)
- (8, 2): No triangles
- (8, 11): Can form triangles with (5, 11, 6), (5, 11, 8)
