Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 2) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 14) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) 

Response:
Below is the given graph with nodes and edges:

Nodes: 15
Edges: 60

Edges:
(5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 10) 
(9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
(6, 2) (6, 8) 
(1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) 
(3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 13)
(10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 4) 
(11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) 
(4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 7) 
(7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) 
(12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 8) 
(13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 2) 
(0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) 
(14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 8) 
(8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 14) 
(2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles. 

Relabeling the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 0 -> Degree 4
Node 6 -> Degree 4
Node 14 -> Degree 4
Node 9 -> Degree 3
Node 11 -> Degree 3
Node 12 -> Degree 3
Node 8 -> Degree 5
Node 7 -> Degree 5
Node 10 -> Degree 4
Node 3 -> Degree 4
Node 13 -> Degree 5
Node 4 -> Degree 5
Node 1 -> Degree 4
Node 2 -> Degree 6
Node 5 -> Degree 5

Checking edges where the node with lower label has fewer connections:
- (3, 0): Shared connections: 7
- (6, 2): Shared connections: None
- (1, 5): Shared connections: 4
- (8, 5): Shared connections: 1
- (2, 6): Shared connections: 7
- (7, 12): Shared connections: 13
- (13, 2): Shared connections: 7
- (4, 7): Shared connections: 2
- (1, 4): Shared connections: 10
- (9, 3): Shared connections: 0

Total number of triangles: [11]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 10>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 11>
<4, 7, 13>
<8, 5, 1>
<9, 3, 0>
<12, 7, 13>
<12, 8, 14>
