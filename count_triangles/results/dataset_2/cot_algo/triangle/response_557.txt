Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 13) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 12) (5, 15) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 0) (13, 6) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 19) (3, 18) (3, 6) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 9) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 12) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 16) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 15) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 12) (14, 2) (14, 15) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 9) (11, 0) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
(10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) 
(17, 4) 
(4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 13) 
(18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 3) 
(2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) 
(8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 12) 
(5, 15) 
(13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 0) (13, 6) 
(0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 11) 
(7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 19) 
(3, 18) (3, 6) (3, 12) 
(1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 9) 
(9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 12) 
(15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 16) 
(16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 15) 
(6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 12) 
(14, 2) (14, 15) 
(19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 9) 
(11, 0) 
(12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 6)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 11: 1 connection
Node 17: 1 connection
Node 14: 2 connections
Node 16: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 18: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 12: 5 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 10: 6 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 6: 7 connections
Node 13: 7 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [34]

Unique triangles:

<0, 1, 9>
<0, 1, 16>
<0, 6, 12>
<0, 6, 13>
<1, 2, 8>
