Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 12) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 9) (1, 12) (1, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 13) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 7) (9, 4) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 4) 

Response:
Let's first sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
Nodes: 0, 5, 1, 2, 7, 3, 6, 4, 8, 14, 9, 12, 13, 10, 11

Now, let's relabel the vertices:
0 -> 0 (degree: 2)
5 -> 1 (degree: 3)
1 -> 2 (degree: 2)
2 -> 3 (degree: 4)
7 -> 4 (degree: 3)
3 -> 5 (degree: 2)
6 -> 6 (degree: 4)
4 -> 7 (degree: 6)
8 -> 8 (degree: 5)
14 -> 9 (degree: 5)
9 -> 10 (degree: 5)
12 -> 11 (degree: 6)
13 -> 12 (degree: 3)
10 -> 13 (degree: 4)
11 -> 14 (degree: 6)

Now, we will count the triangles by checking the shared connections between vertices of each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

The triangles found are:
<0, 11, 6>
<0, 12, 3>
<0, 12, 4>
<1, 12, 3>
<1, 8, 5>
<1, 8, 6>
<1, 9, 13>
<2, 8, 3>
<2, 8, 5>
<2, 8, 6>
<2, 11, 12>
<2, 11, 9>
<2, 13, 12>
<3, 4, 2>
<4, 9, 2>
<4, 9, 3>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 8, 2>
<6, 8, 1>
<8, 9, 2>
<8, 9, 4>
<8, 9, 11>
<8, 9, 12>
<11, 12, 2>
<11, 12, 9>
