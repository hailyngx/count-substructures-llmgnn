Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:

- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 7: 5 connections
- Node 0: 6 connections
- Node 3: 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, the triangles are as follows:
