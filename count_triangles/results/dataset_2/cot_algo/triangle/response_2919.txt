Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: (6, 2, 7, 1)
- 1: (6, 0)
- 2: (9, 4, 8, 0, 3)
- 3: (5, 8, 6, 2, 7)
- 4: (5, 9, 8, 2)
- 5: (9, 6, 4, 3)
- 6: (5, 1, 3, 0)
- 7: (8, 0, 3)
- 8: (9, 4, 2, 3, 7)
- 9: (5, 8, 4, 2)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now proceed to count the triangles.

Triangles:
1. <2, 3, 8>
2. <2, 3, 7>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
