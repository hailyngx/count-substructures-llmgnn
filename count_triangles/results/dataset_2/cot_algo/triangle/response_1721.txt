Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 13) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 16) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 2) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 16) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 12) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 2) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 14) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 3) (7, 18) (7, 14) (16, 6) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 15) (3, 12) (11, 19) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 15) (14, 19) (14, 7) (1, 18) (1, 16) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order. 

The list of nodes and their degrees in ascending order:
(1, 2)
(3, 2)
(5, 2)
(7, 2)
(11, 2)
(18, 3)
(19, 3)
(8, 4)
(12, 4)
(17, 4)
(9, 5)
(15, 5)
(16, 5)
(4, 6)
(10, 6)
(6, 7)
(0, 7)
(13, 7)
(14, 7)
(2, 8)

After relabeling the nodes based on their degrees:
(1, 0)
(3, 1)
(5, 2)
(7, 3)
(11, 4)
(18, 5)
(19, 6)
(8, 7)
(12, 8)
(17, 9)
(9, 10)
(15, 11)
(16, 12)
(4, 13)
(10, 14)
(6, 15)
(0, 16)
(13, 17)
(14, 18)
(2, 19)

Now, we will count the triangles. 

The total number of triangles: [12]
The unique triangles: 
<2, 6, 15>
<4, 6, 10>
<0, 6, 15>
<0, 6, 13>
<2, 6, 10>
<8, 12, 16>
<0, 13, 17>
<8, 12, 4>
<13, 14, 18>
<4, 10, 15>
<4, 10, 2>
<9, 13, 14>
