Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 2) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 12) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 0) (15, 1) (8, 16) (8, 3) (8, 18) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 13) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 7) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 4) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 0) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 2) (3, 8) (3, 19) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 12) (19, 0) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 19) (4, 14) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) and then checking for triangles between nodes based on the order. 

Let's label the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order: 
Node 18 - Degree 2
Node 3 - Degree 2
Node 19 - Degree 3
Node 8 - Degree 3
Node 9 - Degree 3
Node 4 - Degree 3
Node 15 - Degree 3
Node 5 - Degree 4
Node 6 - Degree 4
Node 1 - Degree 4
Node 12 - Degree 4
Node 7 - Degree 4
Node 0 - Degree 5
Node 16 - Degree 5
Node 2 - Degree 5
Node 14 - Degree 5
Node 10 - Degree 6
Node 17 - Degree 6
Node 11 - Degree 6

Now, we will count the triangles: 
Triangles: [<2, 0, 18>, <5, 2, 0>, <3, 19, 0>, <5, 2, 11>, <7, 6, 1>, <7, 16, 10>, <7, 13, 6>, <5, 12, 9>, <14, 18, 8>, <14, 18, 0>, <14, 4, 13>, <17, 12, 9>, <17, 12, 5>, <17, 12, 19>, <17, 11, 10>, <16, 7, 6>, <16, 7, 14>, <16, 8, 3>, <11, 2, 5>, <11, 14, 7>]

Total number of triangles: [19]
