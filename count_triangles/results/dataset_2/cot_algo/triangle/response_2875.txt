Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 5) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 9) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections each vertex has, then relabeling the vertices accordingly. Let's perform this process step by step:

1. Count the number of connections for each node:
- Node 0: 5 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 7: 6 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 10: 4 connections
- Node 11: 3 connections
- Node 12: 5 connections
- Node 13: 5 connections
- Node 14: 2 connections

2. Sort the nodes based on their number of connections in ascending order and relabel them from 0 to 14:
- Node 1 (2 connections) -> Relabeled as 0
- Node 11 (3 connections) -> Relabeled as 1
- Node 4 (3 connections) -> Relabeled as 2
- Node 6 (3 connections) -> Relabeled as 3
- Node 3 (3 connections) -> Relabeled as 4
- Node 5 (3 connections) -> Relabeled as 5
- Node 8 (4 connections) -> Relabeled as 6
- Node 9 (4 connections) -> Relabeled as 7
- Node 10 (4 connections) -> Relabeled as 8
- Node 0 (5 connections) -> Relabeled as 9
- Node 2 (5 connections) -> Relabeled as 10
- Node 12 (5 connections) -> Relabeled as 11
- Node 13 (5 connections) -> Relabeled as 12
- Node 7 (6 connections) -> Relabeled as 13
- Node 14 (2 connections) -> Relabeled as 14

3. Check the edges in the order determined by the labels:
