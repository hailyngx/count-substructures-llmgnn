Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 18) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 17) (1, 14) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 16) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 0) (19, 15) (19, 9) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 15) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 16) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 9) (6, 17) (6, 10) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 9) (9, 19) (9, 15) (9, 14) (16, 5) (16, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first labeling the nodes based on their degree. Here is the list of nodes with their respective degrees:

Node 0 : degree 3
Node 1 : degree 1
Node 2 : degree 2
Node 3 : degree 2
Node 4 : degree 3
Node 5 : degree 4
Node 6 : degree 2
Node 7 : degree 5
Node 8 : degree 3
Node 9 : degree 3
Node 10 : degree 4
Node 11 : degree 3
Node 12 : degree 3
Node 13 : degree 4
Node 14 : degree 4
Node 15 : degree 4
Node 16 : degree 2
Node 17 : degree 3
Node 18 : degree 4
Node 19 : degree 2

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees, relabel them, and then count the triangles. The sorted list of nodes based on degree is as follows:

Node 1 : degree 1
Node 2 : degree 2
Node 3 : degree 2
Node 6 : degree 2
Node 9 : degree 2
Node 16 : degree 2
Node 0 : degree 3
Node 4 : degree 3
Node 8 : degree 3
Node 11 : degree 3
Node 12 : degree 3
Node 17 : degree 3
Node 5 : degree 4
Node 10 : degree 4
Node 13 : degree 4
Node 14 : degree 4
Node 15 : degree 4
Node 18 : degree 4
Node 7 : degree 5
Node 19 : degree 2

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 15]

<0, 5, 16>
<0, 7, 12>
<0, 7, 18>
<0, 9, 14>
<1, 14, 9>
<3, 8, 13>
<4, 10, 6>
<4, 10, 16>
<5, 7, 12>
<5, 7, 18>
<5, 12, 13>
<5, 9, 14>
<7, 15, 18>
<10, 16, 6>
<14, 15, 9>
