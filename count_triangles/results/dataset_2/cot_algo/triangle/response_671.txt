Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 1) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows these steps:
1. Sort the vertices by their degree in ascending order.
2. Relabel the vertices from 0 to 9 based on their degree order.
3. For each edge, check if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections before processing.

Based on the given graph, the sorted vertices based on their connections are:
Node 7: degree 1
Node 3: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 4: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 0: degree 5
Node 9: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 6: degree 6

Next, we count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The total number of triangles is: [12]
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 9, 2>, <0, 9, 8>, <0, 9, 4>, <0, 9, 5>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <6, 9, 2>, <6, 9, 8>.
