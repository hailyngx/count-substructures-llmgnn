Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 12) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 6) (2, 10) (2, 12) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method works as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in increasing order:
   Vertices: 6, 2, 8, 4, 0, 1, 3, 14, 12, 13, 7, 11, 10, 9, 5

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   0 -> 0 (degree: 4)
   1 -> 1 (degree: 4)
   3 -> 2 (degree: 4)
   4 -> 3 (degree: 3)
   8 -> 4 (degree: 3)
   7 -> 5 (degree: 4)
   11 -> 6 (degree: 4)
   10 -> 7 (degree: 5)
   9 -> 8 (degree: 5)
   5 -> 9 (degree: 6)
   6 -> 10 (degree: 1)
   2 -> 11 (degree: 2)
   14 -> 12 (degree: 4)
   12 -> 13 (degree: 5)
   13 -> 14 (degree: 5)

3. Count the triangles by following the steps mentioned earlier. 

There are a total of [22] triangles in the graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 13>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 8, 14>
<1, 9, 10>
<1, 9, 13>
<1, 13, 3>
<0, 6, 0>
<2, 10, 11>
<4, 12, 8>
<4, 13, 7>
<5, 11, 7>
<11, 14, 7>
<10, 11, 7>
<9, 10, 11>
<9, 13, 12>
<10, 13, 12>
<5, 14, 7>
<5, 9, 13>
<5, 7, 11>
