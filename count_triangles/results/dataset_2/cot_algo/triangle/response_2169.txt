Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 3) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 10) (7, 6) (7, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (1, 4) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 10) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: {(6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 11), (6, 12), (6, 13), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 11), (9, 10), (9, 3), (4, 8), (4, 13), (4, 5), (4, 14), (4, 1), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 10), (8, 0), (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 12), (2, 5), (0, 8), (0, 14), (0, 3), (0, 5), (14, 4), (14, 0), (14, 3), (3, 9), (3, 0), (3, 14), (3, 11), (3, 10), (11, 6), (11, 9), (11, 3), (12, 6), (12, 2), (12, 10), (7, 6), (7, 10), (5, 4), (5, 8), (5, 2), (5, 0), (1, 4), (10, 9), (10, 8), (10, 3), (10, 12), (10, 7), (10, 13), (13, 6), (13, 4), (13, 10)}

Now, let's list the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes by degrees: {1, 7, 12, 14, 13, 0, 7, 11, 3, 5, 8, 10, 9, 6, 6}

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
Nodes after relabeling: {1, 7, 12, 14, 13, 0, 4, 11, 2, 5, 8, 10, 9, 6, 3}

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles]: [40]
