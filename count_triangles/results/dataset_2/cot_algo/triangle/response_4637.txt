Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 9) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 6) (0, 3) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 11) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 12) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (13, 11) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 13) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Vertices sorted by their degree:
(3) - (1, 4, 5)
(1) - (3, 4, 5, 9, 14)
(7) - (5, 8, 9, 13)
(12) - (4, 5, 9, 11)
(4) - (1, 12, 13, 6, 10)
(0) - (3, 13)
(10) - (4, 2)
(2) - (10, 9, 6, 14, 11)
(9) - (1, 7, 12, 2, 11)
(5) - (1, 3, 7, 12)
(6) - (4, 2, 13)
(14) - (1, 2)
(8) - (3, 7, 11)
(13) - (3, 4, 7, 0, 6, 11)
(11) - (12, 2, 9, 8, 13)

Number of triangles [2]:
<1, 3, 5>
<4, 12, 9>
