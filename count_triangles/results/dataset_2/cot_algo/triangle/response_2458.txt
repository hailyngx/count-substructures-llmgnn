27 (degree: 1)
10 (degree: 1)
13 (degree: 2)
9 (degree: 4)
28 (degree: 4)
20 (degree: 4)
3 (degree: 4)
26 (degree: 4)
21 (degree: 4)
18 (degree: 5)
7 (degree: 5)
5 (degree: 5)
23 (degree: 5)
8 (degree: 5)
2 (degree: 5)
25 (degree: 5)
4 (degree: 5)
22 (degree: 6)
1 (degree: 6)
19 (degree: 6)
17 (degree: 6)
14 (degree: 6)
29 (degree: 6)
6 (degree: 6)
16 (degree: 6)
11 (degree: 6)
15 (degree: 7)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

Triangles:
- <2, 4, 12>
- <4, 12, 22>
- <4, 14, 16>
- <8, 1, 7>
- <8, 12, 22>
- <8, 15, 24>
- <12, 22, 26>
- <14, 16, 18>
- <14, 16, 29>
- <14, 23, 29>
- <16, 18, 21>
- <16, 18, 15>
- <1, 7, 25>
- <17, 19, 25>
- <18, 21, 6>
- <19, 9, 25>
- <19, 17, 23>
- <19, 17, 22>
- <19, 13, 3>
- <20, 17, 23>
