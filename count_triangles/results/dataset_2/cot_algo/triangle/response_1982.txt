Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 17) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 12) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 2) (19, 15) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 0) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 19) (11, 1) (11, 18) (16, 3) (16, 17) (17, 15) (17, 8) (17, 16) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 18) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 13) (0, 19) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) 

Response:
The given graph with the provided edges can be represented as:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

Edges: 
- 0: [19]
- 1: [11, 14]
- 2: [6, 10]
- 3: [15, 16, 5, 8, 18]
- 4: [7, 14]
- 5: [3, 6, 12, 10]
- 6: [5, 2]
- 7: [4, 14, 9]
- 8: [3, 9, 17]
- 9: [7, 8, 12]
- 10: [5, 13, 19, 2]
- 11: [19, 1, 18]
- 12: [5, 9, 13]
- 13: [10, 12, 14, 18]
- 14: [4, 7, 1, 13]
- 15: [3, 19, 17]
- 16: [3, 17]
- 17: [15, 8, 16]
- 18: [3, 11, 13]
- 19: [15, 10, 11, 0]

Now, we count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Triangles: [47]
