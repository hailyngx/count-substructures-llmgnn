Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 6, 3, 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 3, 2, 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 1, 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 7, 0, 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 3, 2, 8, 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 0, 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 0.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 6, 1.

By sorting the nodes based on their degrees, we get the following order: 2, 8, 5, 7, 0, 3, 1, 9, 4, 6.

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the total number of triangles: [6].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>.
