Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

```
   0 ---- 7 ---- 8 ---- 9
   |      |      |      |
   |      |      |      |
   3 ---- 5 ---- 1 ---- 6
    \    / \    / \    /
      2      4      1
```

Now, we will perform the Degree-Based Ordering as instructed to count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections:  
   Vertex 2 has 3 connections  
   Vertex 9 has 1 connection  
   Vertex 0 has 3 connections  
   Vertex 3 has 4 connections  
   Vertex 7 has 4 connections  
   Vertex 4 has 5 connections  
   Vertex 6 has 5 connections  
   Vertex 5 has 5 connections  
   Vertex 1 has 6 connections  
   Vertex 8 has 6 connections  

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:  
   Vertex 9 -> 0  
   Vertex 0 -> 1  
   Vertex 2 -> 2  
   Vertex 3 -> 3  
   Vertex 7 -> 4  
   Vertex 4 -> 5  
   Vertex 6 -> 6  
   Vertex 5 -> 7  
   Vertex 1 -> 8  
   Vertex 8 -> 9  

3. Start counting triangles by checking each edge starting from the lower labeled vertex:
   The total number of triangles in the graph is [9].

Unique triangles found in the graph are:  
<0, 8, 1>  
<0, 7, 5>  
<0, 3, 5>  
<0, 2, 3>  
<2, 1, 8>  
<3, 5, 1>  
<3, 5, 7>  
<3, 0, 7>  
<7, 5, 1>
