Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 4) (10, 8) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 10) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 6) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 3) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (0, 7) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (19, 16) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 12) (15, 9) (15, 1) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 11) (2, 11) (2, 1) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 6) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 6) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in the graph efficiently.

Let's sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):
Vertices: 
0 (degree: 2)
1 (degree: 3)
2 (degree: 3)
3 (degree: 4)
7 (degree: 4)
6 (degree: 4)
8 (degree: 4)
4 (degree: 4)
12 (degree: 3)
5 (degree: 4)
10 (degree: 4)
16 (degree: 4)
11 (degree: 4)
14 (degree: 4)
18 (degree: 4)
9 (degree: 4)
13 (degree: 4)
17 (degree: 5)
15 (degree: 3)
19 (degree: 2)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
Triangles: 
[25]
Unique triangles: <3, 4, 13>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 11>, <3, 4, 18>, <3, 7, 0>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 11>, <3, 11, 2>, <4, 6, 11>, <4, 6, 12>, <4, 6, 16>, <7, 0, 8>, <7, 3, 4>, <7, 3, 11>, <7, 8, 10>, <8, 13, 4>, <8, 13, 10>, <10, 12, 1>, <11, 2, 1>, <13, 9, 8>, <14, 5, 18>, <15, 1, 12>, <16, 5, 18>, <16, 6, 4>, <16, 6, 11>
