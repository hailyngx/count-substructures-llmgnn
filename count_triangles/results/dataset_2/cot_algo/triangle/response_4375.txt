Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 4) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 16) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 18) (7, 1) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 13) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 6) (4, 2) (18, 11) (18, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 5) (8, 15) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 8) (19, 2) (19, 16) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 17) (16, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 17) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 2) (5, 15) (5, 14) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 17) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting the number of triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Given a graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges.
2. Sort the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:

Nodes: [10, 11, 12, 18, 0, 5, 7, 8, 2, 6, 17, 1, 16, 19, 14, 3, 4, 9, 15, 13]

3. Relabel the nodes accordingly:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

4. For each edge, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles can be formed by shared connections between the lower labeled vertex and the higher labeled vertex in each edge.

5. Count the number of triangles and output them in the format <...>.

After analyzing the given edges based on the method described above, the total number of triangles found in the graph is: 

[<1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 17>, <1, 9, 14>, <2, 16, 17>, <4, 6, 17>, <4, 6, 2>, <14, 9, 0>, <16, 17, 2>, <16, 17, 6>, <16, 19, 2>, <16, 19, 17>, <16, 19, 6>] 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
