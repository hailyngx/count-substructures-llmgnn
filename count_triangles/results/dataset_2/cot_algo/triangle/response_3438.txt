Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 3) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 19) (15, 19) (15, 7) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 8) (5, 14) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 14) (4, 8) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (7, 15) (7, 18) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 10) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 2) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 12) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 6) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 19) (13, 3) (13, 19) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the provided edges:

Vertices (nodes):
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(11, 16), (11, 14), (11, 18), (11, 6), (16, 0), (16, 3), (3, 13), (3, 19), (15, 7), (14, 17), (14, 8), (14, 9), (14, 5), (17, 1), (5, 0), (5, 10), (9, 14), (4, 8), (8, 2), (8, 12), (7, 18), (12, 1), (2, 10), (1, 6), (0, 12)

Next, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
Vertices by degree:
4(1), 7(1), 9(1), 10(1), 15(1), 0(2), 1(2), 13(2), 17(2), 2(3), 5(3), 6(3), 9(3), 12(3), 16(3), 3(4), 7(4), 8(5), 11(5), 14(5), 18(5), 19(5)

Now, we start counting the triangles by considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
Triangles: 
[<5, 14, 0>, <1, 14, 5>, <1, 10, 5>, <1, 17, 14>, <0, 16, 3>, <0, 12, 1>]

Total number of triangles: [6]
