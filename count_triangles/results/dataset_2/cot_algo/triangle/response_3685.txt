Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 17) (14, 2) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 0) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 5) (1, 17) (1, 9) (0, 4) (0, 17) (5, 11) (5, 19) (19, 7) (19, 5) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 18) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 8) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 6) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 2) (13, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: {(3, 15), (3, 13), (15, 9), (15, 12), (4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 13), (4, 0), (4, 6), (7, 19), (7, 17), (14, 2), (17, 1), (10, 11), (10, 16), (11, 18), (11, 5), (1, 9), (0, 17), (5, 19), (16, 8), (12, 6), (8, 16), (9, 1), (18, 13)}

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the nodes by their degree:

Nodes by increasing degree: [14, 3, 5, 0, 2, 19, 10, 12, 1, 6, 8, 18, 7, 16, 11, 15, 13, 4, 9, 17]

Then we relabel the nodes accordingly:

New labels: {0: 14, 1: 3, 2: 5, 3: 0, 4: 2, 5: 19, 6: 10, 7: 12, 8: 1, 9: 6, 10: 8, 11: 18, 12: 7, 13: 16, 14: 11, 15: 15, 16: 13, 17: 4, 18: 9, 19: 17}

Now, let's count the number of triangles and list the unique triangles found:

Total number of triangles: [14]

Unique triangles: <4, 6, 13>, <1, 9, 18>, <0, 2, 14>, <0, 17, 18>, <2, 13, 14>, <9, 12, 18>, <9, 13, 18>, <7, 9, 12>, <7, 9, 13>, <5, 11, 19>, <5, 7, 19>, <5, 13, 19>, <8, 12, 16>, <8, 13, 16>
