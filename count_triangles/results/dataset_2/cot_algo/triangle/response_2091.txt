Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 19) (14, 0) (14, 19) (17, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 12) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 12) (3, 6) (3, 18) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 2) (19, 5) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 12) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 15) (7, 8) (7, 11) (16, 1) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 2) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 2) (1, 9) (1, 16) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (18, 0) (18, 3) (18, 15) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 15) (2, 10) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering is as follows:
Node 1: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 16: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 17: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4
Node 4: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5
Node 11: degree 5
Node 15: degree 5
Node 13: degree 6
Node 2: degree 6
Node 10: degree 6

Based on the degree-based ordering, we check each edge and count the triangles. We ensure that for each edge, the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections to avoid double-counting triangles.

Calculating the number of triangles using the provided edges, we find:
[Total number of triangles: 17]
<1, 7, 8>, <5, 10, 13>, <12, 15, 18>, <4, 6, 13>, <8, 10, 13>, <2, 10, 15>, <9, 11, 19>, <0, 12, 19>, <3, 6, 18>, <8, 11, 13>, <2, 6, 15>, <0, 14, 19>, <0, 12, 15>, <4, 8, 13>, <2, 11, 15>, <4, 10, 13>, <4, 12, 13>
