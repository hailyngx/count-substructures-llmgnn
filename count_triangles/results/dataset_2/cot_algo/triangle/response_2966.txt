Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph. 

Arranging the vertices based on their degrees:

0: degree 5  
2: degree 2  
4: degree 2  
6: degree 4  
7: degree 4  
9: degree 4  
3: degree 4  
1: degree 6  
8: degree 7  
5: degree 7  

Now, we will go through the edges in the order specified:

(0, 5): Both share vertices 1 and 6. Triangle formed <0, 5, 1>.  
(0, 1): Both share vertices 5 and 6. Triangle formed <0, 1, 5>.  
(0, 6): Both share vertices 1 and 5. Triangle formed <0, 6, 1>.  
(0, 8): No triangle formed.  
(1, 9): Both share vertices 5 and 6. Triangle formed <1, 9, 5>.  
(1, 7): Both share vertices 5 and 6. Triangle formed <1, 7, 5>.  
(1, 3): Both share vertices 5 and 6. Triangle formed <1, 3, 5>.  
(1, 6): Both share vertices 0, 5, and 9. Triangles formed <1, 6, 0> and <1, 6, 5>.  
(1, 2): No triangle formed.  
(3, 4): Both share vertices 5. Triangle formed <3, 4, 5>.  
(3, 8): Both share vertices 5. Triangle formed <3, 8, 5>.  
(3, 1): No triangle formed.  
(3, 5): Both share vertices 1, 4, 8, and 9. Triangles formed <3, 5, 1>, <3, 5, 4>, <3, 5, 8>, and <3, 5, 9>.  
(4, 5): Both share vertices 3. Triangle formed <4, 5, 3>.  
(4, 3): No triangle formed.  
(5, 9): Both share vertices 1. Triangle formed <5, 9, 1>.  
(5, 8): Both share vertices 3. Triangle formed <5, 8, 3>.  
(5, 4): No triangle formed.
