Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 3) (26, 12) (1, 26) (1, 21) (1, 18) (21, 1) (21, 8) (21, 29) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (27, 14) (27, 7) (27, 13) (27, 5) (3, 26) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 22) (22, 15) (23, 17) (23, 14) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 5) (17, 23) (17, 5) (29, 21) (29, 10) (7, 0) (7, 27) (7, 25) (7, 24) (7, 19) (25, 7) (25, 5) (25, 16) (8, 21) (8, 19) (8, 10) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 6) (14, 27) (14, 23) (28, 3) (28, 24) (28, 5) (6, 19) (6, 24) (24, 7) (24, 28) (24, 6) (24, 11) (12, 26) (12, 20) (12, 10) (16, 9) (16, 25) (16, 2) (11, 24) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 2) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 15) (10, 29) (10, 8) (10, 12) (5, 27) (5, 20) (5, 17) (5, 25) (5, 28) (13, 0) (13, 27) (2, 16) (2, 4) 

Response:
The graph consists of 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are provided. Let's represent this graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(9, 26) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 19) 
(26, 1) (26, 3) (26, 12)
(1, 21) (1, 18)
(21, 8) (21, 29)
(0, 7) (0, 13)
(27, 14) (27, 13) (27, 5)
(3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 18)
(15, 20) (15, 22)
(20, 12) (20, 5)
(17, 23) (17, 5)
(29, 10)
(7, 25) (7, 24) (7, 19)
(25, 16)
(8, 10)
(19, 6)
(28, 24)
(6, 11)
(16, 2)
(11, 4)
(18, 15)
(10, 12)
(5, 17)
(13, 0)
(2, 4)

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method. The triangles are listed inside <>:

Number of triangles: [15]
<0, 9, 19>, <0, 7, 25>, <0, 13, 27>, <1, 18, 3>, <1, 21, 8>, <2, 4, 16>, <3, 15, 18>, <5, 17, 27>, <5, 20, 15>, <5, 27, 13>, <5, 25, 16>, <7, 19, 9>, <7, 24, 25>, <10, 12, 20>, <11, 24, 6>
