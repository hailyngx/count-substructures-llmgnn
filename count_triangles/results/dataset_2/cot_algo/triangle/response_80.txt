Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) 

Response:
The given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 
- 0: [(4, 8), (2, 12), (14, 0), (0, 8), (0, 12)]
- 1: [(3, 1), (11, 1), (5, 1)]
- 2: [(0, 2), (14, 2), (2, 13)]
- 3: [(1, 3), (12, 3), (8, 3)]
- 4: [(11, 4), (7, 4), (12, 4), (0, 4), (14, 4)]
- 5: [(6, 5), (1, 5), (11, 5), (8, 5)]
- 6: [(9, 6), (5, 6), (7, 6), (10, 6), (13, 6)]
- 7: [(4, 7), (13, 7), (7, 6)]
- 8: [(0, 8), (3, 8), (5, 8), (9, 8)]
- 9: [(13, 9), (8, 9), (11, 9), (6, 9)]
- 10: [(14, 10), (12, 10), (10, 6)]
- 11: [(1, 11), (5, 11), (12, 11), (11, 9), (11, 4)]
- 12: [(0, 12), (2, 12), (3, 12), (4, 12), (11, 12)]
- 13: [(2, 13), (6, 13), (9, 13), (7, 13)]
- 14: [(10, 14), (0, 14), (2, 14), (4, 14)]

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:
0: degree 5
1: degree 3
2: degree 3
3: degree 3
7: degree 3
9: degree 4
10: degree 3
5: degree 4
8: degree 4
11: degree 5
13: degree 4
6: degree 5
14: degree 4
4: degree 5
12: degree 5

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

[Result]
Total number of triangles: [14]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 12>
<0, 8, 12>
<1, 3, 11>
<4, 11, 12>
<5, 6, 11>
<5, 8, 11>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 9, 13>
<6, 10, 14>
<7, 13, 4>
<8, 11, 12>
<12, 0, 14>
