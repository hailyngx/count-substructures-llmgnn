By sorting the nodes based on their degrees and relabeling them accordingly, we get the following Degree-Based Ordering:

Nodes sorted by degree:
7(2), 20(2), 23(3), 12(3), 18(3), 0(3), 2(3), 4(3), 6(4), 3(4), 24(4), 27(4), 16(4), 10(4), 14(4), 15(4), 21(4), 1(4), 5(4), 11(4), 25(4), 29(4), 13(4), 8(4), 17(4), 19(4), 26(5), 9(5), 22(5), 28(5)

Edges to consider based on Degree-Based Ordering:
(0, 7), (20, 11), (23, 19), (12, 6), (18, 10), (0, 24), (2, 8), (4, 19), (6, 27), (3, 26), (24, 3), (6, 25), (16, 13), (10, 13), (14, 9), (15, 29), (21, 22), (1, 21), (5, 26), (11, 2), (25, 16), (29, 15), (13, 16), (8, 26), (17, 21), (19, 23), (8, 28), (5, 17)
