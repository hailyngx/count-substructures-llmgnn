Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 12) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 13) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 4) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 4) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 3) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 4) (16, 14) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 4) (9, 10) (18, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 18) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 19) (4, 16) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 3) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) (3, 8) (3, 16) (3, 12) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: (0, 10), (0, 16), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 6), (1, 14), (1, 15), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 10), (3, 12), (3, 16), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 15), (4, 16), (4, 19), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 12), (6, 13), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 6), (7, 18), (8, 3), (8, 19), (8, 14), (9, 10), (10, 0), (10, 2), (10, 9), (11, 5), (11, 19), (11, 13), (12, 3), (12, 13), (12, 15), (12, 17), (13, 6), (13, 11), (13, 12), (14, 1), (14, 17), (14, 16), (14, 8), (15, 1), (15, 12), (15, 4), (16, 3), (16, 14), (16, 4), (16, 0), (17, 14), (17, 12), (18, 7), (19, 4), (19, 8), (19, 11)

After sorting the nodes by the number of connections, we get:

Nodes (sorted): 2, 18, 5, 9, 7, 10, 15, 11, 17, 8, 13, 16, 19, 3, 6, 1, 12, 0, 4, 14

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we observe the following triangles:

1. <0, 16, 4>
2. <1, 6, 7>
3. <1, 6, 12>
4. <1, 4, 15>
5. <3, 8, 16>
6. <4, 15, 12>
7. <6, 7, 1>
8. <6, 7, 18>
9. <6, 12, 13>
10. <8, 3, 16>
11. <11, 5, 13>
12. <12, 15, 4>
13. <12, 15, 6>

Total number of triangles: [13]
