Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 1) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 12) (17, 6) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 5) (16, 8) (16, 5) (18, 11) (18, 15) (19, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (5, 7) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 2) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 3) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 3) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 13) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 5) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 18) 

Response:
Edges sorted by the node with the lowest label:

(0, 19) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 19) 

(1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 12) 

(2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) 

(3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 14) 

(4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 8) 

(5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 16) (5, 2) 

(6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 2) 

(7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 5)
