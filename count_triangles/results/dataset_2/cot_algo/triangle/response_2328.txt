Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 10) (3, 5) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 6) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 0) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 6) (2, 0) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 18) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 8) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 19) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 8) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 18) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 14) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 11) (18, 13) (18, 1) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes with their degrees in descending order:
- Node 3: degree 6
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 2

Applying the method:
- Considering nodes with labels lower than their connecting nodes:
    - The triangles formed are: <0, 12, 19>, <0, 12, 9>, <0, 13, 14>, <0, 13, 19>, <0, 6, 15>, <0, 6, 14>, <0, 6, 19>, <0, 12, 11>, <0, 9, 14>, <0, 9, 5>, <1, 16, 8>, <1, 18, 13>, <1, 18, 16>, <1, 10, 17>, <3, 16, 17>, <3, 16, 1>, <3, 11, 12>, <3, 11, 9>, <3, 15, 6>, <3, 15, 16>, <4, 10, 17>
    - The total number of triangles is [21].
