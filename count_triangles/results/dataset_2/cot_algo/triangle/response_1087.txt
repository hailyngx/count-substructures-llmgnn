Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 2) (13, 9) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 2) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
Edges: (5, 8), (5, 12), (5, 1), (5, 14), (9, 6), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 13), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 11), (6, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 11), (1, 8), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 2), (10, 11), (10, 7), (10, 14), (11, 6), (11, 1), (11, 10), (11, 14), (11, 0), (11, 4), (4, 6), (4, 3), (4, 11), (4, 8), (8, 5), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 12), (8, 7), (0, 3), (0, 11), (0, 14), (14, 5), (14, 10), (14, 11), (14, 0), (14, 2), (13, 9), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 8), (2, 6), (2, 3), (2, 14), (2, 12), (...
  
To count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the nodes based on their degree:

Vertices with their connections:
- 0: deg(3)
- 2: deg(4)
- 13: deg(1)
- 7: deg(4)
- 10: deg(4)
- 12: deg(3)
- 14: deg(5)
- 5: deg(4)
- 8: deg(5)
- 9: deg(4)
- 6: deg(5)
- 3: deg(4)
- 4: deg(5)
- 11: deg(5)
- 1: deg(5)

Considering edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
- (0, 3) 
  Shared connections: 1
- (0, 11) 
  Shared connections: 1
- (0, 14) 
  Shared connections: None
- (2, 3) 
  Shared connections: None
- (2, 14) 
  Shared connections: 1
- (2, 12) 
  Shared connections: None
- (13, 9) 
  Shared connections: None
- (7, 9) 
  Shared connections: 1
- (7, 10) 
  Shared connections: None
- (7, 8) 
  Shared connections: None
- (10, 11) 
  Shared connections: 1
- (10, 14) 
  Shared connections: None
- (12, 5) 
  Shared connections: None
- (12, 8) 
  Shared connections: None
- (14, 5) 
  Shared connections: 1

There are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 1>, <7, 9, 1>, <10, 11, 1>.
