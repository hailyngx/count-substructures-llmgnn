Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 12) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 10) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) (10, 7) (10, 3) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 12) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 11) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with 15 nodes and the 60 edges provided:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
- Edges: 
  (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 8), (5, 3), 
  (9, 4), (9, 14), (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 12),
  (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 10), (7, 13), (7, 1), 
  (8, 5), (8, 11), (8, 12), 
  (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 13), 
  (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 12), (0, 2), 
  (14, 9), (14, 11), (14, 12), (14, 2), (14, 13), 
  (13, 5), (13, 7), (13, 6), (13, 14), (13, 2), (13, 3), 
  (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 0), (3, 13), (3, 10), 
  (11, 8), (11, 14), (11, 1), (11, 2), 
  (12, 4), (12, 8), (12, 0), (12, 14), (12, 1), 
  (10, 7), (10, 3), 
  (1, 7), (1, 11), (1, 12), 
  (2, 6), (2, 0), (2, 14), (2, 13), (2, 11)

Now, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections (degree) in ascending order with their new labels:

New labels: 
Nodes with degree 2: 10, 1
Nodes with degree 3: 0, 12, 8, 9, 11, 14
Nodes with degree 4: 5, 6, 4, 7, 13
Nodes with degree 5: 2, 3

Now, we will only consider the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections to find the triangles.
