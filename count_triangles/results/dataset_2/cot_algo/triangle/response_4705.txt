Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 18) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 19) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 16) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 10) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 0) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 12) (2, 12) (2, 11) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 11) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 8) (8, 14) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 1) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 19) (16, 6) (16, 1) (16, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 2) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 7) (19, 17) (19, 7) (10, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). 

The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is as follows:
Node 19 has degree 2.
Nodes 0, 1, 4, 10, and 15 have degree 3.
Nodes 2, 5, 7, 8, 13, and 16 have degree 4.
Nodes 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, and 17 have degree 5.
Node 3 has degree 6.
Node 18 has degree 7.

Now, let's use this order to count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles is [6].

The unique triangles are:
<0, 5, 18>
<1, 8, 14>
<3, 9, 18>
<3, 15, 18>
<5, 6, 13>
<7, 11, 16>
