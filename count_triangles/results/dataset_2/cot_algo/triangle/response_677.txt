Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method focuses on counting triangles efficiently in a graph. Let's start by constructing the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 0), (5, 0)
- 1: (0, 3), (0, 5), (3, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1)
- 2: (7, 2), (9, 2)
- 3: (0, 1), (1, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (9, 3)
- 4: (3, 9), (4, 6), (4, 9)
- 5: (0, 1), (1, 5), (3, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8)
- 6: (1, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)
- 7: (2, 7), (5, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9)
- 8: (1, 8), (5, 8), (7, 8)
- 9: (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (7, 9)

Now, let's assign labels based on the number of connections (degree) each node has from lowest to highest:
Nodes: 0 (degree 4), 2 (degree 2), 6 (degree 3), 8 (degree 3), 7 (degree 4), 9 (degree 5), 4 (degree 3), 3 (degree 5), 1 (degree 7), 5 (degree 6)

Using Degree-Based Ordering, we can now identify the triangles and count them efficiently. Here are the unique triangles found:

<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
