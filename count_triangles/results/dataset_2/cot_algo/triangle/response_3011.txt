Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 23) (1, 9) (21, 7) (21, 12) (21, 25) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 17) (6, 22) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 13) (9, 0) (7, 21) (7, 17) (7, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 20) (17, 6) (17, 7) (17, 27) (28, 6) (28, 8) (28, 5) (28, 15) (22, 6) (22, 26) (22, 2) (22, 16) (26, 22) (26, 16) (26, 4) (4, 26) (4, 27) (4, 16) (27, 17) (27, 4) (27, 2) (27, 5) (25, 21) (25, 19) (25, 18) (20, 10) (20, 29) (20, 24) (29, 20) (29, 16) (29, 24) (8, 7) (8, 28) (8, 19) (19, 25) (19, 8) (19, 23) (2, 22) (2, 27) (2, 5) (2, 11) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 4) (16, 29) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 23) (18, 25) (18, 23) (15, 28) (5, 28) (5, 27) (5, 2) (11, 2) (11, 24) (24, 20) (24, 29) (24, 11) (3, 12) (23, 1) (23, 19) (23, 0) (23, 18) (23, 12) (14, 10) (12, 21) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 23) (13, 9) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the provided nodes and edges. Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted by degree:
Nodes with degree 1: 3, 13, 15, 18, 20, 24, 29
Nodes with degree 2: 11, 14, 19
Nodes with degree 3: 7, 8, 18
Nodes with degree 4: 2, 5, 10, 27
Nodes with degree 5: 4, 16, 26
Nodes with degree 6: 17, 22
Nodes with degree 7: 6, 28

Triangles found: [<7, 17, 27>, <9, 1, 6>, <9, 1, 0>, <16, 26, 29>]

Total number of triangles: [4]
