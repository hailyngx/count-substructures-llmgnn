Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 16) (3, 10) (4, 9) (4, 19) (18, 12) (18, 13) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 17) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 12) (15, 2) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 13) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 13) (16, 1) (16, 14) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (17, 2) (17, 11) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 12) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 6) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 19) (7, 6) (7, 14) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 7) (14, 12) (12, 18) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
   - Node 1: 1 edge
   - Node 3: 1 edge
   - Node 7: 4 edges
   - Node 16: 2 edges
   - Node 4: 3 edges
   - Node 18: 2 edges
   - Node 8: 2 edges
   - Node 9: 3 edges
   - Node 5: 3 edges
   - Node 0: 3 edges
   - Node 10: 4 edges
   - Node 6: 3 edges
   - Node 17: 2 edges
   - Node 11: 4 edges
   - Node 19: 4 edges
   - Node 2: 4 edges
   - Node 12: 5 edges
   - Node 15: 4 edges
   - Node 14: 4 edges
   - Node 13: 4 edges

2. Relabel the vertices based on their sorted degrees:
   - Node 1 (degree 1) becomes Node 0
   - Node 3 (degree 1) becomes Node 1
   - Node 7 (degree 4) becomes Node 2
   - Node 16 (degree 2) becomes Node 3
   - Node 4 (degree 3) becomes Node 4
   - Node 18 (degree 2) becomes Node 5
   - Node 8 (degree 2) becomes Node 6
   - Node 9 (degree 3) becomes Node 7
   - Node 5 (degree 3) becomes Node 8
   - Node 0 (degree 3) becomes Node 9
   - Node 10 (degree 4) becomes Node 10
   - Node 6 (degree 3) becomes Node 11
   - Node 17 (degree 2) becomes Node 12
   - Node 11 (degree 4) becomes Node 13
   - Node 19 (degree 4) becomes Node 14
   - Node 2 (degree 4) becomes Node 15
   - Node 12 (degree 5) becomes Node 16
   - Node 15 (degree 4) becomes Node 17
   - Node 14 (degree 4) becomes Node 18
   - Node 13 (degree 4) becomes Node 19

3. Find the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
   - Triangle 1: <2, 4, 9> (common connection: 12) 
   - Triangle 2: <4, 7, 11> (common connection: 12)
   - Triangle 3: <9, 10, 12> (common connection: 0)
   - Triangle 4: <2, 6, 8> (common connection: 15)
   - Triangle 5: <7, 11, 14> (common connection: 19)
   - Triangle 6: <4, 12, 14> (common connection: 18)
   - Triangle 7: <2, 6, 15> (common connection: 8)
   - Triangle 8: <11, 12, 13> (common connection: 14)

There are 8 unique triangles found. The total number of triangles in this graph is [8].
