Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) (5, 8) (5, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 4) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 4) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 10) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges: 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 
(6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 11), (6, 12), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 14), (9, 0), 
(8, 13), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 12), (8, 7), 
(13, 8), (13, 11), (13, 3), (13, 1), (13, 0), 
(7, 8), (7, 12), 
(12, 6), (12, 8), (12, 7), (12, 14), (12, 3), 
(2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 1), 
(0, 9), (0, 13), (0, 14), (0, 10), (0, 3), 
(14, 9), (14, 12), (14, 0), (14, 3), (14, 1), (14, 10), 
(5, 8), (5, 10), 
(3, 13), (3, 12), (3, 0), (3, 14), 
(11, 6), (11, 13), (11, 4), 
(1, 6), (1, 13), (1, 2), (1, 14), (1, 4), 
(10, 0), (10, 14), (10, 5), (10, 4), 
(4, 11), (4, 1), (4, 10)

Now, we apply Degree-Based Ordering to count the number of triangles in the graph. 

Node degrees: 
Node 0: 5 connections  
Node 1: 5 connections 
Node 2: 3 connections 
Node 3: 4 connections 
Node 4: 3 connections 
Node 5: 2 connections 
Node 6: 4 connections 
Node 7: 2 connections 
Node 8: 5 connections 
Node 9: 4 connections 
Node 10: 4 connections 
Node 11: 3 connections 
Node 12: 5 connections 
Node 13: 5 connections 
Node 14: 6 connections 

Now, we sort the nodes based on degrees: 
Nodes in order: 5, 7, 2, 4, 11, 0, 10, 3, 6, 9, 1, 12, 8, 13, 14

Now, we count the triangles:
[Number of triangles: 9]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 9>, <0, 2, 13>, <0, 3, 13>, <0, 9, 13>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 13>, <3, 12, 13>, <6, 8, 12>, <10, 14, 0>
