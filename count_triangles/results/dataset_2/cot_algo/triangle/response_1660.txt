Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 17) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 6) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 8) (17, 11) (5, 3) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 8) (9, 10) (0, 11) (16, 10) (4, 12) (4, 14) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 2) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (14, 19) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 14) (18, 12) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are: 

0 → 1 connection   
16 → 1 connection  
7 → 2 connections  
18 → 2 connections  
3 → 3 connections  
5 → 3 connections  
4 → 3 connections  
6 → 3 connections  
15 → 4 connections  
17 → 6 connections  
2 → 6 connections  
12 → 6 connections  
19 → 6 connections  
1 → 7 connections  
9 → 7 connections  
11 → 7 connections  
8 → 8 connections  
13 → 8 connections  
10 → 8 connections  
14 → 8 connections  

After relabeling, the edges are written as follows:  
(0, 11) (7, 13) (18, 12) (3, 15) (3, 5) (4, 14) (6, 12) (7, 11) (3, 8) (10, 16) (15, 17) (1, 2) (1, 17) (3, 15) (1, 9) (1, 8) (17, 1) (1, 17) (5, 19) (2, 6) (1, 8) (17, 8) (5, 3) (8, 9) (8, 17) (9, 10) (9, 19) (8, 9) (0, 11) (5, 19) (4, 12) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 2) (7, 11) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 2) (9, 1) (9, 19) (10, 14) (14, 19) (14, 13)   

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [24].  
The unique triangles found are <0, 11, 7>, <14, 19, 5>, <1, 17, 3>, and <6, 12, 4>.
