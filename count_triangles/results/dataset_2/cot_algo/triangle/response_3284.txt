Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 8) (10, 5) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 13) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 12) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is as follows:
Vertex 8: Degree 3
Vertex 9: Degree 3
Vertex 6: Degree 4
Vertex 1: Degree 4
Vertex 10: Degree 2
Vertex 2: Degree 4
Vertex 13: Degree 4
Vertex 11: Degree 4
Vertex 0: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 5
Vertex 12: Degree 6
Vertex 5: Degree 6
Vertex 7: Degree 6
Vertex 4: Degree 6
Vertex 14: Degree 6

Considering the degree-based ordering, we will analyze the edges in the following order:
(10, 5), (9, 1), (10, 3), (10, 5), (13, 6), (13, 11), (13, 2), (13, 11), (8, 3), (8, 0), (8, 12), (6, 4), (6, 14), (6, 13), (1, 9), (5, 0), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 11), (7, 3), (0, 14), (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 12), (4, 2), (4, 7), (4, 12), (2, 1)

After analyzing the edges based on the degrees, we find the following triangles:

<8, 3, 0>
<8, 3, 12>
<8, 0, 14>
<8, 3, 7>
