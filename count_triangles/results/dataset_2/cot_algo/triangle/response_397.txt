By sorting the nodes based on their connections in ascending order, we get the following order:
Node 10 < Node 1 < Node 11 < Node 7 < Node 2 < Node 4 < Node 17 < Node 24 < Node 27 < Node 22 < Node 9 < Node 26 < Node 15 < Node 3 < Node 20 < Node 5 < Node 6 < Node 13 < Node 0 < Node 25 < Node 19 < Node 8 < Node 21 < Node 14 < Node 29 < Node 23 < Node 18 < Node 16 < Node 12

Calculating the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method gives us:
Total triangles: [13]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 18>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 12>, <0, 6, 18>, <0, 6, 12>, <2, 18, 5>, <5, 25, 22>, <5, 25, 18>, <5, 25, 15>, <5, 22, 24>, <18, 6, 12>, <12, 26, 24>
