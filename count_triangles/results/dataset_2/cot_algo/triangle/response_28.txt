Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 12) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 11) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 0) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 2) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 15 nodes and the given 60 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (7, 4), (13, 4), (3, 4)
- 1: (7, 1), (3, 1), (5, 1), (10, 1), (12, 1)
- 2: (10, 2), (6, 2), (14, 2), (2, 14)
- 3: (7, 3), (1, 3), (14, 3), (13, 3), (9, 3)
- 4: (7, 4), (13, 4), (3, 4)
- 5: (8, 5), (1, 5), (10, 5), (11, 5)
- 6: (10, 6), (2, 6)
- 7: (0, 7), (1, 7), (9, 7), (8, 7), (11, 7)
- 8: (7, 8), (13, 8), (5, 8)
- 9: (9, 3), (7, 9), (12, 9)
- 10: (10, 1), (1, 10), (5, 10), (6, 10), (2, 10)
- 11: (7, 11), (13, 11), (0, 11), (5, 11)
- 12: (12, 1), (13, 12), (9, 12), (2, 12)
- 13: (4, 13), (3, 13), (8, 13), (13, 12), (13, 11), (13, 0)
- 14: (14, 3), (2, 14), (0, 14)

Next, we will label the nodes based on their degrees from least to most connected. 

Nodes by degree: 6, 0, 4, 2, 8, 14, 12, 10, 11, 5, 9, 1, 3, 13, 7

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Total number of triangles: [11]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 13>
<0, 7, 11>
<0, 7, 13>
<2, 10, 5>
<3, 1, 10>
<3, 1, 13>
<3, 7, 11>
<3, 7, 13>
<5, 8, 13>
<5, 10, 1>
<5, 11, 7>
