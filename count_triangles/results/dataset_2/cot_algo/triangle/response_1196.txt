Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 15) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 18) (7, 16) (7, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (1, 14) (1, 5) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 18) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 15) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 19) (18, 8) (18, 6) (18, 5) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 2) (19, 9) (19, 15) (3, 0) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 15) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 17) (13, 12) (13, 9) (10, 8) (10, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 18) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 9) (17, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, the Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied as follows:

Node degrees:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 5
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 3

After sorting the nodes by their degrees and relabeling accordingly, the new order is:
(3) (1) (10) (12) (9) (19) (14) (5) (7) (16) (0) (2) (8) (18) (6) (13) (15) (4) (11) (17)

Now, we will iterate over the edges following the rule to consider only edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

Triangles found:
1. <0, 6, 8>
2. <0, 8, 4>
3. <0, 8, 17>
4. <3, 0, 15>
5. <6, 4, 14>
6. <6, 4, 17>
7. <6, 8, 18>
8. <6, 11, 17>
9. <7, 9, 17>
10. <9, 13, 12>
11. <9, 13, 17>
12. <9, 13, 19>
13. <9, 15, 19>
14. <13, 12, 5>
15. <15, 0, 16>
16. <15, 0, 19>
17. <15, 2, 14>
18. <17, 2, 10>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [18].
