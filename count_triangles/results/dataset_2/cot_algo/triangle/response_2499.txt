Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 13) (3, 4) (3, 0) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 10) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 12) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 13) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 10) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 12) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 12) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 

Node 2: Degree 3  
Node 10: Degree 3  
Node 6: Degree 3  
Node 5: Degree 4  
Node 3: Degree 4  
Node 0: Degree 5  
Node 9: Degree 7  
Node 7: Degree 7  
Node 4: Degree 7  
Node 1: Degree 7  
Node 8: Degree 7  
Node 11: Degree 7  
Node 13: Degree 4  
Node 12: Degree 5  
Node 14: Degree 6  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start counting triangles.
