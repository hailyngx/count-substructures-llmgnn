Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 11) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 13) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 13) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 12) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 6) 

Response:
The given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 11), (5, 4), (5, 3), 
(9, 3), (9, 0), 
(4, 5), (4, 13), (4, 11), (4, 6), 
(7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 1), 
(3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 11), 
(11, 5), (11, 4), (11, 3), (11, 0), (11, 8), (11, 12), 
(8, 11), (8, 14), (8, 10), (8, 6), 
(0, 9), (0, 11), (0, 10), (0, 13), (0, 2), 
(10, 8), (10, 0), 
(2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 0), (2, 13), 
(6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 12), (6, 13), 
(14, 8), (14, 1), (14, 12), 
(1, 7), (1, 14), (1, 12), 
(12, 11), (12, 6), (12, 14), (12, 1), 
(13, 4), (13, 0), (13, 2), (13, 6)

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph. Let's proceed with that calculation.
