Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 8) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 12) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 4) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 10) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 6) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(0, 1), (0, 13), (0, 6)
(1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 9)
(2, 13), (2, 6), (2, 4)
(3, 7), (3, 10), (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 4)
(4, 9)
(5, 14), (5, 4)
(6, 13), (6, 10), (6, 12)
(7, 11), (7, 8)
(8, 14), (8, 11), (8, 12)
(9, 11)
(10, 14), (10, 12)
(12, 14)

Next, let's find the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Sort the nodes by the number of connections:
0: 3 connections
2: 3 connections
9: 3 connections
7: 3 connections
4: 3 connections
10: 3 connections
13: 3 connections
1: 4 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
12: 4 connections
3: 5 connections
8: 5 connections
11: 5 connections
14: 6 connections

- Follow the method described earlier to count the number of triangles.
The total number of triangles is [14].

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 7, 11>
<3, 8, 12>
<3, 10, 14>
<5, 4, 9>
<5, 14, 12>
<6, 13, 2>
<6, 12, 10>
<7, 11, 8>
<8, 12, 14>
<10, 14, 12>
