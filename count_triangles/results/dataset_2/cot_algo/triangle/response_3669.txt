Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 2) (9, 28) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 11) (26, 4) (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 25) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 5) (27, 8) (22, 7) (22, 12) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 7) (20, 0) (20, 6) (25, 15) (25, 29) (25, 2) (8, 27) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 29) (8, 12) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 18) (1, 26) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 13) (17, 10) (17, 21) (17, 7) (21, 17) (21, 19) (28, 9) (4, 26) (4, 27) (4, 18) (4, 29) (18, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 16) (5, 27) (5, 13) (13, 10) (13, 5) (3, 10) (11, 26) (11, 2) (11, 29) (16, 18) (6, 20) (6, 14) (24, 0) (24, 7) (24, 12) (19, 21) (19, 18) (2, 9) (2, 25) (2, 11) (2, 12) (12, 22) (12, 8) (12, 24) (12, 2) (14, 23) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 6) (29, 25) (29, 8) (29, 4) (29, 11) (7, 22) (7, 23) (7, 17) (7, 24) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most:

Nodes with the least connections:
Node 16: 1 connection
Node 21: 1 connection
Node 19: 2 connections
Node 20: 2 connections
Node 15: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 10: 4 connections

Next, starting with edges where the lower-label vertex has fewer connections and checking for shared connections, we count the number of triangles formed.
