Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 22) (27, 11) (4, 8) (4, 20) (7, 3) (7, 5) (3, 7) (3, 25) (3, 22) (3, 18) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 5) (25, 16) (21, 16) (8, 4) (8, 23) (8, 28) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 18) (23, 2) (23, 1) (5, 7) (5, 25) (5, 29) (6, 24) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 0) (1, 23) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 14) (26, 11) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 26) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 19) (11, 27) (11, 26) (11, 2) (28, 8) (28, 24) (28, 10) (16, 25) (16, 21) (16, 17) (24, 6) (24, 28) (24, 13) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 18) (9, 25) (9, 20) (9, 19) (22, 27) (22, 3) (22, 14) (22, 29) (18, 3) (18, 23) (18, 17) (20, 4) (20, 9) (20, 12) (12, 14) (12, 20) (10, 28) (2, 23) (2, 11) (2, 17) (13, 15) (13, 24) (29, 5) (29, 22) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 9) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 30
Edges: 90

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by degree:
0: 4
1: 2
2: 4
3: 4
4: 2
5: 3
6: 3
7: 2
8: 4
9: 3
10: 1
11: 3
12: 2
13: 2
14: 4
15: 2
16: 3
17: 3
18: 3
19: 3
20: 3
21: 1
22: 4
23: 4
24: 3
25: 4
26: 3
27: 3
28: 3
29: 2
