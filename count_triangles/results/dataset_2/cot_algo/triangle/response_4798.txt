Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 12) (6, 13) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 11) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 12) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 12)
(1, 3), (1, 9), (1, 12)
(2, 5), (2, 11), (2, 12), (2, 13)
(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 8)
(4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 11), (4, 13), (4, 14)
(5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 9), (5, 10)
(6, 12), (6, 13)
(7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 8)
(8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 11), (8, 14)
(9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 10), (9, 11)
(10, 5), (10, 9), (10, 12)
(11, 2), (11, 4), (11, 8), (11, 13)
(12, 0), (12, 1), (12, 2), (12, 10)
(13, 2), (13, 4), (13, 6), (13, 11), (13, 14)
(14, 4), (14, 8), (14, 13)

Now, we will reorder the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes by degree: 
3: 2, 6, 10
4: 7, 13
5: 0
6: 12
7: 14
8: 1, 11
9: 5, 9
Node labels in decreasing order of degrees: 0, 12, 5, 13, 1, 11, 7, 14, 2, 3, 6, 10, 4, 8, 9

Now, we will count the triangles:
Triangles: 
[28]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 1>, <0, 3, 12>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 12, 2>, <0, 12, 1>, <0, 12, 10>, <1, 3, 12>, <1, 9, 5>, <1, 12, 2>, <1, 12, 10>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 8, 4>, <3, 8, 11>, <3, 8, 14>, <4, 11, 9>, <4, 13, 11>, <4, 13, 2>, <7, 8, 11>, <8, 11, 13>, <8, 11, 2>, <8, 11, 14>, <8, 14, 13>, <10, 12, 5>, <10, 12, 9>, <13, 11, 2>
