This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 3) (13, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 11) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 4) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) 

Response:
The graph edges are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 11.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 14, 4, and 12.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 10, 6, 12, and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 11, 13, 12, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 11, and 12.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 0, and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 10, and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 10, and 11.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 13, and 14.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 10, 1, 7, and 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 9, 11, 6, 7, and 2.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 10, 14, 7, 0, and 4.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 3, 2, and 4.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 11.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and relabeling the vertices accordingly, the graph becomes:
- Node 0: Degree 2
- Node 1: Degree 5
- Node 2: Degree 4
- Node 3: Degree 6
- Node 4: Degree 4
- Node 5: Degree 4
- Node 6: Degree 3
- Node 7: Degree 3
- Node 8: Degree 3
- Node 9: Degree 5
- Node 10: Degree 5
- Node 11: Degree 6
- Node 12: Degree 5
- Node 13: Degree 2
- Node 14: Degree 3

Now, let's count the triangles:
- The total number of triangles is [12].
- The unique triangles found are:
    - <0, 3, 11>
    - <0, 5, 6>
    - <1, 9, 12>
    - <1, 9, 4>
    - <1, 12, 2>
    - <2, 10, 6>
    - <3, 1, 12>
    - <3, 1, 4>
    - <4, 1, 12>
    - <4, 2, 12>
    - <6, 10, 2>
    - <9, 10, 7>
