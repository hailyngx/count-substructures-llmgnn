Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 10) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 14) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(5, 2), (5, 12), (5, 4), (5, 0), (9, 6), (9, 14), (9, 1), (9, 0), (4, 5), (4, 12), (4, 3), (4, 0), (4, 6), (7, 12), (7, 10), (7, 14), (6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 0), (8, 13), (8, 11), (8, 1), (13, 8), (13, 12), (13, 10), (13, 14), (12, 5), (12, 4), (12, 7), (12, 13), (12, 2), (12, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 10), (11, 8), (11, 14), (11, 0), (11, 2), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 12), (2, 5), (2, 12), (2, 11), (14, 9), (14, 7), (14, 13), (14, 11), (14, 10), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 11), (10, 7), (10, 13), (10, 3), (10, 14)

Next, we will sort the nodes by their degree in ascending order and assign labels accordingly:
6(2) 1(2) 3(3) 7(3) 8(3) 10(3) 13(3) 2(4) 9(4) 11(4) 14(4) 0(5) 12(5) 4(6) 5(6)

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 11]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 11>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 11, 2>
<1, 8, 13>
<2, 5, 12>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 10>
<7, 10, 14>
<9, 14, 11>
<10, 13, 14>
