Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's label the nodes based on their degrees.  
Node 0 has degree 4   
Node 9 has degree 4   
Node 2 has degree 3   
Node 3 has degree 3   
Node 8 has degree 3   
Node 1 has degree 3   
Node 5 has degree 4   
Node 6 has degree 6   
Node 7 has degree 5   
Node 4 has degree 6   

Sorting the nodes by their degrees, we get the following ordering: 
Nodes: 2, 3, 8, 1, 0, 9, 5, 7, 4, 6

Now, let's count the triangles:
Since we only consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections, we will examine the following edges:  
(2, 0) -> Shared connections: 6  
(3, 0) -> Shared connections: 6  
(3, 9) -> Shared connections: 1  
(3, 6) -> Shared connections: 1, 5  
(8, 0) -> Shared connections: 5   
(8, 6) -> Shared connections: 4  
(1, 0) -> Shared connections: 6  
(1, 9) -> Shared connections: 7  
(0, 5) -> Shared connections: 7  
(0, 7) -> Shared connections: 4   
(9, 7) -> Shared connections: 2  
(5, 3) -> Shared connections: 6  
(5, 6) -> Shared connections: 4   
(5, 7) -> Shared connections: 2   
(6, 8) -> Shared connections: 3  
(6, 4) -> Shared connections: 7  

Now summing up the triangles, we find:
[15]  

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 8, 6>, <1, 9, 7>, <3, 6, 5>, <4, 6, 5>, <6, 8, 0>, <5, 7, 2>, <3, 0, 5>, <3, 6, 4>, <1, 0, 5>, <6, 4, 7>, <8, 0, 7>, <9, 7, 2>
