Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 15) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 19) (10, 11) (10, 9) (11, 10) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 15) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 16) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 7) (12, 9) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 19) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 0) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 7) (16, 13) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 0) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 12) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 16) (13, 19) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 19) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is:
Node 10: degree 2
Node 11: degree 1
Node 12: degree 2
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4
Node 17: degree 3
Node 18: degree 3
Node 19: degree 5
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 8: degree 0
Node 9: degree 4

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will find the triangles in the graph. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is: [32]
The unique triangles found are: <1, 3, 19>, <2, 5, 18>, <3, 9, 19>, <4, 13, 16>, <7, 12, 9>, <15, 17, 14>, <15, 17, 18>, <3, 13, 4>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 4, 19>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 5, 18>, <9, 10, 12>, <9, 10, 11>, <13, 19, 4>, <13, 19, 3>, <13, 16, 4>, <13, 16, 19>, <9, 12, 7>, <9, 12, 16>, <10, 11, 9>, <14, 1, 7>, <14, 1, 17>, <14, 1, 3>, <14, 7, 16>, <14, 17, 16>, <15, 19, 3>, <15, 19, 18>, <17, 15, 19>, <2, 1, 4>, <2, 1, 3>
