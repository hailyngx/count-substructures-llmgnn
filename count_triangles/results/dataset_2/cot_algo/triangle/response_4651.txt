Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (4, 6) (4, 14) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: {(5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 12), (5, 0), (9, 8), (9, 14), (9, 0), (6, 14), (6, 2), (6, 4), (1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 7), (3, 7), (3, 13), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 7), (11, 14), (11, 7), (11, 8), (11, 12), (8, 13), (13, 3), (13, 2), (0, 9), (14, 6), (14, 4), (7, 10)}

Now, let's determine the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Sorted vertices based on their degree:
{4, 0, 3, 6, 1, 10, 2, 14, 12, 9, 7, 13, 8, 11, 5}

Triangles found: 
<2, 5, 0>
<2, 5, 13>
<2, 7, 14>
<4, 6, 14>
<1, 11, 7>
<8, 5, 9>
<8, 5, 12>
<8, 5, 13>
<8, 9, 14>
<8, 9, 0>
<11, 12, 10>
<11, 12, 7>

Total number of triangles: [12]
