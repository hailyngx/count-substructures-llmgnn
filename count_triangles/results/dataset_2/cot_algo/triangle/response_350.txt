Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree, from least to most connected. The sorted list of nodes with their respective degrees is as follows: 

(0, 4) -> (2, 2) -> (9, 2) -> (6, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (8, 4) -> (1, 5) -> (3, 5) -> (7, 5) -> (5, 5)

We will now analyze the edges based on the degree-based ordering:

Considering edges where the lower-degree node is listed first:
(2, 0) - Shared connections with node 4 form triangle <0, 2, 4>.
(0, 6) - Shared connections with node 4 form triangle <0, 6, 4>.
(0, 8) - Shared connections with node 4 form triangle <0, 8, 4>.
(6, 0) - Shared connections with node 4 form triangle <0, 6, 4>.
(6, 1) - No shared connections.
(4, 2) - Shared connections with node 6 form triangle <2, 4, 6>.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 8, 4>, <2, 4, 6>.
