Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- 0: {3, 4, 7, 2}
- 1: {9, 4, 8}
- 2: {6, 9, 7, 8, 0}
- 3: {7, 0, 5}
- 4: {6, 1, 0, 5}
- 5: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- 6: {9, 2, 4, 8}
- 7: {3, 0, 2, 5}
- 8: {6, 9, 1, 2, 5}
- 9: {6, 9, 1, 8}

Degree-Based Ordering:
Node 3 has degree 4
