Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 3) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 9) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 14) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 2) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) 

Response:
The graph with nodes and edges can be visually represented as:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 13), 
(1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 14), 
(2, 9), (2, 10), 
(3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 12), (3, 13),
(4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 11), (4, 14),
(5, 6), (5, 10),
(6, 10), (6, 12),
(7, 12),
(8, 10),
(9, 10), (9, 13), (9, 14),
(11, 12), (11, 14)

Let's sort the nodes based on the number of connections they have:

Vertices sorted by degree:
7, 2, 11, 5, 1, 8, 0, 13, 10, 3, 6, 14, 9, 4, 12

Now, we will count the triangles formed using the degree-based ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 4]
<0, 1, 14>
<0, 3, 13>
<0, 6, 3>
<10, 4, 9>
