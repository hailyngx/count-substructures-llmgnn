Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 12) (18, 17) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 9) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 15) (0, 12) (0, 9) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 1) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 6) (15, 11) (15, 5) (16, 18) (16, 3) (8, 6) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 8) (6, 10) (17, 18) (17, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 9) (14, 12) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 17) (9, 1) (2, 7) (2, 19) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (10, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted list of vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 10, 14, 8, 0, 16, 5, 2, 13, 17, 15, 12, 18, 6, 19, 7, 11, 3, 1, 9, 4

Following the method, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles in the graph. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [15]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 9, 17>, <0, 9, 1>, <0, 9, 4>, <5, 19, 2>, <5, 19, 6>, <2, 7, 1>, <7, 11, 1>, <7, 11, 3>, <7, 11, 15>, <7, 1, 4>, <3, 4, 9>, <11, 1, 4>, <11, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 9, 4>
