Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 3) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 18) (13, 10) (13, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 16) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 2) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 16) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 18) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 16) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 3) (15, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 15) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the triangles in the given graph. 

After sorting the nodes by their number of connections from least to most and relabeling them accordingly, the new ordering is as follows:
Nodes: [7, 15, 1, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19, 3, 10, 6, 8, 18, 4, 0, 14, 5, 17, 9, 2]
Edges to consider based on the lower label having fewer connections principle:
(4, 16) - Share 1 connection: 1, 8
(4, 8) - Share 1 connection: 9
(4, 9) - Share 1 connection: 6
(4, 18) - No common connection
(7, 12) - No common connection
(7, 1) - No common connection
(7, 16) - No common connection
(15, 2) - No common connection
(15, 19) - No common connection
(15, 16) - No common connection
(1, 11) - No common connection
(1, 17) - Share 1 connection: 3
(1, 7) - No common connection
(11, 10) - Share 1 connection: 13
(11, 12) - No common connection
(11, 1) - No common connection
(12, 7) - No common connection
(13, 8) - Share 1 connection: 10
(13, 10) - Share 1 connection: 11
(16, 1) - No common connection
(16, 19) - No common connection
(16, 2) - No common connection

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <1, 3, 17>, <4, 8, 9>, <10, 11, 13>
