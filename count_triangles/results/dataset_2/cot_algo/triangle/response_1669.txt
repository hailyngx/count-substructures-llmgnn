Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes can be relabeled in the following order: 

Node 9 has degree 5
Node 7 has degree 1
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 6 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 0 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 5
Node 2 has degree 3
Node 4 has degree 5
Node 5 has degree 4

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:

(7, 9) - Node 7 has fewer connections than Node 9. No triangles.
(7, 0) - Node 7 has fewer connections than Node 0. No triangles.
(7, 8) - Node 7 has fewer connections than Node 8. No triangles.
(7, 6) - Node 7 has fewer connections than Node 6. No triangles.
(7, 1) - Node 7 has fewer connections than Node 1. No triangles.
(7, 3) - Node 7 has fewer connections than Node 3. No triangles.
(7, 2) - Node 7 has fewer connections than Node 2. No triangles.
(7, 4) - Node 7 has fewer connections than Node 4. No triangles.
(7, 5) - Node 7 has fewer connections than Node 5. No triangles.
(9, 6) - Node 9 has fewer connections than Node 6. Possible triangle <9, 6, 1>.
(9, 1) - Node 9 has fewer connections than Node 1. No triangles.
(9, 3) - Node 9 has fewer connections than Node 3. Possible triangle <9, 3, 1>.
(9, 4) - Node 9 has fewer connections than Node 4. No triangles.
...
(0, 2) - Node 0 has fewer connections than Node 2. No triangles.

The total number of triangles found inside brackets []: [2].
The unique triangles found inside <>: <9, 6, 1>, <9, 3, 1>.
