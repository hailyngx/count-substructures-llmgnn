Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 26) (15, 18) (27, 28) (27, 5) (1, 22) (3, 18) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 12) (17, 10) (17, 25) (17, 0) (17, 4) (20, 15) (20, 22) (20, 24) (20, 6) (20, 11) (5, 27) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 14) (6, 20) (6, 5) (6, 29) (6, 19) (6, 0) (13, 26) (13, 4) (13, 23) (26, 15) (26, 10) (26, 13) (26, 7) (9, 29) (9, 14) (9, 16) (22, 1) (22, 20) (22, 7) (21, 19) (21, 8) (21, 24) (11, 20) (11, 23) (23, 13) (23, 11) (23, 16) (29, 6) (29, 9) (29, 0) (29, 25) (14, 5) (14, 9) (28, 27) (28, 8) (28, 19) (25, 17) (25, 29) (2, 24) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 28) (8, 12) (0, 17) (0, 6) (0, 29) (0, 12) (18, 15) (18, 3) (16, 9) (16, 23) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 19) (4, 17) (4, 13) (4, 24) (24, 20) (24, 21) (24, 2) (24, 4) (19, 6) (19, 21) (19, 28) (19, 12) (7, 26) (7, 22) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are as follows:
Nodes: 16, 2, 3, 1, 21, 27, 28, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, 25, 10, 13, 22, 23, 24, 0, 4, 6, 12, 19, 20, 26, 29, 15

After relabeling, the edges to consider are: 
(16, 9), (2, 24), (3, 18), (1, 22), (21, 8), (27, 28), (28, 5), (5, 7), (7, 26), (8, 21), (9, 14), (11, 23), (14, 5), (16, 23), (18, 15), (25, 17), (10, 12), (13, 26), (22, 1), (23, 11), (24, 2), (0, 12), (4, 13), (6, 0), (12, 8), (19, 12), (20, 15), (26, 10), (29, 6)
