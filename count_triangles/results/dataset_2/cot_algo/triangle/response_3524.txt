Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (2, 4, 5, 7)
- 1: (3, 5, 6, 9)
- 2: (0, 3, 7)
- 3: (1, 2, 4, 9)
- 4: (0, 3, 8, 9)
- 5: (0, 1, 6, 7)
- 6: (1, 5, 7, 8)
- 7: (0, 2, 5, 6, 9)
- 8: (4, 6, 9)
- 9: (1, 3, 4, 7, 8)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:

Vertices sorted by degree: 2, 8, 6, 5, 4, 0, 1, 7, 3, 9

Triangles:
1. <4, 9, 8>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <5, 6, 7>
4. <3, 4, 9>
5. <1, 3, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
