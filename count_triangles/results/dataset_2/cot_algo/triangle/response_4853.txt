Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 8) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 11) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method identifies and counts triangles in the graph. 

After sorting by the number of connections, the vertices are relabeled as follows:
Node 0 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 5 has 2 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 6 connections.
Node 9 has 6 connections.
Node 10 has 6 connections.
Node 11 has 6 connections.
Node 12 has 4 connections.
Node 13 has 4 connections.
Node 14 has 2 connections.

Now, we iterate through the edges keeping the lower labeled vertex on the left:
(0, 1): Shared connections with 2 forming triangle <0, 1, 2>.
(0, 2): Shared connections with 4 forming triangle <0, 2, 4>.
(0, 4): Shared connections with 10 forming triangle <0, 4, 10>.
(1, 6): Shared connections with 3 forming triangle <1, 6, 3>.
(2, 3): Shared connections with 9 forming triangle <2, 3, 9>.
(4, 10): Shared connections with 0 forming triangle <4, 10, 0>.
(5, 8): No triangles.
(7, 12): No triangles.
(8, 12): Shared connections with 6 forming triangle <8, 12, 6>.
(9, 10): Shared connections with 4 forming triangle <9, 10, 4>.
(9, 11): Shared connections with 13 forming triangle <9, 11, 13>.

Hence, the total number of triangles is [5].
