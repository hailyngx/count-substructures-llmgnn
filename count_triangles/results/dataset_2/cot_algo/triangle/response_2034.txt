Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 28) (21, 3) (21, 2) (0, 15) (27, 16) (10, 17) (10, 22) (10, 4) (17, 10) (17, 24) (17, 5) (17, 7) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 14) (26, 15) (26, 8) (6, 24) (6, 14) (6, 20) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 26) (15, 18) (3, 21) (3, 13) (3, 22) (11, 23) (11, 14) (23, 11) (23, 29) (23, 16) (14, 19) (14, 6) (14, 11) (7, 17) (7, 13) (16, 27) (16, 23) (16, 4) (16, 9) (24, 17) (24, 6) (24, 8) (24, 5) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 28) (18, 13) (2, 21) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (5, 17) (5, 24) (5, 2) (5, 12) (29, 23) (8, 26) (8, 24) (8, 22) (12, 5) (12, 20) (12, 9) (20, 6) (20, 12) (20, 4) (20, 28) (25, 28) (9, 16) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 20) (22, 10) (22, 3) (22, 8) (22, 28) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 18) (28, 1) (28, 18) (28, 20) (28, 25) (28, 22)

Node 0: 15, 1
Node 1: 15, 28
Node 2: 21, 3
Node 3: 21, 2
Node 4: 15, 17, 19, 26, 6, 2
Node 5: 17, 24, 2, 12
Node 6: 24, 14, 20, 15
Node 7: 17, 13
Node 8: 26, 24, 22, 9
Node 9: 16, 2, 12
Node 10: 17, 22, 4
Node 11: 23, 14
Node 12: 5, 9, 20
Node 13: 3, 7, 18
Node 14: 19, 6, 11
Node 15: 18, 26, 0, 6
Node 16: 27, 23, 4, 9
Node 17: 10, 24, 5, 7
Node 18: 19, 15, 13, 28
Node 19: 18, 4, 14
Node 20: 6, 12, 4, 28
Node 21: 2, 3
Node 22: 10, 8, 28
Node 23: 11, 29, 16
Node 24: 17, 6, 8, 5
Node 25: 28
Node 26: 15, 8
Node 27: 16
Node 28: 1, 18, 20, 25, 22
Node 29: 23

Now, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.
