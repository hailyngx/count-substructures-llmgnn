Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed based on the given information. Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by their degree: 
Node 7: degree 1
Node 2: degree 2
Node 9: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 1: degree 5
Node 0: degree 6
Node 3: degree 6

Now, let's count the triangles:
- For edge (1, 8): Node 1 has connections with nodes 4, 7, 3, 2, and 8. Node 8 has connections with nodes 6, 1, and 0. The shared connection between nodes 1 and 8 is node 1. 
  Triangle: (1, 8, 1) or equivalently (1, 8, 0)

- For edge (1, 7): Node 1 has connections with nodes 4, 7, 3, 2, and 8. Node 7 has a connection with node 1. The shared connection between nodes 1 and 7 is node 1. 
  Triangle: (1, 7, 1) or equivalently (1, 7, 4)

- For edge (4, 1): Node 4 has connections with nodes 0, 1, and 3. Node 1 has connections with nodes 4, 7, 3, 2, and 8. The shared connection between nodes 4 and 1 is node 1. 
  Triangle: (4, 1, 1) or equivalently (4, 1, 0)

The total number of triangles is [3].
The unique triangles found are <1, 8, 0>, <1, 7, 4>, <4, 1, 0>.
