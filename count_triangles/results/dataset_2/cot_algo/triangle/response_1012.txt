Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph by listing the nodes and their connections.

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 3), (9, 5), (9, 2), (9, 3), (4, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 8), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 3), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 8), (2, 9), (2, 7), (2, 3), (2, 8), (2, 6), (2, 0), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 3), (8, 2), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 0), (0, 4), (0, 2), (0, 6)

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Degree-Based Ordering:
Node 9: Degree=3
Node 1: Degree=3
Node 7: Degree=3
Node 0: Degree=3
Node 6: Degree=3
Node 8: Degree=4
Node 4: Degree=4
Node 5: Degree=4
Node 2: Degree=6
Node 3: Degree=6

Now, analyzing the edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:
(3, 5) - Shared connection with 9: <3, 5, 9>
(3, 9) - Shared connection with 5: <3, 5, 9>
(3, 1) - Shared connection with 7: <3, 1, 7>
(7, 1) - Shared connection with 4: <7, 1, 4>
(7, 4) - Shared connection with 8: <7, 4, 8>
(1, 4) - Shared connection with 5: <1, 4, 5>
(1, 5) - Shared connection with 8: <1, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6] and the unique triangles are <3, 5, 9>, <3, 1, 7>, <7, 1, 4>, <7, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 8>.
