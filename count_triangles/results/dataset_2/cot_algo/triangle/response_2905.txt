Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the vertices is as follows:
Vertex 0: Degree 2
Vertex 1: Degree 2
Vertex 7: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 4
Vertex 5: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 5
Vertex 2: Degree 5
Vertex 6: Degree 6
Vertex 9: Degree 6
Vertex 4: Degree 6

Now, we will look at the edges by following the degree-based ordering to count the number of triangles:

1. Vertex 0 and Vertex 2:
   - Shared connections: Vertex 2 and Vertex 7
   - Triangle: <0, 2, 7>

2. Vertex 0 and Vertex 7:
   - Shared connections: Vertex 7 and Vertex 6
   - Triangle: <0, 7, 6>

3. Vertex 2 and Vertex 5:
   - Shared connections: Vertex 5 and Vertex 8
   - Triangle: <2, 5, 8>

4. Vertex 2 and Vertex 1:
   - No triangle formed.

5. Vertex 7 and Vertex 8:
   - Shared connections: Vertex 8 and Vertex 6
   - Triangle: <7, 8, 6>

6. Vertex 7 and Vertex 6:
   - Shared connections: Vertex 6 and Vertex 1
   - Triangle: <7, 6, 1>

7. Vertex 8 and Vertex 5:
   - Shared connections: Vertex 5 and Vertex 4
   - Triangle: <8, 5, 4>

8. Vertex 8 and Vertex 3:
   - No triangle formed.

9. Vertex 5 and Vertex 4:
   - Shared connections: Vertex 4 and Vertex 6
   - Triangle: <5, 4, 6>

10. Vertex 4 and Vertex 6:
    - Shared connections: Vertex 6 and Vertex 9
    - Triangle: <4, 6, 9>

The total number of triangles is [6].
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 7>, <0, 7, 6>, <2, 5, 8>, <7, 8, 6>, <7, 6, 1>, <5, 4, 6>.
