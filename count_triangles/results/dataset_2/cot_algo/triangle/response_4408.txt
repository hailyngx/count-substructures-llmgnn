Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 4) (22, 25) (0, 27) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 2) (27, 20) (27, 23) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 19) (29, 27) (29, 28) (29, 20) (29, 19) (6, 28) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (7, 12) (7, 17) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 21) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 16) (21, 12) (21, 24) (24, 21) (1, 14) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 18) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 23) (17, 15) (5, 19) (5, 26) (19, 28) (19, 29) (19, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 26) (8, 18) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 23) (20, 27) (20, 29) (10, 1) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 26) (15, 25) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 3) (26, 5) (26, 8) (26, 15) (4, 22) (4, 6) (4, 2) (25, 22) (25, 17) (25, 15) (25, 18) (11, 6) (11, 18) (2, 27) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 3) (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 2) (23, 27) (23, 17) (23, 9) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 25) (18, 11) 

Response:
Let's start by constructing the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges:
(0, 27), (1, 14), (1, 17), (1, 2), (1, 10), (1, 18), (2, 27), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 6), (3, 16), (3, 2), (4, 22), (4, 6), (4, 2), (5, 19), (5, 26), (6, 28), (6, 14), (6, 3), (6, 11), (6, 4), (7, 12), (7, 17), (7, 8), (8, 7), (8, 9), (8, 26), (8, 18), (9, 8), (9, 15), (9, 23), (10, 1), (11, 6), (11, 18), (12, 7), (12, 21), (14, 6), (14, 1), (14, 16), (15, 17), (15, 9), (15, 16), (15, 26), (15, 25), (16, 14), (16, 15), (16, 3), (17, 7), (17, 1), (17, 25), (17, 23), (17, 15), (18, 1), (18, 8), (18, 25), (18, 11), (19, 28), (19, 29), (19, 5), (20, 27), (20, 29), (21, 12), (21, 24), (22, 4), (22, 25), (23, 27), (23, 17), (23, 9), (24, 21), (25, 22), (25, 17), (25, 15), (25, 18), (26, 5), (26, 8), (26, 15), (27, 0), (27, 29), (27, 2), (27, 20), (27, 23), (28, 29), (28, 6), (28, 19), (29, 27), (29, 28), (29, 20), (29, 19)

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
