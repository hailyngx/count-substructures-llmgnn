Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degree is: 
Nodes: 5, 6, 8, 1, 2, 8, 3, 0, 7, 9

Calculating the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Starting with the edge (5, 9): 5 is connected to 0, 4, and 9. 9 is connected to 5, 6, 4, 7, and 0. So, the shared connections between 5 and 9 are 0 and 4, forming the triangle <5, 9, 4>.
- Skipping the edge (5, 4) since 5 has higher degree than 4.
- Proceeding with the edge (5, 0): The shared connections between 5 and 0 are 4, forming the triangle <5, 9, 0>.
- Proceeding with the edge (9, 6): 6 is connected to 1, 7, and 9. So, the shared connections between 9 and 6 are 7, forming the triangle <9, 5, 6>.
- Proceeding with the edge (9, 4): The shared connections between 9 and 4 are 5 and 7, forming the triangle <9, 5, 4>.
- Skipping the rest of the edges due to the degree-based ordering.

The total number of triangles is [4].
The unique triangles found are <5, 9, 4>, <5, 9, 0>, <9, 5, 6>, and <9, 5, 4>.
