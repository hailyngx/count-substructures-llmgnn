Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 10) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 18) (26, 21) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 20) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (18, 26) (18, 22) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 12) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 24) (23, 25) (23, 6) (23, 13) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 2) (20, 4) (20, 0) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 21) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 27) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 24) (17, 5) (5, 17) (5, 19) (19, 22) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 5) (29, 0) (29, 14) (3, 21) (3, 24) (3, 6) (21, 26) (21, 15) (21, 3) (12, 4) (12, 22) (12, 25) (16, 28) (28, 16) (28, 27) (2, 4) (2, 22) (2, 11) (2, 0) (24, 11) (24, 8) (24, 0) (24, 17) (24, 3) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 29) (6, 7) (6, 23) (6, 3) (27, 1) (27, 28) (25, 23) (25, 12) (13, 11) (13, 23) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Let's calculate the number of triangles based on the given graph.

After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:

Node 3: Degree 3
Node 16: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 18: Degree 4
Node 26: Degree 4
Node 29: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 5
Node 15: Degree 5
Node 10: Degree 6
Node 1: Degree 7
Node 20: Degree 7
Node 6: Degree 8
Node 0: Degree 9
Node 12: Degree 9
Node 19: Degree 9
Node 27: Degree 9
Node 17: Degree 10
Node 28: Degree 10
Node 11: Degree 11
Node 8: Degree 12
Node 24: Degree 12
Node 21: Degree 12
Node 7: Degree 13
Node 25: Degree 13
Node 4: Degree 14
Node 22: Degree 14
Node 2: Degree 15
Node 9: Degree 16

Now, we will count the triangles:

1. <6, 23, 25>
2. <0, 4, 20>
3. <0, 4, 22>
4. <0, 24, 3>
5. <8, 10, 24>
6. <10, 11, 19>
7. <12, 4, 22>
8. <12, 4, 25>
9. <12, 22, 25>
10. <15, 17, 24>
11. <17, 5, 19>
12. <17, 5, 24>
13. <19, 5, 24>
14. <22, 2, 11>
15. <22, 2, 19>
16. <22, 11, 19>
17. <2, 0, 24>
18. <2, 11, 19>
19. <2, 22, 11>
20. <2, 22, 0>
21. <2, 22, 19>
22. <2, 22, 12>
23. <2, 22, 0>
24. <5, 17, 24>
25. <17, 15, 21>

Total number of triangles: [25]
