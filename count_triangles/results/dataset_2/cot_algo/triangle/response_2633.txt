Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 19) (25, 0) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 10) (22, 29) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 14) (23, 29) (23, 20) (1, 26) (1, 19) (1, 27) (1, 18) (26, 1) (26, 10) (20, 23) (20, 18) (20, 5) (20, 11) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 17) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 29) (8, 17) (8, 7) (13, 21) (13, 7) (5, 20) (5, 18) (11, 20) (16, 19) (16, 27) (28, 0) (28, 19) (28, 18) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 21) (12, 10) (12, 21) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (17, 25) (17, 23) (17, 2) (17, 8) (19, 25) (19, 22) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 28) (10, 22) (10, 26) (10, 12) (27, 1) (27, 16) (21, 13) (21, 4) (21, 12) (21, 0) (0, 25) (0, 28) (0, 4) (0, 21) (24, 3) (24, 14) (29, 22) (29, 23) (29, 8) (14, 23) (14, 4) (14, 24) (18, 1) (18, 20) (18, 5) (18, 28) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and relabeling them accordingly. 

After relabeling the nodes, the new ordering based on the number of connections is:
Nodes: 3, 6, 25, 22, 23, 20, 1, 26, 2, 8, 0, 4, 16, 27, 10, 12, 21, 7, 14, 29, 18, 5, 11, 13, 17, 24, 9, 19, 28, 15, 30

Then, we go through the edges one by one and count the triangles that can be formed. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [36].

Unique triangles found are:
<0, 19, 28>
<0, 4, 21>
<0, 25, 3>
<1, 18, 20>
<1, 18, 26>
