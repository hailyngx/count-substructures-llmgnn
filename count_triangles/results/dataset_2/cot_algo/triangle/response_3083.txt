Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes can be represented with their connections as follows:
0: 9, 4, 6, 8, 2, 1
1: 5, 9, 7, 6, 0
2: 6, 0, 3
3: 5, 7, 6, 2
4: 9, 8, 0
5: 9, 1, 3, 7
6: 9, 4, 1, 3, 2, 0
7: 5, 3, 1
8: 4, 0
9: 5, 6, 4, 1, 0

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the nodes can be relabeled as follows:
0: 0
1: 4
2: 3
3: 2
4: 1
5: 8
6: 9
7: 5
8: 6
9: 7

Now, we can check for triangles based on the edge connections:
- For edge (0, 4): Shared connections with 4 are 9, 0 -> Triangle: <0, 4, 9>
- For edge (0, 6): Shared connections with 6 are 9, 0 -> Triangle: <0, 6, 9>
- For edge (0, 8): Shared connections with 8 are 4, 0 -> Triangle: <0, 8, 4>
- For edge (0, 2): Shared connections with 2 are 6, 0 -> Triangle: <0, 2, 6>
- For edge (1, 4): Shared connections with 4 are 9, 0 -> Triangle: <1, 4, 9>
- For edge (1, 6): Shared connections with 6 are 9, 1 -> Triangle: <1, 6, 9>
- For edge (2, 3): Shared connections with 3 are 6, 2 -> Triangle: <2, 3, 6>
- For edge (3, 5): Shared connections with 5 are 9, 1 -> Triangle: <3, 5, 9>
- For edge (3, 7): Shared connections with 7 are 5, 1 -> Triangle: <3, 7, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 8, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 7, 5>.
