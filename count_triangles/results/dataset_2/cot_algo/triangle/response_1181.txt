Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 16) (9, 1) (26, 18) (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 24) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 22) (6, 27) (3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 23) (25, 3) (25, 19) (25, 12) (25, 24) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 23) (1, 18) (2, 12) (2, 7) (18, 26) (18, 1) (18, 29) (15, 17) (15, 28) (20, 27) (20, 4) (0, 29) (0, 19) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 16) (19, 25) (19, 0) (19, 22) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 23) (21, 8) (28, 15) (28, 21) (13, 16) (13, 29) (13, 23) (13, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 27) (10, 21) (10, 8) (24, 5) (24, 25) (22, 6) (22, 19) (22, 12) (12, 25) (12, 2) (12, 22) (12, 17) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 29) (29, 18) (29, 0) (29, 13) (29, 7) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 10) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 13) (17, 15) (17, 12) (27, 6) (27, 20) (27, 11) (4, 20) (4, 14) (23, 3) (23, 1) (23, 21) (23, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in this graph.

The nodes sorted by their degree are:  
Node 28: Degree 2  
Node 17: Degree 2  
Node 0: Degree 2  
Node 10: Degree 2  
Node 4: Degree 2  
Node 15: Degree 2  
Node 18: Degree 3  
Node 20: Degree 2  
Node 16: Degree 3  
Node 5: Degree 3  
Node 22: Degree 3  
Node 6: Degree 4  
Node 25: Degree 4  
Node 27: Degree 4  
Node 26: Degree 1  
Node 1: Degree 4  
Node 3: Degree 4  
Node 24: Degree 3  
Node 12: Degree 4  
Node 29: Degree 4  
Node 21: Degree 4  
Node 19: Degree 3  
Node 7: Degree 4  
Node 11: Degree 3  
Node 8: Degree 3  
Node 9: Degree 4  
Node 2: Degree 3  
Node 13: Degree 4  

By examining the edges, we can identify the triangles formed by shared connections. 

The total number of triangles is [60], and the unique triangles found are:
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 3, 23>
<1, 9, 16>
<1, 23, 21>
<3, 9, 1>
