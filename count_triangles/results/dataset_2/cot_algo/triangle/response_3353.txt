Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (5, 9), (5, 7), (5, 0), (4, 7), (4, 0), (3, 7), (3, 0), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2)
- 1: (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 1), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 1), (1, 9), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 8), (8, 7), (8, 1)
- 2: (9, 6), (9, 1), (9, 2), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 8), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 8), (3, 6), (6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 8), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 1)
- 3: (7, 3), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 6), (6, 3)
- 4: (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 6), (6, 4)
- 5: (5, 9), (5, 7), (5, 0), (0, 5)
- 6: (9, 6), (4, 6), (7, 3), (3, 6), (6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 8), (8, 6)
- 7: (4, 7), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 8), (7, 1), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 8), (3, 7), (8, 7)
- 8: (7, 8), (1, 8), (3, 6), (6, 8), (8, 6), (8, 7)
- 9: (5, 9), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 1), (1, 9), (2, 9)

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Nodes sorted by degree:
0: degree 4
3: degree 4
4: degree 4
5: degree 4
2: degree 5
8: degree 5
6: degree 6
7: degree 6
1: degree 7
9: degree 7

Count of triangles inside brackets []: [24]

Unique triangles found inside <>:
