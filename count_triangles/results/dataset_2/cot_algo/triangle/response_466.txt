Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 19) (25, 21) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) (8, 13) (8, 24) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 14) (17, 10) (17, 24) (17, 12) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 24) (18, 12) (18, 28) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 28) (15, 20) (15, 0) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 4) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 20) (21, 25) (21, 13) (21, 28) (28, 18) (28, 22) (28, 21) (28, 27) (1, 27) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 24) (0, 26) (7, 20) (7, 0) (5, 11) (19, 25) (19, 14) (19, 6) (9, 11) (9, 23) (27, 28) (27, 1) (27, 29) (16, 22) (16, 24) (16, 29) (2, 3) (2, 12) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 2) (12, 29) (23, 9) (23, 26) (26, 20) (26, 0) (26, 23) (26, 6) (24, 8) (24, 17) (24, 18) (24, 0) (24, 16) (29, 27) (29, 16) (29, 12) (14, 13) (14, 19) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 26) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, ..., 29}
Edges: 
(3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 2) 
(25, 19) (25, 21) 
(10, 11) (10, 17) 
(11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) 
(8, 13) (8, 24) 
(13, 21) (13, 14) 
(17, 12) 
(18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 24) (18, 28) 
(22, 16) (22, 28) 
(15, 20) (15, 0) 
(20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 4) 
(4, 18) 
(21, 28) 
(28, 27) 
(1, 27) 
(0, 7) 
(7, 5) 
(19, 6) 
(9, 23) 
(27, 29) 
(16, 24) 
(2, 12) 
(12, 29) 
(26, 23) 

To start counting triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we need to sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes sorted by degrees:
<1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 16, 17, 19, 29, 4, 6, 10, 11, 14, 18, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 2, 7, 8, 0, 12, 20, 21, 23, 28, 13>

Now, we will count the triangles. 

The total number of triangles is [17].

The unique triangles are:
<0, 4, 20>
<4, 18, 28>
<4, 18, 24>
<4, 20, 26>
<5, 11, 6>
<11, 10, 17>
<11, 6, 19>
<12, 2, 3>
<12, 2, 29>
<12, 17, 18>
<12, 17, 24>
<12, 18, 24>
<16, 22, 28>
<16, 24, 18>
<16, 24, 29>
<16, 29, 27>
<18, 4, 3>
<18, 4, 20>
