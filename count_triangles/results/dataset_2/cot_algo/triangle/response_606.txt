Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 1) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has.

The sorted vertices based on their degree are:
Vertex 11 (degree 2)
Vertex 14 (degree 3)
Vertex 3 (degree 3)
Vertex 0 (degree 3)
Vertex 10 (degree 3)
Vertex 9 (degree 4)
Vertex 1 (degree 4)
Vertex 13 (degree 5)
Vertex 8 (degree 5)
Vertex 5 (degree 5)
Vertex 7 (degree 5)
Vertex 4 (degree 6)
Vertex 12 (degree 6)
Vertex 6 (degree 6)
Vertex 2 (degree 6)

Triangles found using the degree-based ordering method and the list of unique triangles:
Total number of triangles: [19]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 4>, <1, 7, 10>, <1, 7, 12>, <1, 7, 13>, <1, 8, 5>, <1, 8, 7>, <1, 8, 9>, <1, 8, 11>, <1, 14, 2>, <1, 14, 13>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 12>, <4, 5, 12>, <4, 5, 13>, <4, 6, 10>, <8, 9, 12>, <12, 13, 5>, <12, 13, 11>
