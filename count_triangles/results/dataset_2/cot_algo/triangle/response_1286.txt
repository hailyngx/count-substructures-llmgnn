Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 3) (11, 26) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 22) (16, 19) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 17) (29, 11) (29, 13) (29, 5) (7, 21) (7, 18) (7, 8) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 3) (21, 18) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 4) (18, 2) (18, 7) (18, 21) (18, 4) (28, 11) (28, 5) (28, 23) (3, 11) (3, 21) (3, 4) (3, 20) (17, 2) (17, 20) (17, 5) (20, 3) (20, 17) (20, 13) (20, 27) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 0) (5, 29) (5, 28) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 22) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 14) (0, 15) (0, 25) (10, 2) (10, 21) (10, 13) (10, 23) (14, 19) (26, 11) (26, 25) (25, 0) (25, 26) (27, 20) (27, 24) (27, 9) (6, 23) (12, 24) (12, 22) (12, 9) (23, 28) (23, 10) (23, 6) (23, 9) (9, 27) (9, 12) (9, 23) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 12) (24, 27) (24, 12) (13, 29) (13, 20) (13, 10) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, the list of edges provided can be used to construct the graph with connections between the nodes. Here is the list of unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <2, 4, 8>
2. <2, 5, 17>
3. <2, 10, 21>
4. <2, 17, 20>
5. <3, 4, 21>
6. <3, 11, 21>
7. <3, 20, 21>
8. <5, 17, 20>
9. <5, 19, 22>
10. <9, 12, 24>
11. <10, 13, 29>
12. <10, 21, 23>
13. <11, 16, 29>
14. <13, 20, 29>

Total number of triangles: [14]
