Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 1) (12, 4) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 1) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 10) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and relabeling them accordingly.

The sorted vertices with their connections are as follows:
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 11: 5 connections
Node 10: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 4: 7 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we will now count the number of triangles by checking the shared connections between the two vertices of each edge. 

The triangles found are:
<0, 12, 4>
<0, 12, 8>
<0, 12, 11>
<0, 14, 4>
<0, 14, 5>
<0, 14, 8>
<0, 14, 3>
<1, 10, 7>
<1, 5, 4>
<2, 9, 7>
<2, 9, 6>
<2, 9, 10>
<3, 9, 14>
<4, 11, 8>
<4, 11, 6>
<4, 11, 12>
<4, 13, 6>
<4, 13, 10>
<4, 13, 7>
<5, 14, 1>
<6, 11, 8>
<6, 11, 12>
<6, 13, 10>
<7, 10, 9>
<8, 12, 11>
<9, 14, 3>
