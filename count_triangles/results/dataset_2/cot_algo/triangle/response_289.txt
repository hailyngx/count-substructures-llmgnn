Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is:  
0 -> 3 connections  
8 -> 3 connections  
9 -> 3 connections  
2 -> 4 connections  
7 -> 4 connections  
5 -> 4 connections  
1 -> 6 connections  
6 -> 6 connections  
4 -> 6 connections  
3 -> 6 connections  

Now, examining each edge using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (5, 8): Both vertices have 4 connections. No triangles formed.
2. Edge (5, 1): Vertex 5 has fewer connections than vertex 1. So, check for shared connections:
   - Shared connections: 4, 7
   - Triangle <1, 4, 5> formed.
3. Edge (5, 4): Vertex 5 has fewer connections than vertex 4. So, check for shared connections:
   - Shared connections: 6
   - Triangle <4, 5, 6> formed.
4. Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 has fewer connections than vertex 7. So, check for shared connections:
   - Shared connections: 3
   - Triangle <3, 5, 7> formed.
 
Continue examining all edges using the same method.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 4, 5>, 
<4, 5, 6>, 
<3, 5, 7>.
