Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 2) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 6) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (5, 6), (5, 12), (5, 14), (9, 2), (4, 13), (4, 0), (4, 10), (4, 2), (7, 6), (1, 3), (1, 10), (1, 12), (1, 8), (3, 1), (3, 14), (3, 13), (3, 2), (3, 8), (10, 4), (10, 1), (10, 11), (10, 2), (11, 10), (11, 6), (11, 8), (11, 12), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 11), (8, 13), (8, 0), (13, 4), (13, 3), (13, 8), (13, 2), (13, 14), (12, 5), (12, 1), (12, 11), (12, 0), (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 12), (0, 14), (14, 5), (14, 3), (14, 13), (14, 0), (14, 6), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 11), (6, 14), (6, 2), (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 10), (2, 13), (2, 6)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their degree in increasing order:

Degree-based ordering: [9, 7, 8, 9, 5, 6, 9, 3, 7, 4, 7, 6, 7, 9, 9]
Vertices: {7, 4, 3, 11, 6, 10, 1, 8, 13, 0, 2, 12, 5, 9, 14}

Now, let's calculate the triangles based on the degree-based ordering method:

Triangles: [23]
Triangles found: <1, 10, 11>, <2, 3, 13>, <2, 6, 13>, <4, 8, 13>, <6, 11, 14>, <8, 10, 11>
