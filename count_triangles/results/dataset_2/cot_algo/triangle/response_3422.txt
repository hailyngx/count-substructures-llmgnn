Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves labeling the nodes based on the number of connections each node has in ascending order. Let's assign labels to the nodes:

Node 5 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 5
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 0 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 5
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 5

Now, let's sort the edges based on the labels of the nodes:

(0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) 
(1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) 
(2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) 
(3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) 
(4, 6) 
(5, 8) (5, 9) 
(6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) 
(7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) 
(8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) 
(9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Now, we can count the triangles by checking for shared connections between nodes connected by an edge. The triangles are:

<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
