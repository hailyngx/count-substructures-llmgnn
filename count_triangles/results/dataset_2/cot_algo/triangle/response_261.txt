Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 7), 
(9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 7), 
(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 8), 
(3, 5), (3, 7), 
(4, 7), 
(7, 0), 
(8, 0), 
(5, 0), 
(2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 8), 
(0, 8)

Now let's label the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):

Nodes by degree:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 8: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 7: degree 6
Node 1: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [6]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 2>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 8, 2>, <0, 5, 2>, and <7, 8, 2>.
