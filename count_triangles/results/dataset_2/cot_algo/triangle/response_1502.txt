Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 27) (11, 5) (11, 12) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 14) (1, 16) (1, 21) (21, 1) (21, 4) (0, 27) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 2) (27, 11) (27, 0) (27, 13) (27, 23) (3, 10) (18, 5) (18, 29) (22, 12) (20, 0) (20, 14) (20, 28) (19, 26) (19, 4) (19, 24) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 25) (9, 24) (9, 14) (28, 20) (28, 26) (28, 10) (28, 23) (6, 15) (6, 4) (8, 16) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 7) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 4) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 25) (12, 11) (12, 22) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 15) (7, 8) (7, 13) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 25) (4, 21) (4, 19) (4, 6) (4, 5) (29, 18) (29, 24) (10, 3) (10, 28) (10, 8) (24, 19) (24, 9) (24, 12) (24, 29) (24, 13) (23, 27) (23, 28) (25, 0) (25, 26) (25, 2) (25, 15) (17, 8) (17, 5) (14, 16) (14, 20) (14, 9) (14, 13) (13, 27) (13, 7) (13, 24) (13, 14) 

Response:
The graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges can be visualized as shown below:

```
Nodes:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29
Edges: (0,27) (1,16) (2,25) (3,10) (4,21) (5,11) (6,15) (7,8) (9,24) (12,22) (13,27) (14,16) (17,8) (18,5) (19,26) (20,0) (23,27) (28,20) (29,18)
```

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices in ascending order of degrees:  3, 6, 1, 7, 17, 9, 29, 22, 13, 10, 2, 16, 21, 12, 26, 19, 4, 0, 5, 8, 14, 24, 15, 28, 20, 27, 11, 25, 18, 23

Now, we will list the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: 
[10, 12, 15]
[4, 21, 25]
[14, 16, 24]
[8, 10, 17]
[5, 11, 18]
[5, 17, 18]
[5, 8, 17]
[0, 20, 27]
[0, 25, 27]
[0, 2, 25]
[0, 20, 28]
[0, 25, 28]
[2, 12, 25]
[2, 25, 12]
[12, 24, 25]
[14, 20, 24]
[24, 14, 20]

Total number of triangles: [16]
