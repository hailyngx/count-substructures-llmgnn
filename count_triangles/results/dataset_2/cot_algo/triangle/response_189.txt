Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 1), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 7), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 8), (1, 3), (1, 7), (3, 0), (4, 0), (8, 7), (2, 8), (0, 2)}

Now, rearrange the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in increasing order:
New node ordering: [0, 5, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 7, 9, 6]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:
1. (0, 2) shares connections with nodes 3 and 8, forming a triangle <0, 2, 3>.
2. (0, 4) shares connections with nodes 3 and 6, forming a triangle <0, 4, 3>.
3. (0, 8) shares connections with nodes 2 and 7, forming a triangle <0, 8, 2>.
4. (0, 7) shares connections with nodes 1 and 8, forming a triangle <0, 7, 1>.
5. (1, 3) shares connections with nodes 6 and 0, forming a triangle <1, 3, 6>.
6. (1, 7) shares connections with nodes 3 and 8, forming a triangle <1, 7, 3>.

Total number of triangles: [6]
