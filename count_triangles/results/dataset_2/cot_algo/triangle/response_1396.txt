Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 20) (22, 13) (22, 25) (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 21) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 2) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 23) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 8) (15, 20) (15, 23) (20, 13) (20, 15) (20, 12) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 24) (14, 0) (14, 29) (14, 25) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 4) (28, 16) (28, 19) (7, 2) (16, 28) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 26) (16, 19) (3, 21) (3, 18) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 20) (12, 16) (12, 4) (23, 10) (23, 15) (26, 16) (26, 6) (19, 10) (19, 28) (19, 16) (24, 0) (24, 18) (24, 29) (8, 17) (8, 11) (8, 29) (27, 5) (27, 29) (29, 14) (29, 24) (29, 8) (29, 27) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 21) (2, 7) (18, 3) (18, 24) (6, 26) (6, 25) (25, 22) (25, 14) (25, 6) 

Response:
The vertices with their respective degrees are:

Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 4
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 4: degree 5
Vertex 5: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 1
Vertex 8: degree 3
Vertex 9: degree 4
Vertex 10: degree 4
Vertex 11: degree 4
Vertex 12: degree 4
Vertex 13: degree 4
Vertex 14: degree 3
Vertex 15: degree 2
Vertex 16: degree 5
Vertex 17: degree 3
Vertex 18: degree 2
Vertex 19: degree 4
Vertex 20: degree 3
Vertex 21: degree 4
Vertex 22: degree 3
Vertex 23: degree 3
Vertex 24: degree 3
Vertex 25: degree 3
Vertex 26: degree 2
Vertex 27: degree 2
Vertex 28: degree 2
Vertex 29: degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will look at the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Examining the edges (13, 22) and (13, 2):
Vertex 13 has fewer connections than both 22 and 2, creating a triangle <13, 22, 2>.

Examining the edges (13, 20) and (20, 15):
Vertex 13 has fewer connections than 20, creating a triangle <13, 20, 15>.

Examining the edges (22, 25) and (25, 14):
Vertex 22 has fewer connections than 25, creating a triangle <22, 25, 14>.

Examining the edges (5, 9) and (9, 4):
Vertex 5 has fewer connections than both 9 and 4, creating a triangle <5, 9, 4>.

Examining the edges (5, 0) and (0, 24):
Vertex 5 has fewer connections than 0, creating a triangle <5, 0, 24>.

Examining the edges (5, 27) and (27, 29):
Vertex 5 has fewer connections than 27, creating a triangle <5, 27, 29>.

There are no more triangles to be found following the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
