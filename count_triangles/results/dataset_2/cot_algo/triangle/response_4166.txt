Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 3), (9, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 3), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 2), (7, 1), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 0), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 0), (3, 8), (6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 8), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 0), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 0), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 2)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):

Node Degrees: 
0: 6 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 3 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 5 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 4 connections

Sorted Nodes: {1, 2, 6, 0, 3, 7, 8, 9, 5, 4}

Now, we will count the triangles:
Triangles: 
[10]
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 8, 4>
