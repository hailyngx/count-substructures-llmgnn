Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 10) (21, 7) (21, 19) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 27) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 26) (27, 13) (27, 12) (27, 20) (4, 8) (4, 0) (2, 12) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 23) (19, 21) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 6) (26, 12) (26, 19) (26, 10) (1, 5) (1, 28) (1, 24) (17, 28) (17, 9) (17, 15) (9, 17) (9, 29) (9, 23) (22, 28) (22, 10) (22, 0) (22, 15) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 20) (16, 12) (16, 20) (28, 1) (28, 17) (28, 22) (28, 23) (29, 9) (29, 5) (29, 23) (29, 24) (10, 7) (10, 26) (10, 22) (10, 15) (15, 17) (15, 22) (15, 10) (0, 4) (0, 22) (0, 3) (11, 19) (11, 3) (6, 19) (6, 24) (6, 14) (6, 25) (24, 1) (24, 29) (24, 6) (24, 25) (14, 6) (14, 5) (23, 18) (23, 9) (23, 28) (23, 29) (5, 1) (5, 29) (5, 14) (20, 27) (20, 3) (20, 16) (25, 6) (25, 24) 

Response:
The sorted nodes based on their degrees are as follows:
Nodes with degree 1: 7, 8, 13, 16, 20, 21, 4
Nodes with degree 2: 17, 18, 19, 26, 27, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 22, 28
Nodes with degree 3: 11, 12, 23, 24, 29, 0, 3, 14
Nodes with degree 4: 1, 2, 25

Based on the sorted nodes, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph and list unique triangles found:

Total number of triangles: [16]

Unique triangles found: 
<6, 19, 26>
<1, 5, 29>
<9, 17, 28>
<2, 18, 23>
<9, 23, 29>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 24, 29>
<3, 8, 20>
<12, 16, 20>
<9, 23, 28>
<10, 15, 22>
<6, 14, 25>
<0, 3, 22>
<13, 27, 12>
<6, 24, 25>
<18, 23, 29>
