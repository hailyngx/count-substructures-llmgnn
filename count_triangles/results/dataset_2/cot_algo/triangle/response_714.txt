Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4

Next, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:
1. Sort the vertices by their degrees (number of connections):
Nodes in ascending order of their degrees: 0, 5, 6, 9, 1, 2, 8, 7, 3, 4

2. Relabel the vertices based on their order:
- Node 0 becomes Node 0
- Node 5 becomes Node 1
- Node 6 becomes Node 2
- Node 9 becomes Node 3
- Node 1 becomes Node 4
- Node 2 becomes Node 5
- Node 8 becomes Node 6
- Node 7 becomes Node 7
- Node 3 becomes Node 8
- Node 4 becomes Node 9

3. Check for triangles:
Count the total number of triangles inside the brackets []: [10]

Unique triangles found:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <1, 4, 7>
