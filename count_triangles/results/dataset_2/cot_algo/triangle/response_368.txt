Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 24) (6, 17) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 3) (7, 21) (7, 26) (7, 13) (21, 6) (21, 7) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 29) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 23) (11, 28) (11, 22) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 23) (1, 22) (3, 9) (3, 1) (22, 11) (22, 1) (22, 23) (23, 10) (23, 1) (23, 22) (23, 24) (5, 14) (5, 20) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 29) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 8) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 15) (4, 2) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 20) (18, 13) (19, 4) (19, 15) (26, 7) (26, 16) (28, 11) (28, 0) (28, 12) (20, 5) (20, 18) (29, 21) (29, 0) (24, 6) (24, 23) (24, 8) (24, 27) (12, 28) (12, 25) (12, 8) (16, 26) (15, 9) (15, 21) (15, 4) (15, 19) (17, 6) (17, 27) (25, 12) (25, 8) (8, 21) (8, 14) (8, 24) (8, 12) (8, 25) (2, 4) (2, 27) (27, 24) (27, 17) (27, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 18) 

Response:
Based on the provided edges, first, let's list the degree of each node:
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 5 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 5 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 10: 4 connections
- Node 11: 3 connections
- Node 12: 4 connections
- Node 13: 3 connections
- Node 14: 3 connections
- Node 15: 4 connections
- Node 16: 1 connection
- Node 17: 2 connections
- Node 18: 4 connections
- Node 19: 2 connections
- Node 20: 2 connections
- Node 21: 5 connections
- Node 22: 3 connections
- Node 23: 4 connections
- Node 24: 4 connections
- Node 25: 2 connections
- Node 26: 2 connections
- Node 27: 3 connections
- Node 28: 4 connections
- Node 29: 2 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Node 16 with 1 connection becomes Node 0
- Nodes 2, 5, 17, 19, 20, 25 and 26 with 2 connections become Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 respectively
- Nodes 3, 7, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19, 27 and 29 with 3 connections become Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 respectively
- Nodes 0, 1, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 23, 24 and 28 with 4 connections become Nodes 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 respectively
- Nodes 4, 8 with 5 connections become Nodes 27, 28

Now, let's list the edges in the graph based on the new labels:
- (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 24) (6, 17) (9, 15) (7, 21) (21, 8) (21, 29) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 23) (11, 22) (1, 3) (22, 23) (23, 24) (5, 14) (0, 28) (14, 8) (4, 18) (18, 13) (8, 25) (2, 27) (13, 7)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
The total number of triangles is [49].

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 9, 13> <3, 9, 10> <3, 13, 18> <3, 19, 27> <3, 27, 2> <4, 18, 10> <4, 18, 13> <4, 18, 15> <4, 19, 15> <4, 8, 14> <4, 8, 25> <6, 8, 14> <6, 8, 21> <6, 9, 13> <6, 9, 15> <6, 9, 21> <6, 21, 29> <8, 14, 0> <8, 14, 5> <8, 14, 25> <8, 14, 24> <8, 24, 25> <8, 24, 27> <10, 13, 7> <14, 5, 0> <18, 13, 7> <18, 13, 10> <18, 13, 21> <21, 13, 7> <21, 13, 10>
