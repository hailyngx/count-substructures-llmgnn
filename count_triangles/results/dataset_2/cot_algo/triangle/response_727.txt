Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 17) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 5) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 15) (18, 9) (18, 1) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (1, 18) (1, 15) (1, 13) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 14) (15, 12) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 8) (14, 15) (14, 19) (12, 15) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 3) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 8) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 3) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 16) (13, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections). 

The sorted list of nodes with their degrees is as follows:
Node 12: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 18: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 16: degree 3
Node 11: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 19: degree 5
Node 13: degree 5
Node 5: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 7: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 6: degree 6
Node 9: degree 6
Node 15: degree 6
Node 10: degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now check the edges in order to count the triangles.

Total number of triangles: [24]
