Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 5) (16, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 5) (12, 5) (12, 3) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 14) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 13) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 10) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 13) (13, 17) (13, 9) (13, 14) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 9) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 19) (0, 6) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 0) (18, 11) (18, 3) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 18) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
   - Node 16 has 2 connections
   - Nodes 1, 10, 12, 13, 18, and 19 have 3 connections each
   - Nodes 0, 6, and 8 have 4 connections each
   - Nodes 3 and 15 have 5 connections each
   - Nodes 5, 7, and 14 have 6 connections each
   - Nodes 2, 4, 9, and 11 have 7 connections each

2. Relabel the vertices starting from 0 to 19 based on the sorted order:
   - Node 16 (2 connections) is now Node 0
   - Nodes 1, 10, 12, 13, 18, and 19 (3 connections each) are now Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 respectively
   - Nodes 0, 6, and 8 (4 connections each) are now Nodes 7, 8, and 9 respectively
   - Nodes 3 and 15 (5 connections each) are now Nodes 10 and 11 respectively
   - Nodes 5, 7, and 14 (6 connections each) are now Nodes 12, 13, and 14 respectively
   - Nodes 2, 4, 9, and 11 (7 connections each) are now Nodes 15, 16, 17, and 18 respectively

Now, let's count the triangles:

- From the given edges, the only edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections is (16, 5) where Node 0 (previously Node 16) connects with Node 12 (previously Node 5).
   - Node 0 (16) shares connections with Node 5 (12): shared connection is Node 7 (previously Node 4)
   - So, the triangle formed is <0, 5, 12> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
The unique triangle found is <0, 5, 12>.
