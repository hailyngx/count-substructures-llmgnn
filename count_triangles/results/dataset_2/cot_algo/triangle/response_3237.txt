Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 2) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following edges:
(6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 2) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 2)

Let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 14: Degree 2
Nodes 10, 2, 3, 8, 6: Degree 3
Nodes 13, 7, 1, 9: Degree 4
Nodes 0, 11, 12, 5, 4: Degree 5

Starting with edges where the lower degree node comes first:
- (1, 6) forms triangle with 0: <0, 1, 6>
- (1, 8) forms triangle with 5: <5, 1, 8>
- (1, 0) forms triangle with 6: <0, 1, 6>
- (1, 14) forms triangle with 5: <5, 14, 1>
- (1, 7) forms triangle with 11: <1, 7, 11>
- (2, 9) forms triangle with 10: <2, 9, 10>
- (2, 0) forms triangle with 6: <0, 2, 6>
- (2, 12) forms triangle with 0: <0, 2, 12>
- (2, 7) forms triangle with 3: <2, 3, 7>
- (6, 1) forms triangle with 0: <0, 1, 6>
- (7, 1) forms triangle with 11: <1, 7, 11>
- (7, 3) forms triangle with 9: <3, 7, 9>
- (7, 13) forms triangle with 4: <4, 7, 13>
- (8, 1) forms triangle with 0: <0, 1, 8>
- (8, 5) forms triangle with 10: <5, 8, 10>
- (8, 12) forms triangle with 0: <8, 12, 0>
- (9, 2) forms triangle with 3: <2, 3, 9>
- (9, 3) forms triangle with 7: <3, 7, 9>
- (9, 8) forms triangle with 5: <5, 8, 9>
- (10, 4) forms triangle with 5: <4, 5, 10>
- (11, 7) forms triangle with 1: <1, 7, 11>
- (11, 0) forms triangle with 6: <0, 6, 11>
- (12, 2) forms triangle with 0: <0, 2, 12>
- (12, 6) forms triangle with 0: <0, 6, 12>
- (13, 7) forms triangle with 4: <4, 7, 13>
