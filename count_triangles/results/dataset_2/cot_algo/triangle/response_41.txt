Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, I will construct the graph as described:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges:
  - 0: (3), (2)
  - 1: (6), (3), (2), (7)
  - 2: (5), (1), (3), (4), (0)
  - 3: (9), (1), (7), (0), (2), (8)
  - 4: (5), (6), (2)
  - 5: (6), (2), (8), (4), (7)
  - 6: (5), (9), (1), (4), (8)
  - 7: (5), (1), (3)
  - 8: (5), (9), (6), (3)
  - 9: (6), (8), (3)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees from lowest to highest:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 6

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Start with the lowest degree node - Node 0: No triangles
- Node 1: No triangles
- Node 7: No triangles
- Node 4: No triangles
- Node 2: Triangles: <2, 3, 1> <2, 5, 6> <2, 5, 7> <2, 0, 3> <2, 0, 1>
- Node 5: Triangles: <5, 6, 4> <5, 6, 8> <5, 7, 1> <5, 7, 3> <5, 2, 4> <5, 2, 1> <5, 2, 3> <5, 8, 9> <5, 8, 6>
- Node 9: No triangles
- Node 6: Triangles: <6, 4, 2> <6, 8, 5> <6, 8, 9> <6, 1, 3>
- Node 8: Triangles: <8, 9, 6> <8, 5, 6> <8, 5, 7> <8, 3, 1>

Total number of triangles: [16]
