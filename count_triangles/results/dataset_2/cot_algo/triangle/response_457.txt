Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 12) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 24) (15, 21) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 24) (18, 21) (22, 18) (22, 7) (22, 12) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 19) (6, 28) (6, 21) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 19) (21, 15) (21, 18) (21, 6) (21, 28) (19, 2) (19, 28) (26, 5) (17, 29) (17, 23) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 23) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 26) (5, 25) (5, 20) (20, 5) (20, 9) (4, 13) (4, 27) (4, 0) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 7) (11, 9) (12, 3) (12, 22) (12, 8) (12, 2) (7, 22) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 27) (7, 16) (16, 7) (16, 24) (16, 25) (16, 23) (16, 14) (0, 28) (0, 4) (24, 15) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 9) (25, 5) (25, 16) (1, 28) (14, 27) (14, 16) (9, 20) (9, 11) (9, 24) (9, 23) (23, 17) (23, 29) (23, 16) (23, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. The sorted nodes are then relabeled from 0 to 29 accordingly.

Here is the list of nodes sorted by their degree:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 10: 0 connections
Node 11: 2 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 14: 2 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 16: 5 connections
Node 17: 2 connections
Node 18: 4 connections
Node 19: 2 connections
Node 20: 2 connections
Node 21: 4 connections
Node 22: 3 connections
Node 23: 4 connections
Node 24: 4 connections
Node 25: 2 connections
Node 26: 1 connection
Node 27: 3 connections
Node 28: 5 connections
Node 29: 3 connections

Now, we will count the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles is [18].
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 27>
<2, 5, 19>
<2, 12, 18>
<2, 5, 26>
<4, 13, 8>
<4, 13, 27>
<5, 9, 24>
<5, 16, 23>
<7, 8, 13>
<7, 8, 27>
<9, 11, 23>
<9, 20, 5>
<12, 18, 21>
<16, 23, 9>
<16, 14, 27>
<16, 14, 23>
<16, 25, 5>
