Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 28) (22, 14) (22, 3) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (6, 17) (6, 20) (14, 22) (14, 17) (14, 23) (14, 25) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 19) (1, 5) (1, 21) (1, 18) (21, 1) (21, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 20) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 21) (12, 7) (12, 4) (29, 17) (29, 11) (4, 12) (27, 3) (27, 28) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 25) (16, 25) (16, 18) (16, 10) (28, 13) (28, 27) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 23) (3, 13) (3, 22) (3, 5) (3, 27) (10, 16) (10, 0) (10, 24) (23, 14) (23, 0) (23, 26) (23, 24) (26, 23) (26, 15) (26, 11) (15, 26) (15, 8) (20, 6) (20, 7) (20, 18) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 15) (8, 11) (25, 14) (25, 19) (25, 16) (25, 18) (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 20) (18, 25) (24, 10) (24, 23) (11, 5) (11, 29) (11, 26) (11, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, ..., 28, 29

Edges:
(13, 17), (13, 3), (13, 28), (22, 14), (22, 3), (5, 19), (5, 1), (5, 11), (5, 3), (9, 2), (9, 12), (6, 17), (6, 20), (14, 22), (14, 17), (14, 23), (14, 25), (17, 13), (17, 6), (17, 14), (17, 29), (17, 19), (1, 5), (1, 21), (1, 18), (21, 1), (21, 12), (7, 12), (7, 0), (7, 20), (7, 8), (12, 9), (12, 21), (12, 7), (12, 4), (29, 17), (29, 11), (4, 12), (27, 3), (27, 28), (19, 5), (19, 17), (19, 25), (16, 25), (16, 18), (16, 10), (28, 1...

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degrees:

0: 4 connections
2: 2 connections
18: 4 connections
20: 3 connections
10: 3 connections
24: 2 connections
23: 4 connections
26: 3 connections
15: 2 connections
8: 4 connections
11: 4 connections
29: 2 connections
3: 4 connections
5: 4 connections
1: 3 connections
21: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
12: 4 connections
7: 4 connections
9: 2 connections
6: 3 connections
14: 5 connections
25: 4 connections
19: 3 connections
13: 3 connections
17: 5 connections
22: 2 connections
16: 4 connections
27: 2 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles:

Triangles: [26]

I will calculate the triangles based on the degree-based approach and provide the final count.
