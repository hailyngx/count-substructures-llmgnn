Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 0) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 6) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 7) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph with nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
- 0: {13, 10, 5, 9}
- 1: {7, 13, 8}
- 2: {9, 3, 11}
- 3: {2, 9, 11, 14, 8}
- 4: {10}
- 5: {0, 12, 7, 14}
- 6: {12, 11, 7}
- 7: {1, 13, 6, 14, 5, 8, 9}
- 8: {1, 13, 3, 7, 12}
- 9: {0, 2, 3, 11, 13, 7}
- 10: {0, 12, 4}
- 11: {2, 3, 6, 9}
- 12: {5, 6, 10, 13, 8}
- 13: {1, 0, 12, 9, 8, 7}
- 14: {7, 5, 3}

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can relabel the nodes as follows:
Degree 0: {4}
Degree 1: {1, 2, 14}
Degree 2: {0, 10}
Degree 3: {5, 6}
Degree 4: {11}
Degree 5: {12}
Degree 6: {3}
Degree 7: {7, 9}
Degree 8: {8}
Degree 9: {13}

Now, counting the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 7]

<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 12>
<0, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<7, 9, 13>
<7, 8, 13>
<9, 11, 13>
