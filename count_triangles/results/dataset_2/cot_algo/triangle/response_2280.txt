Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Degree-Based Ordering:
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
