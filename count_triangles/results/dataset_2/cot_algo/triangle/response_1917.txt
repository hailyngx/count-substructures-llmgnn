Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges can be represented as:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 8), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 7), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7), (3, 6), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 8), (4, 0), (8, 6), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 0), (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 5), (0, 2), (7, 6), (7, 9), (7, 1), (7, 0), (7, 5), (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 0), (2, 5), (5, 0), (5, 7), (5, 2)

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees from least to most:
Nodes in degree-based ordering: {3, 9, 5, 8, 4, 1, 7, 0, 2, 6}

Based on the degree-based ordering, let's count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 9]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 8, 4>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 6, 2>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 0>
<4, 8, 0>
