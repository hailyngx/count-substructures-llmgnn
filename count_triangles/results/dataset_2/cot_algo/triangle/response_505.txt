Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 18) (15, 10) (15, 18) (8, 17) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 8) (7, 13) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 1) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 19) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 4) (4, 13) (4, 10) (0, 16) (0, 19) (0, 2) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 14) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 9) (18, 17) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 17) (6, 11) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 6) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 14) (11, 12) (11, 6) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 3) (5, 2) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 19) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 14) 

Response:
The given edges are as follows: 

- (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 18) 
- (15, 10) (15, 18) 
- (8, 17) (8, 7) 
- (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) 
- (7, 8) (7, 13) 
- (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 1) 
- (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 19) 
- (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 4) 
- (4, 13) (4, 10) 
- (0, 16) (0, 19) (0, 2) 
- (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 14) 
- (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 3) 
- (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 17) (6, 11) 
- (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 18) (17, 6) 
- (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 14) 
- (11, 12) (11, 6) 
- (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) 
- (5, 3) (5, 2) 
- (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 19) 
- (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 14) 

Now, let's calculate the total number of triangles and list them: 

Vertices sorted by degree (from least to most connected):
- 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 5, 8, 4, 1, 9, 0, 2, 16, 13, 12, 19

Triangles found: 
1. <0, 16, 6> 
2. <1, 12, 14> 
3. <0, 2, 19> 
4. <1, 14, 19> 
5. <11, 12, 6> 
6. <2, 9, 19> 

Total number of triangles: [6]
