Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 6) (14, 0) (14, 19) (17, 11) (17, 18) (17, 7) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 16) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 3) (13, 8) (2, 16) (2, 4) (2, 19) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 6) (0, 14) (0, 10) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 4) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 19) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 15) (12, 15) (12, 9) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 19) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 6) (5, 3) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 7) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be used to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, the nodes are relabeled based on their degrees in ascending order:
Node 12 -> 0 connections
Node 5 -> 0 connections
Node 0 -> 2 connections
Node 2 -> 2 connections
Node 18 -> 2 connections
Node 7 -> 2 connections
Node 4 -> 3 connections
Node 6 -> 3 connections
Node 19 -> 4 connections
Node 16 -> 4 connections
Node 1 -> 4 connections
Node 15 -> 4 connections
Node 9 -> 4 connections
Node 8 -> 5 connections
Node 3 -> 5 connections
Node 13 -> 5 connections
Node 14 -> 6 connections
Node 17 -> 6 connections
Node 10 -> 6 connections
Node 11 -> 6 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now check for triangles using the given edges:

Edges to consider: (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 6) (17, 11) (17, 18) (17, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 5) (8, 13) (2, 4) (18, 6) (19, 10) (19, 6) (10, 7)

Number of triangles found: [21]

Unique triangles:
