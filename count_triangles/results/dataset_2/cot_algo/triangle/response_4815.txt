Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 5: degree 3
Node 9: degree 8
Node 4: degree 5
Node 7: degree 3
Node 1: degree 2
Node 3: degree 5
Node 8: degree 6
Node 6: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5

Based on the sorting, the new labels for the nodes are:
Node 5 -> Node 0
Node 9 -> Node 1
Node 4 -> Node 2
Node 7 -> Node 3
Node 1 -> Node 4
Node 3 -> Node 5
Node 8 -> Node 6
Node 6 -> Node 7
Node 0 -> Node 8
Node 2 -> Node 9

Now let's look at the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 9)

Now we count the triangles formed by the shared connections:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 6>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 5, 9>

The total number of triangles is [6].
