Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's construct the graph by listing the nodes and the edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 3, 4, 8, 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 3, 8, 0, 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 1.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 7, 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 6, 2, 0.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 4, 2.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 2, 1, 7.

Next, we will sort the vertices by their degree from least to most:

1. Node 0 (Degree: 3)
2. Node 3 (Degree: 2)
3. Node 5 (Degree: 3)
4. Node 2 (Degree: 3)
5. Node 6 (Degree: 4)
6. Node 8 (Degree: 4)
7. Node 7 (Degree: 5)
8. Node 9 (Degree: 5)
9. Node 1 (Degree: 6)
10. Node 4 (Degree: 6)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [7]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
