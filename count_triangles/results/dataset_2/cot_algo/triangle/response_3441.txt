Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections and then relabeling them accordingly. 

After sorting the nodes by their degrees from least to most, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 11: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 4
Node 14: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 6
Node 4: Degree 7
Node 13: Degree 7
Node 10: Degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider each edge once:
- Edge (5, 13): <5, 13> shares connections with 1 and 3, forming the triangle <5, 1, 13>.
- Edge (5, 2): <5, 2> shares connection with 13 on Node 5, but Vertex 2 has fewer connections.
- Edge (5, 4): <5, 4> shares connections with 13 and 1, forming the triangle <5, 1, 4>.
- Edge (9, 4): <9, 4> shares connection with 3, forming the triangle <9, 3, 4>.
- Edge (9, 10): <9, 10> shares connections with 1 and 3, forming the triangle <9, 1, 10>.
- Edge (9, 3): <9, 3> shares connection with 4, forming the triangle <9, 4, 3>.
- Edge (1, 3): <1, 3> shares connection with 4 and 10, forming the triangle <1, 3, 4>.
- Edge (1, 6): Vertex 1 has fewer connections than Vertex 6.
- Edge (1, 10): Vertex 1 has fewer connections than Vertex 10.
- Edge (1, 13): <1, 13> shares connection with 5, forming the triangle <1, 5, 13>.
- Edge (1, 7): <1, 7> shares connection with 12, forming the triangle <1, 12, 7>.
