Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 18) (10, 7) (2, 15) (2, 19) (2, 13) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 6) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 1) (6, 8) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 13) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 12) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 8) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (17, 4) (17, 12) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling the vertices accordingly.

Here are the vertices sorted by their degree:
Vertices: 2, 3, 1, 13, 4, 10, 11, 18, 7, 12, 0, 19, 5, 8, 6, 9, 14, 16, 17, 15

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 2 -> 0
Vertex 3 -> 1
Vertex 1 -> 2
Vertex 13 -> 3
Vertex 4 -> 4
Vertex 10 -> 5
Vertex 11 -> 6
Vertex 18 -> 7
Vertex 7 -> 8
Vertex 12 -> 9
Vertex 0 -> 10
Vertex 19 -> 11
Vertex 5 -> 12
Vertex 8 -> 13
Vertex 6 -> 14
Vertex 9 -> 15
Vertex 14 -> 16
Vertex 16 -> 17
Vertex 17 -> 18
Vertex 15 -> 19

Next, we will identify the triangles based on the shared connections for each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles is [8].
The unique triangles found are: <5, 6, 8>, <0, 10, 15>, <7, 8, 18>, <5, 8, 12>, <1, 2, 14>, <15, 16, 17>, <15, 16, 19>, <6, 14, 16>.
