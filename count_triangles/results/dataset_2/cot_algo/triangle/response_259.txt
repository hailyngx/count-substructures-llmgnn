Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 24) (0, 1) (0, 23) (27, 25) (27, 11) (22, 23) (22, 14) (23, 0) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 29) (23, 13) (8, 23) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 1) (2, 18) (2, 26) (2, 13) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 12) (14, 22) (14, 26) (4, 10) (4, 3) (16, 8) (16, 24) (16, 20) (16, 5) (28, 9) (28, 12) (28, 15) (26, 2) (26, 18) (26, 14) (26, 5) (26, 15) (13, 23) (13, 2) (13, 17) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 21) (17, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 19) (21, 17) (21, 11) (25, 27) (25, 29) (12, 18) (12, 28) (5, 8) (5, 16) (5, 26) (5, 11) (6, 3) (24, 0) (24, 16) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 29) (1, 10) (29, 23) (29, 25) (29, 1) (29, 11) (15, 28) (15, 26) (15, 17) (15, 7) (19, 3) (19, 7) (9, 28) (9, 3) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 19) (20, 16) (10, 4) (10, 1) (11, 27) (11, 21) (11, 5) (11, 29) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the given nodes and edges. 

The Degree-Based Ordering method will now be applied to count the number of triangles.

The vertices and their connections are as follows:

Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 16: 4 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 18: 4 connections
Node 19: 2 connections
Node 20: 1 connection
Node 21: 2 connections
Node 22: 2 connections
Node 23: 6 connections
Node 24: 2 connections
Node 25: 3 connections
Node 26: 5 connections
Node 27: 2 connections
Node 28: 3 connections
Node 29: 4 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices are: 6, 20, 4, 10, 22, 24, 9, 1, 25, 12, 0, 14, 7, 19, 28, 27, 21, 3, 11, 8, 17, 29, 2, 13, 15, 18, 5, 16, 26, 23.

The total number of triangles is [46]. 

The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 1, 8>  
<0, 1, 10>  
<0, 1, 29>  
<0, 8, 23>
