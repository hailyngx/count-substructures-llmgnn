Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 4) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 12) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps in counting the triangles efficiently. Let's construct the graph by listing the vertices in order of their degrees:

Nodes in order of degree:
6 -> 5 edges
8 -> 6 edges
3 -> 5 edges
10 -> 5 edges
0 -> 5 edges
13 -> 4 edges
2 -> 4 edges
4 -> 4 edges
11 -> 3 edges
14 -> 4 edges
9 -> 3 edges
5 -> 3 edges
1 -> 2 edges
12 -> 3 edges
7 -> 3 edges

Now, we will check each edge (u, v) if the vertex with the lower label (u) has fewer connections. If so, we will count the triangles that can be formed with this edge:
- Edge (6, 9) forms a triangle with shared connections {3}.
- Edge (6, 10) forms a triangle with shared connections {4}.
- Edge (6, 3) forms a triangle with shared connections {}.
- Edge (6, 8) forms a triangle with shared connections {13}.
- Edge (6, 13) forms a triangle with shared connections {8}.
- Edge (9, 3) forms a triangle with shared connections {6}.
- Edge (9, 0) forms a triangle with shared connections {}.
- Edge (3, 1) forms a triangle with shared connections {}.
- Edge (3, 4) forms a triangle with shared connections {}.
- Edge (8, 14) forms a triangle with shared connections {}.
- Edge (8, 12) forms a triangle with shared connections {}.
- Edge (8, 7) forms a triangle with shared connections {}.
- Edge (13, 12) forms a triangle with shared connections {}.
- Edge (10, 11) forms a triangle with shared connections {14}.
- Edge (10, 2) forms a triangle with shared connections {}.
- Edge (11, 5) forms a triangle with shared connections {12}.
- Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with shared connections {}.
- Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle with shared connections {}.
- Edge (14, 2) forms a triangle with shared connections {}.
- Edge (7, 2) forms a triangle with shared connections {}.
- Edge (12, 5) forms a triangle with shared connections {}.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [5]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<6, 9, 3>
<6, 10, 4>
<6, 13, 8>
<10, 11, 14>
<11, 5, 12>
