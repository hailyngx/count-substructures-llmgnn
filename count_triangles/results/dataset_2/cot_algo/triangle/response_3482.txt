Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method of counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Let's apply this to the given graph:

Nodes sorted by their degrees:
Node 5: degree 4
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 12: degree 3
Node 6: degree 4
Node 14: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 0: degree 5
Node 13: degree 5
Node 11: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 10: degree 6

Based on the sorted nodes, we will analyze each edge to count the triangles. We will only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles counted:
[11, 13, 14]
[4, 10, 11]
[2, 8, 10]
[4, 6, 12]
[2, 13, 14]
[0, 9, 11]

Total number of triangles: [6] 
Unique triangles found: <11, 13, 14>, <4, 10, 11>, <2, 8, 10>, <4, 6, 12>, <2, 13, 14>, <0, 9, 11>
