Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (13, 1) (22, 13) (22, 11) (22, 6) (22, 25) (7, 21) (7, 29) (7, 1) (21, 13) (21, 7) (21, 26) (12, 27) (12, 20) (12, 3) (27, 12) (27, 25) (2, 18) (2, 10) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 8) (15, 18) (15, 20) (20, 12) (20, 15) (20, 3) (28, 29) (28, 26) (28, 14) (29, 7) (29, 28) (29, 8) (29, 4) (9, 24) (9, 1) (26, 21) (26, 28) (26, 23) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 9) (8, 18) (8, 29) (8, 19) (8, 0) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 16) (25, 22) (25, 27) (25, 10) (23, 26) (23, 16) (16, 19) (16, 23) (4, 29) (4, 19) (4, 5) (17, 18) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 11) (3, 12) (3, 18) (3, 20) (11, 22) (11, 17) (0, 8) (0, 5) (6, 22) (24, 9) (24, 14) (24, 10) (14, 28) (14, 24) (14, 10) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 10) (10, 2) (10, 25) (10, 24) (10, 14) (10, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's now count the number of triangles in this graph by following the Degree-Based Ordering method.

First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Node 0: 3 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 16: 2 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 20: 3 connections
Node 21: 4 connections
Node 23: 2 connections
Node 24: 3 connections
Node 25: 3 connections
Node 26: 4 connections
Node 28: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 18: 4 connections
Node 22: 4 connections
Node 27: 2 connections
Node 29: 4 connections

Now, we will traverse the edges based on the degree-based ordering to count the number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles:
<2, 18, 3>
<2, 18, 8>
<2, 10, 25>
<2, 10, 24>
<4, 19, 5>
<4, 19, 17>
<4, 5, 0>
<18, 3, 20>
