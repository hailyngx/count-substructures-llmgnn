Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 4) (0, 29) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 3) (27, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 29) (9, 19) (14, 1) (14, 18) (17, 10) (17, 23) (17, 15) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 2) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 25) (15, 5) (20, 26) (28, 19) (29, 0) (29, 9) (29, 24) (21, 24) (21, 13) (21, 19) (24, 29) (24, 21) (24, 26) (24, 11) (19, 9) (19, 28) (19, 21) (19, 26) (19, 5) (26, 20) (26, 24) (26, 19) (26, 18) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 11) (22, 8) (18, 14) (18, 26) (18, 7) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 8) (11, 24) (11, 22) (11, 23) (11, 12) (23, 17) (23, 11) (23, 25) (25, 27) (25, 15) (25, 23) (25, 16) (25, 8) (7, 15) (7, 18) (16, 25) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 22) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 22) (2, 13) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 11) (12, 1) (13, 21) (13, 2) (8, 27) (8, 22) (8, 5) (8, 25) (3, 27) (3, 6) 

Response:
Vertices sorted based on their degree are: 
(7, 8), (12, 14), (16, 26), (3, 5), (0, 1, 4, 6, 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 29), (2, 9, 15, 18, 25, 28)
