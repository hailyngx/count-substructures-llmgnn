Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges can be constructed as follows:
- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 8), (6, 0), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 7), (4, 8), (4, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 2), (7, 9), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 5), (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 5), (3, 6), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 0), (8, 6), (8, 9), (8, 4), (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 5), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 1), (5, 0)

Now, we will label the nodes based on their degree from lowest to highest:
- Node 1 (Degree: 3)
- Node 5 (Degree: 3)
- Node 7 (Degree: 3)
- Node 8 (Degree: 3)
- Node 0 (Degree: 4)
- Node 2 (Degree: 4)
- Node 9 (Degree: 4)
- Node 3 (Degree: 5)
- Node 4 (Degree: 5)
- Node 6 (Degree: 6)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles present in the graph:
- Triangles: [15]
- Unique triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 8, 9>
