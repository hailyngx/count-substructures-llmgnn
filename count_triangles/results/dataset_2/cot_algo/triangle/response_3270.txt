Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (17, 13) (17, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 2) (5, 13) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 12) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 3) (15, 9) (16, 12) (16, 6) (18, 14) (18, 19) (18, 6) (12, 13) (12, 16) (3, 17) (3, 9) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 11) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 1) (11, 6) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 6) (6, 16) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 2) 

Response:
The nodes can be relabeled based on their degrees as follows:
- Node 5 (degree 1)
- Node 7 (degree 2)
- Node 3 (degree 2)
- Node 12 (degree 2)
- Node 15 (degree 2)
- Node 17 (degree 2)
- Node 18 (degree 3)
- Node 19 (degree 3)
- Node 0 (degree 4)
- Node 1 (degree 4)
- Node 10 (degree 4)
- Node 13 (degree 4)
- Node 16 (degree 4)
- Node 2 (degree 4)
- Node 14 (degree 5)
- Node 9 (degree 5)
- Node 6 (degree 5)
- Node 11 (degree 5)
- Node 8 (degree 6)
- Node 4 (degree 6)

After relabeling, the graph can be represented as follows:
Edges:
(5, 13)
(7, 17)
(3, 19)
(3, 15)
(12, 16)
(17, 18)
(6, 18)
(15, 9)
(5, 12)
(9, 1)
(16, 6)
(18, 19)
(1, 19)
(6, 2)

From the edges above, we find the following triangles:
- <3, 16, 6>
- <1, 19, 18>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
