Response:
The given graph is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
(8, 23), (8, 5), (23, 8), (23, 17), (23, 1), (23, 16), (23, 6), (19, 17), (26, 22), (26, 15), (26, 11), (22, 26), (22, 11), (22, 21), (9, 21), (9, 24), (0, 21), (0, 11), (7, 3), (7, 29), (7, 20), (7, 1), (17, 23), (17, 19), (17, 13), (17, 28), (20, 7), (20, 29), (16, 23), (16, 12), (16, 29), (16, 2), (28, 17), (28, 27), (28, 15), (13, 17), (13, 27), (29, 7), (29, 20), (29, 16), (14, 4), (14, 24), (14, 25), (2, 16), (2, 12), (2, 27), (12, 16), (12, 2), (12, 5), (12, 11), (3, 7), (3, 10), (3, 5), (15, 26), (15, 28), (15, 6), (5, 8), (5, 12), (5, 3), (5, 4), (21, 22), (21, 9), (21, 0), (4, 14), (4, 5), (4, 10), (1, 23), (1, 7), (1, 25), (25, 14), (25, 1), (25, 18), (27, 28), (27, 13), 

Let's now count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Relabel the nodes according to their degrees:
Degree 0: 18
Degree 1: 9, 20
Degree 2: 2, 10, 19, 24, 29
Degree 3: 3, 6, 13, 15, 18, 22, 25
Degree 4: 0, 4, 7, 11, 12, 16, 23, 28, 27
Degree 5: 5, 14, 21, 26
Degree 6: 8, 17

2. Identify triangles:
Triangles: <2, 16, 27>, <2, 16, 12>, <2, 16, 29>, <2, 16, 23>, <3, 7, 1>, <3, 7, 29>, <3, 7, 20>, <3, 7, 15>, <3, 7, 6>, <3, 7, 18>, <13, 17, 28>, <5, 12, 11>, <5, 12, 4>, <5, 12, 3>, <5, 12, 16>, <5, 12, 2>, <5, 12, 27>, <5, 12, 10>, <5, 4, 10>, <5, 4, 14>, <5, 4, 25>, <7, 1, 23>, <7, 1, 25>, <17, 13, 27>, <22, 11, 0>, <11, 26, 15>, <21, 0, 11>

[Number of triangles: 26]
