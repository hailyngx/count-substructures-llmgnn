Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 30
Edges: 90
Edge List:
(9, 22) (26, 15) (1, 21) (21, 1) (21, 25) (21, 14) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 8) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 23) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 25) (20, 5) (20, 10) (20, 16) (5, 12) (5, 20) (5, 13) (5, 17) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 4) (28, 0) (28, 29) (28, 22) (29, 27) (29, 28) (29, 16) (29, 10) (19, 8) (19, 13) (22, 9) (22, 28) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 24) (13, 3) (13, 18) (11, 6) (11, 23) (11, 7) (15, 26) (15, 12) (15, 0) (15, 14) (7, 11) (7, 25) (7, 2) (7, 8) (25, 21) (25, 0) (25, 7) (25, 14) (25, 2) (4, 27) (4, 6) (4, 17) (8, 12) (8, 19) (8, 7) (8, 3) (23, 27) (23, 11) (23, 18) (16, 20) (16, 29) (17, 5) (17, 6) (17, 4) (18, 13) (18, 23) (3, 13) (3, 8) (3, 24) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 25) (2, 3) (24, 13) (24, 3) (10, 20) (10, 29) (10, 14) (14, 21) (14, 15) (14, 25) (14, 10)

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, the Degree-Based Ordering will be as follows:
Vertices: 1(1), 26(2), 9(3), 22(4), 16(5), 10(6), 19(7), 24(8), 3(9), 7(10), 8(11), 18(12), 6(13), 11(14), 2(15), 17(16), 27(17), 23(18), 28(19), 29(20), 5(21), 4(22), 0(23), 20(24), 25(25), 12(26), 15(27), 21(28), 13(29), 14(30)

Now, let's count the triangles in the graph. 

Total number of triangles: [268]
Unique triangles found:
<0, 14, 15>
<14, 25, 21>
<25, 14, 15>
...
These triangles are a subset of all possible triangles within the graph.
