Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree in increasing order are: 0, 3, 8, 6, 2, 1, 7, 4, 9, 5.

The triangles found in the graph are: 
<1, 3, 7>, <4, 8, 5>, <4, 2, 1>, <4, 2, 8>, <4, 8, 7>, 
<2, 6, 0>, <7, 3, 1>, <9, 6, 2>, <9, 4, 1>, <9, 4, 7>.

The total number of triangles is [10].
