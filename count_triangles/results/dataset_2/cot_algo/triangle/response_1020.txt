Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 8) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 12) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14  
Edges:  
(4, 0), (4, 10), (4, 11),  
(7, 11), (7, 10), (7, 9), (7, 1),  
(1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 14), (1, 5),  
(3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 8),  
(10, 4), (10, 7), (10, 6), (10, 12), (10, 13),  
(11, 4), (11, 7), (11, 8),  
(8, 3), (8, 11), (8, 5), (8, 6),  
(2, 9), (2, 13), (2, 14),  
(0, 4), (0, 14), (0, 12), (0, 9),  
(14, 1), (14, 2), (14, 0), (14, 9),  
(5, 1), (5, 8), (5, 13),  
(13, 10), (13, 2), (13, 5), (13, 12), (13, 6),  
(6, 3), (6, 10), (6, 8), (6, 13), (6, 12),  
(9, 7), (9, 2), (9, 0), (9, 14), (9, 12),  
(12, 10), (12, 0), (12, 13), (12, 6), (12, 9)  

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degree from lowest to highest:
0 (degree 5), 2 (degree 3), 5 (degree 3), 11 (degree 3), 4 (degree 3), 7 (degree 4), 6 (degree 5), 1 (degree 5), 14 (degree 5), 12 (degree 5), 8 (degree 4), 13 (degree 5), 3 (degree 4), 10 (degree 5), 9 (degree 5)

Using the degree-based ordering, we find the following triangles:
[<5, 1, 8>, <5, 1, 13>, <5, 13, 12>, <5, 1, 14>, <5, 8, 6>, <5, 13, 6>, <5, 6, 12>, <5, 8, 3>, <5, 3, 6>, <11, 7, 10>, <11, 10, 13>, <11, 7, 4>, <11, 4, 0>, <11, 0, 9>, <11, 7, 9>, <7, 1, 14>, <7, 14, 0>, <14, 1, 9>, <14, 9, 0>, <4, 11, 7>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 1, 3>, <8, 3, 6>, <13, 2, 9>, <13, 5, 1>, <13, 12, 9>, <13, 6, 3>, <13, 10, 12>, <13, 12, 0>, <13, 0, 9>, <9, 2, 14>, <9, 14, 0>, <12, 0, 6>, <12, 6, 3>]

The total number of triangles is: [34]
