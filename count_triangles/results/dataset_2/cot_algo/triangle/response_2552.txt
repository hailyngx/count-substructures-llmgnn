Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 2) (15, 12) (27, 14) (27, 5) (27, 23) (5, 27) (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 28) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 16) (2, 15) (2, 23) (2, 10) (18, 16) (18, 28) (18, 17) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 19) (6, 13) (28, 9) (28, 18) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 0) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 23) (21, 24) (17, 18) (17, 24) (17, 26) (17, 22) (24, 21) (24, 17) (24, 26) (26, 17) (26, 24) (4, 9) (4, 22) (4, 0) (22, 17) (22, 4) (22, 29) (11, 7) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 8) (20, 1) (0, 28) (0, 4) (0, 29) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 10) (14, 27) (14, 12) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 21) (12, 14) (13, 6) (13, 19) (29, 22) (29, 0) (10, 2) (10, 8) (23, 27) (23, 2) (23, 21) (23, 16) (25, 5) (25, 6) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 13) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 23) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 

<0, 2, 11, 13, 20, 24, 26, 29, 7, 10, 15, 1, 3, 5, 12, 14, 16, 25, 6, 8, 21, 23, 28, 4, 9, 17, 18, 22, 27, 19>

Based on the edges provided, we can count the number of triangles and list the unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [98]
