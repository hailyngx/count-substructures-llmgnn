Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 26) (11, 21) (23, 5) (23, 17) (22, 26) (22, 14) (22, 27) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 25) (16, 0) (16, 14) (28, 9) (18, 26) (18, 20) (18, 24) (18, 21) (21, 10) (21, 11) (21, 18) (21, 0) (21, 19) (0, 16) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (3, 4) (24, 18) (24, 17) (24, 15) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (29, 27) (29, 19) (5, 23) (5, 2) (5, 15) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (20, 18) (27, 22) (27, 29) (27, 17) (14, 22) (14, 16) (14, 1) (12, 0) (12, 25) (12, 9) (19, 21) (19, 0) (19, 29) (19, 25) (15, 24) (15, 5) (15, 6) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 4) (9, 28) (9, 7) (9, 12) (25, 26) (25, 12) (25, 19) (17, 23) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 4) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 17) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. For the given graph, we count the number of connections for each node:

Node 0: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 3
Node 15: Degree 3
Node 16: Degree 2
Node 17: Degree 4
Node 18: Degree 4
Node 19: Degree 4
Node 20: Degree 2
Node 21: Degree 5
Node 22: Degree 4
Node 23: Degree 2
Node 24: Degree 3
Node 25: Degree 3
Node 26: Degree 5
Node 27: Degree 3
Node 28: Degree 1
Node 29: Degree 3

Now, we label the vertices in ascending order of degrees:

Node 3: Degree 1
Node 28: Degree 1
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 16: Degree 2
Node 20: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 12: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 3
Node 15: Degree 3
Node 24: Degree 3
Node 25: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 17: Degree 4
Node 18: Degree 4
Node 19: Degree 4
Node 27: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 5
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 21: Degree 5
Node 22: Degree 4
Node 23: Degree 2
Node 26: Degree 5
Node 29: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 4

Next, we analyze the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

(10, 11) forms a triangle with 21: <10, 11, 21>
(10, 21) forms a triangle with 0, 11: <10, 21, 0> and <10, 21, 11>
(10, 26) forms a triangle with 23: <10, 26, 23>
(10, 13) forms a triangle with 0, 21: <10, 13, 0> and <10, 13, 21>
(11, 7) forms a triangle with 6: <11, 7, 6>
(11, 26) forms a triangle with 14, 21, 22: <11, 26, 14>, <11, 26, 21>, and <11, 26, 22>
(23, 17) forms a triangle with 5: <23, 17, 5>
(22, 26) forms a triangle with 18: <22, 26, 18>
(22, 14) forms a triangle with 16: <22, 14, 16>
(22, 27) forms a triangle with 29: <22, 27, 29>
(26, 18) forms a triangle with 21: <26, 18, 21>
(26, 25) forms a triangle with 12: <26, 25, 12>
(16, 14) forms a triangle with 1: <16, 14, 1>
(18, 24) forms a triangle with 17: <18, 24, 17>
(18, 21) forms a triangle with 0, 19: <18, 21, 0> and <18, 21, 19>
(21, 0) forms a triangle with 19: <21, 0, 19>
(21, 19) forms a triangle with 25: <21, 19, 25>
(0, 12) forms a triangle with 9, 13: <0, 12, 9> and <0, 12, 13>
(3, 4) forms a triangle with 2: <3, 4, 2>
(24, 15) forms a triangle with 6, 17: <24, 15, 6> and <24, 15, 17>
(7, 6) forms a triangle with 2: <7, 6, 2>
(29, 19) forms a triangle with 25: <29, 19, 25>
(5, 15) forms a triangle with 6: <5, 15, 6>
(1, 14) forms a triangle with 16: <1, 14, 16>

Counting the number of unique triangles found, we get:
[24]

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [24].
