Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 6) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 11) (19, 15) (19, 12) (7, 14) (7, 18) (16, 2) (16, 13) (16, 10) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 19) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 18) (0, 2) (0, 17) (0, 3) (0, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 10) (9, 1) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 18) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 1) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 1) (11, 8) (11, 17) (12, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently in the graph. Let's follow the method to find the total number of triangles.

1. First, let's list the vertices sorted by their degrees:
   Node 9: degree 1
   Node 12, 19: degree 2
   Node 7, 4, 10, 18, 1, 16, 6: degree 3
   Node 0, 14, 15, 11, 13, 5: degree 4
   Node 8, 3, 2, 17: degree 5

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   Node 9: label 0
   Node 12, 19: label 1, 2
   Node 7, 4, 10, 18, 1, 16, 6: label 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
   Node 0, 14, 15, 11, 13, 5: label 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
   Node 8, 3, 2, 17: label 16, 17, 18, 19

3. Count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
   Triangles:
   <0, 2, 3> 
   <0, 2, 17>
   <0, 3, 10>
   <0, 3, 18>
   <0, 10, 6>
   <0, 11, 15>
   <1, 9, 12>
   <1, 9, 19> 
   <1, 12, 19>

   Total number of triangles: [9]
