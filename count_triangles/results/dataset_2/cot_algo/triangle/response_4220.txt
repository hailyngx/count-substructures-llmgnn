Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 0) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 12) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 12) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 12) (5, 0) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the graph provided will be as follows:

Vertices sorted by the number of connections:
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 12: 6 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 14: 5 connections

Triangles found:
[6] triangles

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 14>
