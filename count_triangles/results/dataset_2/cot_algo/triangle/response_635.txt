Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 6) (15, 0) (15, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 2) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 2) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 7) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (17, 1) (17, 7) (5, 13) (5, 16) (19, 4) (19, 16) (16, 0) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 9) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 10) (18, 9) (18, 6) (7, 11) (7, 17) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 1) (12, 15) (12, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 18) (6, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering for the given graph is as follows:

Node 15 has degree 2
Node 12 has degree 2
Node 17 has degree 2
Node 5 has degree 2
Node 19 has degree 2
Node 18 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 16 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 13 has degree 4
Node 14 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 5
Node 11 has degree 5
Node 8 has degree 5
Node 10 has degree 5
Node 6 has degree 5
Node 0 has degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we count the triangles formed by shared connections between the vertices of each edge. 

By doing this, we find that the total number of triangles is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 6, 18>
<0, 6, 12>
<1, 10, 9>
<1, 10, 8>
<4, 11, 8>
<4, 11, 7>
