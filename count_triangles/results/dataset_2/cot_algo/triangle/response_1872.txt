Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 16) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 11) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 0) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 3) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 10) (19, 15) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 11) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 10) (5, 14) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (12, 15) (13, 1) (13, 6) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 3) (11, 18) (11, 15) (11, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 11) 

Response:
The graph will be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- Node 0: 8, 1, 16, 3
- Node 1: 13, 9, 0
- Node 2: 9, 16
- Node 3: 4, 0, 16, 10
- Node 4: 17, 8, 6, 3
- Node 5: 14
- Node 6: 4, 13, 11
- Node 7: 9, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7, 10, 0
- Node 9: 14, 7, 2, 1
- Node 10: 14, 8, 16, 3
- Node 11: 18, 15, 6
- Node 12: 15
- Node 13: 1, 6
- Node 14: 17, 18, 9, 5, 10
- Node 15: 19, 12, 11
- Node 16: 2, 0, 3, 10
- Node 17: 14, 18, 4
- Node 18: 14, 17, 11
- Node 19: 15

Node 12: 1
Node 19: 1
Node 2: 2
Node 7: 2
Node 12: 2
Node 13: 2
Node 6: 3
Node 1: 3
Node 5: 4
Node 16: 4
Node 4: 4
Node 11: 4
Node 18: 4
Node 9: 4
Node 7: 4
Node 0: 4
Node 8: 4
Node 10: 4
Node 3: 4
Node 14: 5
Node 15: 5
Node 17: 5
