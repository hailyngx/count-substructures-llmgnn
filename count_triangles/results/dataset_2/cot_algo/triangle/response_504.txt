Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 5) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 9) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 13) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 16) (6, 12) (2, 0) (2, 16) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 19) (16, 19) (16, 6) (16, 2) (12, 11) (12, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19}.

Sorting the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes by degree: [(2, 2), (9, 3), (4, 3), (11, 3), (13, 3), (16, 3), (5, 3), (6, 4), (8, 4), (0, 4), (1, 5), (12, 5), (3, 5), (7, 5), (15, 5), (19, 5), (14, 2), (17, 5)]

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [26]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 13>, <0, 1, 15>, <0, 1, 17>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 16>, <0, 6, 15>, <0, 6, 17>, <0, 13, 15>, <0, 13, 17>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 15>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 7, 15>, <1, 7, 17>, <1, 8, 14>, <1, 8, 17>, <1, 11, 12>, <1, 11, 15>, <1, 12, 6>, <1, 15, 17>, <4, 5, 19>, <4, 9, 19>, <6, 16, 19>, <6, 2, 16>, <6, 12, 16>, <16, 19, 5>
