Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 8) (12, 9) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 5) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 13) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 5) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, and then proceed with finding the triangles based on the given edges.

The vertices labeled from 0 to 14 based on their degrees are:  

Vertices by degree:  
Vertex 6 (Degree 2): {6}  
Vertex 1, 2, 10, 13 (Degree 3): {1, 2, 10, 13}  
Vertex 0, 5, 7, 8, 12 (Degree 4): {0, 5, 7, 8, 12}  
Vertex 3, 4, 9, 11, 14 (Degree 5): {3, 4, 9, 11, 14}  

Now, let's go through the edges to count the triangles and list them.  

From the given edges, the triangles formed are:  
<2, 5, 13>  
<3, 4, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
