Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 19) (8, 3) (8, 18) (13, 2) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 17) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 10) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 15) (9, 12) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 5) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 4) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (5, 15) (5, 2) (0, 11) (0, 15) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 18) (10, 3) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 2) (4, 16) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 3) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows with the nodes and their connections:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: (11, 16), (11, 0), (11, 17), (16, 6), (16, 4), (16, 19), (16, 17), (16, 11), (8, 3), (8, 18), (13, 2), (7, 12), (12, 10), (12, 14), (12, 9), (1, 6), (1, 14), (1, 10), (6, 17), (6, 16), (6, 1), (18, 19), (18, 10), (18, 8), (19, 15), (19, 16), (19, 18), (9, 12), (15, 19), (15, 0), (15, 14), (15, 5), (17, 6), (17, 16), (17, 11), (17, 4), (2, 13), (2, 5), (2, 14), (2, 4), (5, 15), (5, 2), (0, 11), (0, 15), (3, 8), (3, 10), (3, 4), (10, 18), (10, 12), (10, 1), (10, 3), (14, 2), (14, 15), (14, 12), (14, 1), (4, 17), (4, 16), (4, 2), (4, 3)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes sorted by degrees: {13, 7, 5, 9, 0, 19, 8, 3, 7, 1, 4, 17, 14, 14, 5, 7, 10, 6, 7, 6}
Relabeled nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Now, let's count the number of triangles based on the shared connections:

Number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 11, 16>, <0, 11, 17>, <0, 15, 19>, <2, 14, 15>, <3, 4, 10>, <4, 16, 17>
