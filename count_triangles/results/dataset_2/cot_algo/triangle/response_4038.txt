Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 12) (16, 25) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 28) (7, 0) (7, 22) (6, 28) (6, 26) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 10) (1, 15) (1, 22) (1, 12) (3, 14) (3, 24) (3, 23) (3, 29) (12, 16) (12, 1) (12, 27) (12, 2) (27, 12) (27, 23) (28, 4) (28, 6) (28, 25) (17, 11) (17, 9) (17, 29) (17, 5) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 15) (29, 22) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (15, 1) (15, 29) (15, 10) (15, 23) (15, 14) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 21) (8, 18) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 24) (10, 23) (19, 8) (19, 2) (5, 17) (5, 2) (26, 6) (26, 2) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 5) (2, 26) (24, 3) (24, 10) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 20) (14, 13) (20, 14) (20, 21) (23, 3) (23, 27) (23, 15) (23, 10) (21, 8) (21, 20) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 25) (25, 16) (25, 28) (25, 13) (18, 8) (22, 7) (22, 1) (22, 29) 

Response:
The graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. To count the number of triangles, let's use the Degree-Based Ordering method.

First, let's list the degree of each node:
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 2
Node 12: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 4
Node 15: Degree 5
Node 16: Degree 2
Node 17: Degree 4
Node 18: Degree 1
Node 19: Degree 2
Node 20: Degree 2
Node 21: Degree 2
Node 22: Degree 3
Node 23: Degree 4
Node 24: Degree 3
Node 25: Degree 3
Node 26: Degree 2
Node 27: Degree 2
Node 28: Degree 3
Node 29: Degree 4

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:
Node 18: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 16: Degree 2
Node 19: Degree 2
Node 20: Degree 2
Node 21: Degree 2
Node 26: Degree 2
Node 27: Degree 2
Node 11: Degree 2
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 22: Degree 3
Node 25: Degree 3
Node 28: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 17: Degree 4
Node 29: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 4
Node 24: Degree 4
Node 15: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 5

Based on the relabeling, we will process the edges accordingly to count the triangles. After counting, the total number of triangles is [36].

Unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 28>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 28>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 22>, <1, 12, 15>, <1, 15, 22>, <1, 12, 22>, <3, 14, 15>, <3, 14, 23>, <3, 15, 29>, <3, 23, 27>, <3, 23, 29>, <3, 27, 29>, <4, 13, 14>, <4, 13, 25>, <4, 14, 15>, <6, 26, 28>, <8, 9, 17>, <8, 9, 21>, <8, 9, 18>, <8, 17, 29>, <9, 10, 15>, <9, 10, 23>, <9, 17, 29>, <10, 15, 23>, <10, 23, 24>, <12, 16, 25>, <14, 20, 21>, <15, 20, 21>, <23, 24, 29>, <23, 27, 29>, <27, 12, 2>, <28, 25, 13>, <8, 11, 17>
