Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 3) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 11), 
(1, 5), (1, 11), (1, 13), (1, 14),
(2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 10), (2, 11), (2, 13),
(3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 14),
(4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 10), (4, 12),
(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 9), (5, 10),
(6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 10), (6, 12),
(7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 9),
(8, 0), (8, 6), (8, 9),
(9, 5), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 14),
(10, 2), (10, 4), (10, 5), (10, 6), (10, 14),
(11, 0), (11, 1), (11, 2), (11, 13), (11, 14),
(12, 4), (12, 6),
(13, 1), (13, 2), (13, 11),
(14, 3), (14, 9), (14, 10), (14, 11)

Now, let's find the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by degree:
{3, 12, 13, 7, 8, 4, 6, 1, 10, 14, 0, 2, 5, 11, 9}

Triangles: <0, 2, 11>, <0, 2, 14>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 10>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 11, 14>, <1, 13, 11>, <1, 13, 2>, <1, 14, 10>, <1, 14, 11>, <2, 5, 10>, <2, 5, 13>, <2, 7, 0>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 10>, <3, 4, 14>, <5, 6, 10>, <5, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [22]
