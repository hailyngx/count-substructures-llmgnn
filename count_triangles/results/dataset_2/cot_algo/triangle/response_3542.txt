Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 28) (13, 14) (22, 11) (22, 7) (22, 12) (22, 1) (4, 8) (4, 23) (7, 22) (7, 29) (7, 19) (2, 18) (2, 26) (2, 24) (2, 11) (29, 7) (29, 27) (10, 19) (10, 23) (17, 1) (17, 16) (18, 2) (18, 27) (18, 25) (8, 4) (8, 20) (8, 26) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 26) (14, 11) (14, 5) (1, 22) (1, 17) (1, 0) (1, 28) (6, 21) (6, 15) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 6) (21, 11) (16, 17) (16, 28) (16, 23) (28, 13) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 16) (26, 2) (26, 8) (26, 14) (11, 22) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 21) (11, 27) (3, 20) (27, 29) (27, 18) (27, 11) (27, 24) (27, 23) (15, 6) (15, 25) (23, 4) (23, 10) (23, 16) (23, 27) (9, 24) (9, 19) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 9) (5, 14) (12, 22) (12, 24) (24, 2) (24, 27) (24, 9) (24, 12) (24, 25) (20, 8) (20, 3) (25, 18) (25, 15) (25, 24) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degrees:

Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 15: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 16: 4 connections
Node 20: 2 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 18: 5 connections
Node 25: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 26: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 24: 6 connections
Node 29: 3 connections
Node 11: 6 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 21: 5 connections
Node 27: 6 connections
Node 22: 6 connections
Node 28: 5 connections

Following the method, we will count the triangles:
