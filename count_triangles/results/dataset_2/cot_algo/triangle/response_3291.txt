Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 3) (26, 9) (26, 15) (26, 21) (6, 24) (6, 18) (6, 27) (3, 9) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 22) (25, 3) (25, 28) (25, 2) (20, 7) (20, 19) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 1) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 8) (2, 25) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 29) (7, 20) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 5) (12, 4) (12, 8) (29, 18) (22, 3) (22, 21) (22, 8) (5, 18) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 11) (13, 5) (13, 24) (13, 14) (13, 27) (4, 12) (4, 27) (4, 24) (4, 11) (27, 6) (27, 13) (27, 4) (1, 10) (1, 23) (15, 26) (15, 16) (16, 15) (16, 28) (16, 23) (28, 25) (28, 17) (28, 16) (21, 26) (21, 22) (24, 6) (24, 13) (24, 4) (24, 14) (0, 2) (0, 23) (19, 20) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 24) (14, 23) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 22) (11, 5) (11, 4) (23, 1) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 14) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree from least to most are as follows:
Vertex 16: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 11: 4 connections
Vertex 15: 4 connections
Vertex 19: 4 connections
Vertex 20: 4 connections
Vertex 21: 4 connections
Vertex 22: 4 connections
Vertex 29: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 12: 5 connections
Vertex 18: 5 connections
Vertex 23: 5 connections
Vertex 24: 5 connections
Vertex 26: 5 connections
Vertex 27: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertex 13: 5 connections
Vertex 14: 6 connections
Vertex 17: 6 connections
Vertex 10: 6 connections
Vertex 8: 7 connections
Vertex 3: 7 connections
Vertex 25: 7 connections
Vertex 4: 7 connections
Vertex 28: 7 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles. 

There are [57] triangles in total.
The unique triangles found are:
