Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

0: 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
1: 7, 8
2: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8
3: 0, 4, 9
4: 2, 3, 5
5: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8
6: 0, 2, 5, 8
7: 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
8: 1, 2, 5, 7, 6
9: 0, 3, 7

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
[15]

Unique triangles:
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
