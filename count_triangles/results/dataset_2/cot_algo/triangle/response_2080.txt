Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 9) (12, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degree:

Nodes sorted by degree:
0 -> 4 connections
5 -> 3 connections
9 -> 3 connections
14 -> 3 connections
6 -> 2 connections
8 -> 2 connections
12 -> 2 connections
1 -> 2 connections
10 -> 2 connections
3 -> 2 connections
7 -> 2 connections
13 -> 2 connections
2 -> 2 connections
11 -> 5 connections
4 -> 5 connections

Using the sorted order, we will now examine the edges to count the triangles.
After analyzing all the triangles, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 2>, <1, 3, 2>, <1, 9, 12>, <4, 11, 13>.
