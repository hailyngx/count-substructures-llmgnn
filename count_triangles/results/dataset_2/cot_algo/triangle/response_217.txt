Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 16) (2, 7) (4, 18) (4, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 12) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 18) (1, 5) (1, 17) (17, 0) (17, 1) (17, 15) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 17) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 6) (16, 2) (16, 0) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 6) (11, 13) (11, 18) (6, 13) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 14) (14, 6) (14, 12) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 12) (3, 8) (3, 12) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: 
- 0: 4, 12, 16, 17
- 1: 5, 17
- 2: 5, 7, 9, 16
- 3: 8, 12
- 4: 0, 7, 11, 18
- 5: 1, 2, 13
- 6: 13, 14, 15, 19
- 7: 2, 4, 8, 18
- 8: 3, 7, 13
- 9: 2, 9, 12, 15
- 10: 15, 19
- 11: 4, 13, 18
- 12: 0, 3, 9, 14
- 13: 5, 6, 8, 11
- 14: 6, 12
- 15: 6, 9, 10, 17
- 16: 0, 2
- 17: 0, 1, 15
- 18: 4, 7, 11, 19
- 19: 6, 10, 18

By using the Degree-Based Ordering method and looking at the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles.

After counting the triangles, the total number of triangles is [18].

Unique triangles found are:
<6, 13, 19>
<6, 14, 19>
<0, 4, 18>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 12, 14>
<0, 12, 9>
<0, 16, 2>
<1, 5, 17>
<15, 6, 9>
<15, 6, 10>
<15, 9, 10>
<7, 4, 18>
<7, 4, 11>
<2, 5, 13>
<2, 9, 12>
<17, 0, 1>
<17, 0, 15>
<18, 4, 11>
<19, 10, 18>
