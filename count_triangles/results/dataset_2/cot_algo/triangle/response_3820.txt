Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 1) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 14) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method is as follows:

Node 5 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 3
Node 11 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 4
Node 13 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 14 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 12 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 5
Node 0 has degree 5
Node 7 has degree 5
Node 10 has degree 5

Considering the edges in increasing order of the labels, we see that the lower labeled vertices have fewer connections, so we count the triangles formed by shared connections:

We find the following triangles in the graph:
[<0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 13>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 12>, <3, 4, 10>, <3, 4, 12>, <4, 9, 10>, <4, 9, 14>, <5, 10, 14>, <6, 10, 11>, <8, 13, 1>, <9, 10, 14>, <11, 12, 14>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is:
