Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 0) (6, 4) (6, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 
(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 2)
(1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 10), (1, 14), (1, 3)
(2, 0), (2, 8), (2, 13), (2, 14)
(3, 1), (3, 13), (3, 14)
(4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9)
(5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 7), (5, 9), (5, 14)
(6, 4), (6, 10)
(7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 11)
(8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 7)
(9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 12)
(10, 0), (10, 6), (10, 1), (10, 12), (10, 13)
(11, 0), (11, 7), (11, 14)
(12, 9), (12, 10)
(13, 2), (13, 3), (13, 10)
(14, 2), (14, 5), (14, 1), (14, 3), (14, 11)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes by degree: 
(3, 3)
(6, 3)
(9, 4)
(12, 4)
(0, 5)
(2, 5)
(8, 5)
(10, 5)
(1, 5)
(4, 5)
(5, 5)
(7, 5)
(11, 3)
(13, 3)
(14, 5)

Now, we will count the number of triangles. 

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 14>
