Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 2) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 4) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 11) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 3) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 5 has degree 6,
Node 9 has degree 4,
Node 6 has degree 4,
Node 0 has degree 4,
Node 14 has degree 4,
Node 1 has degree 4,
Node 10 has degree 3,
Node 3 has degree 3,
Node 7 has degree 3,
Node 11 has degree 3,
Node 2 has degree 3,
Node 8 has degree 3,
Node 12 has degree 4,
Node 4 has degree 5,
Node 13 has degree 2.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted list of vertices is as follows:
13 < 3 < 10 < 8 < 11 < 7 < 2 < 1 < 0 < 6 < 9 < 14 < 4 < 5 < 12.

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Node 13 does not form a triangle with any other nodes.
- Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 10, 1, and 4.
- Node 10 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 2.
- Node 8 forms triangles with 3, 0, and 7.
- Node 11 forms triangles with 7, 4, and 8.
- Node 7 forms triangles with 11, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 forms triangles with 10, 5, and 7.
- Node 1 forms triangles with 10, 6, and 0.
- Node 0 forms triangles with 1, 14, and 8.
- Node 6 forms triangles with 1, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 forms a triangle with 6.
- Node 14 forms triangles with 0 and 4.
- Node 4 forms triangles with 3, 11, and 14.
- Node 5 forms triangles with 2 and 11.
- Node 12 does not form a triangle with other nodes.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [33]. 
The unique triangles found are <3, 10, 1>, <3, 10, 2>, <3, 10, 4>, <3, 8, 0>, <3, 8, 7>, <3, 8, 11>, <10, 1, 6>, <10, 1, 0>, <10, 2, 5>, <10, 2, 7>, <8, 3, 4>, <8, 3, 11>, <8, 0, 1>, <8, 0, 14>, <8, 0, 12>, <8, 0, 7>, <11, 7, 5>, <11, 7, 8>, <11, 7, 2>, <11, 4, 5>, <11, 4, 14>, <11, 4, 13>, <7, 2, 5>, <7, 2, 10>, <7, 2, 8>, <7, 2, 11>, <2, 10, 1>, <2, 10, 6>, <2, 10, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 0>, <0, 14, 4>, <0, 14, 12>.
