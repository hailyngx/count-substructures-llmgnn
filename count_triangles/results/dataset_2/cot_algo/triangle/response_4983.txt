Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 11) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 7) (5, 7) (2, 0) (0, 1) (13, 6) (13, 5) (11, 13) (11, 14) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 8) (0, 14) (14, 4) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 4) (12, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 1)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 3: degree 2
Node 10: degree 2
Node 2: degree 3
Node 0: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 8: degree 6
Node 9: degree 6
Node 13: degree 4
Node 11: degree 6
Node 14: degree 6
Node 4: degree 6
Node 1: degree 6

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will proceed with counting the triangles:
- Edge (3, 4) is considered (Node 3 has fewer connections)
    - Node 3: 4, 1
    - Node 4: 1, 3
    - Triangles: <3, 4, 1>
- Edge (10, 14) is considered (Node 10 has fewer connections)
    - Node 10: 11, 14
    - Node 14: 10, 11, 4, 0, 1
    - Triangles: <10, 14, 11>
- Edge (2, 8) is considered (Node 2 has fewer connections)
    - Node 2: 0, 8
    - Node 8: 2, 13, 5, 14, 9
    - Triangles: <2, 8, 0>
- Edge (0, 1) is considered (Node 0 has fewer connections)
    - Node 0: 2, 1, 14
    - Node 1: 4, 9, 7, 0
    - Triangles: <0, 1, 4> <0, 1, 14>
- Edge (7, 11) is considered (Node 7 has fewer connections)
    - Node 7: 11, 5, 1
    - Node 11: 13, 14, 3, 7
    - Triangles: <7, 11, 13> <7, 11, 14>
- Edge (12, 4) is considered (Node 4 has fewer connections)
    - Node 12: 9, 8, 4, 1
    - Node 4: 9, 14, 1, 3, 12
    - Triangles: <4, 12, 9> <4, 12, 1>
- Edge (6, 9) is considered (Node 6 has fewer connections)
    - Node 6: 5, 13, 9
    - Node 9: 8, 4, 1, 6, 12
    - Triangles: <6, 9, 8> <6, 9, 4> <6, 9, 1> <6, 9, 12>
- Edge (5, 8) is considered (Node 5 has fewer connections)
    - Node 5: 6, 13, 8, 7
    - Node 8: 13, 2, 5, 14, 9
