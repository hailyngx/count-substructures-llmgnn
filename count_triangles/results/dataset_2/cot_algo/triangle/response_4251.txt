Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) 

Response:
The degrees of the nodes in the graph are as follows:
Node 0: degree 5
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 9: degree 5

The vertices sorted by their degrees in ascending order are as follows:
Node 3, Node 1, Node 2, Node 6, Node 4, Node 0, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:
(3, 6)
(1, 7)
(1, 9)
(3, 8)
(2, 0)
(2, 8)
(2, 7)
(2, 6)
(6, 4)
(0, 7)
(0, 8)
(0, 2)
(0, 6)
(7, 5)
(7, 9)
(7, 1)
(7, 2)
(7, 0)
(8, 5)
(8, 9)
(8, 3)
(8, 2)
(8, 0)
(9, 5)
(9, 8)
(9, 4)
(9, 1)
(9, 7)
(5, 4)
(5, 9)
(5, 8)
(5, 1)
(5, 7)
(6, 3)
(6, 2)
(6, 4)
(6, 0)
(4, 6)
(4, 5)
(4, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
