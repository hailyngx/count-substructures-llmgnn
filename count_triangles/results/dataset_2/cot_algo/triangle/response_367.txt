Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (12, 13) (12, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Sorted Nodes by Degree:
1. Node 5 (Degree 2)
2. Node 4 (Degree 3)
3. Node 7 (Degree 3)
4. Node 9 (Degree 3)
5. Node 8 (Degree 4)
6. Node 12 (Degree 2)
7. Node 1 (Degree 4)
8. Node 0 (Degree 4)
9. Node 10 (Degree 2)
10. Node 14 (Degree 5)
11. Node 11 (Degree 5)
12. Node 3 (Degree 5)
13. Node 6 (Degree 5)
14. Node 13 (Degree 5)
15. Node 2 (Degree 5)

Now, we go through each edge to count the triangles:

1. Checking edge (5, 9):
   - Shared connections with 5: {13}
   - Shared connections with 9: {13}
   - Triangle formed: <5, 9, 13>

2. Checking edge (5, 13):
   - Shared connections with 5: {9}
   - Shared connections with 13: {9, 12, 14, 6}
   - Triangles formed: <5, 13, 9>, <5, 13, 12>, <5, 13, 14>, <5, 13, 6>

3. Checking edge (9, 1):
   - No shared connection, no triangle formed.

4. Checking edge (9, 13):
   - Shared connections with 9: {5}
   - Shared connections with 13: {5, 12, 14, 6}
   - Triangles formed: <9, 13, 5>, <9, 13, 12>, <9, 13, 14>, <9, 13, 6>

5. Checking edge (4, 0):
   - Shared connections with 4: {3, 14}
   - Shared connections with 0: {3, 11, 6}
   - Triangle formed: <4, 0, 3>

6. Checking edge (4, 14):
   - Shared connections with 4: {0, 3}
   - Shared connections with 14: {8, 13, 11, 6}
   - Triangles formed: <4, 14, 8>, <4, 14, 13>, <4, 14, 11>, <4, 14, 6>

7. Checking edge (4, 3):
   - Shared connections with 4: {0, 14}
   - Shared connections with 3: {0, 11, 6, 2}
   - Triangles formed: <4, 3, 0>, <4, 3, 11>, <4, 3, 6>

8. Checking edge (8, 14):
   - Shared connections with 8: {11}
   - Shared connections with 14: {4, 13, 11, 6}
   - Triangles formed: <8, 14, 4>, <8, 14, 13>, <8, 14, 6>, <8, 14, 11>

9. Checking edge (8, 11):
   - Shared connections with 8: {14}
   - Shared connections with 11: {3, 14, 7, 1, 0}
   - Triangles formed: <8, 11, 3>, <8, 11, 14>

10. Checking edge (8, 7):
   - No shared connection, no triangle formed.

11. Checking edge (8, 6):
    - Shared connections with 8: {14}
    - Shared connections with 6: {13, 3, 0, 14, 2}
    - Triangles formed: <8, 6, 13>, <8, 6, 3>, <8, 6, 0>, <8, 6, 14>

12. Checking edge (13, 5):
    - Shared connections with 13: {9, 12, 14, 6}
    - Shared connections with 5: {9}
    - Triangles formed: <13, 5, 9>

13. Checking edge (13, 9):
    - Shared connections with 13: {5, 12, 14, 6}
    - Shared connections with 9: {5}
    - Triangles formed: <13, 9, 5>

14. Checking edge (13, 12):
    - Shared connections with 13: {5, 9, 14, 6}
    - Shared connections with 12: {10}
    - Triangle formed: <13, 12, 10>

15. Checking edge (13, 14):
    - Shared connections with 13: {5, 9, 12, 6}
    - Shared connections with 14: {8, 4, 11, 6}
    - Triangles formed: <13, 14, 8>, <13, 14, 4>, <13, 14, 11>, <13, 14, 6>
