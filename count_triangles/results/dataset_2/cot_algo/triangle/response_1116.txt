Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:
```
   6 -- 5     2
   |    |     |
   1 -- 8 -- 9
   |    |    |
   7 -- 0 -- 4
         |
         3
```

The Degree-Based Ordering is as follows:
Node 2 has degree 2.
Node 3 has degree 3.
Node 5 has degree 3.
Node 4 has degree 4.
Node 7 has degree 4.
Node 8 has degree 4.
Node 1 has degree 5.
Node 9 has degree 5.
Node 6 has degree 5.
Node 0 has degree 5.
