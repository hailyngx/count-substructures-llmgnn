Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 21) (0, 27) (0, 15) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 3) (27, 20) (27, 5) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 12) (9, 0) (9, 6) (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 3) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 23) (22, 5) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 23) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 25) (12, 6) (12, 20) (12, 13) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 29) (28, 3) (28, 8) (13, 12) (26, 18) (26, 25) (26, 8) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 2) (29, 4) (29, 1) (29, 8) (29, 23) (3, 27) (3, 17) (3, 28) (3, 21) (21, 16) (21, 25) (21, 3) (21, 19) (8, 11) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 29) (23, 18) (23, 10) (23, 29) (23, 15) (24, 11) (24, 5) (24, 15) (1, 25) (1, 29) (1, 19) (2, 25) (20, 27) (20, 12) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 23) (15, 24) (5, 27) (5, 22) (5, 24) (19, 21) (19, 1) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 8)
(16, 21)
(0, 27) (0, 15) (0, 9)
(27, 3) (27, 20) (27, 5)
(6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 12)
(14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 15)
(17, 10) (17, 3)
(18, 26) (18, 23)
(22, 5)
(10, 7) (10, 23)
(7, 25)
(12, 20) (12, 13)
(4, 18) (4, 29)
(28, 3) (28, 8)
(26, 25) (26, 8)
(25, 21) (25, 2) (25, 1)
(29, 1) (29, 23)
(3, 28)
(21, 16) (21, 19)
(8, 29)
(24, 5)

Next, we will label the nodes based on their degree from lowest to highest:

Nodes by degree: 2, 19, 10, 12, 22, 13, 16, 20, 4, 6, 5, 9, 14, 17, 21, 0, 1, 26, 28, 29, 7, 15, 18, 23, 24, 27, 3, 8, 11, 25

Now, we will count the number of triangles:

Number of triangles: [74]

Unique triangles:
<0, 15, 23>
<4, 18, 29>
<3, 17, 21>
<1, 19, 25>
<8, 11, 29>
<7, 10, 25>
<7, 11, 25>
<3, 17, 28>
<6, 12, 15>
<15, 23, 24>
<15, 0, 6>
<26, 25, 8>
<3, 21, 25>
<18, 23, 10>
<0, 9, 27>
<4, 14, 15>
<3, 21, 19>
<14, 15, 17>
<6, 9, 15>
<17, 10, 23>
<17, 3, 27>
<16, 11, 24>
<25, 7, 11>
<25, 1, 29>
<21, 16, 25>
<14, 4, 29>
<27, 0, 9>
<6, 15, 0>
<18, 4, 14>
<12, 20, 27>
<10, 7, 25>
<9, 0, 6>
<11, 16, 21>
<17, 14, 4>
<25, 26, 8>
<23, 29, 4>
<21, 25, 3>
<25, 10, 7>
<18, 26, 8>
<11, 24, 5>
<27, 20, 12>
<27, 3, 28>
