This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 22) (29, 2) (29, 26) (29, 25) (29, 11) (1, 6) (3, 16) (3, 19) (4, 8) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 27) (24, 26) (24, 9) (24, 15) (26, 29) (26, 24) (26, 23) (26, 21) (15, 24) (15, 5) (11, 29) (11, 4) (11, 23) (11, 20) (23, 26) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 25) (22, 2) (22, 27) (22, 12) (28, 0) (28, 17) (28, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (14, 18) (14, 20) (19, 3) (19, 16) (19, 12) (0, 28) (0, 6) (5, 15) (5, 23) (5, 7) (5, 20) (9, 24) (9, 25) (9, 10) (25, 29) (25, 23) (25, 9) (25, 13) (25, 16) (7, 28) (7, 6) (7, 5) (17, 8) (17, 28) (17, 12) (17, 18) (21, 26) (21, 27) (27, 8) (27, 22) (27, 21) (13, 25) (18, 14) (18, 17) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 16) (12, 22) (12, 6) (12, 19) (12, 17) (12, 10) (16, 3) (16, 19) (16, 25) (16, 10) (20, 11) (20, 14) (20, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method proceeds as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
   - Node 28: 3 connections
   - Node 7: 4 connections
   - Node 0: 4 connections
   - Node 27: 4 connections
   - Node 14: 2 connections
   - Node 18: 2 connections
   - Node 13: 1 connection
   - Node 10: 3 connections
   - Node 12: 5 connections
   - Node 11: 4 connections
   - Node 3: 2 connections
   - Node 22: 3 connections
   - Node 24: 4 connections
   - Node 9: 3 connections
   - Node 15: 2 connections
   - Node 5: 4 connections
   - Node 16: 4 connections
   - Node 17: 4 connections
   - Node 25: 5 connections
   - Node 1: 1 connection
   - Node 29: 4 connections
   - Node 4: 3 connections
   - Node 26: 5 connections
   - Node 6: 4 connections
   - Node 8: 3 connections
   - Node 20: 3 connections
   - Node 2: 2 connections
   - Node 19: 3 connections
   - Node 21: 2 connections

2. Relabel the nodes accordingly:
   - Node 13 (1 connection)
   - Node 14 (2 connections)
   - Node 18 (2 connections)
   - Node 21 (2 connections)
   - Node 3 (2 connections)
   - Node 15 (2 connections)
   - Node 22 (3 connections)
   - Node 10 (3 connections)
   - Node 4 (3 connections)
   - Node 8 (3 connections)
   - Node 20 (3 connections)
   - Node 2 (3 connections)
   - Node 19 (3 connections)
   - Node 9 (3 connections)
   - Node 28 (3 connections)
   - Node 7 (4 connections)
   - Node 0 (4 connections)
   - Node 27 (4 connections)
   - Node 16 (4 connections)
   - Node 17 (4 connections)
   - Node 6 (4 connections)
   - Node 11 (4 connections)
   - Node 29 (4 connections)
   - Node 24 (4 connections)
   - Node 5 (4 connections)
   - Node 1 (1 connection)
   - Node 25 (5 connections)
   - Node 12 (5 connections)
   - Node 26 (5 connections)
