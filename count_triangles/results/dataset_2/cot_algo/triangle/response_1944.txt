Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently in the given graph. 

By sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections), we have the following new labeling:

- Vertex 0 (Degree: 4)
- Vertex 1 (Degree: Not present)
- Vertex 2 (Degree: 2)
- Vertex 3 (Degree: 2)
- Vertex 4 (Degree: 4)
- Vertex 5 (Degree: 5)
- Vertex 6 (Degree: 2)
- Vertex 7 (Degree: 4)
- Vertex 8 (Degree: 3)
- Vertex 9 (Degree: 3)
- Vertex 10 (Degree: 4)
- Vertex 11 (Degree: 2)
- Vertex 12 (Degree: 4)
- Vertex 13 (Degree: 5)
- Vertex 14 (Degree: 5)
- Vertex 15 (Degree: 4)
- Vertex 16 (Degree: 3)
- Vertex 17 (Degree: 4)
- Vertex 18 (Degree: 2)
- Vertex 19 (Degree: 3)
- Vertex 20 (Degree: 4)
- Vertex 21 (Degree: 3)
- Vertex 22 (Degree: 2)
- Vertex 23 (Degree: 3)
- Vertex 24 (Degree: 2)
- Vertex 25 (Degree: 2)
- Vertex 26 (Degree: 2)
- Vertex 27 (Degree: 2)
- Vertex 28 (Degree: 4)
- Vertex 29 (Degree: 3)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:

1. (11, 15, 27) - Triangle involving vertices with labels 11, 15, 27.
2. (16, 3, 5) - Triangle involving vertices with labels 16, 3, 5.
3. (16, 8, 5) - Triangle involving vertices with labels 16, 8, 5.
4. (15, 27, 14) - Triangle involving vertices with labels 15, 27, 14.
5. (27, 14, 29) - Triangle involving vertices with labels 27, 14, 29.
6. (3, 5, 28) - Triangle involving vertices with labels 3, 5, 28.
7. (18, 17, 10) - Triangle involving vertices with labels 18, 17, 10.
8. (17, 10, 23) - Triangle involving vertices with labels 17, 10, 23.
9. (17, 13, 20) - Triangle involving vertices with labels 17, 13, 20.
10. (17, 4, 0) - Triangle involving vertices with labels 17, 4, 0.
11. (0, 20, 29) - Triangle involving vertices with labels 0, 20, 29.
12. (0, 4, 6) - Triangle involving vertices with labels 0, 4, 6.
13. (20, 13, 14) - Triangle involving vertices with labels 20, 13, 14.
14. (20, 21, 24) - Triangle involving vertices with labels 20, 21, 24.
15. (28, 5, 14) - Triangle involving vertices with labels 28, 5, 14.
16. (29, 12, 19) - Triangle involving vertices with labels 29, 12, 19.
17. (13, 7, 5) - Triangle involving vertices with labels 13, 7, 5.

Thus, the final count of triangles in the given graph is [17].

The unique triangles found are:
- <11, 15, 27>
- <16, 3, 5>
- <16, 8, 5>
