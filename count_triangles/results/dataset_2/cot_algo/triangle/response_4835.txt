Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 11) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 10) 

Response:
The vertices with their corresponding degrees based on the given edges are:
- Node 0: degree 6
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 4

Therefore, the sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 5, 10, 4, 1, 0

After relabeling according to the sorted list, the edges we consider are: (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 8), (6, 14), (7, 12), (9, 13), (10, 14), (11, 13)

Calculating the triangles, we find:
- Triangles: 10
- Unique triangles: {<0, 3, 4>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 8, 3>, <6, 14, 2>, <7, 12, 4>, <9, 13, 5>, <10, 1, 14>, <10, 11, 13>, <10, 13, 14>, <11, 2, 13>}

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
