Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 0), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 7), (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 9), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 0), (7, 1), (7, 0), (7, 8), (5, 6), (5, 3), (5, 8), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 0), (8, 6), (8, 1), (8, 7), (8, 5), (8, 2), (0, 6), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 2)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and relabel them accordingly:  

New labels: 
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 6: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's count the triangles: 

Triangles: 
<3, 6, 9>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<0, 2, 8>

Total number of triangles: [5]
