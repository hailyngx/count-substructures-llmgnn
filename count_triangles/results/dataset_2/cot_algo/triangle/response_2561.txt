Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (16, 11) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 19) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 19) (17, 9) (17, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 18) (14, 7) (15, 10) (15, 19) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (1, 11) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 7) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 3) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 13) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 4) (18, 14) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves ordering the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order. Here is the list of nodes sorted in increasing order of degree:

0: degree 2
3: degree 2
16: degree 2
18: degree 2
5: degree 3
15: degree 3
7: degree 4
1: degree 4
2: degree 4
6: degree 4
13: degree 4
11: degree 5
14: degree 2
17: degree 4
9: degree 5
8: degree 5
4: degree 5
10: degree 5
12: degree 4
19: degree 5

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

1. (11, 16):
No triangles formed.
