- Node 10: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 19: degree 2
- Node 21: degree 3
- Node 22: degree 2
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 26: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 20: degree 3
- Node 27: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 23: degree 4
- Node 24: degree 5
- Node 29: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 6
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 25: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 28: degree 1
