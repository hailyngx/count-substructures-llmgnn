Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted by their degrees (number of connections):
0 (degree 5) <br>
1 (degree 4) <br>
2 (degree 3) <br>
3 (degree 2) <br>
4 (degree 2) <br>
5 (degree 4) <br>
6 (degree 4) <br>
7 (degree 5) <br>
8 (degree 2) <br>
9 (degree 1) <br>
10 (degree 2) <br>
11 (degree 2) <br>
12 (degree 3) <br>
13 (degree 5) <br>
14 (degree 3) <br>
15 (degree 3) <br>
16 (degree 5) <br>
17 (degree 1) <br>
18 (degree 1) <br>
19 (degree 2)
