Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 10) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 3) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 12) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 14) (13, 14) 

Response:
Let's start by constructing the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: 
- 0: {6, 2, 3, 12}
- 1: {5, 7, 6, 12}
- 2: {7, 8, 11, 0}
- 3: {0, 11, 12}
- 4: {9, 7, 12}
- 5: {9, 8, 1, 10}
- 6: {9, 1, 11, 0}
- 7: {9, 4, 2, 1, 8}
- 8: {5, 9, 7, 2, 10, 11}
- 9: {5, 6, 8, 4, 7, 12}
- 10: {5, 8, 14}
- 11: {6, 2, 8, 3}
- 12: {9, 4, 0, 14, 3, 1}
- 13: {14}
- 14: {12, 13, 10}

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degree in ascending order:
Nodes by degree: [13, 10, 3, 4, 0, 6, 2, 1, 11, 5, 7, 8, 12, 9, 14]

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles and the unique triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Triangles: [13]
- Unique triangles: <0, 12, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13], and the unique triangles found are <0, 12, 13>.
