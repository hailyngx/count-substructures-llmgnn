Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: 1, 8, 7
- 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7
- 2: 1, 3, 5, 9
- 3: 1, 2, 4, 7
- 4: 3, 5
- 5: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
- 6: 5, 9, 7
- 7: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9
- 8: 0, 5, 9
- 9: 2, 6, 7, 8

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes in ascending order of degree: 4, 8, 0, 6, 2, 3, 7, 9, 1, 5

Then, we will count the number of triangles formed:
[Number of triangles: 6]

Unique triangles found: 
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 3>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 1>
<3, 5, 7>
