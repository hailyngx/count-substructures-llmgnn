Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 29) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 24) (27, 16) (2, 21) (29, 15) (29, 1) (1, 29) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 12) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 25) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 13) (23, 28) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 23) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 0) (6, 8) (6, 28) (6, 7) (6, 4) (28, 23) (28, 6) (28, 10) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 21) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 9) (26, 13) (16, 27) (16, 21) (16, 18) (16, 10) (21, 2) (21, 3) (21, 0) (21, 16) (21, 5) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 25) (12, 3) (12, 22) (12, 9) (19, 22) (19, 7) (19, 24) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 5) (5, 21) (5, 11) (5, 10) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 10) (24, 27) (24, 19) (24, 20) (10, 8) (10, 28) (10, 16) (10, 5) (10, 7) (25, 22) (25, 23) (25, 4) (18, 16) (18, 20) (20, 24) (20, 18) (17, 15) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the given nodes and edges. Now let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most:
Nodes: [2, 9, 27, 8, 5, 4, 12, 1, 26, 7, 3, 17, 29, 18, 20, 28, 23, 25, 19, 22, 16, 24, 6, 0, 14, 11, 10, 13, 15, 21]

Triangles found in the graph:
[<0, 14, 15>, <5, 10, 11>, <6, 7, 10>, <6, 7, 19>, <10, 16, 21>, <12, 9, 22>, <13, 0, 14>, <13, 6, 28>, <13, 8, 23>, <13, 23, 25>, <16, 21, 27>, <19, 22, 23>]

Total number of triangles: [12]
