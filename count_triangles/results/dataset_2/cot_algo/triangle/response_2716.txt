Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 7: degree 3  
Node 2: degree 2  
Node 6: degree 3  
Node 1: degree 3  
Node 0: degree 4  
Node 8: degree 4  
Node 3: degree 6  
Node 4: degree 6  
Node 9: degree 5  
Node 5: degree 5  

Now, starting from the edges with the lower degree vertex:
- Edge (7, 3): Node 7 is lower, which has Node 3 in common.
- Edge (2, 5): Node 2 is lower, which has Node 5 in common.
- Edge (6, 8): Node 6 is lower, which has Node 8 in common.
- Edge (1, 8): Node 1 is lower, which has Node 8 in common.
- Edge (0, 1): Node 0 is lower, which has Node 1 in common.
- Edge (3, 6): Node 3 is lower, which has Node 6 in common.
- Edge (3, 7): Node 3 is lower, which has Node 7 in common.
- Edge (3, 0): Node 0 is lower, which has Node 3 in common.
- Edge (3, 4): Node 3 is lower, which has Node 4 in common.
- Edge (4, 5): Node 4 is lower, which has Node 5 in common.
- Edge (4, 9): Node 4 is lower, which has Node 9 in common.
- Edge (4, 3): Node 3 is lower, which has Node 4 in common.
- Edge (4, 8): Node 4 is lower, which has Node 8 in common.
- Edge (8, 5): Node 8 is lower, which has Node 5 in common.

Counting the triangles resulting from these connections:
- Triangle <4, 3, 5>
- Triangle <4, 3, 8>

Output: [2]
