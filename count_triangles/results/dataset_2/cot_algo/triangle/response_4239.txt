Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 2) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 26) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 28) (3, 1) (3, 24) (3, 10) (3, 16) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 22) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 26) (11, 25) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 18) (20, 22) (25, 11) (25, 20) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 8) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 19) (27, 5) (2, 14) (2, 16) (29, 14) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 24) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 8) (21, 27) (21, 28) (28, 14) (28, 1) (28, 21) (13, 11) (13, 15) (26, 17) (26, 11) (5, 27) (18, 20) (18, 23) (18, 24) (9, 17) (9, 29) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 2) (16, 7) (6, 17) (6, 22) (23, 18) (23, 24) (24, 3) (24, 29) (24, 18) (24, 23) (24, 19) (19, 17) (19, 27) (19, 24) (0, 4) (0, 8) (15, 4) (15, 13) (22, 10) (22, 20) (22, 6) (8, 12) (8, 7) (8, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. 

After sorting vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following relabeling of nodes:
- Node 16 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 18 has degree 2
- Node 13 has degree 2
- Node 23 has degree 2
- Node 22 has degree 2
- Node 15 has degree 2
- Node 21 has degree 2
- Node 20 has degree 2
- Node 10 has degree 3
- Node 29 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 27 has degree 4
- Node 19 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 4
- Node 11 has degree 5
- Node 25 has degree 5
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 17 has degree 5
- Node 24 has degree 6
- Node 8 has degree 6
- Node 1 has degree 6
- Node 26 has degree 6
- Node 12 has degree 6
- Node 28 has degree 6

Now, let's count the triangles and output the results.

Total number of triangles: [34]
