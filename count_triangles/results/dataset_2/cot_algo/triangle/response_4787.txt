Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 6) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 7) (1, 11) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 6) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 6: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 12: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 10: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 9: degree 5
Node 3: degree 6
Node 14: degree 6
Node 5: degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

Number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles found: <2, 5, 10>, <3, 6, 12>, <2, 1, 7>, <2, 1, 12>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 1, 11>, <3, 7, 1>, <3, 0, 14>, <3, 0, 1>, <3, 6, 11>, <6, 10, 12>, <6, 11, 1>
