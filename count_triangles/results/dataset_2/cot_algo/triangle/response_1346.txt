Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 10) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 11) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 1) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order.

The degrees of the vertices are:
Vertex 0: 4
Vertex 1: 3
Vertex 2: 5
Vertex 3: 4
Vertex 4: 5
Vertex 5: 6
Vertex 6: 3
Vertex 7: 2
Vertex 8: 6
Vertex 9: 5
Vertex 10: 3
Vertex 11: 5
Vertex 12: 3
Vertex 13: 4
Vertex 14: 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we label the vertices as:
Vertex 7: 0
Vertex 1: 1
Vertex 12: 2
Vertex 10: 3
Vertex 6: 4
Vertex 5: 5
Vertex 0: 6
Vertex 13: 7
Vertex 3: 8
Vertex 14: 9
Vertex 2: 10
Vertex 8: 11
Vertex 4: 12
Vertex 9: 13
Vertex 11: 14

Now, we can count the number of triangles formed in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The total number of triangles is [10], and the unique triangles are:
<8, 0, 3>
<8, 0, 5>
<8, 3, 5>
<9, 1, 14>
<9, 14, 2>
<12, 4, 13>
<12, 8, 4>
<5, 0, 3>
<5, 0, 14>
<5, 14, 3>
