Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 9) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (5, 3) (5, 1) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 9) (14, 8) (14, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 13) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 9) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree of connections in ascending order. The sorted vertices are:

Sorted vertices: 
2, 5, 14, 7, 5, 9, 1, 10, 0, 8, 12, 6, 13, 3, 11

Using this ordering, we can count the number of triangles formed in the graph. 

Triangles:

<0, 1, 13>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 8, 10>
<3, 4, 11>
<3, 5, 1>
<6, 10, 12>
<6, 10, 13>
<6, 11, 12>
<6, 11, 13>
<7, 4, 12>
<8, 0, 13>
<8, 1, 14>
<9, 1, 13>
<10, 12, 13>

[Total number of triangles: 15]
