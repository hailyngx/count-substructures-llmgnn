Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 14) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 0) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 2) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 9) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree, from least connected to most connected:

Nodes:  
0: Degree 3  
1: Degree 3  
2: Degree 4  
5: Degree 4  
6: Degree 4  
12: Degree 4  
13: Degree 4  
4: Degree 5  
7: Degree 5  
10: Degree 5  
11: Degree 5  
3: Degree 6  
8: Degree 3  
14: Degree 5  
9: Degree 4
