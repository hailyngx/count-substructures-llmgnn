Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: 5, 9, 7, 1, 3, 6
- 1: 9, 3, 0, 8
- 2: 5, 6, 8
- 3: 4, 7, 1, 0
- 4: 5, 9, 6, 3
- 5: 6, 2, 8, 4, 0
- 6: 5, 4, 2, 0
- 7: 0, 3
- 8: 9, 1, 2, 5
- 9: 8, 4, 1, 0

Next, let's sort the nodes by their number of connections (degree):

Nodes: 7, 2, 1, 8, 9, 3, 6, 4, 0, 5

Now, we will count the triangles formed in the graph:

- Starting from the edges with the lowest degree nodes, we find the triangles: 
  - Triangles with node 7: None
  - Triangles with node 2: None
  - Triangles with node 1: None
  - Triangles with node 8: <1, 0, 8>
  - Triangles with node 9: <4, 0, 9>
  - Triangles with node 3: <1, 0, 3>
  - Triangles with node 6: <5, 0, 6>, <6, 2, 5>, <4, 6, 5>, <4, 6, 0>
  - Triangles with node 4: <4, 9, 0>, <4, 6, 5>, <3, 4, 0>
  - Triangles with node 0: <5, 0, 6>, <6, 2, 5>, <5, 0, 4>, <3, 0, 7>, <3, 0, 1>
  - Triangles with node 5: <5, 0, 6>, <4, 5, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
