Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 8),
(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 8),
(2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 9),
(3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 0),
(4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 7),
(5, 2), (5, 9),
(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 7),
(7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8),
(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 9), (8, 7),
(9, 2), (9, 5), (9, 8)

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:
Nodes with degree 2: 0, 1, 5, 9
Nodes with degree 3: 4, 8
Nodes with degree 4: 6
Nodes with degree 5: 3, 7
Nodes with degree 6: 2

We will now find the triangles:

Triangles found:
<0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 3>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 7>, 
<1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 3>, 
<2, 3, 7>, <2, 7, 8>, 
<3, 6, 4>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 1>, <3, 7, 4>, 
<4, 7, 6>, 
<6, 7, 8>
