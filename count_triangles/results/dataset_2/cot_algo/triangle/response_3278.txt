This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 8) (9, 11) (26, 9) (26, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (22, 8) (23, 21) (23, 6) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 2) (17, 1) (17, 24) (15, 25) (15, 12) (15, 28) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 28) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 21) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 1) (12, 15) (12, 7) (12, 19) (13, 26) (13, 0) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 16) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 3) (8, 9) (8, 22) (8, 20) (8, 21) (16, 1) (16, 28) (16, 27) (28, 15) (28, 20) (28, 16) (28, 2) (19, 12) (19, 3) (19, 27) (4, 21) (27, 10) (27, 16) (27, 19) (27, 24) (29, 7) (29, 6) (29, 24) (11, 9) (11, 18) (6, 23) (6, 29) (6, 25) (6, 2) (24, 17) (24, 27) (24, 29) (24, 21) (3, 5) (3, 20) (3, 18) (3, 19) (25, 15) (25, 6) (25, 2) (2, 10) (2, 28) (2, 6) (2, 25) (21, 23) (21, 14) (21, 8) (21, 4) (21, 24) 

Response:
Let's first construct a graph with the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
- Node 0: 14, 7, 13
- Node 1: 17, 7, 16
- Node 2: 10, 28, 6, 25
- Node 3: 5, 20, 18, 19
- Node 4: 21
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 23, 29, 25, 2
- Node 7: 5, 0, 12, 29, 1
- Node 8: 9, 22, 20, 21
- Node 9: 26, 8, 11
- Node 10: 18, 27, 2
- Node 11: 9, 18
- Node 12: 15, 7, 19
- Node 13: 26, 0
- Node 14: 21, 0
- Node 15: 25, 12, 28
- Node 16: 1, 28, 27
- Node 17: 1, 24
- Node 18: 10, 11, 3
- Node 19: 12, 3, 27
- Node 20: 3, 8, 28
- Node 21: 23, 14, 8, 4, 24
- Node 22: 8
- Node 23: 21, 6
- Node 24: 17, 27, 29, 21
- Node 25: 15, 6, 2
- Node 26: 9, 13
- Node 27: 10, 16, 19, 24
- Node 28: 15, 20, 16, 2
- Node 29: 7, 6, 24

Next, we will list the nodes based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Least connections:
4, 22, 10, 11, 26, 5, 23, 14, 15, 9, 3, 19, 16, 18, 20, 24, 25, 6, 2, 27, 28, 13, 0, 1, 7, 21, 17, 29, 12, 8

And now let's count the number of triangles: [120]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 28>
<0, 3, 20>
<0, 7, 12>
<0, 7, 14>
<1, 7, 12>
<1, 7, 16>
<2, 6, 25>
<3, 18, 10>
<3, 18, 19>
<3, 18, 20>
<3, 19, 12>
<3, 19, 27>
<4, 21, 24>
<6, 23, 21>
<6, 23, 29>
<6, 25, 15>
<7, 12, 15>
<7, 12, 19>
<7, 12, 29>
<7, 14, 21>
<7, 24, 21>
<10, 18, 11>
<16, 1, 28>
<16, 1, 7>
<16, 27, 24>
<18, 10, 27>
<20, 8, 21>
<21, 8, 22>
