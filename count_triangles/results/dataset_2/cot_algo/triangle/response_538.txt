Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (2, 9) (2, 11) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to efficiently count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Calculate the degree of each node:
   - Node 0: degree 4
   - Node 1: degree 4
   - Node 2: degree 2
   - Node 3: degree 3
   - Node 4: degree 5
   - Node 5: degree 4
   - Node 6: degree 6
   - Node 7: degree 3
   - Node 8: degree 5
   - Node 9: degree 4
   - Node 10: degree 5
   - Node 11: degree 5
   - Node 12: degree 4
   - Node 13: degree 4
   - Node 14: degree 5

2. Sort the nodes by their degrees in ascending order:
   - Node 2, Node 7, Node 3, Node 13, Node 5, Node 9, Node 0, Node 1, Node 12, Node 4, Node 13, Node 14, Node 10, Node 11, Node 8

3. Label the nodes accordingly:
   - Node 2: 0
   - Node 7: 1
   - Node 3: 2
   - Node 13: 3
   - Node 5: 4
   - Node 9: 5
   - Node 0: 6
   - Node 1: 7
   - Node 12: 8
   - Node 4: 9
   - Node 13: 10
   - Node 14: 11
   - Node 10: 12
   - Node 11: 13
   - Node 8: 14

4. Count the triangles formed by shared connections between vertices:
   - Total number of triangles: [10]
   
5. Unique triangles found:
   - <0, 4, 5>
   - <0, 6, 7>
   - <0, 1, 6>
   - <6, 7, 1>
   - <6, 8, 12>
   - <6, 12, 3>
   - <6, 12, 10>
   - <4, 9, 10>
   - <4, 9, 14>
   - <4, 14, 11>
