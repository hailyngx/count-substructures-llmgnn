Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 11) (4, 2) (4, 16) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 6) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 6) (17, 13) (7, 3) (7, 16) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 19) (9, 3) (9, 18) (9, 13) (9, 0) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 15) (5, 8) (5, 18) (0, 9) (0, 15) (0, 19) (15, 11) (15, 0) (15, 6) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 6) (6, 18) (6, 13) (6, 15) (6, 12) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 19) (14, 1) (14, 19) (19, 16) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph.

Let's assign labels to the vertices based on their degrees:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 4
- Node 10 has degree 3
- Node 11 has degree 3
- Node 12 has degree 3
- Node 13 has degree 5
- Node 14 has degree 2
- Node 15 has degree 3
- Node 16 has degree 4
- Node 17 has degree 1
- Node 18 has degree 4
- Node 19 has degree 4

Based on the degrees, the labels assigned to each node are as follows:
- Node 17 labeled as 0
- Node 1 labeled as 1
- Node 14 labeled as 2
- Node 7 labeled as 3
- Node 4 labeled as 4
- Node 5 labeled as 5
- Node 12 labeled as 6
- Node 3 labeled as 7
- Node 8 labeled as 8
- Node 13 labeled as 9
- Node 10 labeled as 10
- Node 11 labeled as 11
- Node 15 labeled as 12
- Node 0 labeled as 13
- Node 6 labeled as 14
- Node 2 labeled as 15
- Node 16 labeled as 16
- Node 18 labeled as 17
- Node 9 labeled as 18
- Node 19 labeled as 19

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [24]

Unique triangles:
