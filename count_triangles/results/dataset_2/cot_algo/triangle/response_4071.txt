Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree. Let's find the degrees of each node first:

- Node 0: degree 6
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 4

Let's relabel the nodes based on their degree:

- Node 0 (degree 6) -> Node A
- Node 1 (degree 4) -> Node B
- Node 2 (degree 4) -> Node C
- Node 3 (degree 4) -> Node D
- Node 4 (degree 4) -> Node E
- Node 5 (degree 3) -> Node F
- Node 6 (degree 5) -> Node G
- Node 7 (degree 2) -> Node H
- Node 8 (degree 5) -> Node I
- Node 9 (degree 4) -> Node J

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

1. (5, 2) (Skip as Node C has fewer connections)
2. (5, 1) (Skip as Node B has fewer connections)
3. (5, 4) (Skip as Node E has fewer connections)
