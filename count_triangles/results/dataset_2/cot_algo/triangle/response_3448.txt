Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (10, 17) (10, 7) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 13) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 13) (12, 14) (4, 2) (18, 7) (18, 16) (18, 8) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 15) (19, 5) (8, 18) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 6) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 6) (0, 2) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 15) (15, 5) (15, 16) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 2) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 

Edges: 
(1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (10, 17) (10, 7) 
(17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 13) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 13) (12, 14) (4, 2) 
(18, 7) (18, 16) (18, 8) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 15) (19, 5) 
(8, 18) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 17) (13, 7)
(13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 6) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 6) (0, 2) (16, 18) 
(16, 0) (16, 15) (15, 5) (15, 16) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) 
(2, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) 
(6, 0) (6, 2)

By sorting nodes using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the new labels are:
Nodes: 9, 13, 0, 2, 6, 1, 3, 7, 8, 5, 11, 17, 4, 10, 18, 12, 16, 14, 15, 19

Now, let's find the number of triangles and list the unique triangles:
Total number of triangles: [7]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 2>
<2, 6, 9>
<5, 11, 13>
<13, 11, 6>
