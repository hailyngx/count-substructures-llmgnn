Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (4, 7), (4, 3), (4, 2), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 9), (1, 0), (9, 0), (5, 0)
- 1: (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 0), (6, 1)
- 2: (4, 2), (1, 2), (5, 2), (2, 4), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 8)
- 3: (4, 3), (7, 3), (1, 3), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 8)
- 4: (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 3), (2, 4), (0, 4)
- 5: (3, 5), (6, 5), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 0)
- 6: (7, 6), (1, 6), (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 9), (6, 5), (9, 6)
- 7: (4, 7), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 9), (9, 7)
- 8: (3, 8), (9, 8), (2, 8), (8, 3), (8, 9), (8, 2)
- 9: (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 0), (0, 9)

Now, we will apply Degree-Based Ordering to count the number of triangles:

Node degrees:
0: 5
1: 4
2: 4
3: 7
4: 4
5: 5
6: 5
7: 5
8: 4
9: 5

Sorted vertices by degree:
1, 2, 8, 4, 0, 5, 6, 9, 7, 3

Now, counting triangles using the sorted vertices:

Triangles:
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 6, 5>
<1, 6, 4>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 8, 3>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 0, 7>
<4, 2, 8>
<5, 0, 3>
<5, 0, 4>
<5, 0, 6>
<5, 2, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 3, 9>
<9, 8, 3>

Total number of triangles: [16]
