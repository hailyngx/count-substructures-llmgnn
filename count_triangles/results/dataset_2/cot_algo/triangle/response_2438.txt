Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 1) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 13) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 17) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 2) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (5, 15) (5, 3) (19, 4) (15, 17) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 8) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 2) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (9, 0) (9, 15) (9, 3) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (10, 3) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 16) (13, 10) (2, 14) (2, 16) (8, 7) (8, 15) (8, 6) (11, 17) (11, 6) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows:
0 (degree: 2), 2 (degree: 2), 5 (degree: 2), 10 (degree: 2), 12 (degree: 2), 19 (degree: 2), 7 (degree: 3), 4 (degree: 3), 13 (degree: 3), 18 (degree: 4), 1 (degree: 4), 9 (degree: 4), 6 (degree: 4), 3 (degree: 5), 11 (degree: 5), 14 (degree: 5), 8 (degree: 5), 17 (degree: 5), 15 (degree: 6), 16 (degree: 6).

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles in the graph.
There are 16 triangles in the graph. 

Result: [16]
Unique triangles: <7, 12, 1>, <7, 1, 17>, <7, 8, 15>, <12, 7, 1>, <4, 13, 16>, <4, 13, 10>, <18, 4, 13>, <0, 14, 2>, <0, 14, 18>, <14, 2, 16>, <1, 12, 7>, <1, 17, 16>, <1, 17, 15>, <17, 16, 15>, <17, 16, 2>, <3, 9, 15>.
