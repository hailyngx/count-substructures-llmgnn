Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 28) (13, 9) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 13) (9, 6) (12, 19) (27, 10) (27, 26) (5, 22) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 28) (26, 13) (26, 27) (26, 14) (26, 16) (26, 7) (21, 0) (21, 14) (17, 20) (20, 17) (20, 2) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 20) (2, 25) (3, 14) (3, 8) (28, 13) (28, 5) (28, 8) (28, 18) (14, 26) (14, 21) (14, 3) (19, 22) (19, 12) (19, 11) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 28) (8, 10) (11, 19) (24, 23) (24, 15) (7, 26) (7, 29) (7, 15) (7, 1) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 23) (29, 10) (18, 28) (18, 0) (23, 24) (23, 29) (23, 16) (4, 5) (4, 1) (0, 21) (0, 18) (0, 1) (15, 24) (15, 7) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 16) (16, 26) (16, 29) (16, 23) (16, 1) (16, 25) (10, 27) (10, 8) (10, 29) (10, 25) (25, 2) (25, 16) (25, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. 

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we can relabel them as follows:
Vertex 0 has degree 3
Vertex 1 has degree 5
Vertex 2 has degree 4
Vertex 3 has degree 2
Vertex 4 has degree 2
Vertex 5 has degree 5
Vertex 6 has degree 3
Vertex 7 has degree 4
Vertex 8 has degree 4
Vertex 9 has degree 3
Vertex 10 has degree 4
Vertex 11 has degree 2
Vertex 12 has degree 1
Vertex 13 has degree 4
Vertex 14 has degree 4
Vertex 15 has degree 2
Vertex 16 has degree 5
Vertex 17 has degree 2
Vertex 18 has degree 2
Vertex 19 has degree 3
Vertex 20 has degree 3
Vertex 21 has degree 2
Vertex 22 has degree 4
Vertex 23 has degree 3
Vertex 24 has degree 2
Vertex 25 has degree 3
Vertex 26 has degree 5
Vertex 27 has degree 2
Vertex 28 has degree 4
Vertex 29 has degree 4

Now, we can count the triangles by checking the shared connections for each edge. 

The total number of triangles is [20] and the unique triangles found are:
<1, 4, 16>
<1, 7, 16>
<1, 16, 25>
<1, 16, 29>
<2, 5, 22>
<2, 5, 28>
<2, 20, 25>
<2, 22, 5>
<4, 5, 28>
<6, 5, 28>
<7, 1, 16>
<8, 10, 25>
<8, 28, 18>
<10, 25, 16>
<13, 9, 6>
<13, 26, 27>
<14, 3, 8>
<14, 21, 0>
<16, 1, 7>
<16, 23, 29>
