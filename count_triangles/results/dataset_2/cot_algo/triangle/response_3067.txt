Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are:

0: degree 5 (connected to nodes 9, 6, 1, 3, 0)
2: degree 3 (connected to nodes 9, 4, 8)
5: degree 4 (connected to nodes 9, 1, 4, 7)
7: degree 3 (connected to nodes 5, 3, 4)
6:  degree 3 (connected to nodes 9, 3, 4)
1: degree 3 (connected to nodes 5, 4, 0)
3: degree 5 (connected to nodes 9, 6, 7, 0, 4)
4: degree 7 (connected to nodes 5, 6, 1, 3, 7, 2)
8: degree 3 (connected to nodes 9, 6, 2)
9: degree 5 (connected to nodes 5, 8, 2, 3, 0)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles by examining each edge while considering the label order and shared connections:

Total number of triangles: [11]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 5, 7>
