Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 0) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9
- 1: 0, 8
- 2: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8
- 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8
- 4: 2, 3, 6
- 5: 0, 3, 8
- 6: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- 7: 6, 9
- 8: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
- 9: 0, 6, 7, 8

Now, we will sort the nodes by their degree:

1. Node 1: degree = 2
2. Node 4: degree = 3
3. Node 7: degree = 2
4. Node 5: degree = 3
5. Node 0: degree = 5
6. Node 9: degree = 4
7. Node 8: degree = 6
8. Node 3: degree = 5
9. Node 2: degree = 5
10. Node 6: degree = 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

1. Edge (1, 0): Node 1 (degree 2) < Node 0 (degree 5), shared connections: none
2. Edge (4, 2): Node 4 (degree 3) < Node 2 (degree 5), shared connections: 3
    - Triangle: <2, 4, 3>
3. Edge (7, 6): Node 7 (degree 2) < Node 6 (degree 5), shared connections: none
4. Edge (5, 8): Node 5 (degree 3) < Node 8 (degree 6), shared connections: 3
    - Triangle: <5, 8, 3>
5. Edge (0, 9): Node 0 (degree 5) < Node 9 (degree 4), shared connections: 3
    - Triangle: <0, 9, 6>

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles:
- <2, 4, 3>
- <5, 8, 3>
- <0, 9, 6>
