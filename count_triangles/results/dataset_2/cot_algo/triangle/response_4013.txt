Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (4, 15) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 18) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 5) (13, 16) (13, 14) (17, 18) (19, 9) (19, 18) (0, 6) (0, 16) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 5) (18, 8) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 14) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 12) (12, 15) (12, 11) (12, 2) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 5) (5, 10) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections (degrees) are:  
0 (degree 2)  
3 (degree 2)  
13 (degree 2)  
17 (degree 2)  
18 (degree 3)  
19 (degree 3)  
8 (degree 3)  
4 (degree 3)  
12 (degree 3)  
6 (degree 4)  
7 (degree 4)  
16 (degree 4)  
10 (degree 4)  
1 (degree 5)  
11 (degree 5)  
14 (degree 5)  
5 (degree 5)  
9 (degree 5)  
15 (degree 6)  
2 (degree 6)  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [18]

Unique triangles:
