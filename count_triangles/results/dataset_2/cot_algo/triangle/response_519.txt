Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 14) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 12) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 12) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 10) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we have the following labels:

0: 3 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 3 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 3 connections
8: 3 connections
10: 4 connections
11: 4 connections
12: 4 connections
13: 6 connections
14: 5 connections
7: 3 connections
9: 4 connections
3: 4 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting triangles by focusing on edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles is: [23]

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 9, 13>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 8, 14>
<3, 4, 13>
<0, 5, 14>
<1, 3, 13>
<1, 5, 14>
<3, 10, 13>
<1, 3, 4>
<4, 7, 13>
<1, 5, 13>
<2, 9, 13>
<1, 8, 14>
<2, 10, 13>
<4, 11, 12>
<3, 13, 14>
<7, 10, 13>
<0, 4, 7>
<5, 13, 14>
<1, 3, 13>
<1, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 10>
