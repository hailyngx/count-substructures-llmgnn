Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degrees in ascending order. The degrees of each node are as follows:  

Node 0: 4  
Node 1: 5  
Node 2: 4  
Node 3: 5  
Node 4: 7  
Node 5: 3  
Node 6: 4  
Node 7: 4  
Node 8: 3  
Node 9: 4  
Node 10: 3  
Node 11: 4  
Node 12: 4  
Node 13: 6  
Node 14: 3  

Now, we will proceed to count the number of triangles:

1. Checking the edges with nodes with lower degrees first, we find that node 0, with a degree of 4, has edges with nodes 12, 2, 14, and 6. Only the edge between nodes 2 and 6 forms a triangle: <0, 2, 6>.

2. Moving to the next edge, we look at node 3 (degree 5) connected to nodes 7, 1, 12, 6, and 13. The edges with nodes 12 and 6 do not form triangles with node 3.

3. We continue this process for all edges but do not find any further triangles, resulting in a total of [1] triangle in the given graph.

The unique triangle found is <0, 2, 6>.
