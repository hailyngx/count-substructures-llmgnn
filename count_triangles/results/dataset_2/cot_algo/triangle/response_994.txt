Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 11) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 7) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 7) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 12) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 13) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 7) (14, 9) (14, 3) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 1) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 10) 

Response:
The graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
    0 --- 6 --- 9 --- 14
    |     |     |     |
    |     |     |     |
    13 --- 5 --- 1 --- 12
    |           |     |
    |           |     |
    2 --- 8 --- 4 --- 11
    |           |
    |           |
    7 --------- 10 --- 3
```

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, relabeling the nodes from vertices with the least connections to the most connections, we get:
Node 4 (Degree 3) -> Node 2 (Degree 3) -> Node 7 (Degree 3) -> Node 11 (Degree 3) -> Node 13 (Degree 4) -> Node 0 (Degree 4) -> Node 3 (Degree 4) -> Node 6 (Degree 4) -> Node 10 (Degree 4) -> Node 12 (Degree 5) -> Node 14 (Degree 5) -> Node 8 (Degree 5) -> Node 1 (Degree 6) -> Node 5 (Degree 6) -> Node 9 (Degree 6)

Using the above ordering, we can count the triangles:
- For the edge (5, 9), we find the shared connections: 1
- For the edge (5, 13), we find the shared connections: 1
- For the edge (5, 8), we find the shared connections: 1
- For the edge (5, 1), we find the shared connections: 1
- For the edge (5, 4), we find the shared connections: 1, 8
- For the edge (9, 6), we find the shared connections: 1
- For the edge (9, 4), we find the shared connections: 1
- For the edge (6, 9), we find the shared connections: 1
- For the edge (6, 1), we find the shared connections: 6
- For the edge (4, 5), we find the shared connections: 9
- For the edge (4, 9), we find the shared connections: 1
- For the edge (4, 8), we find the shared connections: 5
- For the edge (4, 0), we find the shared connections: 6
- For the edge (8, 5), we find the shared connections: 1
- For the edge (8, 4), we find the shared connections: 5
- For the edge (8, 2), we find the shared connections: 5
- For the edge (8, 10), we find the shared connections: 4

- For the edge (2, 13), we find the shared connections: 5, 7
- For the edge (2, 7), we find the shared connections: 10
- For the edge (13, 5), we find the shared connections: 1
- For the edge (13, 2), we find the shared connections: 5, 7
- For the edge (13, 0), we find the shared connections: 6
- For the edge (3, 4), we find the shared connections: 8, 11
- For the edge (3, 14), we find the shared connections: 9
- For the edge (11, 4), we find the shared connections: 8
- For the edge (1, 5), we find the shared connections: 9
- For the edge (1, 6), we find the shared connections: 6
- For the edge (1, 8), we find the shared connections: 5
- For the edge (1, 2), we find the shared connections: 6
- For the edge (1, 12), we find the shared connections: 7
- For the edge (7, 2), we find the shared connections: 10
- For the edge (7, 13), we find the shared connections: 2
- For the edge (7, 10), we find the shared connections: 3

Calculating the total number of triangles using the shared connections found above, we find there are [15] triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <2, 7, 13>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 5, 9>, <4, 8, 5>, <4, 9, 1>, <4, 9, 6>, <4, 11, 3>, <8, 2, 5>, <10, 7, 3>, <12, 1, 6>, <12, 6, 9>, <12, 1, 5>, <13, 5, 1>, <13, 7, 2>.
