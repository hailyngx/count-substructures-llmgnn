Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) 

Response:
The vertices in the graph with the number of their connections (degrees) are as follows:
- Vertex 0: degree 5
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 2: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 4
- Vertex 5: degree 5
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 5
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices are:
1. Vertex 1
2. Vertex 2
3. Vertex 3
4. Vertex 8
5. Vertex 9
6. Vertex 4
7. Vertex 6
8. Vertex 0
9. Vertex 5
10. Vertex 7

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle <0, 5, 1>
- Triangle <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle <0, 5, 4>
- Triangle <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle <0, 6, 5>
- Triangle <0, 6, 1>
- Triangle <0, 6, 2>
- Triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle <0, 7, 9>
- Triangle <1, 5, 6>
- Triangle <3, 9, 7>
- Triangle <3, 9, 0>
- Triangle <3, 4, 7>

There are 14 triangles in total, which can be represented as [14].
