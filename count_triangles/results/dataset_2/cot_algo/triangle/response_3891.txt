Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 23) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 28) (9, 24) (20, 25) (20, 13) (25, 20) (25, 26) (25, 15) (25, 11) (28, 9) (28, 29) (28, 4) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 13) (4, 28) (4, 18) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 27) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 10) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 7) (22, 21) (1, 2) (17, 5) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 15) (3, 21) (3, 23) (11, 25) (11, 26) (11, 21) (11, 12) (21, 22) (21, 3) (21, 11) (26, 25) (26, 11) (26, 2) (26, 16) (10, 14) (10, 23) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 26) (2, 27) (2, 15) (7, 22) (7, 16) (7, 27) (16, 26) (16, 7) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 24) (24, 9) (24, 6) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 3) (23, 10) (13, 20) (13, 29) (13, 15) (12, 11) (8, 15) (19, 29) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 17) (27, 18) (27, 2) (27, 7) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 8) 

Response:
The vertices with their corresponding degrees are as follows:
0: 3
1: 1
2: 6
3: 3
4: 3
5: 3
6: 2
7: 4
8: 1
9: 6
10: 3
11: 5
12: 1
13: 3
14: 3
15: 5
16: 3
17: 4
18: 4
19: 4
20: 2
21: 4
22: 4
23: 5
24: 2
25: 4
26: 4
27: 3
28: 3
29: 4

After sorting the vertices by degree and relabeling them accordingly, the new graph is as follows:
0: 1
1: 2
6: 3
8: 4
12: 5
20: 6
24: 7
5: 8
10: 9
13: 10
14: 11
17: 12
27: 13
2: 14
4: 15
19: 16
28: 17
29: 18
22: 19
26: 20
7: 21
3: 22
16: 23
15: 24
25: 25
18: 26
21: 27
9: 28
23: 29
11: 30

Now, we will count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering:
- Starting from the edge with vertices 0 and 14: No triangles.
- Moving on to the edge with vertices 0 and 19: No triangles.
- Continuing with the edge with vertices 0 and 1: No triangles.
- Analyzing the edge with vertices 1 and 2: No triangles.
- Examining the edge with vertices 1 and 26: No triangles.
- Checking the edge with vertices 1 and 27: No triangles.
- Observing the edge with vertices 6 and 24: Triangle <6, 7, 24> found.
- Moving on to the edge with vertices 8 and 15: No triangles.
- Analyzing the edge with vertices 8 and 13: No triangles.
- Continuing with the edge with vertices 12 and 11: No triangles.
- Analyzing the edge with vertices 12 and 21: No triangles.
- Moving on to the edge with vertices 12 and 24: Triangle <5, 7, 24> found.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <6, 7, 24>, <5, 7, 24>
