Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (2, 4) (2, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 7) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 7) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 10) (14, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most and relabeling them accordingly.

By counting the connections for each node, we have the following sorted list of vertices:
0(2), 1(2), 2(3), 4(4), 6(4), 10(4), 12(4), 13(4), 3(5), 7(5), 8(5), 11(5), 9(6), 5(7), 14(7).

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed by shared connections between the two vertices of each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

After counting, we find the total number of triangles inside brackets [] to be [20] and the unique triangles found inside <> as follows:
<0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 11>, <0, 5, 13>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 10>, <1, 4, 10>, <3, 5, 13>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 8, 12>, <4, 8, 11>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 10, 14>, <6, 7, 13>, <8, 9, 11>, <8, 9, 14>, <8, 11, 14>, <10, 13, 14>, <11, 13, 14>, <11, 14, 7>, <13, 6, 7>.
