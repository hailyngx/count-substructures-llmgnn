Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 18) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 15) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (14, 6) (14, 17) (14, 15) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 1) (4, 6) (4, 13) (18, 11) (18, 19) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 2) (1, 16) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 19) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 1) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 9) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 12) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (15, 16) (15, 14) (10, 6) (10, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by the number of connections in ascending order.
2. Label the vertices accordingly: 
   - Node 11 has 2 connections.
   - Node 16 has 4 connections.
   - Node 6 has 5 connections.
   - Nodes 9, 14, 17, 4, 18, 5, and 13 have 4 connections.
   - Nodes 7, 0, 3, 12 have 3 connections.
   - Node 1 has 4 connections.
   - Node 19 has 5 connections.
   - Nodes 2 and 10 have 4 connections.
   - Node 8 has 1 connection.
   - Nodes 15, 13 have 2 connections.

Now, let's look at the edges and count the triangles:

From the given edges, we can see the following triangles:
- <1, 2, 13>
- <1, 2, 14>
- <1, 16, 19>
- <2, 12, 13>
- <2, 12, 14>
- <3, 8, 12>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <4, 6, 13>
- <5, 6, 10>
- <5, 13, 19>
- <6, 9, 19>
- <7, 9, 16>
- <9, 12, 13>
- <10, 13, 19>
- <14, 15, 17>

After counting all the triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
