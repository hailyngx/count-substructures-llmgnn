Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 8) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 4) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 12) (27, 18) (27, 20) (27, 26) (2, 16) (2, 21) (29, 28) (29, 25) (29, 22) (18, 27) (18, 14) (22, 29) (22, 6) (22, 21) (10, 11) (10, 25) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 19) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (23, 8) (23, 24) (5, 24) (5, 21) (6, 22) (6, 17) (6, 26) (28, 29) (28, 9) (9, 28) (9, 14) (9, 20) (9, 7) (19, 8) (19, 12) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 9) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 12) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 0) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 3) (20, 27) (20, 9) (20, 3) (20, 26) (26, 27) (26, 6) (26, 20) (26, 12) (1, 13) (1, 25) (25, 29) (25, 10) (25, 1) (25, 0) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 25) (0, 24) (0, 4) (24, 23) (24, 5) (24, 0) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 0) (21, 2) (21, 22) (21, 5) (12, 15) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 26) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}
Edges: [(11, 10), (11, 8), (16, 7), (16, 2), (16, 4), (15, 7), (15, 0), (15, 12), (27, 18), (27, 20), (27, 26), (2, 16), (2, 21), (29, 28), (29, 25), (29, 22), (18, 27), (18, 14), (22, 29), (22, 6), (22, 21), (10, 11), (10, 25), (8, 11), (8, 13), (8, 23), (8, 19), (13, 8), (13, 4), (13, 1), (23, 8), (23, 24), (5, 24), (5, 21), (6, 22), (6, 17), (6, 26), (28, 29), (28, 9), (9, 28), (9, 14), (9, 20), (9, 7), (19, 8), (19, 12), (7, 16), (7, 15), (7, 9), (3, 17), (3, 14), (3, 20), (3, 12), (17, 6), (17, 3), (17, 0), (14, 18), (14, 9), (14, 3), (20, 27), (20, 9), (20, 3), (20, 26), (26, 27), (26, 6), (26, 20), (26, 12), (1, 13), (1, 25), (25, 29), (25, 10), (25, 1), (25, 0), (0, 15), (0, 17), (0, 25), (0, 24), (0, 4), (24, 23), (24, 5), (24, 0), (4, 16), (4, 13), (4, 0), (21, 2), (21, 22), (21, 5), (12, 15), (12, 19), (12, 3), (12, 26)]

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
