Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 16) (6, 14) (6, 13) (9, 16) (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 1) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 16) (10, 14) (11, 10) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 8) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 1) (8, 15) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 16) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 19) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 12) (17, 13) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 12) (12, 1) (12, 17) (0, 10) (0, 17) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 8) (19, 13) (19, 14) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections, from least to most. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly. Here is the ordered list of vertices with their connections:

Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 11: 2 connections
Vertex 18: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 12: 3 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 19: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 13: 4 connections
Vertex 17: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 16: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 6 connections
Vertex 10: 6 connections
Vertex 15: 8 connections
Vertex 14: 8 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method on the given edges, we consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Then, we check for shared connections between the two vertices of the edge to find triangles.

After analyzing the given graph, we find that the total number of triangles is [28].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 17>, <0, 10, 14>, <0, 10, 16>, <0, 12, 17>, <0, 17, 1>, <0, 17, 12>, <1, 5, 17>, <1, 7, 17>, <1, 12, 17>, <4, 7, 14>, <4, 7, 18>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 14, 19>, <7, 10, 14>, <7, 10, 15>, <7, 14, 19>, <7, 14, 6>, <8, 15, 16>, <8, 15, 7>, <8, 16, 15>, <8, 16, 9>, <8, 16, 10>, <15, 10, 16>, <15, 10, 7>, <15, 16, 8>, <15, 16, 9>
