Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph and count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 8), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 0), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 7), (3, 4), (4, 5), (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 7)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes sorted by degree: [3, 0, 2, 5, 4, 7, 8, 1, 9, 6]

Next, we will count the triangles formed by the listed edges:

Triangles:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
