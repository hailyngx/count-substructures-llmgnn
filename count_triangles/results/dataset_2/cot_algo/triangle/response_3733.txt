Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The triangles found in the graph are: 
<0, 3, 20>
<0, 18, 20>
<0, 18, 15>
<3, 12, 16>
<3, 12, 8>
<3, 12, 25>
<3, 0, 18>
<4, 5, 10>
<4, 5, 27>
<4, 22, 0>
<4, 26, 28>
<4, 27, 7>
<5, 6, 2>
<5, 6, 23>
<5, 10, 27>
<6, 2, 10>
<6, 2, 23>
<15, 21, 1>
<15, 18, 13>
<16, 12, 25>
<16, 1, 24>
<16, 1, 13>
<17, 23, 19>
<18, 15, 21>
<18, 15, 19>
<18, 13, 7>
<19, 11, 15>
<27, 10, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [28].
