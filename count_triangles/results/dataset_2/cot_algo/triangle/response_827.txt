Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 12) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (12, 7) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 0) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 3) 

Response:
The nodes can be relabeled based on their degree in ascending order as follows:
Node 1 - Degree: 2
Node 2 - Degree: 2
Node 0 - Degree: 4
Node 5 - Degree: 3
Node 10 - Degree: 3
Node 11 - Degree: 3
Node 12 - Degree: 2
Node 3 - Degree: 4
Node 13 - Degree: 4
Node 8 - Degree: 3
Node 4 - Degree: 4
Node 14 - Degree: 4
Node 7 - Degree: 4
Node 6 - Degree: 5
Node 9 - Degree: 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
Shared connections between the vertices:

Node 6 and Node 1: (6, 1), (6, 14), (6, 7), (6, 4), (9, 1), (4, 6), (1, 9), (1, 10)
Node 6 and Node 14: (6, 14), (6, 7), (6, 4), (7, 14), (4, 14), (1, 14), (14, 7), (14, 3)
Node 6 and Node 7: (6, 7), (6, 4), (7, 14), (7, 4), (7, 12), (4, 7), (14, 7), (7, 2)
Node 6 and Node 4: (6, 4), (4, 7), (4, 5), (4, 14), (7, 4), (4, 6), (4, 14), (5, 4)
Node 9 and Node 1: (9, 1), (9, 13), (9, 8), (9, 6), (1, 6), (1, 10), (1, 3), (1, 14)

Triangles found:
<6, 9, 1>, <6, 1, 14>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 1, 4>, <6, 14, 7>, <6, 14, 4>, <6, 7, 4>
