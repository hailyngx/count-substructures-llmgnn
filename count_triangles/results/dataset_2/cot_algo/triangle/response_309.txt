Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 6) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 2) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
The graph is represented below:

Vertices:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6)
(7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1)
(1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 12)
(3, 2) (3, 0)
(8, 5) (8, 14)
(13, 2) (13, 6)
(10, 11) (10, 0)
(5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 14)
(6, 13) (6, 2)
(12, 14)
(11, 9)
(2, 14)

Next, we will apply Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles. 

After sorting the vertices by their degrees in increasing order:
0(4), 2(4), 8(4), 9(4), 3(5), 5(5), 12(5), 13(5), 6(5), 10(5), 14(6), 11(6), 1(6), 7(6), 4(6)

Triangles: 
<1, 3, 0>, <1, 9, 0>, <6, 13, 2>, <5, 8, 14>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
