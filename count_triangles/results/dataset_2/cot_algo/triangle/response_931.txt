Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 5
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 5
- Node 5 has degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 5

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 3 (degree 2) will be labeled as node 1
- Node 7 (degree 3) will be labeled as node 2
- Node 8 (degree 3) will be labeled as node 3
- Node 0 (degree 4) will be labeled as node 4
- Node 2 (degree 4) will be labeled as node 5
- Node 6 (degree 4) will be labeled as node 6
- Node 5 (degree 5) will be labeled as node 7
- Node 1 (degree 5) will be labeled as node 8
- Node 4 (degree 5) will be labeled as node 9
- Node 9 (degree 5) will be labeled as node 10

Now, we will restate the edges according to the new labels:
(4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (7, 10) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 6) (1, 8) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 3) (5, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
[Number of triangles: 2]

Triangles found:
<1, 2, 10>
<1, 2, 5>
