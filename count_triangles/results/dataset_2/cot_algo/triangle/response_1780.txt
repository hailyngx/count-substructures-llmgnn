Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 3) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 8) (17, 9) (17, 18) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 18) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 16) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 1) (16, 14) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (1, 19) (1, 2) (1, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 4) (15, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 18) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 4) (9, 10) (9, 17) (9, 16) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 6) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their respective connections:
- Node 0: 14, 19
- Node 1: 19, 2, 4
- Node 2: 5, 1, 6, 11
- Node 3: 13, 10, 16, 4
- Node 4: 1, 11, 3
- Node 5: 19, 2
- Node 6: 10, 2, 18
- Node 7: 12, 15, 14
- Node 8: 13, 11, 17
- Node 9: 10, 17, 16
- Node 10: 6, 3, 19, 9
- Node 11: 8, 2, 4
- Node 12: 7, 18
- Node 13: 8, 3
- Node 14: 7, 0, 16
- Node 15: 7
- Node 16: 14, 3, 18, 9
- Node 17: 8, 9, 18
- Node 18: 17, 12, 16, 6
- Node 19: 0, 10, 5, 1

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the nodes in ascending order of connections are:
Nodes with 0 connections: 15
Nodes with 1 connection: 0, 4, 5, 7, 12
Nodes with 2 connections: 13
Nodes with 3 connections: 1, 9, 15, 18
Nodes with 4 connections: 8, 16
Nodes with 5 connections: 6, 17
Nodes with 6 connections: 3, 11
Nodes with 7 connections: 2, 19
Nodes with 8 connections: 10

Based on the sorted nodes, the triangles in the graph are:
[Total number of triangles: 17]
<2, 11, 8>
<5, 19, 0>
<3, 16, 9>
<3, 16, 18>
