Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7)
- 1: (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0)
- 2: (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2)
- 3: (7, 5) (7, 3)
- 4: (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0)
- 5: (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8)
- 6: (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6)
- 7: (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0)
- 8: (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8)
- 9: (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6)

Now, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Nodes sorted by degree:
1. Node 4 (degree 3)
2. Node 7 (degree 2)
3. Node 8 (degree 4)
4. Node 3 (degree 4)
5. Node 6 (degree 3)
6. Node 2 (degree 4)
7. Node 0 (degree 5)
8. Node 1 (degree 4)
9. Node 5 (degree 5)
10. Node 9 (degree 6)

Next, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

[Total number of triangles: 16]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>
