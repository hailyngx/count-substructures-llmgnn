Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 0), (5, 7)
- 1: (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 7)
- 2: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 3), (4, 2)
- 3: (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 2), (7, 1)
- 4: (1, 9), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 0), (1, 8)
- 5: (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 1)
- 6: (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 1), (8, 6)
- 7: (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 0)
- 8: (0, 5), (0, 1), (0, 6)
- 9: (2, 4), (2, 7)

Next, let's sort the nodes by their number of connections from least to most:

Nodes in Degree-Based Order: 2, 0, 6, 3, 9, 8, 4, 1, 7, 5

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Start with node 2, which has 2 connections (edges with nodes 4 and 7).
- For node 2, no triangles can be formed.

- Next, move to node 0, which has 3 connections (edges with nodes 1, 5, and 6).
- For node 0, no triangles can be formed.

- Move to node 6, which has 4 connections (edges with nodes 0, 1, 5, and 8).
- For node 6, we find the triangle <0, 1, 6>.

- Move to node 3, which has 4 connections (edges with nodes 1, 4, 9, and 5).
- For node 3, we find the triangle <1, 4, 3>.

- Move to node 9, which has 4 connections (edges with nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8).
- For node 9, we find the triangle <1, 3, 9>.

- Move to node 8, which has 5 connections (edges with nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9).
- For node 8, we find the triangle <1, 4, 8>.

- Move to node 4, which has 5 connections (edges with nodes 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9).
- For node 4, we find the triangle <2, 4, 7>.

- Move to node 1, which has 6 connections (edges with nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9).
- For node 1, we find the triangle <0, 1, 9>.

- Move to node 7, which has 6 connections (edges with nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9).
- For node 7, we find the triangle <2, 7, 4>.

- Finally, move to node 5, which has 7 connections (edges with nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8).
- For node 5, we find the triangle <0, 5, 6> and <0, 5, 8>.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 6>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <2, 7, 4>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 8>.
