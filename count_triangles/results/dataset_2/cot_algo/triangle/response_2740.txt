Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0), (4, 8), (4, 6), (4, 3), (7, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (3, 7), (3, 2), (3, 8), (8, 0), (6, 2), (6, 0)}

By sorting nodes based on the number of connections:
Node degrees: {0: 4, 1: 3, 2: 4, 3: 5, 4: 4, 5: 4, 6: 3, 7: 1, 8: 4, 9: 5}
Sorted nodes: [7, 1, 6, 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 3, 9]

Triangles:
[5, 9]: {0, 2, 3, 8}
[5, 6]: {}
[5, 8]: {0, 4, 3}
[5, 4]: {8, 3, 0}
[9, 5]: {0, 2, 3, 8}
[9, 2]: {0, 1, 3}
[9, 3]: {0, 2, 1, 4}
[9, 1]: {2, 3, 8}
[9, 0]: {5, 2, 8, 4}
[4, 8]: {5, 0, 3}
[4, 6]: {}
[4, 3]: {8, 5, 0}
[7, 3]: {2}
[1, 3]: {9, 2}
[1, 2]: {9, 3}
[3, 7]: {}
[3, 2]: {1, 9}
[3, 8]: {5, 4, 0}
[8, 0]: {5, 4, 3}
[6, 2]: {9, 1}
[6, 0]: {9, 8, 4}

Total number of triangles: [11]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 3>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 8>
