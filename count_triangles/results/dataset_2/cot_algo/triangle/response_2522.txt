Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 25) (1, 16) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 13) (21, 19) (21, 8) (5, 9) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 17) (18, 20) (18, 13) (22, 6) (22, 25) (8, 21) (8, 15) (8, 27) (13, 21) (13, 18) (13, 24) (12, 27) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 11) (27, 8) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 20) (26, 28) (26, 25) (17, 9) (17, 12) (17, 28) (17, 24) (29, 20) (28, 26) (28, 17) (28, 19) (28, 2) (20, 18) (20, 27) (20, 29) (20, 16) (11, 12) (11, 23) (23, 11) (23, 3) (0, 16) (0, 3) (16, 1) (16, 21) (16, 20) (16, 0) (16, 10) (3, 23) (3, 0) (3, 6) (15, 5) (15, 8) (14, 19) (14, 2) (14, 10) (4, 9) (4, 24) (4, 6) (4, 2) (25, 1) (25, 22) (25, 26) (24, 13) (24, 27) (24, 17) (24, 4) (10, 16) (10, 14) (10, 2) (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 4) (19, 21) (19, 28) (19, 14) (2, 28) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 10) 

Response:

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles.

Total number of triangles: [44]
Unique triangles found: <0, 16, 21>, <2, 10, 16>, <4, 17, 24>, <4, 6, 12>, <4, 6, 22>, <4, 6, 3>, <4, 17, 28>, <4, 24, 27>, <6, 12, 27>, <8, 15, 21>, <10, 14, 19>, <10, 14, 2>, <12, 17, 24>, <12, 27, 20>, <13, 18, 21>, <14, 19, 21>, <14, 19, 28>, <15, 5, 8>, <16, 1, 21>, <16, 20, 21>, <16, 20, 27>, <17, 9, 4>, <17, 9, 5>, <17, 24, 27>, <17, 24, 4>, <17, 24, 28>, <20, 27, 8>, <20, 27, 12>, <20, 27, 24>, <20, 29, 27>, <20, 29, 16>, <22, 6, 4>, <23, 3, 0>, <24, 13, 21>, <24, 13, 18>, <24, 17, 9>, <25, 26, 28>, <25, 26, 22>, <26, 28, 19>, <28, 2, 14>, <28, 2, 4>, <28, 2, 10>
