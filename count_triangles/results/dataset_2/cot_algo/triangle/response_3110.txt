Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 5) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 12), (5, 1), (5, 7), (9, 11), (9, 14), (9, 1), (9, 0), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (7, 5), (7, 11), (7, 3), (7, 14), (7, 2), (10, 0), (10, 3), (10, 8), (10, 14), (11, 9), (11, 7), (11, 3), (11, 6), (8, 4), (8, 10), (8, 13), (8, 3), (13, 8), (13, 1), (13, 0), (13, 6), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 10), (3, 11), (3, 8), (3, 2), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 13), (1, 0), (6, 11), (6, 13), (2, 7), (2, 3), (2, 12), (2, 14), (12, 5), (12, 2), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 10), (0, 13), (0, 1), (14, 9), (14, 7), (14, 10), (14, 2)

Next, we will sort the nodes by their degrees from lowest to highest and relabel them accordingly:
Nodes by degree: 6(2), 13(4), 2(4), 12(4), 10(4), 5(4), 6(4), 4(4), 8(4), 0(5), 1(5), 9(5), 7(5), 11(5), 14(5)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Triangles: [80]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 10>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 10, 14>, <1, 4, 13>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 13, 9>, <1, 13, 5>, <1, 9, 5>, <4, 8, 10>, <4, 8, 13>, <4, 8, 3>, <4, 10, 3>, <4, 10, 8>, <4, 10, 13>, <4, 10, 0>, <4, 10, 1>, <4, 13, 9>, <4, 13, 6>, <4, 13, 1>, <4, 13, 0>, <4, 13, 8>, <4, 13, 10>, <4, 13, 7>, <4, 9, 0>, <4, 9, 1>, <4, 9, 13>, <4, 9, 14>, <4, 9, 6>, <4, 3, 2>, <4, 3, 7>, <4, 3, 11>, <4, 3, 10>, <4, 8, 0>, <4, 8, 1>, <4, 8, 3>, <4, 8, 10>, <4, 8, 13>, <4, 1, 13>, <4, 1, 0>, <4, 1, 9>, <4, 1, 5>, <4, 1, 13>, <4, 1, 8>, <8, 13, 6>, <8, 13, 10>, <8, 13, 7>, <8, 13, 3>, <8, 10, 6>, <8, 10, 13>, <8, 10, 0>, <8, 10, 4>, <8, 10, 3>, <13, 6, 11>, <13, 6, 4>, <13, 1, 5>, <13, 1, 0>, <13, 1, 9>, <13, 1, 4>, <13, 1, 8>, <13, 1, 7>, <13, 0, 9>, <13, 0, 4>, <13, 0, 10>, <13, 0, 1>, <13, 6, 4>, <13, 6, 11>, <13, 6, 8>, <13, 3, 2>, <13, 3, 7>, <13, 3, 11>, <13, 3, 8>, <13, 6, 11>, <13, 6, 8>, <13, 7, 11>, <13, 7, 3>, <10, 8, 3>, <10, 8, 4>, <10, 8, 13>, <10, 3, 2>, <10, 3, 7>, <10, 3, 11>, <10, 3, 8>, <10, 14, 2>, <5, 1, 4>, <5, 1, 0>, <5, 1, 13>, <5, 1, 9>, <5, 1, 7>, <5, 5, 12>, <5, 5, 7>, <5, 12, 2>, <5, 12, 2>, <1, 4, 13>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 13, 9>, <1, 13, 5>, <1, 13, 7>, <1, 13, 0>, <1, 1, 9>, <1, 6, 13>, <1, 7, 2>, <1, 7, 3>, <1, 9, 5>, <6, 13, 11>, <6, 13, 1>, <6, 13, 0>, <6, 13, 4>, <6, 6, 11>, <6, 6, 8>, <7, 2, 3>, <7, 2, 14>, <7, 5, 12>, <7, 5, 2>, <7, 11, 3>, <7, 11, 6>, <7, 11, 4>, <7, 14, 2>, <11, 6, 13>, <11, 6, 4>, <11, 6, 8>, <11, 11, 6>, <11, 11, 3>, <11, 11, 7>, <11, 11, 4>, <11, 3, 2>, <11, 3, 7>, <11, 3, 4>, <11, 3, 6>, <11, 3, 8>
