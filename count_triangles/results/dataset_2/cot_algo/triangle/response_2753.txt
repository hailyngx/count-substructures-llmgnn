Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 11) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them. The original vertex number is listed first, followed by its new label.

(1, 0), (4, 1), (7, 2), (5, 3), (8, 4), (11, 5), (2, 6), (6, 7), (10, 8), (9, 9), (13, 10), (0, 11), (12, 12), (14, 13), (3, 14)

Based on the new labels, we can see that edges with lower labeled vertices having fewer connections are: (1, 0), (4, 1), (13, 10), (5, 3), (8, 4), (11, 5), (2, 6), (6, 7), (10, 8), (9, 9), (0, 11), (12, 12), (14, 13), (3, 14)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles: <0, 3, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 9, 10>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 10, 13>

Total number of triangles: [5]
