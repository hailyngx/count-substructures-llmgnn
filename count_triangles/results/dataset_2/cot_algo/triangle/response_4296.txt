Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 9) (16, 19) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 17) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 0) (1, 8) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 8) (5, 16) (5, 7) (19, 11) (19, 16) (10, 18) (10, 15) (10, 2) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 12) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 14) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 13) (0, 18) (0, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 15) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 14) 

Response:
Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(11, 16), (11, 19), (11, 12), (16, 11), (16, 9), (16, 19), (16, 5), (4, 7), (4, 18), (4, 12), (4, 13), (4, 14), (7, 4), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 17), (18, 4), (18, 10), (18, 0), (1, 8), (17, 7), (17, 9), (17, 8), (5, 16), (5, 7), (19, 11), (19, 16), (10, 18), (10, 15), (10, 2), (15, 10), (15, 0), (15, 8), (15, 12), (13, 4), (13, 12), (13, 14), (12, 11), (12, 4), (12, 15), (12, 13), (0, 18), (0, 15), (3, 14), (3, 6), (8, 1), (8, 17), (8, 15), (14, 4), (14, 13), (14, 3), (14, 9), (2, 7), (2, 10), (2, 6), (6, 3), (6, 2), (9, 16), (9, 17), (9, 14)

After sorting the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes ordered by degree: 1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 2, 18, 0, 8, 15, 13, 7, 17, 19, 11, 9, 4, 12, 14, 16

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
1. Consider edge (11, 16):
    - Node 11 has degree 3 and Node 16 has degree 4. Skip this edge.
2. Consider edge (11, 19):
    - Node 11 has degree 3 and Node 19 has degree 4. Skip this edge.
3. Consider edge (11, 12):
    - Node 11 has degree 3 and Node 12 has degree 4. Skip this edge.
4. Consider edge (16, 11):
    - Node 11 has degree 3 and Node 16 has degree 4.
    - Shared connections between 11, 16: 19
    - Triangle formed: <11, 16, 19>
5. Consider edge (16, 9):
    - Node 16 has degree 4 and Node 9 has degree 3. Skip this edge.
6. Continue analyzing other edges...

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <11, 16, 19>
