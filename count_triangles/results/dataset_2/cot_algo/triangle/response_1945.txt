Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 10) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 0) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
Based on the provided edges, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 10), 
(9, 10), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 12), 
(4, 7), (4, 10),
(7, 11), (7, 14), 
(10, 11), 
(8, 13), 
(13, 12), (13, 2), 
(11, 14), (11, 0), 
(6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 0), 
(2, 14), 
(12, 14), 
(0, 1)

Next, we will assign labels to the nodes based on their degree:

Node 1 (degree 1): 1
Node 2 (degree 2): 13, 4
Node 3 (degree 3): 0, 12, 8
Node 4 (degree 4): 11, 10, 14, 7
Node 5 (degree 6): 5, 9, 6, 3, 2, 13

Now, let's count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles found:
<5, 9, 10>
<5, 3, 9>
<4, 7, 10>
<2, 6, 3>
<2, 6, 0>
<12, 13, 14>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
