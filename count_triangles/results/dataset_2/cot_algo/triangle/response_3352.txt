Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 12) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 2) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 4) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges. 

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(5, 12) (5, 7) (5, 14) 
(9, 6) (9, 12) 
(6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) 
(8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) 
(13, 12) 
(7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) 
(12, 10) (12, 1) 
(14, 11) (14, 4) 
(3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) 
(2, 1) 
(4, 1) 

Next, let's label the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
Vertices: 9, 5, 13, 2, 4, 0, 10, 8, 3, 7, 1, 12, 6, 11, 14

Now, let's count the triangles:
- (6, 3) (Vertex 6, Vertex 3)
    - Shared connections: 11
    - <6, 3, 11>
- (6, 3) (Vertex 6, Vertex 11)
    - Shared connections: 8
    - <6, 3, 8>
- (6, 0) (Vertex 6, Vertex 0)
    - Shared connections: 7
    - <6, 0, 7>
- (6, 8) (Vertex 6, Vertex 8)
    - Shared connections: 11
    - <6, 8, 11>
- (0, 7) (Vertex 0, Vertex 7)
    - Shared connections: 1
    - <0, 7, 1>
- (3, 4) (Vertex 3, Vertex 4)
    - Shared connections: - None (No triangle formed)

The total number of triangles is [5]. 
The unique triangles found are <6, 3, 11>, <6, 3, 8>, <6, 0, 7>, <6, 8, 11>, <0, 7, 1>.
