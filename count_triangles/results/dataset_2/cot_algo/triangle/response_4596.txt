Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 6) (26, 4) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 0) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 18) (23, 29) (23, 6) (12, 27) (12, 24) (27, 9) (27, 12) (27, 14) (27, 3) (27, 16) (0, 22) (0, 20) (0, 11) (0, 19) (20, 0) (20, 19) (28, 9) (28, 21) (28, 13) (29, 23) (29, 25) (29, 24) (21, 28) (21, 3) (21, 17) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 8) (17, 21) (17, 1) (17, 2) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 13) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 11) (6, 26) (6, 23) (6, 24) (6, 4) (24, 12) (24, 29) (24, 6) (24, 8) (24, 5) (25, 29) (25, 11) (19, 22) (19, 0) (19, 20) (19, 7) (5, 23) (5, 24) (5, 18) (18, 23) (18, 5) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (16, 27) (8, 1) (8, 24) (8, 14) (14, 27) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 8) (11, 0) (11, 15) (11, 25) (13, 28) (13, 3) (2, 17) (2, 7) (4, 26) (4, 15) (4, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort the nodes by degree in ascending order:
Node 2: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 16: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 18: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 20: degree 4
Node 29: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 13: degree 5
Node 17: degree 5
Node 21: degree 5
Node 25: degree 5
Node 12: degree 5
Node 15: degree 5
Node 19: degree 5
Node 24: degree 6
Node 26: degree 6
Node 27: degree 6
Node 28: degree 6
Node 6: degree 6
Node 0: degree 6
Node 22: degree 6
Node 11: degree 6
Node 9: degree 7
Node 14: degree 7

2. Relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 2 -> A
Node 7 -> B
Node 16 -> C
Node 8 -> D
Node 10 -> E
Node 18 -> F
Node 1 -> G
Node 5 -> H
Node 20 -> I
Node 29 -> J
Node 3 -> K
Node 13 -> L
Node 17 -> M
Node 21 -> N
Node 25 -> O
Node 12 -> P
Node 15 -> Q
Node 19 -> R
Node 24 -> S
Node 26 -> T
Node 27 -> U
Node 28 -> V
Node 6 -> W
Node 0 -> X
Node 22 -> Y
Node 11 -> Z
Node 9 -> AA
Node 14 -> BB

3. Count the triangles based on the above relabeled nodes:
There are [129] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 20, 1>
<0, 9, 27>
<0, 9, 28>
<0, 11, 15>
<1, 17, 2>
