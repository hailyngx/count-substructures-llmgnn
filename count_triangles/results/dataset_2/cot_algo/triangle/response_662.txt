Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are:  
Node 5: degree 4  
Node 1: degree 4  
Node 8: degree 3  
Node 6: degree 3  
Node 0: degree 3  
Node 4: degree 4  
Node 9: degree 4  
Node 3: degree 6  
Node 2: degree 4  
Node 7: degree 4

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will examine the edges in the appropriate order to count the triangles.  

The total number of triangles is [9].  

The unique triangles are:  
<1, 3, 4>  
<3, 4, 6>  
<3, 4, 7>  
<3, 4, 9>  
<3, 6, 7>  
<4, 6, 8>  
<4, 7, 9>  
<6, 7, 9>  
<2, 3, 7>
