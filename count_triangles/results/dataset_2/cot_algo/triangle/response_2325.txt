Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices based on their degree of connections:

Vertex 9: degree 2  
Vertex 7: degree 3  
Vertex 3: degree 4  
Vertex 0: degree 4  
Vertex 5: degree 4  
Vertex 8: degree 5  
Vertex 6: degree 5  
Vertex 1: degree 5  
Vertex 2: degree 5  
Vertex 4: degree 6  

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees in increasing order.  

Relabeled Graph:  
Vertex 0 (degree 4) -> Vertex A  
Vertex 1 (degree 5) -> Vertex B  
Vertex 2 (degree 5) -> Vertex C  
Vertex 3 (degree 4) -> Vertex D  
Vertex 4 (degree 6) -> Vertex E  
Vertex 5 (degree 4) -> Vertex F  
Vertex 6 (degree 5) -> Vertex G  
Vertex 7 (degree 3) -> Vertex H  
Vertex 8 (degree 5) -> Vertex I  
Vertex 9 (degree 2) -> Vertex J  

Now, we will check each edge using the relabeled vertices and count the triangles formed.  

Triangles:

<0, 1, 5>  
<0, 1, 2>  
<0, 2, 3>

<0, 2, 5>  
<1, 2, 4>  
<1, 2, 8>  
<1, 4, 5>  
<1, 5, 0>  
<1, 5, 4>  
<2, 4, 5>  
<3, 0, 2>  
<4, 5, 0>  
<4, 5, 7>  
<4, 5, 8>  
<4, 5, 1>  
<5, 0, 1>  
<5, 1, 4>  
<5, 1, 2>  

Total number of triangles: [19]
