Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 1) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 17) (27, 6) (18, 17) (18, 29) (22, 27) (4, 13) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 3) (1, 0) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 14) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 10) (26, 3) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 15) (28, 20) (5, 8) (5, 19) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 12) (15, 28) (16, 20) (11, 23) (11, 21) (23, 11) (23, 6) (23, 13) (6, 27) (6, 1) (6, 23) (6, 14) (3, 8) (3, 26) (3, 28) (3, 12) (10, 26) (10, 12) (10, 20) (9, 25) (9, 2) (9, 7) (25, 8) (25, 9) (25, 29) (25, 14) (13, 4) (13, 23) (13, 21) (21, 11) (21, 13) (21, 24) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 25) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 14) (17, 27) (17, 18) (17, 7) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 24) (24, 21) (24, 7) (24, 20) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 29) (29, 18) (29, 25) (29, 12) (20, 28) (20, 16) (20, 10) (20, 24) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows: 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
(0, 27), (0, 1), (0, 19), 
(27, 22), (27, 17), (27, 6), 
(18, 17), (18, 29), 
(22, 27), 
(4, 13), (4, 2), 
(8, 5), (8, 25), (8, 3), 
(1, 26), (1, 6), (1, 14), 
(26, 28), (26, 10), (26, 3), 
(28, 15), (28, 20), 
(5, 19), (5, 9), 
(19, 12), 
(15, 16), 
(11, 23), (11, 21), 
(23, 13), 
(6, 14), (6, 7), 
(3, 12), 
(10, 20), 
(25, 29), 
(13, 21), 
(2, 9), 
(17, 7), 
(24, 20)

Next, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Nodes in ascending order of degrees:
7, 16, 4, 5, 9, 10, 15, 18, 1, 2, 11, 12, 14, 24, 8, 13, 0, 6, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 3, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

\[Total \ number \ of \ triangles: [54]\]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 1, 6>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 14, 25>, <3, 8, 26>, <3, 12, 29>, <3, 12, 10>, <3, 12, 19>, <3, 12, 29>, <4, 13, 21>, <4, 13, 23>, <5, 8, 25>, <5, 19, 12>, <6, 1, 27>, <6, 7, 17>, <6, 14, 25>, <7, 24, 20>, <8, 5, 19>, <10, 12, 29>, <11, 21, 24>, <13, 21, 24>, <17, 7, 24>, <17, 18, 29>, <20, 10, 24>, <20, 16, 15>, <22, 27, 17>, <25, 9, 2>, <28, 26, 3>
