Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 7) (4, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 11) (7, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (10, 17) (10, 0) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 16) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 18) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 13) (3, 13) (11, 4) (11, 13) (1, 6) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 11) (19, 8) (19, 9) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 9) (18, 15) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 15) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 12) (9, 19) (9, 18) (15, 18) (15, 12) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

Edges: (14, 17), (14, 0), (14, 4), (14, 16), (17, 10), (17, 7), (4, 8), (4, 11), (7, 6), (10, 0), (8, 19), (8, 18), (5, 6), (5, 2), (6, 1), (0, 2), (0, 18), (2, 12), (2, 13), (3, 13), (11, 13), (1, 6), (13, 3), (19, 9), (18, 15)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Degree-Based Ordering: [1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 4, 3, 4, 2]

Triangles: 
- <0, 2, 18>
- <6, 12, 16>
- <4, 7, 14>
- <8, 9, 18>

Total number of triangles: [4]
