Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 16) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 11) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 16) (4, 2) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 19) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 16) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 14) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 11) (19, 18) (19, 5) (7, 11) (7, 1) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 16) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 7) (0, 15) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 5) (12, 10) (12, 17) 

Response:
Here is the analysis of the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Vertices sorted by their number of connections (degree):
   Node 3: 2 edges
   Node 7: 2 edges
   Node 19: 2 edges
   Node 0: 1 edge
   Node 2: 1 edge
   Node 8: 1 edge
   Node 11: 2 edges
   Node 17: 3 edges
   Node 18: 3 edges
   Node 9: 3 edges
   Node 12: 2 edges
   Node 16: 4 edges
   Node 1: 4 edges
   Node 4: 4 edges
   Node 6: 4 edges
   Node 5: 5 edges
   Node 14: 5 edges
   Node 10: 4 edges
   Node 13: 4 edges
   Node 15: 7 edges
