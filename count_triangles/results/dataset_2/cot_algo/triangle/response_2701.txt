Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 5) (15, 12) (15, 16) (14, 17) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 0) (19, 5) (19, 7) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 4) (1, 13) (2, 12) (2, 16) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 2) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 19) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (6, 10) (6, 16) (18, 17) (18, 10) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 1) (16, 15) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 6) 

Response:
The vertices and their connections sorted by the number of connections are as follows:

0: (3, 5, 9)
1: (4, 13)
2: (12, 16)
3: (0, 5, 13)
4: (1, 8, 9, 13)
5: (0, 3, 12, 19)
6: (10, 16)
7: (10, 11, 17, 19)
8: (4, 9)
9: (0, 4, 8, 12)
10: (6, 7, 11, 18)
11: (7, 10, 13)
12: (5, 9, 15, 2)
13: (3, 4, 11, 1)
14: (16, 17)
15: (12, 16)
16: (6, 14, 15, 2)
17: (7, 14, 18)
18: (10, 17)
19: (5, 7)

Now, let's count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 8]
<0, 5, 3>, <3, 13, 11>, <0, 3, 5>, <2, 16, 12>, <4, 9, 8>, <10, 7, 11>, <16, 14, 17>, <7, 10, 11>
