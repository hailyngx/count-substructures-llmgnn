Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 6) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 8) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 13) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 0) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then, for each edge, we proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. We then check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to find triangles.

After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the labels become: 

Node 2: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 3
Node 12: Degree 6
Node 13: Degree 6
Node 14: Degree 5

Now, we can go through each edge and check for shared connections to find triangles. 

There are a total of 4 triangles:

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 14>
<4, 10, 13>
<6, 10, 14>
