Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 10) (16, 6) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (15, 19) (15, 17) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 5) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 2) (5, 14) (9, 4) (2, 17) (2, 12) (18, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 0) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 17) (8, 7) (1, 10) (1, 13) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 19) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 13) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections) from least to most. Let's label the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 18: degree 1
Vertex 5: degree 1
Vertex 9: degree 1
Vertex 1: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 2
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 19: degree 3
Vertex 15: degree 3
Vertex 14: degree 4
Vertex 5: degree 1
Vertex 6: degree 4
Vertex 3: degree 4
Vertex 0: degree 5
Vertex 16: degree 5
Vertex 12: degree 5
Vertex 17: degree 5
Vertex 11: degree 5
Vertex 13: degree 6
Vertex 10: degree 6
Vertex 8: degree 6

Now, we'll count the triangles by examining the shared connections between vertices based on their labels:

[13, 12, 7] - <13, 6, 12>
[13, 12, 4] - <13, 6, 4>
[13, 12, 10] - <13, 6, 10>
[13, 1, 10] - <13, 1, 10>
[12, 7, 0] - <12, 7, 0>
[12, 2, 17] - <12, 2, 17>
[12, 2, 0] - <12, 2, 0>
[12, 17, 8] - <12, 17, 8>
[12, 13, 10] - <12, 13, 10>
[7, 0, 19] - <7, 0, 19>
[8, 17, 2] - <8, 17, 2>
[8, 17, 12] - <8, 17, 12>
[8, 17, 14] - <8, 17, 14>
[8, 17, 15] - <8, 17, 15>
[8, 7, 0] - <8, 7, 0>
[8, 12, 0] - <8, 12, 0>
[8, 3, 4] - <8, 3, 4>
[10, 1, 3] - <10, 1, 3>
[6, 11, 16] - <6, 11, 16>
[6, 11, 13] - <6, 11, 13>

Total number of triangles: [20]
