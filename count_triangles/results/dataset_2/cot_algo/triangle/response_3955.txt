Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 16) (4, 21) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 14) (8, 29) (8, 15) (13, 12) (13, 25) (13, 27) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 28) (27, 13) (27, 14) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 18) (26, 21) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 14) (17, 1) (17, 3) (28, 12) (28, 18) (20, 21) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 23) (11, 3) (23, 11) (23, 2) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 0) (2, 23) (2, 22) (2, 10) (2, 0) (22, 2) (22, 10) (22, 25) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 21) (16, 29) (21, 4) (21, 26) (21, 20) (21, 16) (6, 24) (24, 6) (24, 10) (25, 13) (25, 22) (25, 0) (25, 15) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 25) (15, 9) (15, 8) (15, 25) (15, 18) (29, 8) (29, 16) (29, 14) (18, 5) (18, 26) (18, 28) (18, 15) (14, 7) (14, 27) (14, 1) (14, 29) (10, 2) (10, 22) (10, 24) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 12), (5, 18), (5, 1), (5, 11), 
(9, 15), (9, 1), (9, 7), 
(4, 16), (4, 21), 
(7, 11), (7, 14), 
(8, 29), (8, 15), 
(13, 12), (13, 25), (13, 27), 
(12, 13), (12, 28), 
(27, 14), 
(19, 26), 
(26, 18), (26, 21), 
(1, 17), (1, 16), (1, 14), 
(17, 3), 
(28, 18), 
(20, 21), 
(11, 23), (11, 3), 
(23, 2), 
(3, 0), 
(2, 22), (2, 10), (2, 0), 
(22, 10), (22, 25), 
(16, 29), 
(21, 20), 
(6, 24), 
(25, 15), 
(0, 15), 
(29, 14), 
(18, 28)

Next, let's apply Degree-Based Ordering:

Vertices sorted by the number of connections:
(6), (19), (4), (20), (18), (28), (26), (17), (16), (7), (8), (13), (27), (24), (12), (5), (9), (1), (2), (14), (3), (23), (10), (21), (22), (29), (15), (0), (11)

Triangles formed by shared connections (and in increasing order):

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 25>, <0, 3, 17>, <0, 3, 25>, <0, 22, 25>, <1, 9, 5>, <1, 9, 7>, <1, 9, 15>, <1, 11, 7>, <1, 14, 7>, <2, 10, 22>, <2, 11, 3>, <5, 9, 1>, <5, 9, 11>, <5, 12, 13>, <5, 12, 18>, <5, 12, 28>, <5, 18, 26>, <5, 18, 28>, <7, 11, 3>,...
