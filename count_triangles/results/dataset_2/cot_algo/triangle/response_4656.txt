Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 0) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 12) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1.  Label the vertices from 0 to 14 based on their degree:
    - Vertex 0 has degree 4
    - Vertex 1 has degree 2
    - Vertex 2 has degree 4
    - Vertex 3 has degree 3
    - Vertex 4 has degree 4
    - Vertex 5 has degree 4
    - Vertex 6 has degree 4
    - Vertex 7 has degree 4
    - Vertex 8 has degree 4
    - Vertex 9 has degree 6
    - Vertex 10 has degree 4
    - Vertex 11 has degree 5
    - Vertex 12 has degree 5
    - Vertex 13 has degree 5
    - Vertex 14 has degree 4

2.  Sort the vertices based on their degree:
    - Vertices with degree 2: 1, 2
    - Vertices with degree 3: 3
    - Vertices with degree 4: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 14
    - Vertices with degree 5: 11, 12, 13
    - Vertex with degree 6: 9

3.  Count the triangles:
    - Since vertex 1 has degree 2 and is less than vertex 2 (also degree 2), we check for shared neighbors: None.
    - Since vertex 3 has degree 3 and is less than vertex 12 (also degree 3), we check for shared neighbors: None.
    - Since vertex 3 has degree 3 and is less than vertex 6 (degree 4), we check for shared neighbors: Shared neighbor with vertex 12, forming a triangle <3, 6, 12>.
    - Continue this process for all edges.

The total number of triangles is [28].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 8, 12>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 9, 13>, <0, 9, 14>, <10, 14, 11>, <10, 14, 13>, <11, 0, 8>, <11, 0, 9>, <11, 9, 13>, <12, 3, 6>, <12, 3, 8>, <12, 3, 2>, <12, 5, 4>, <12, 5, 6>, <12, 5, 8>, <12, 6, 13>, <2, 13, 9>, <2, 13, 14>, <2, 9, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 12>, <5, 10, 14>, <9, 13, 14>.
