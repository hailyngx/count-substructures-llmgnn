Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 12) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 11) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 14) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degree is as follows:
Nodes and their degrees:
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 6
- Node 14: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 7
- Node 10: degree 7

Since all edges are provided and the vertices are numbered according to their degrees (from least to most connected), we will check each edge to count the triangles.

The total number of triangles is [12].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 14>
<0, 1, 13>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 14>
<0, 11, 13>
<1, 6, 13>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<7, 10, 13>
<2, 3, 14>
<10, 13, 14>
<2, 3, 12>
