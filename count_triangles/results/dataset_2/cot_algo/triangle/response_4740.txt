Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 12) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 1) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 12) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 6) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (4, 12), (4, 11), (4, 6), (7, 3), (7, 9), (7, 2), (7, 13), (10, 11), (10, 6), (10, 13), (10, 5), (10, 14), (11, 4), (11, 10), (11, 8), (11, 2), (8, 11), (8, 13), (8, 9), (8, 6), (8, 1), (13, 7), (13, 10), (13, 8), (13, 3), (13, 1), (5, 10), (5, 6), (5, 0), (6, 4), (6, 10), (6, 8), (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 2), (0, 5), (0, 12), (0, 1), (14, 10), (14, 12), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 12), (12, 4), (12, 0), (12, 14), (12, 9), (12, 2), (12, 1), (2, 7), (2, 11), (2, 6), (2, 12), (3, 7), (3, 13), (3, 6), (1, 8), (1, 13), (1, 0), (1, 12)

Next, let's sort the vertices by their degree and relabel the vertices accordingly. 

Degree-based ordering: (0, 1), (5, 2), (3, 3), (14, 4), (9, 5), (8, 6), (13, 7), (11, 8), (10, 9), (7, 10), (6, 11), (2, 12), (12, 13), (4, 14)

Now, using the degree-based ordering, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles found: 
<0, 1, 12>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 12>, <0, 1, 12>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 11>, <5, 6, 7>, <3, 7, 13>, <3, 7, 13>, <3, 7, 13>, <14, 12, 0>

Total number of triangles: [11]
