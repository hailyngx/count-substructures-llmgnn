Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 16) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 9) (11, 1) (11, 10) (5, 8) (5, 13) (0, 17) (0, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (15, 10) (15, 2) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 16) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 9) (18, 14) (18, 19) (18, 16) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 6) (2, 15) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 6) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 2) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 9) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 16) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are as follows:
Node 5: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 15: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 18: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 10: degree 5
Node 9: degree 5
Node 14: degree 5
Node 16: degree 5

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles and get the following results:

Total number of triangles: [18]
