Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order. The sorted vertices are then relabeled accordingly.

Here is the relabeled list of vertices based on their degrees (in parentheses) after sorting:

Vertices: 
(0) - 5 connections 
(1) - 5 connections 
(2) - 4 connections 
(3) - 4 connections 
(4) - 2 connections 
(5) - 3 connections 
(6) - 6 connections 
(7) - 2 connections 
(8) - 7 connections 
(9) - 5 connections 
(10) - 4 connections 
(11) - 4 connections 
(12) - 2 connections 
(13) - 5 connections 
(14) - 6 connections 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method with the given edges, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph:

Total number of triangles: [21]

Unique triangles found:
