Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 12) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 14) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. Here is the updated list of vertices with their degrees in parentheses:

Vertex 0 (4), Vertex 1 (4), Vertex 2 (4), Vertex 3 (5), Vertex 4 (5), Vertex 5 (4), Vertex 6 (2), Vertex 7 (5), Vertex 8 (3), Vertex 9 (4), Vertex 10 (5), Vertex 11 (5), Vertex 12 (6), Vertex 13 (4), Vertex 14 (4)

Now, let's go through the edges and count the number of triangles:

- Edge (10, 11): Both vertices have 5 connections, so skip.
- Edge (10, 3): Vertex 10 (5 connections) connects with Vertex 3 (5 connections). They share 3 common neighbors (9, 5, 11), forming a triangle <3, 9, 11>.
- Edge (10, 2): Vertex 10 (5 connections) connects with Vertex 2 (4 connections). They share 1 common neighbor (7), forming a triangle <2, 7, 10>.
- Edge (10, 9): Both vertices have 4 connections, so skip.
- Edge (10, 5): Both vertices have 4 connections, so skip.
- ...

After going through all edges, we have found the following unique triangles:

<3, 9, 11>, <2, 7, 10>, <4, 12, 14>, <4, 0, 1>, <4, 3, 12>, <8, 7, 12>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is **[6]**.
