Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- 0: (7, 9), (3, 0), (5, 0), (2, 0)
- 1: (4, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 1), (6, 1)
- 2: (3, 2), (6, 2), (2, 0), (0, 2)
- 3: (1, 3), (3, 5), (9, 3), (2, 3), (0, 3)
- 4: (4, 9), (4, 1), (4, 6), (6, 4), (8, 4)
- 5: (1, 5), (3, 5), (6, 5), (5, 0)
- 6: (4, 6), (1, 6), (6, 2), (6, 8), (5, 6)
- 7: (7, 9), (7, 8), (8, 7), (0, 7)
- 8: (7, 8), (8, 6), (4, 8)
- 9: (4, 9), (7, 9), (9, 3), (9, 0)

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes sorted by degree (ascending): [2, 8, 7, 5, 4, 0, 9, 6, 1, 3]

Triangles:
- Shared connections between (2, 3) and (2, 0): <2, 3, 0>
- Shared connections between (8, 7) and (8, 6): <8, 7, 6>
- Shared connections between (5, 0) and (0, 7): <5, 0, 7>
- Shared connections between (4, 9) and (4, 1): <4, 9, 1>

Total number of triangles: [4]
