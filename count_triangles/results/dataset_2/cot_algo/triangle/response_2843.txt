The edges are as follows: (11, 21) (16, 7) (16, 24) (16, 17) (16, 8) (6, 9) (6, 22) (6, 18) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 27) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 17) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 10) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 14) (1, 10) (22, 6) (22, 5) (23, 7) (23, 29) (12, 2) (12, 10) (27, 9) (27, 25) (27, 4) (27, 17) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 8) (20, 1) (20, 0) (20, 18) (14, 1) (14, 0) (19, 26) (19, 2) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 8) (28, 3) (28, 26) (28, 7) (4, 27) (4, 15) (15, 4) (15, 13) (7, 16) (7, 23) (7, 28) (7, 24) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 21) (24, 16) (24, 7) (17, 16) (17, 3) (17, 27) (13, 25) (13, 15) (13, 29) (5, 22) (5, 18) (5, 21) (18, 6) (18, 20) (18, 5) (18, 10) (10, 25) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 18) (29, 23) (29, 0) (29, 13) (29, 21) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 26) (21, 11) (21, 2) (21, 5) (21, 29) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(0, 8), (0, 14), (0, 20), (0, 29), (1, 3), (1, 10), (1, 14), (1, 20), (2, 12), (2, 19), (2, 21), (3, 17), (3, 28), (4, 15), (4, 27), (5, 18), (5, 21), (5, 22), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 18), (6, 22), (7, 16), (7, 23), (7, 24), (7, 28), (8, 16), (8, 26), (9, 27), (10, 12), (10, 18), (10, 25), (11, 21), (12, 10), (13, 15), (13, 25), (13, 29), (14, 0), (14, 1), (15, 4), (15, 13), (16, 17), (16, 24), (17, 27), (19, 2), (19, 26), (20, 1), (20, 18), (21, 2), (21, 5), (21, 29), (22, 5), (22, 6), (23, 7), (23, 29), (24, 7), (25, 10), (25, 27), (26, 8), (26, 19), (26, 28), (27, 17), (28, 3), (28, 7), (28, 26), (29, 0), (29, 13)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the nodes in ascending order of their connections are:
11, 12, 4, 15, 5, 19, 10, 23, 9, 14, 2, 1, 3, 26, 16, 20, 6, 21, 22, 24, 18, 28, 29, 7, 0, 25, 8, 13, 17, 27

Now, counting the number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 8, 26>
<0, 14, 20>
<0, 8, 16>
<2, 12, 10>
<3, 17, 27>
<5, 18, 10>
