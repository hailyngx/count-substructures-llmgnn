Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in the given graph. 

To start, we sort the vertices based on their degrees from least to most:

Nodes: 
0 (degree 4)
9 (degree 4)
8 (degree 3)
6 (degree 3)
2 (degree 3)
5 (degree 5)
1 (degree 5)
3 (degree 5)
7 (degree 6)
4 (degree 6)

Now we relabel the nodes accordingly:
0 → 0
9 → 1
8 → 2
6 → 3
2 → 4
5 → 5
1 → 6
3 → 7
7 → 8
4 → 9

Given the list of edges, we apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:

Triangles: 
1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <1, 2, 4>
5. <1, 2, 5>
6. <1, 3, 7>
7. <1, 5, 8>
8. <2, 5, 8>
9. <3, 6, 9>
10. <4, 7, 8>
11. <5, 7, 8>
