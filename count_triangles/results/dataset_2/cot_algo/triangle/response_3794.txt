Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves relabeling the vertices based on their number of connections. Let's sort the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 0: degree 4
Vertex 1: degree 2
Vertex 2: degree 3
Vertex 3: degree 6
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 5: degree 4
Vertex 6: degree 5
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 5
Vertex 9: degree 4

Based on the degrees, the relabeled vertices are:
Vertex 1: 0
Vertex 2: 1
Vertex 0: 2
Vertex 9: 3
Vertex 7: 4
Vertex 5: 5
Vertex 8: 6
Vertex 6: 7
Vertex 4: 8
Vertex 3: 9

Now, let's determine the triangles and count them:

1. Edge (0, 2): 
   Both have degree 4 which is equal, so not considering.

2. Edge (0, 6): 
   Degree of 0 is 4 < Degree of 6 is 5.
   Shared connections: 7
   <0, 6, 7>

3. Edge (0, 8): 
   Both have degree 4 which is equal, so not considering.

4. Edge (0, 2): 
   Degree of 0 is 4 < Degree of 2 is 3.
   Shared connections: 5
   <0, 2, 5>

5. Edge (1, 4): 
   Degree of 1 is 2 < Degree of 4 is 4.
   Shared connections: 7
   <1, 4, 7>

6. Edge (2, 5): 
   Degree of 2 is 3 < Degree of 5 is 4.
   Shared connections: 0
   <2, 5, 0>

7. Edge (2, 9): 
   Degree of 2 is 3 < Degree of 9 is 4.
   Shared connections: None, so no triangle.

8. Edge (3, 4): 
   Degree of 3 is 6 > Degree of 4 is 4.
   Shared connections: 6
   <3, 4, 6>

9. Edge (3, 8): 
   Degree of 3 is 6 > Degree of 8 is 5.
   Shared connections: 6
   <3, 8, 6>

10. Edge (3, 5): 
   Degree of 3 is 6 > Degree of 5 is 4.
   Shared connections: 6
   <3, 5, 6>

11. Edge (3, 6): 
   Degree of 3 is 6 > Degree of 6 is 5.
   Shared connections: 0
   <3, 6, 0>

12. Edge (3, 9): 
   Degree of 3 is 6 > Degree of 9 is 4.
   Shared connections: None, so no triangle.

Total number of triangles: [6]
