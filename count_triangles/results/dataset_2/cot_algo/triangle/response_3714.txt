Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 4) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 17) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 5) (8, 16) (8, 19) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 18) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 17) (2, 4) (18, 10) (18, 13) (18, 2) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 19) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 0) (12, 16) (5, 3) (5, 10) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 0) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (9, 16) (9, 4) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
Node 14 has 0 connections.
Nodes 0, 7, 12 have 1 connection each.
Nodes 1, 3, 6, 13 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 5, 7, 9, 18 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 8, 16 have 4 connections each.
Nodes 2, 15, 17 have 5 connections each.
Nodes 4, 10, 11, 19 have 5 connections each.

Next, we will proceed by examining the edges based on the degree-based ordering method:

1. Edge (11, 16): Both nodes have 5 connections, so we will not count this edge.
2. Edge (11, 10): Node 10 has fewer connections than node 11. Shared connections with nodes 19 and 4 form the triangle <10, 4, 19>.
3. Edge (11, 4): Node 4 has fewer connections than node 11. Shared connections with nodes 10 and 2 form the triangle <4, 2, 10>.
4. Edge (11, 15): Node 15 has fewer connections than node 11. Shared connection with node 3 forms the triangle <11, 3, 15>.
5. Edge (16, 11): Already counted in step 1.
6. Edge (16, 12): Both nodes have 4 connections, so we will not count this edge.
7. Edge (16, 17): Node 17 has fewer connections than node 16. Shared connections with nodes 15 and 2 form the triangle <17, 2, 15>.
8. Edge (16, 8): Node 8 has fewer connections than node 16. Shared connection with node 19 forms the triangle <16, 19, 8>.
9. Edge (16, 9): Node 9 has fewer connections than node 16. Shared connection with node 4 forms the triangle <16, 4, 9>.
10. Remaining edges do not fulfill the conditions for counting triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
The unique triangles found are <10, 4, 19>, <4, 2, 10>, and <11, 3, 15>.
