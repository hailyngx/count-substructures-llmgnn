Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 24) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 20) (8, 10) (8, 21) (8, 26) (23, 25) (23, 0) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 13) (20, 3) (20, 15) (17, 27) (17, 26) (29, 6) (29, 21) (29, 18) (4, 28) (18, 29) (18, 27) (18, 0) (18, 28) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 5) (26, 8) (26, 17) (26, 22) (26, 24) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 22) (9, 0) (24, 1) (24, 26) (24, 25) (0, 23) (0, 18) (0, 9) (0, 5) (7, 25) (7, 10) (25, 23) (25, 24) (25, 7) (25, 2) (21, 8) (21, 29) (21, 28) (21, 13) (21, 27) (28, 4) (28, 18) (28, 21) (28, 19) (12, 16) (12, 14) (16, 12) (16, 5) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (13, 15) (13, 21) (13, 11) (6, 29) (6, 22) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 2) (19, 28) (19, 14) (19, 27) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 16) (27, 17) (27, 18) (27, 21) (27, 19) (10, 8) (10, 7) (2, 25) (2, 11) (2, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most, and then relabeling them accordingly. 

After sorting the nodes and relabeling them with the number of connections in ascending order, we get the following list of nodes: 
```
Node 0: degree 4
Node 4: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 12: degree 2
Node 16: degree 2
Node 19: degree 3
Node 28: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 3: degree 2
Node 11: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 15: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 24: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 18: degree 5
Node 25: degree 4
Node 10: degree 2
Node 2: degree 3
Node 6: degree 2
Node 14: degree 3
Node 20: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 21: degree 5
Node 26: degree 5
Node 27: degree 4
Node 22: degree 4
Node 29: degree 3
Node 23: degree 2
```

Now, we will go through each edge according to the Degree-Based Ordering method and count the triangles formed by shared connections between the vertices of each edge.

Among the given edges, the following unique triangles are found:
```
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 18>
<0, 9, 15>
<0, 9, 18>
<0, 9, 25>
<0, 18, 27>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 9, 15>
<1, 9, 24>
<3, 1, 9>
<5, 0, 18>
<5, 16, 22>
<9, 1, 15>
<9, 1, 24>
<9, 15, 21>
<9, 15, 25>
<9, 18, 27>
<11, 1, 13>
<13, 11, 21>
<15, 9, 21>
<15, 9, 25>
<18, 0, 27>
<19, 14, 27>
<21, 15, 25>
<21, 18, 27>
<21, 18, 29>
<21, 27, 29>
<25, 0, 23>
<25, 7, 10>
<25, 2, 11>
<26, 8, 21>
<26, 8, 24>
<27, 18, 28>
<27, 19, 28>
<27, 21, 28>
```

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [34]
