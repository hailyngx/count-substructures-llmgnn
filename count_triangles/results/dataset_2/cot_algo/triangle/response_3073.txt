Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 7), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 1), (8, 7), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 5), (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 0), (4, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (0, 3)

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degree:
Label 0: connected to 4 nodes
Label 1: connected to 5 nodes
Label 2: connected to 3 nodes
Label 3: connected to 5 nodes
Label 4: connected to 5 nodes
Label 5: connected to 4 nodes
Label 6: connected to 4 nodes
Label 7: connected to 3 nodes
Label 8: connected to 5 nodes
Label 9: connected to 4 nodes

Now, we will go through the edges and count the triangles:
Triangles: <1, 0, 3>, <1, 0, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <0, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
