Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 14) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 11) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 12) (11, 9) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 12) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
(11) - 1 connection
(9, 6, 5, 4) - 2 connections
(0, 7) - 3 connections
(2, 10) - 4 connections
(14) - 5 connections
(8, 12) - 6 connections
(13) - 7 connections
(3) - 9 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now analyze the edges to find triangles:

1. Edge (1, 3): Both vertices have 5 connections each but 1 is lower labeled. No triangle.
2. Edge (1, 2): 1 has 5 connections, 2 has 4 connections. Shared connection with 4, so triangle <1, 2, 4>.
3. Edge (1, 13): 1 has 5 connections, 13 has 7 connections. Shared connection with 3, so triangle <1, 13, 3>.
4. Edge (1, 4): 1 has 5 connections, 4 has 2 connections. No triangle.
5. Edge (1, 8): 1 has 5 connections, 8 has 6 connections. Shared connection with 13, so triangle <1, 8, 13>.
6. Edge (3, 1): 3 has 9 connections, 1 has 5 connections. Shared connection with 2, so triangle <3, 1, 2>.
7. Edge (3, 7): 3 has 9 connections, 7 has 3 connections. No triangle.
8. Edge (3, 10): 3 has 9 connections, 10 has 3 connections. No triangle.
9. Edge (3, 13): 3 has 9 connections, 13 has 7 connections. Shared connection with 1, so triangle <3, 13, 1>.
10. Edge (3, 2): 3 has 9 connections, 2 has 4 connections. Shared connection with 1, so triangle <3, 2, 1>.
11. Edge (8, 1): 8 has 6 connections, 1 has 5 connections. No triangle.
12. Edge (8, 13): 8 has 6 connections, 13 has 7 connections. No triangle.
13. Edge (8, 9): Both vertices have 2 connections each but 8 is lower labeled. No triangle.
14. Edge (8, 0): 8 has 6 connections, 0 has 3 connections. Shared connection with 5, so triangle <8, 0, 5>.
15. Edge (8, 12): 8 has 6 connections, 12 has 6 connections. No triangle.
16. Edge (13, 1): 13 has 7 connections, 1 has 5 connections. Shared connection with 3, so triangle <13, 1, 3>.
17. Edge (13, 3): 13 has 7 connections, 3 has 9 connections. Shared connection with 1, so triangle <13, 3, 1>.
18. Edge (13, 8): 13 has 7 connections, 8 has 6 connections. No triangle.
19. Edge (13, 12): 13 has 7 connections, 12 has 6 connections. Shared connection with 5, so triangle <13, 12, 5>.
20. Edge (13, 10): 13 has 7 connections, 10 has 3 connections. No triangle.

After analyzing all edges, the total number of triangles is [6]. The unique triangles found are:
<1, 2, 4>, <1, 8, 13>, <3, 13, 1>, <3, 2, 1>, <8, 0, 5>, <13, 12, 5>.
