Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. The sorted list of vertices with their degrees is as follows:

Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 0: 6 connections

Since the vertex with the lower label only proceeds if it has fewer connections, we will now list the triangles based on the shared connections between vertices. 

There are a total of [10] triangles in the graph. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 0>, <1, 3, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, and <5, 6, 9>.
