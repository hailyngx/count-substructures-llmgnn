Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 9) (16, 21) (16, 29) (16, 18) (28, 4) (28, 18) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 4) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 25) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 7) (13, 6) (20, 29) (20, 24) (29, 16) (29, 1) (29, 20) (29, 0) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 14) (23, 3) (23, 21) (2, 6) (2, 24) (22, 6) (22, 25) (21, 16) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 24) (25, 1) (25, 17) (25, 22) (25, 4) (25, 18) (26, 10) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 27) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 14) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 9) (8, 15) (8, 3) (7, 13) (14, 23) (14, 15) (12, 1) (12, 6) (0, 29) (0, 19) (0, 9) (0, 18) (9, 11) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 3) (27, 10) (18, 16) (18, 28) (18, 25) (18, 10) (18, 0) (4, 28) (4, 1) (4, 23) (4, 25) (24, 20) (24, 2) (24, 21) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 3) (3, 23) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the given edges, and the nodes have been labeled according to their number of connections in ascending order.

The sorted nodes with their respective connections are:
Node 19: 3 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 27: 1 connection
Node 22: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 14: 2 connections
Node 12: 2 connections
Node 20: 2 connections
Node 26: 1 connection
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 21: 5 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 25: 5 connections
Node 24: 3 connections
Node 23: 5 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 18: 6 connections
Node 11: 2 connections
Node 16: 5 connections
Node 29: 5 connections
Node 5: 0 connections

Next, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
