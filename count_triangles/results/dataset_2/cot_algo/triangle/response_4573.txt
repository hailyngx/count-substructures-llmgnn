Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 9) (10, 0) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 1) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 1) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 15) (13, 2) (13, 15) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 7) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 15) (7, 5) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (15, 14) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph can be labelled as follows based on their degrees:  
Node 5 (Degree 1)  
Node 0 (Degree 2)  
Node 9 (Degree 2)  
Node 10 (Degree 2)  
Node 14 (Degree 2)  
Node 3 (Degree 2)  
Node 18 (Degree 3)  
Node 13 (Degree 3)  
Node 15 (Degree 4)  
Node 12 (Degree 4)  
Node 7 (Degree 4)  
Node 2 (Degree 4)  
Node 8 (Degree 4)  
Node 4 (Degree 4)  
Node 6 (Degree 4)  
Node 19 (Degree 4)  
Node 1 (Degree 5)  
Node 11 (Degree 6)  
Node 16 (Degree 6)  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles by examining the shared connections between vertices along the edges.  

The total number of triangles is [16].

The unique triangles found are:  
<4, 16, 19>  
<2, 6, 18>  
<4, 1, 12>  
<2, 13, 15>  
<8, 14, 15>  
<6, 7, 19>  
<1, 11, 18>  
<8, 4, 19>  
<11, 16, 2>  
<11, 9, 10>  
<11, 9, 1>  
<11, 1, 18>  
<11, 1, 4>  
<7, 19, 15>  
<5, 3, 12>  
<5, 7, 12>
