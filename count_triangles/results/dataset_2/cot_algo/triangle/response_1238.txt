Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the nodes is as follows:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 6: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 7: degree 5
Node 9: degree 5
Node 4: degree 6

Using this ordering, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

The total number of triangles is [16].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
