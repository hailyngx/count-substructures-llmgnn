Node 13 (degree 4)  
Node 2 (degree 5)  
Node 9 (degree 5)  
Node 11 (degree 5)  
Node 8 (degree 5)  
Node 10 (degree 2)  
Node 3 (degree 5)  
Node 15 (degree 3)  

Now, let's identify the triangles:  
- From the given edges, using the method described, we find the following triangles:

<2, 9, 18>

<2, 4, 17>  
<2, 18, 9>  
<2, 9, 16>  
<9, 16, 6>  
<9, 16, 12>  
<9, 18, 8>  
<9, 18, 2>  
<9, 18, 16>  
<11, 4, 14>  
<11, 4, 2>  
<11, 4, 19>  
<11, 0, 19>  
<11, 19, 0>  
<11, 19, 5>  
<4, 14, 2>  
<4, 2, 13>  
<4, 2, 17>  
<4, 2, 18>  
<4, 17, 2>  
<4, 18, 2>  
<4, 2, 9>  
<16, 6, 7>  
<16, 12, 3>  
<16, 9, 18>  
<16, 9, 2>  
<16, 9, 12>  
<16, 12, 3>  
<16, 12, 1>  
<16, 12, 15>  
<16, 12, 13>  
<18, 8, 10>  
<18, 8, 9>  
<18, 8, 11>  
<18, 8, 9>  
<18, 8, 11>  
<18, 8, 18>  
<18, 8, 2>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [40].
