Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 5) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 2) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections they have. Using the given edges, we can determine the number of connections for each node. 

Node 0 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 2
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 5
Node 6 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 8 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 3
Node 10 has degree 4
Node 11 has degree 4
Node 12 has degree 4
Node 13 has degree 4
Node 14 has degree 4

Next, we will relabel the nodes from lowest degree to highest degree:
(1 -> 1), (9 -> 2), (2 -> 3), (5 -> 4), (7 -> 5), (11 -> 6), (6 -> 7), (14 -> 8), (13 -> 9), (0 -> 10), (12 -> 11), (3 -> 12), (4 -> 13), (8 -> 14), (10 -> 15)

Following the Rule: For each edge, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This ensures that each triangle is only counted once.

We find the total number of triangles to be [11]. 

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 10>
<0, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<7, 9, 14>
<8, 10, 13>
<8, 10, 15>
<11, 12, 13>
<11, 12, 14>
<12, 13, 14>
