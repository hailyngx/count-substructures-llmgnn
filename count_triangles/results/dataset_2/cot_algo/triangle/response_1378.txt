Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 13) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 13) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method:

The degrees of each node are as follows:
Node 0: 6 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 10: 5 connections
Node 11: 5 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 13: 6 connections
Node 14: 4 connections

Vertices sorted by degree in ascending order:
8, 9, 12
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 14
0, 6, 10, 13

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:
- Edge (4, 12) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 5) does not form a triangle.
