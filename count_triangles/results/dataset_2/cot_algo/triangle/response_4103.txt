Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 10) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 19) (13, 5) (13, 19) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 18) (6, 1) (6, 5) (0, 11) (0, 3) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 17) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 12) (17, 7) (17, 4) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 13) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 12) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 12) (2, 9) (2, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 2) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 18) (12, 1) (12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 18) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (11, 16), (11, 19), (11, 0), (16, 7), (16, 10), (16, 19), (1, 6), (1, 4), (1, 12), (1, 8), (3, 14), (3, 8), (3, 4), (8, 19), (13, 5), (13, 19), (5, 18), (0, 3), (7, 14), (7, 17), (9, 12), (17, 4), (19, 13), (10, 15), (18, 14), (2, 9), (4, 17), (12, 15)

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degree from least to most connections:

Nodes: 2, 16, 17, 18, 0, 13, 15, 6, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 1, 3, 8, 4, 11, 19

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:

1. (2, 16): No triangles
2. (16, 17): No triangles
3. (17, 18): No triangles
4. (18, 0): No triangles
5. (0, 13): No triangles
6. (13, 15): No triangles
7. (15, 6): No triangles
8. (6, 5): No triangles
9. (5, 7): No triangles
10. (7, 9): No triangles
11. (9, 10): No triangles
12. (10, 12): No triangles
13. (12, 14): No triangles
14. (14, 1): No triangles
15. (1, 3): No triangles
16. (3, 8): No triangles
17. (8, 4): Triangle <4, 8, 19>
18. (4, 11): No triangles
19. (11, 19): No triangles

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <4, 8, 19>
