Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
(6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 4), 
(9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 0), 
(4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 1), (4, 3), 
(8, 4), (8, 0), (8, 7), (8, 3), 
(5, 6), (5, 3), (5, 7), 
(0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 1), 
(2, 6), (2, 7), 
(7, 6), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 5), (7, 0), (7, 2), 
(3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 5), (3, 0), 
(1, 4), (1, 0)

Next, we will sort the vertices based on their degree of connection from least to most:

Nodes by degree: {1, 2, 5, 9, 8, 0, 2, 5, 9, 8}

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method by checking shared connections between edges:

[Total number of triangles: 7]
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 0, 4>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
