Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their number of connections and then following the process mentioned earlier. Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

Vertices by their degree:
0: 3
1: 2
2: 3
3: 6
4: 4
5: 5
6: 3
7: 5
8: 4
9: 5

Relabeled vertices based on their degree (ordered from lowest degree to highest degree):
1: 0
2: 1
6: 2
0: 3
8: 4
5: 5
7: 6
4: 7
9: 8
3: 9

Now, considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(1, 0)
(6, 2)
(0, 3)
(4, 7)
(5, 1)
(7, 6)
(4, 0)
(5, 3)
(4, 0)
(7, 3)
(4, 0)
(7, 3)
(4, 0)
(7, 3)
(0, 3)
(5, 3)
(7, 3)
(8, 4)
(8, 4)
(8, 4)
(8, 4)
(8, 4)
(4, 0)
(4, 0)

Total number of triangles: [13]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 3>
<1, 0, 5>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 0>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 0, 7>
<5, 0, 3>
<8, 4, 0>
