Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 8) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 5) (17, 15) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 6) (0, 11) (0, 3) (1, 15) (1, 19) (1, 9) (5, 16) (5, 4) (5, 17) (19, 7) (19, 1) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 9) (2, 12) (3, 16) (3, 4) (3, 0) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 18) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 10) (18, 11) (18, 12) (18, 10) (18, 13) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 9) (13, 18) (8, 11) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 3), (0, 11), (1, 9), (1, 15), (1, 19), (2, 12), (3, 4), (3, 16), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 10), (5, 16), (5, 17), (6, 12), (6, 10), (6, 4), (7, 12), (7, 13), (7, 16), (7, 19), (8, 11), (9, 1), (9, 13), (9, 14), (9, 15), (10, 4), (10, 6), (10, 18), (11, 0), (11, 18), (11, 8), (12, 2), (12, 6), (12, 7), (12, 18), (13, 7), (13, 9), (13, 14), (13, 18), (14, 9), (14, 13), (15, 1), (15, 9), (15, 17), (16, 3), (16, 5), (16, 7), (17, 5), (17, 15), (18, 10), (18, 11), (18, 12), (18, 13), (19, 1), (19, 7)

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:

Degree 1: 8, 2, 0, 11
Degree 2: 1, 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19
Degree 3: 3, 5, 6, 8, 13
Degree 4: 4, 14
Degree 5: 7, 16, 9

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles:
1. <9, 15, 17>
2. <7, 12, 16>
