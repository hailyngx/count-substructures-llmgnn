Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 12) 

Response:

Node 3: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 0: degree 6
Node 1: degree 6
Node 10: degree 6
Node 9: degree 6
Node 11: degree 6
Node 8: degree 6
Node 2: degree 6
Node 13: degree 6
Node 12: degree 7
