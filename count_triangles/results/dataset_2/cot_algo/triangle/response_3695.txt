Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 9) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 10) (14, 9) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 14) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is given below:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (13, 10, 6, 2, 1)
- 1: (8, 12, 11, 0, 10)
- 2: (11, 0)
- 3: (8, 5, 12, 9)
- 4: (7, 8, 10)
- 5: (7, 8, 6, 12, 3)
- 6: (7, 5, 11, 0)
- 7: (4, 12, 11, 6, 5)
- 8: (4, 5, 3, 1)
- 9: (13, 3, 11, 10, 14)
- 10: (4, 13, 0, 1, 9)
- 11: (7, 6, 2, 1, 9)
- 12: (7, 5, 3, 1)
- 13: (4, 10, 9, 0)
- 14: (9)

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [<5, 7, 12>, <3, 5, 12>, <0, 6, 10>]

Total number of triangles: [3]
