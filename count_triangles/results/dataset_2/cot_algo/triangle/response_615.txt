Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 5) (12, 4) (12, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 13) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 9) 

Response:
The sorted nodes based on their degrees are as follows:
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 12: 2 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 14: 6 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 11: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 13: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles found in the graph are:
[<0, 2, 1> <0, 2, 6> <0, 2, 7> <0, 2, 9> <0, 6, 1> <0, 6, 5> <0, 6, 7> <0, 6, 11> <0, 7, 1> <0, 7, 5> <0, 7, 11> <0, 7, 13> <0, 11, 6> <0, 11, 7> <0, 11, 13> <0, 13, 1> <0, 13, 7> <0, 13, 11> <1, 2, 5> <1, 2, 7> <1, 2, 14> <1, 4, 5> <1, 5, 7> <1, 5, 14> <1, 7, 14> <2, 6, 11> <2, 6, 13> <2, 6, 5> <2, 7, 5> <2, 7, 11> <2, 7, 13> <3, 13, 1> <4, 8, 12> <4, 8, 14> <4, 10, 6> <4, 10, 7> <4, 12, 8> <4, 12, 14> <5, 6, 7> <5, 6, 14> <5, 7, 14> <6, 10, 7> <6, 11, 7> <6, 11, 13> <7, 11, 13> <9, 2, 7> <9, 7, 13> <10, 4, 6> <10, 4, 7> <10, 6, 7> <11, 13, 7>]
