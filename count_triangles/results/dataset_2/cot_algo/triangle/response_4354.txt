Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:

Node 5: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 0: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5

Now, we will look at the edges starting from the ones where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

(5, 9): Forms a triangle with node 4
(5, 8): Forms a triangle with node 2
(5, 1): Forms a triangle with node 0
(9, 4): Doesn't form a triangle
(9, 7): Doesn't form a triangle
(1, 3): Doesn't form a triangle
(4, 6): Forms a triangle with node 0
(8, 2): Doesn't form a triangle
(8, 6): Doesn't form a triangle
(2, 6): Forms a triangle with node 0

Now, let's count the total number of triangles [3] and list the unique triangles found inside <>:

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <5, 9, 4>, <5, 8, 2>, <5, 1, 0>
