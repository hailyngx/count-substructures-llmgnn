Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
