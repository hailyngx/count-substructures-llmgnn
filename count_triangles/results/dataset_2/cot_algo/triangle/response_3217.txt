Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 22) (15, 5) (27, 15) (27, 8) (8, 27) (8, 23) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 11) (23, 15) (23, 8) (23, 3) (23, 6) (26, 28) (26, 24) (26, 14) (26, 6) (26, 17) (28, 26) (28, 0) (28, 17) (0, 28) (7, 3) (7, 5) (24, 26) (24, 4) (24, 22) (9, 29) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 21) (29, 9) (29, 19) (29, 12) (29, 21) (29, 18) (14, 26) (14, 3) (14, 20) (1, 11) (1, 25) (6, 23) (6, 26) (6, 10) (17, 26) (17, 28) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 22) (18, 9) (18, 29) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 3) (3, 23) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 18) (3, 10) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 22) (19, 29) (19, 25) (20, 14) (2, 9) (2, 21) (10, 6) (10, 3) (12, 29) (12, 18) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 22) (22, 15) (22, 24) (22, 25) (22, 11) (22, 16) (4, 13) (4, 24) (21, 9) (21, 29) (21, 2) (21, 5) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 21) 

Response:
The graph has 30 nodes with 90 edges. Here is the sorted list of nodes with their degrees:
(0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 3) (4, 3) (5, 3) (7, 3) (10, 3) (12, 3) (14, 3) (19, 3) (20, 1) (21, 4) (25, 3) (28, 4) (29, 5) (3, 6) (6, 5) (8, 2) (13, 3) (16, 4) (18, 5) (23, 4) (26, 5) (27, 2) (15, 4) (9, 4) (11, 3) (17, 3) (22, 6) (24, 3)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles:

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 6, 26>
<3, 6, 23>
<3, 6, 10>
<3, 6, 14>
<3, 7, 5>
