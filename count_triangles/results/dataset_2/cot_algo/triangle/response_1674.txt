Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 8) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 14) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (4, 9) (4, 0) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 10) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
- 0: (1, 3, 4, 13)
- 1: (0, 2, 12, 13)
- 2: (1, 5, 6, 13)
- 3: (0, 8, 11)
- 4: (0, 9)
- 5: (2, 5, 9, 10, 12, 14)
- 6: (2, 7, 8, 12)
- 7: (6, 9, 10, 11, 14)
- 8: (3, 6, 9, 14)
- 9: (4, 5, 7, 8, 11)
- 10: (5, 7, 10, 11, 12)
- 11: (3, 7, 9, 10, 13)
- 12: (1, 5, 6, 10)
- 13: (1, 2, 11, 0)
- 14: (5, 7, 8)

Now, let's order the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections) from least to most:
Vertices order: 0(4), 9(5), 3(3), 4(2), 1(4), 6(4), 14(3), 2(4), 12(4), 10(5), 13(4), 8(4), 7(5), 11(5), 5(6)

Now, we will count the number of triangles:
Triangles: [34]

Unique triangles:
<5, 10, 12>
<5, 10, 11>
<5, 10, 7>
<5, 10, 12>
<5, 6, 12>
<5, 6, 2>
<5, 6, 2>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 1>
<9, 11, 13>
<9, 11, 7>
<9, 11, 7>
<9, 11, 7>
<9, 11, 13>
<9, 11, 13>
