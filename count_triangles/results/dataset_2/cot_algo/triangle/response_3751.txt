Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
0 -- 3 -- 6 -- 9
|    |    |    |
5 -- 1 -- 2    |
|         |    |
4 --------- 8 -- 7
```

Now, let's sort the vertices by their degree:

Vertices: 0, 7, 8 --> Degree: 1

Vertices: 5, 7, 9 --> Degree: 2

Vertices: 2, 4 --> Degree: 3

Vertices: 1, 6 --> Degree: 5

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found: <3, 4, 5>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 5>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
