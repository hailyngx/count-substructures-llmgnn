Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 18) (15, 7) (15, 9) (18, 3) (18, 22) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 10) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 7) (23, 16) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 0) (10, 22) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 1) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 24) (17, 19) (17, 27) (4, 8) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 20) (28, 6) (28, 12) (28, 14) (28, 25) (21, 0) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 20) (24, 17) (24, 1) (26, 12) (0, 8) (0, 21) (0, 29) (7, 15) (7, 23) (7, 10) (7, 2) (2, 7) (2, 27) (2, 20) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 24) (11, 25) (11, 29) (12, 28) (12, 26) (12, 20) (12, 9) (20, 6) (20, 13) (20, 2) (20, 12) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 16) (25, 6) (25, 28) (25, 13) (25, 11) (25, 19) (29, 0) (29, 11) (14, 28) (27, 17) (27, 2) (27, 19) (19, 17) (19, 25) (19, 27) (16, 23) (16, 8) (16, 9) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are as follows:
Vertices: 26, 14, 5, 3, 15, 6, 11, 4, 0, 21, 1, 2, 12, 13, 29, 7, 22, 23, 10, 8, 16, 9, 19, 17, 25, 20, 27, 24, 18, 28

Based on the given edges and the sorted vertices, the triangles in the graph are:
[<0, 8, 23>, <0, 8, 16>, <0, 8, 4>, <0, 8, 29>, <0, 21, 2>, <1, 5, 13>, <1, 5, 24>, <1, 10, 24>, <2, 7, 10>, <2, 7, 20>, <2, 7, 27>, <2, 10, 20>, <4, 8, 16>, <5, 13, 20>, <6, 12, 28>, <7, 10, 20>, <7, 10, 27>, <8, 16, 23>, <9, 12, 16>, <9, 12, 20>, <9, 12, 25>, <9, 15, 16>, <10, 17, 24>, <10, 17, 27>, <12, 16, 20>, <13, 20, 25>, <17, 19, 27>, <17, 24, 27>, <19, 24, 27>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is:
[29]
