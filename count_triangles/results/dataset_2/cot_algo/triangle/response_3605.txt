Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 16) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 0) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 13) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 11) (16, 17) (16, 1) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 11) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 9) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 13) (11, 7) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 12) (9, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 10) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 18) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: 2, 6, 7
- 1: 13, 16, 17
- 2: 0, 9
- 3: 4, 5, 10
- 4: 3, 6, 7, 12
- 5: 3, 6, 8, 15
- 6: 0, 4, 5
- 7: 0, 4, 11, 15
- 8: 5, 8, 10, 11
- 9: 2, 12
- 10: 3, 8, 10, 19
- 11: 7, 8, 11, 12, 15
- 12: 4, 9, 11
- 13: 1, 15, 18
- 14: 17
- 15: 5, 7, 11, 13, 18
- 16: 1, 17
- 17: 1, 14, 16
- 18: 13, 15, 19
- 19: 8, 10, 18

Now, let's use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles. 

[Total number of triangles: 21]

<0, 4, 7>
<0, 7, 11>
<0, 11, 15>
<2, 0, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 15>
<3, 10, 4>
<5, 6, 15>
<5, 7, 15>
<8, 5, 15>
<8, 5, 11>
<8, 10, 19>
<11, 7, 15>
<11, 8, 15>
<12, 4, 11>
<12, 9, 11>
<13, 1, 15>
<18, 15, 19>
