Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 2) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 10) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 14) (11, 12) (11, 0) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 4) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 10) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 13), (1, 9), (1, 7), (3, 9), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 4), (8, 2), (8, 9), (8, 14), (13, 5), (13, 2), (7, 12), (7, 6), (7, 10), (12, 0), (12, 11), (12, 9), (0, 14), (0, 11), (0, 4), (14, 6), (14, 9), (5, 6), (5, 10), (2, 0), (2, 13), (9, 12), (4, 6), (4, 10)

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 7 has degree 4
Node 8 has degree 3
Node 10 has degree 3
Node 11 has degree 3
Node 14 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 5
Node 3 has degree 5
Node 12 has degree 4
Node 0 has degree 4
Node 13 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 5
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 5
Node 4 has degree 4
Node 6 has degree 4

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we get:
Total number of triangles: [12]
Unique triangles found: <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 13>, <1, 7, 12>, <1, 7, 6>, <1, 7, 10>, <3, 9, 12>, <3, 5, 1>, <3, 5, 6>, <5, 7, 1>, <5, 13, 1>, <7, 12, 0>
