Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 26) (15, 6) (27, 15) (27, 11) (27, 17) (27, 19) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 11) (29, 2) (29, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (3, 29) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 27) (11, 2) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 26) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 0) (12, 3) (18, 28) (6, 15) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 25) (28, 18) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 5) (28, 20) (9, 28) (9, 22) (9, 17) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 17) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 20) (7, 19) (16, 13) (16, 7) (16, 24) (16, 14) (17, 27) (17, 9) (17, 22) (17, 21) (25, 6) (24, 6) (24, 16) (24, 5) (4, 10) (4, 22) (4, 21) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 28) (5, 24) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 16) (14, 21) (20, 28) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 21) (26, 15) (26, 8) (26, 20) (21, 17) (21, 4) (21, 14) (21, 20) (19, 27) (19, 7) (0, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree. 

Here is the list of nodes with their degrees:
Node 0: 1
Node 1: 3
Node 2: 3
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 4
Node 5: 5
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 4
Node 8: 2
Node 9: 3
Node 10: 2
Node 11: 5
Node 12: 1
Node 13: 4
Node 14: 3
Node 15: 3
Node 16: 4
Node 17: 4
Node 18: 1
Node 19: 2
Node 20: 4
Node 21: 4
Node 22: 3
Node 24: 4
Node 25: 2
Node 26: 3
Node 27: 4
Node 28: 5
Node 29: 3

Now, we will relabel the nodes from 0 to 29 based on their degrees:
Node 0: 0
Node 10: 1
Node 18: 2
Node 8: 3
Node 19: 4
Node 29: 5
Node 1: 6
Node 2: 7
Node 15: 8
Node 12: 9
Node 6: 10
Node 24: 11
Node 25: 12
Node 26: 13
Node 5: 14
Node 8: 15
Node 9: 16
Node 3: 17
Node 13: 18
Node 14: 19
Node 21: 20
Node 4: 21
Node 22: 22
Node 28: 23
Node 20: 24
Node 7: 25
Node 16: 26
Node 17: 27
Node 11: 28
Node 27: 29

Now, we will list the triangles:
[<1, 2, 29>, <5, 8, 9>, <16, 20, 23>, <16, 20, 21>, <16, 14, 21>, <16, 7, 21>, <16, 24, 26>, <16, 24, 5>, <16, 14, 2>, <14, 3, 1>, <20, 7, 25>, <20, 7, 19>, <24, 5, 8>, <26, 15, 27>] 

Total number of triangles: [14]
