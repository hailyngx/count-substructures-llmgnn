Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
   Node 9 (degree 2)
   Node 1 (degree 3)
   Node 6 (degree 3)
   Node 5 (degree 4)
   Node 8 (degree 4)
   Node 7 (degree 5)
   Node 3 (degree 5)
   Node 2 (degree 5)
   Node 0 (degree 6)
   Node 4 (degree 6)

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:  
   Node 9 -> Node 0
   Node 1 -> Node 1
   Node 6 -> Node 2
   Node 5 -> Node 3
   Node 8 -> Node 4
   Node 7 -> Node 5
   Node 3 -> Node 6
   Node 2 -> Node 7
   Node 0 -> Node 8
   Node 4 -> Node 9

3. Count the triangles:
   - For the edge (4, 7), proceed as the vertex with the lower label (Node 4) has fewer connections:
     Shared connections between Node 4 and Node 7 are Node 2 and Node 8, forming a triangle <4, 7, 2>.
   - For other edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, check for shared connections:
     <0, 1, 5>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 8, 3>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 8>

4. Output:
   The total number of triangles is [9].
   The unique triangles found are: <4, 7, 2>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 8, 3>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 9>.
