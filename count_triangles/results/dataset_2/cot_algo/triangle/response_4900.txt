Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 3), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 1), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 8), (3, 9), (8, 5), (8, 6), (5, 8), (6, 0), (2, 3)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order: 

Nodes Sorted: {0(2), 2(2), 9(2), 8(3), 6(4), 5(4), 1(5), 7(5), 3(6), 4(6)}

Now, we will list the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 4>, <2, 3, 1>, <2, 6, 1>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 6, 5>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 6, 4>, <9, 3, 1>, <9, 3, 8>, <9, 6, 1>, <9, 6, 8>, <9, 3, 6>, <9, 6, 8>, <9, 3, 5>, <9, 6, 5>, <9, 3, 4>, <9, 6, 4>

Total number of triangles: [24]
