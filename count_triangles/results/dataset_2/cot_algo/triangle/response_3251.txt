Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 23) (9, 19) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 2) (3, 21) (3, 22) (3, 8) (15, 0) (15, 17) (25, 16) (25, 12) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 16) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 21) (4, 10) (8, 3) (8, 5) (13, 26) (13, 20) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 20) (20, 13) (20, 5) (20, 11) (21, 3) (21, 17) (21, 0) (21, 11) (21, 29) (24, 26) (24, 18) (24, 19) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 21) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 22) (2, 26) (2, 5) (2, 22) (2, 28) (22, 3) (22, 7) (22, 2) (22, 27) (11, 20) (11, 21) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 6) (18, 24) (18, 11) (18, 23) (18, 1) (23, 9) (23, 18) (23, 1) (23, 28) (6, 14) (1, 18) (1, 23) (29, 21) (29, 12) (27, 22) (27, 16) (19, 9) (19, 17) (19, 24) (16, 25) (16, 10) (16, 27) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 29) (12, 28) (28, 2) (28, 23) (28, 12) 

Response:
The nodes are as follows in the decreasing order of their degrees:
\[ (29, 4), (7, 4), (6, 3), (18, 3), (1, 3), (9, 2), (26, 2), (15, 2), (5, 2), (20, 2), (21, 2), (24, 2), (0, 2), (2, 2), (27, 2), (13, 2), (10, 2), (22, 2), (11, 2), (28, 2), (12, 2), (16, 2), (3, 2), (17, 2), (14, 2), (23, 2), (19, 2), (8, 2), (25, 2) \]

After relabeling the nodes accordingly, the ordered list of edges to be processed is:
\[ (29, 12), (7, 0), (6, 14), (18, 24), (1, 23), (9, 19), (26, 13), (15, 0), (5, 8), (20, 13), (21, 3), (24, 26), (0, 5), (2, 26), (27, 22), (13, 26), (10, 17), (22, 7), (11, 20), (28, 2), (12, 25), (16, 25), (3, 21), (17, 15), (14, 7), (23, 18), (19, 17), (8, 3) \]

By examining shared connections, we find that the total number of triangles within the given graph is 72. 

The unique triangles found are:
\[ <3, 8, 5>, <3, 21, 0>, <3, 21, 22>, <3, 21, 11>, <3, 8, 0>, <3, 17, 10>, <21, 11, 20>, <21, 11, 14>, <21, 0, 5>, <21, 0, 7>, <21, 29, 12>, <21, 29, 16>, <21, 29, 27>, <21, 24, 18>, <21, 24, 23>, <21, 24, 19>, <21, 13, 26>, <21, 13, 20>, <21, 13, 11>, <21, 2, 5>, <21, 2, 22>, <21, 2, 28>, <21, 22, 27>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 7, 14>, <0, 5, 20>, <0, 5, 18>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 5, 22>, <0, 7, 22>, <5, 20, 13>, <5, 20, 11>, <5, 20, 14>, <5, 20, 6>, <5, 22, 2>, <5, 22, 27>, <5, 22, 28>, <5, 22, 7>, <5, 2, 26>, <5, 2, 28>, <5, 2, 23>, <5, 8, 3>, <8, 3, 17>, <13, 26, 20>, <13, 26, 24>, <13, 20, 11>, <13, 20, 14>, <13, 20, 6>, <13, 20, 18>, <17, 10, 16>, <17, 10, 4>, <17, 10, 25>, <17, 10, 12>, <17, 10, 29>, <17, 4, 10>, <17, 16, 10>, <17, 16, 25>, <17, 16, 27>, <17, 16, 12>, <17, 12, 25>, <17, 12, 29>, <17, 12, 28>, <24, 26, 18>, <24, 26, 23>, <24, 26, 19>, <24, 18, 11>, <24, 19, 9> \]
