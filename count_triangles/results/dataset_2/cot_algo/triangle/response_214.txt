Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 7) (4, 7) (7, 17) (7, 4) (7, 19) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 15) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 0) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 2) (1, 15) (1, 16) (15, 5) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 9) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 8) (0, 13) (0, 15) (0, 9) (6, 17) (6, 16) (6, 8) (9, 15) (9, 0) (10, 19) (10, 16) (16, 14) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 8) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 6) (8, 16) (2, 3) (2, 11) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (0, 13), (0, 15), (0, 9), (1, 15), (1, 16), (2, 3), (2, 11), (3, 13), (3, 11), (5, 12), (5, 13), (5, 15), (5, 18), (6, 8), (6, 16), (6, 17), (7, 4), (7, 17), (7, 19), (8, 6), (8, 11), (8, 12), (8, 16), (9, 0), (9, 15), (10, 16), (10, 19), (11, 2), (11, 3), (11, 8), (13, 0), (13, 5), (13, 12), (13, 15), (13, 3), (14, 16), (14, 17), (15, 0), (15, 1), (15, 5), (15, 13), (15, 9), (16, 1), (16, 6), (16, 8), (16, 10), (16, 14), (17, 6), (17, 7), (17, 14), (17, 19), (18, 5), (19, 7), (19, 10), (19, 17)
 
Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

After sorting the nodes by their degrees in ascending order, we get the following order:
Nodes: 2, 18, 4, 10, 9, 1, 12 , 0, 19, 14, 11, 3, 7, 18, 6, 8, 5, 16, 17, 13

Applying the edge conditions while counting triangles, we find that there are:
Total number of triangles: [17]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 13, 15>, <0, 13, 5>, <0, 13, 9>, <0, 15, 1>, <0, 15, 5>, <0, 15, 13>, <0, 15, 9>, <0, 5, 13>, <1, 15, 5>, <1, 15, 13>, <1, 15, 0>, <4, 7, 17>, <5, 15, 13>, <5, 15, 0>, <5, 13, 0>, <6, 16, 8>, <7, 17, 19>
