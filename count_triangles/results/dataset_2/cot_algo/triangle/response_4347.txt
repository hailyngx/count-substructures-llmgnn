Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (7, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 10) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted based on their number of connections are: 7, 11, 2, 5, 9, 13, 10, 4, 6, 1, 3, 12, 14, 0, 8.

We will list the triangles based on the edges provided:
- Triangle 1: <0, 5, 1>
- Triangle 2: <0, 9, 1>
- Triangle 3: <0, 4, 10>
- Triangle 4: <0, 3, 12>
- Triangle 5: <1, 5, 11>
- Triangle 6: <1, 8, 14>
- Triangle 7: <1, 11, 2>
- Triangle 8: <3, 4, 12>
- Triangle 9: <4, 8, 12>
- Triangle 10: <6, 3, 12>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
