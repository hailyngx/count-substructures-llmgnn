Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 10) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 18) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 19) (2, 13) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 17) (8, 0) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 14) (18, 1) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 14) (15, 7) (15, 19) (19, 9) (19, 12) (19, 15) (11, 18) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 16) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 2) (16, 5) (16, 10) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 18) (17, 12) (17, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Nodes with their degrees:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 2
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 1
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 15: degree 3
Node 16: degree 2
Node 17: degree 2
Node 18: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4

Now, we relabel the nodes based on degree:
Node 11: degree 1
Nodes 2, 9, 16, 17: degree 2
Nodes 0, 6, 8: degree 3
Nodes 3, 10, 15: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Nodes 1, 4, 7, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19: degree 4
