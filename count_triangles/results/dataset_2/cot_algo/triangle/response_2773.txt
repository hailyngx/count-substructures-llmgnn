Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 16) (9, 6) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 7) (3, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 13) (17, 13) (17, 4) (17, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 18) (0, 13) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 15) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 18) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 4) (15, 8) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 2) (19, 15) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 15) (12, 6) (12, 8) (18, 13) (18, 7) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 11) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are as follows: 
Node 16: 3 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 18: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 12: 2 connections
Node 19: 2 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 17: 3 connections
Node 15: 4 connections

Based on the sorted vertices and the given edges, we can count the number of triangles by looking at the shared connections between nodes connected by an edge with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
Triangles:
<1, 7, 11>
<1, 7, 18>
<2, 4, 11>
<2, 4, 13>
<2, 4, 17>
<2, 8, 12>
<2, 8, 15>
<2, 13, 17>
<3, 7, 14>
<4, 7, 17>
<4, 11, 17>
<6, 9, 10>
<7, 11, 17>
<7, 11, 14>
<8, 12, 15>
<13, 17, 18>

Total number of triangles: [16]
