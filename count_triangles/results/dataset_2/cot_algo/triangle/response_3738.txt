Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 5) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 10) (3, 16) (10, 3) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 6) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 9) (5, 17) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 16) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 7) (8, 0) (8, 19) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (18, 0) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 13) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 9) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 13) (15, 14) (2, 4) (2, 9) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 18) (13, 7) (13, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method focuses on counting triangles efficiently. 
Let's begin by sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):

Vertices in increasing order of degrees: 
Vertex 2: Degree 2
Vertex 3: Degree 2
Vertex 15: Degree 2
Vertex 17: Degree 4
Vertex 19: Degree 4
Vertex 0: Degree 5
Vertex 4: Degree 5
Vertex 7: Degree 3
Vertex 14: Degree 3
Vertex 1: Degree 4
Vertex 5: Degree 5
Vertex 6: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 3
Vertex 10: Degree 3
Vertex 12: Degree 4
Vertex 16: Degree 4
Vertex 9: Degree 4
Vertex 11: Degree 2
Vertex 13: Degree 3
Vertex 18: Degree 5

Based on this ordering, we identify triangles using the given edges.
Count of triangles: [22]
