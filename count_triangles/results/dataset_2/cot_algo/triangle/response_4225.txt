Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (11, 12) (11, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 4) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 0) 

Response:
The vertices and their corresponding degrees are as follows:
- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 6
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 6
- Vertex 5: degree 4
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 6
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 4
- Vertex 10: degree 4
- Vertex 11: degree 3
- Vertex 12: degree 3
- Vertex 13: degree 5
- Vertex 14: degree 5

Based on the degrees, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Vertex 0: label 0
- Vertex 3: label 1
- Vertex 11: label 2
- Vertex 12: label 3
- Vertex 6: label 4
- Vertex 8: label 5
- Vertex 2: label 6
- Vertex 5: label 7
- Vertex 10: label 8
- Vertex 9: label 9
- Vertex 1: label 10
- Vertex 4: label 11
- Vertex 13: label 12
- Vertex 14: label 13
- Vertex 7: label 14

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles:

There are [34] triangles in total.
The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 9, 13>
<1, 4, 10>
<1, 4, 13>
<1, 7, 14>
<1, 8, 10>
<1, 8, 14>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 11>
<3, 4, 14>
<5, 7, 13>
<7, 9, 13>
<7, 12, 14>
<8, 10, 13>
<10, 13, 14>
