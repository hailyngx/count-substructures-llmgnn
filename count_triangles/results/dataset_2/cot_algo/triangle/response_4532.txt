Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 22) (11, 8) (16, 21) (3, 15) (3, 17) (15, 3) (15, 23) (15, 9) (15, 29) (6, 9) (6, 22) (6, 8) (9, 15) (9, 6) (9, 29) (7, 21) (7, 20) (7, 1) (21, 16) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 24) (14, 20) (17, 3) (17, 20) (17, 19) (17, 2) (27, 4) (27, 28) (27, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 23) (8, 25) (23, 15) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 1) (1, 7) (1, 23) (1, 26) (1, 2) (26, 1) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 13) (26, 12) (20, 7) (20, 14) (20, 17) (20, 13) (28, 21) (28, 27) (28, 18) (22, 11) (22, 6) (22, 26) (22, 29) (2, 17) (2, 23) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 27) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 25) (18, 26) (18, 28) (18, 24) (29, 15) (29, 9) (29, 22) (29, 25) (5, 27) (19, 17) (19, 24) (12, 21) (12, 26) (12, 4) (13, 26) (13, 20) (13, 24) (25, 8) (25, 4) (25, 29) (24, 21) (24, 18) (24, 19) (24, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices with the number of connections:
1: 4 connections
7: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
9: 4 connections
17: 4 connections
21: 5 connections
20: 4 connections
15: 5 connections
2: 4 connections
26: 5 connections
27: 3 connections
28: 3 connections
22: 4 connections
6: 3 connections
8: 4 connections
23: 4 connections
13: 3 connections
4: 4 connections
25: 3 connections
12: 3 connections
29: 4 connections
16: 1 connection
14: 2 connections
18: 3 connections
19: 3 connections
5: 1 connection

Based on the sorted list of vertices, we will proceed with counting triangles. After checking all the edges, the total number of triangles is 13. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<15, 9, 6>
<8, 23, 1>
<1, 7, 21>
<1, 2, 23>
<1, 7, 20>
<1, 2, 4>
<9, 29, 22>
<17, 3, 15>
<4, 27, 5>
<20, 13, 26>
<24, 19, 13>
<24, 21, 12>
<24, 18, 28> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [13].
