Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 18) (7, 1) (7, 17) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 18) (8, 16) (13, 15) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 19) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 15) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 12) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 15) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 11) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 9) (19, 1) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 9) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 19) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 5) (16, 8) (16, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 20 nodes and the given 60 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 17) 
(7, 4) (7, 18) (7, 1) (7, 17) 
(1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 19) 
(3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 18) 
(8, 16) 
(13, 15) 
(5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 16) 
(6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) 
(0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 2) 
(14, 19) (14, 10) 
(2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
(10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 15) 
(15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 12) 
(12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 15) 
(17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 11) 
(11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 9) 
(19, 1) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 9) 
(9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 19) 
(18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 5) 
(16, 8) (16, 5)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes with their degrees: 
0 (3), 1 (4), 2 (3), 3 (3), 4 (4), 5 (3), 6 (3), 7 (4), 8 (1), 9 (3), 10 (3), 11 (4), 12 (3), 13 (1), 14 (2), 15 (3), 16 (2), 17 (4), 18 (3), 19 (4)

Based on this degree-based ordering, we relabel the nodes as follows:
Node ordering: 8, 13, 14, 16, 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 1, 15, 18, 4, 7, 11, 17, 19

Now, we will count the triangles based on the shared connections between vertices:
[Total number of triangles: 6]
<2, 4, 6>, <5, 6, 17>, <4, 7, 17>, <1, 7, 17>, <11, 17, 19>, <0, 9, 12>
