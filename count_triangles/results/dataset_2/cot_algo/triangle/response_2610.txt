Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 4) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 4) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 13) (13, 7) (13, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 10), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 14), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 12), (3, 4), (3, 12), (3, 0), (4, 6), (4, 13), (4, 14), (5, 9), (5, 10), (5, 12), (5, 14), (6, 8), (6, 14), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 13), (8, 11), (8, 14), (9, 11), (10, 11), (11, 9), (12, 14), (13, 7)

Degree-Based Ordering:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Nodes with degree 2: 1, 6, 9
Nodes with degree 3: 11, 13
Nodes with degree 4: 0, 7, 8
Nodes with degree 5: 10
Nodes with degree 6: 12
Nodes with degree 7: 2, 3, 5, 14
Nodes with degree 8: 4
