Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 12) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 12) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Here are the nodes sorted by their number of connections in ascending order:
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 12: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 14: Degree 6
Node 8: Degree 6
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will look at the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

Counting the number of triangles gives us a total of [20] triangles.
Unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 1, 14>
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 14, 2>
<0, 14, 3>
<1, 9, 13>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 14>
<1, 2, 10>
<3, 4, 2>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 14>
<3, 4, 12>
<4, 8, 7>
<4, 8, 11>
<8, 10, 2>
<10, 11, 7>
<10, 14, 6>
