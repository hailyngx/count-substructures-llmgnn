Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 16) (4, 14) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 16) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 16) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 0) (18, 11) (18, 0) (18, 7) (19, 12) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 7) (7, 18) (7, 11) (7, 13) (3, 9) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 13) (15, 4) (15, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 15) (0, 12) (10, 13) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 19) (12, 0) (1, 9) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 10) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) 
(9, 3) (9, 1)
(14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4)
(17, 16)
(4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 15)
(8, 2) (8, 16)
(6, 13)
(2, 0)
(18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 0)
(19, 12)
(7, 13)
(3, 9)
(16, 13)
(15, 0) (15, 4)
(0, 12)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes by degree: 10, 1, 4, 6, 7, 16, 0, 5, 12, 8, 11, 13, 14, 17, 2, 3, 15, 18, 9, 19

After relabelling based on degrees, the edges to consider are:
(9, 5), (9, 3), (9, 1), (17, 14), (17, 16), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 15), (8, 2), (6, 13), (18, 7), (18, 11), (7, 13), (16, 13), (15, 0), (0, 12)

Now, counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
[Total number of triangles: 10]

Unique triangles found:
<5, 4, 6>
<5, 4, 15>
<8, 4, 6>
<8, 4, 15>
<4, 0, 12>
<16, 13, 6>
<16, 13, 7>
<0, 12, 18>
<7, 13, 6>
<18, 7, 11>
