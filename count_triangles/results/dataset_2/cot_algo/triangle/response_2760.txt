Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 2) (1, 8) (1, 14) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method works as follows:
1. Sort vertices based on their degree in ascending order.
2. Relabel the vertices accordingly.
3. For each edge, only consider it if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
4. Check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to find triangles.

After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling is as follows:
Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 2
Vertex 10: degree 2
Vertex 5: degree 5
Vertex 8: degree 3
Vertex 14: degree 4
Vertex 9: degree 6
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 7: degree 2
Vertex 11: degree 6
Vertex 2: degree 4
Vertex 12: degree 5
Vertex 13: degree 5
Vertex 3: degree 6
Vertex 6: degree 4

Now, let's go through the edges and count the triangles formed by each edge:
1. (5, 9): Triangle <5, 9, X>
2. (5, 13): No triangles
3. (5, 12): No triangles
4. (5, 0): No triangles
5. (5, 7): No triangles
6. (9, 8): No triangles
7. (9, 4): No triangles
8. (4, 7): No triangles
9. (10, 0): No triangles
10. (11, 14): Triangle <11, 14, X>
11. (8, 6): No triangles
12. (13, 6): Triangle <13, 6, X>
13. (0, 10): No triangles
14. (2, 6): Triangle <2, 6, X>

The total number of triangles found is 3, and they are <5, 9, X>, <11, 14, X>, <2, 6, X>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
