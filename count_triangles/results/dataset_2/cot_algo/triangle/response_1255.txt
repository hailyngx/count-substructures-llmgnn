Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 2) (14, 8) (14, 12) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 12) 

Response:
The degrees of each vertex are as follows:
Vertex 0 degree: 4
Vertex 1 degree: 4
Vertex 2 degree: 4
Vertex 3 degree: 6
Vertex 4 degree: 4
Vertex 5 degree: 5
Vertex 6 degree: 5
Vertex 7 degree: 3
Vertex 8 degree: 5
Vertex 9 degree: 4
Vertex 10 degree: 2
Vertex 11 degree: 5
Vertex 12 degree: 4
Vertex 13 degree: 3
Vertex 14 degree: 2

By labeling the vertices in increasing order of their degrees:
Vertex 10 (degree 2) - relabeled as 0
Vertex 13 (degree 3) - relabeled as 1
Vertex 14 (degree 2) - relabeled as 2
Vertex 7 (degree 3) - relabeled as 3
Vertex 9 (degree 4) - relabeled as 4
Vertex 0 (degree 4) - relabeled as 5
Vertex 1 (degree 4) - relabeled as 6
Vertex 4 (degree 4) - relabeled as 7
Vertex 12 (degree 4) - relabeled as 8
Vertex 2 (degree 4) - relabeled as 9
Vertex 3 (degree 6) - relabeled as 10
Vertex 8 (degree 5) - relabeled as 11
Vertex 6 (degree 5) - relabeled as 12
Vertex 11 (degree 5) - relabeled as 13
Vertex 5 (degree 5) - relabeled as 14

Now, we will count the number of triangles:
- For edge (10, 4): Shared connections: None
- For edge (13, 2): Shared connections: None
- For edge (14, 8): Shared connections: None
- For edge (7, 4): Shared connections: None
- For edge (9, 5): Shared connections: 3 (with 4, 1, 0) -> Triangle <4, 5, 9>
- For edge (0, 5): Shared connections: 3 (with 1, 9, 3) -> Triangle <1, 5, 0>
- For edge (8, 6): Shared connections: 3 (with 4, 12, 3) -> Triangle <4, 6, 8>
- For edge (13, 8): Shared connections: 2 (with 0, 4) -> Triangle <0, 8, 13>
- For edge (12, 8): Shared connections: None
- For edge (12, 3): Shared connections: 2 (with 6, 8) -> Triangle <6, 8, 12>
- For edge (12, 0): Shared connections: 2 (with 8, 5) -> Triangle <0, 5, 12>
- For edge (6, 4): Shared connections: 2 (with 8, 3) -> Triangle <3, 4, 6>
  
Total number of triangles: [5]

Therefore, the total number of triangles is 5.
