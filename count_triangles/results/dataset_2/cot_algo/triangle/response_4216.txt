Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 13) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 8) (4, 15) (4, 9) (7, 9) (7, 1) (10, 0) (10, 18) (8, 14) (8, 17) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 6) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 6) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 5) (19, 15) (19, 9) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 6) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 11) (12, 1) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 19) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 0) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 16) (11, 18) (11, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows the steps below:

1. Calculate the degree of each node:
   - Node 0 has degree 3
   - Node 1 has degree 4
   - Node 2 has degree 3
   - Node 3 has degree 4
   - Node 4 has degree 3
   - Node 5 has degree 2
   - Node 6 has degree 3
   - Node 7 has degree 2
   - Node 8 has degree 3
   - Node 9 has degree 4
   - Node 10 has degree 2
   - Node 11 has degree 2
   - Node 12 has degree 5
   - Node 13 has degree 4
   - Node 14 has degree 5
   - Node 15 has degree 3
   - Node 16 has degree 3
   - Node 17 has degree 4
   - Node 18 has degree 4
   - Node 19 has degree 3

2. Sort nodes based on their degrees:
   - Nodes by degree: [5, 7, 10, 11, 15, 0, 4, 6, 8, 2, 19, 1, 3, 9, 16, 17, 18, 13, 14, 12]

3. Relabel the nodes according to their sorted order:
   - Relabeled nodes: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5, 6: 6, 7: 7, 8: 8, 9: 9, 10: 10, 11: 11, 12: 12, 13: 13, 14: 14, 15: 15, 16: 16, 17: 17, 18: 18, 19: 19}

4. For each edge, count the number of triangles:
   - Triangles: [222]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [222]. The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 14>, <1, 13, 14>, <3, 4, 13>, <3, 12, 17>.
