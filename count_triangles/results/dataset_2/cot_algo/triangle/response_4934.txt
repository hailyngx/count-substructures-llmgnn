Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 21) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (22, 9) (22, 10) (24, 7) (24, 13) (26, 6) (26, 0) (26, 12) (4, 9) (4, 28) (27, 20) (27, 2) (27, 8) (16, 28) (16, 19) (28, 4) (28, 16) (28, 3) (28, 19) (8, 9) (8, 27) (8, 25) (8, 21) (10, 22) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 13) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 2) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 18) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (7, 24) (7, 3) (7, 19) (0, 9) (0, 26) (0, 3) (11, 1) (11, 21) (11, 29) (18, 1) (18, 20) (18, 13) (6, 26) (6, 15) (29, 14) (29, 11) (12, 26) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 24) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 12) (2, 27) (2, 15) (2, 3) (2, 21) (19, 16) (19, 28) (19, 7) (20, 27) (20, 18) (20, 5) (25, 8) (25, 21) (21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 11) (21, 2) (21, 25) (5, 15) (5, 20) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 9), (0, 26),
(1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 17), (1, 18),
(2, 3), (2, 15), (2, 21), (2, 27),
(3, 7), (3, 28),
(4, 9), (4, 28),
(5, 15), (5, 20),
(6, 15), (6, 26),
(7, 19), (7, 24),
(8, 9), (8, 21), (8, 25), (8, 27),
(9, 22),
(10, 12), (10, 13), (10, 15), (10, 22),
(11, 21), (11, 29),
(12, 13), (12, 26),
(13, 18), (13, 24),
(14, 17), (14, 29),
(15, 16),
(16, 19),
(18, 20),
(19, 28),
(20, 27),
(21, 25),
(22, 25)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles.

Vertices by degree (least to most):
0: 4 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
5: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
7: 3 connections
16: 2 connections
18: 2 connections
20: 3 connections
3: 4 connections
17: 3 connections
11: 3 connections
12: 3 connections
14: 2 connections
8: 4 connections
10: 4 connections
13: 4 connections
15: 4 connections
9: 4 connections
26: 3 connections
24: 2 connections
28: 4 connections
27: 4 connections
21: 5 connections
22: 2 connections
25: 2 connections
29: 2 connections

Given the nature of the task, Emphasize the verification of shared connections of each edge to find triangles.
