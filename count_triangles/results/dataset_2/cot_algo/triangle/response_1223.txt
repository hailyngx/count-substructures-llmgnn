Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 7) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 14) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 5) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 0) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 11, 13, and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 10, 14.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 10, 0, 5, 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 10, 8, 7, 13.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 11, 13, 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 12, 14, 7, 2.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 11, 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 14, 3, 2, 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 12, 3, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 11, 13.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 1, 2.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 14, 0, 4.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 8, 13, 5.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 12, 3, 0.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11, 1, 7, 5.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the nodes based on their degrees:
0(3), 10(3), 12(3), 9(3), 8(4), 2(4), 3(4), 1(3), 5(5), 6(4), 14(4), 7(6), 11(5), 4(4)

Now, let's count the number of triangles:
- Triangle <0, 2, 13>
- Triangle <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle <0, 13, 4>
- Triangle <0, 13, 5>
- Triangle <1, 6, 7>
- Triangle <1, 6, 11>
- Triangle <1, 7, 14> 
- Triangle <2, 7, 14>
- Triangle <3, 7, 14>
- Triangle <3, 8, 12> 
- Triangle <3, 8, 13>
- Triangle <4, 5, 12> 
- Triangle <5, 12, 13>
- Triangle <7, 8, 14> 
- Triangle <11, 6, 4> 

There are a total of [15] triangles in the given graph.
