Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 4) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 17) (12, 9) (12, 10) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 14) (19, 9) (19, 5) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 17) (8, 15) (8, 0) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 0) (2, 3) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 13) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 13) (13, 14) (13, 18) (13, 3) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 17) (17, 7) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 0) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 16) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method proceeds as follows:

Sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:  
Node 11 has 2 connections  
Node 2 has 1 connection  
Node 7 has 3 connections  
Node 8 has 2 connections  
Node 13 has 3 connections  
Node 18 has 3 connections  
Node 3 has 3 connections  
Node 15 has 4 connections  
Node 14 has 4 connections  
Node 5 has 4 connections  
Node 12 has 4 connections  
Node 16 has 4 connections  
Node 19 has 4 connections  
Node 1 has 4 connections  
Node 0 has 4 connections  
Node 17 has 5 connections  
Node 6 has 5 connections  
Node 9 has 5 connections  
Node 10 has 5 connections  
Node 4 has 5 connections  

Next, we label the vertices according to their sorted degree:  
Node 2 -> 0  
Node 11 -> 1  
Node 8 -> 2  
Node 7 -> 3  
Node 13 -> 4  
Node 18 -> 5  
Node 3 -> 6  
Node 5 -> 7  
Node 12 -> 8  
Node 14 -> 9  
Node 15 -> 10  
Node 16 -> 11  
Node 19 -> 12  
Node 1 -> 13  
Node 0 -> 14  
Node 17 -> 15  
Node 6 -> 16  
Node 9 -> 17  
Node 10 -> 18  
Node 4 -> 19  

Now, we go through the edges and count the triangles:  
Triangles:  
<3, 4, 8>  
<3, 4, 9>  
<3, 8, 9>  
<4, 8, 9>  
<5, 7, 9>  
<5, 8, 9>  
<5, 12, 19>  
<5, 14, 19>  
<5, 14, 18>  
<7, 14, 18>  
<8, 14, 18>  
<13, 14, 18>  
<14, 18, 19>  

Total number of triangles: [13]
