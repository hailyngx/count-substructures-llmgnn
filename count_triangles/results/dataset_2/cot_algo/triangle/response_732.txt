Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 10) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 14) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 13) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 13) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degrees. The degrees of each node in this graph are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 5

We will start by relabeling the nodes according to their degrees:
- Node 7: 0
- Node 1: 1
- Node 6: 2
- Node 11: 3
- Node 12: 4
- Node 9: 5
- Node 5: 6
- Node 3: 7
- Node 8: 8
- Node 10: 9
- Node 2: 10
- Node 0: 11
- Node 13: 12
- Node 14: 13
- Node 4: 14

Now, we will list the edges based on the new labeling as follows:
(5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 11) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 4) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 10) (7, 5) (7, 4) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 3) (3, 10) (3, 4) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 13) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 12) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 12) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 12) 

Now, let's count the triangles using this method. 

The total number of triangles is: [9]

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 7, 11>
<3, 11, 12>
<4, 8, 10>
<4, 8, 13>
<4, 10, 12>
<5, 8, 10>
<5, 8, 13>
<5, 9, 12>
<8, 10, 12>
