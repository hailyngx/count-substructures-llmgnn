Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their number of connections. 

The sorted order of nodes based on their degrees is:
(6, 9), (5), (1, 4, 7, 8, 2), (0, 3)

Now, let's count the number of triangles by examining each edge and checking for shared connections. 

Triangles found:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 7, 4>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 2>
<1, 8, 4>
<1, 8, 2>
