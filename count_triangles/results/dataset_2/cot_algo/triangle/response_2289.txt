Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 10) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 10) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 1) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 14) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the total number of triangles in the given graph.

The vertices sorted by the number of connections (degree) are as follows:
Vertex 0: degree 5
Vertex 14: degree 4
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 13: degree 3
Vertex 3: degree 3
Vertex 12: degree 3
Vertex 10: degree 3
Vertex 7: degree 3
Vertex 8: degree 3
Vertex 9: degree 3
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 5
Vertex 11: degree 6
Vertex 5: degree 4
Vertex 6: degree 4

Now, let's count the total number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 12]

<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 12>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 10>
<1, 7, 14>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 10>
<2, 4, 11>
<2, 6, 11>
<3, 7, 12>
<5, 8, 10>
