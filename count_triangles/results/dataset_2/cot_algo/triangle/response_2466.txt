Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 3), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 6), (7, 6), (7, 1), (1, 8), (3, 1), (6, 2)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

Nodes: 0, 5, 8, 4, 7, 1, 6, 2, 9, 3

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check for triangles:

Triangles: <1, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
