Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 9) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 1) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 10) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 12) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections). Here is the sorted list of nodes: 

Node 7: 2 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 11: 5 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 14: 6 connections
Node 4: 6 connections

Now, we will check the edges based on the degree-based ordering: 

1. Check edges (4, 12), (4, 13), (4, 14), (4, 6): No triangles formed.
2. Check edge (7, 1): No triangles formed.
3. Check edges (7, 8), (14, 8), (8, 12), (8, 14), (8, 0): No triangles formed.
4. Check edges (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 10): Formed the following triangles: <1, 5, 10>.
5. Check edges (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 10), (6, 2), (6, 12): Formed the following triangles: <2, 6, 12>.
6. Check edges (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 10), (2, 3), (2, 11): Formed the following triangles: <2, 3, 11>.
7. Check edge (8, 7): No triangles formed.
8. Check edges (0, 14), (14, 4), (14, 8), (14, 11), (14, 9): Formed the following triangles: <0, 9, 11>.
9. Check edges (13, 4), (13, 5), (13, 1): No triangles formed.
10. Check edges (3, 2), (3, 14), (3, 11), (3, 9): No triangles formed.
11. Check edges (11, 2), (11, 0), (11, 14), (11, 3), (11, 1): No triangles formed.
12. Check edges (12, 4), (12, 6), (12, 8), (12, 10): No triangles formed.
13. Check edges (1, 7), (1, 5), (1, 13), (1, 11): No triangles formed.
14. Check edges (10, 5), (10, 6), (10, 2), (10, 12): No triangles formed.
15. Check edges (9, 0), (9, 14), (9, 3): No triangles formed.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3] which are: 
<1, 5, 10>, <2, 6, 12>, <0, 9, 11>.
