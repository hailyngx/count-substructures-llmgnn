Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (9, 15) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 10) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 3) (3, 17) (3, 8) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 12) (15, 9) (15, 7) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 16) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 11) (0, 6) (0, 19) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 8) (19, 4) (19, 11) (19, 0) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 16) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 14) (8, 3) (8, 10) (16, 15) (16, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the nodes based on their degree. After sorting the given graph, the vertices are relabeled as follows:

Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 5
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 2
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 5
Node 16: degree 2
Node 17: degree 2
Node 18: degree 3
Node 19: degree 3

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method with the given edges, we can count the number of triangles. 

The total number of triangles is: [12]

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 12, 13>
<1, 10, 13>
<1, 10, 2>
<1, 12, 4>
<8, 10, 13>
<8, 10, 2>
<10, 13, 2>
<10, 12, 4>
<12, 11, 19>
<4, 12, 6>
<7, 10, 1>
<7, 10, 13>
