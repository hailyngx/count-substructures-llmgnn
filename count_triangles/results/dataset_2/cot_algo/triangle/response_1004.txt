Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (4, 0) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 11) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 2) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 14) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 10) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 2) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 4) 

Response:
Let's construct a graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 11), (6, 8), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 13), (9, 0), (0, 4), (0, 12), (0, 1), (7, 2), (8, 5), (8, 14), (4, 13), (4, 5), (4, 11), (12, 10), (11, 1), (12, 14), (3, 10), (14, 2)

To count triangles, we will use Degree-Based Ordering:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
   Vertices by degrees: {3, 1, 2, 10, 12, 13, 7, 11, 5, 14, 4, 6, 8, 0, 9}

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly: 
   Relabeled vertices: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Now, we will count the triangles formed by each edge:

Triangles: [30]
Unique triangles found: <6, 9, 7>, <6, 9, 13>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 13>, <6, 11, 1>, <6, 11, 4>, <6, 8, 5>, <9, 3, 0>, <9, 3, 7>, <9, 3, 10>, <9, 7, 2>, <9, 7, 13>, <9, 0, 1>, <9, 0, 4>, <9, 13, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 11>, <0, 1, 11>, <7, 2, 14>, <11, 1, 14>, <5, 8, 14>, <5, 8, 4>, <5, 8, 12>, <5, 4, 11>, <12, 10, 14>, <12, 10, 5>, <12, 14, 2>, <3, 10, 2>, <14, 2, 10>
