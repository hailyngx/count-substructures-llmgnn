Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (13, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 2) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 2) 

Response:
The graph's nodes are as follows: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}.

After sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections), the labels should be arranged as follows:
{9, 3, 13, 7, 10, 1, 5, 4, 12, 0, 2, 6, 11, 8, 14}.

Now, let's list the triangles by checking shared connections between vertices with lower labels:

\[
\begin{align*}
&\text{Triangles:} \\
&<0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 7, 12>, <1, 2, 10>, <1, 2, 14>, \\
&<2, 7, 10>, <2, 7, 14>, <3, 0, 2>, <4, 8, 12>, <4, 12, 14>, \\
&<5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 12>, <6, 8, 14>, <10, 1, 2>, <11, 9, 12> \\
\end{align*}
\]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [15].
