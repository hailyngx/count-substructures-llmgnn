Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 13) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The vertices arranged in order of their degrees are: 
3, 2, 10, 7, 8, 5, 4, 9, 0, 12, 11, 1, 13, and 6.  

The number of triangles in the graph is [12].
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 4>, 
<0, 1, 12>, 
<0, 1, 13>, 
<0, 2, 6>, 
<0, 6, 13>, 
<1, 4, 9>, 
<1, 4, 10>, 
<1, 4, 5>, 
<1, 5, 14>, 
<1, 10, 4>, 
<1, 12, 13>, 
<5, 8, 14>.
