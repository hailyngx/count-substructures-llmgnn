Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (7, 5) (7, 12) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
Vertices sorted by degree: 5, 7, 3, 7, 11, 11, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 6, 11, 11
Relabeling vertices: 5->0, 7->1, 3->2, 7->3, 11->4, 11->5, 6->6, 6->7, 6->8, 9->9, 9->10, 9->11, 6->12, 11->13, 11->14

Triangles found using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
[15]
