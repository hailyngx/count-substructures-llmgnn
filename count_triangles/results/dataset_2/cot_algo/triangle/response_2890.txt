Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 7) (27, 12) (27, 21) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 26) (6, 19) (9, 6) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 24) (22, 18) (22, 14) (22, 11) (22, 3) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 1) (25, 20) (25, 29) (25, 4) (5, 17) (5, 24) (8, 14) (23, 14) (23, 7) (23, 10) (23, 28) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 7) (7, 15) (7, 23) (7, 12) (4, 18) (4, 25) (4, 29) (4, 2) (1, 6) (1, 20) (1, 26) (1, 17) (26, 6) (26, 20) (26, 1) (26, 2) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 21) (3, 22) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 22) (11, 3) (11, 2) (16, 17) (16, 28) (16, 0) (16, 29) (16, 10) (28, 23) (28, 16) (28, 0) (0, 16) (0, 28) (10, 23) (10, 16) (2, 4) (2, 26) (2, 3) (2, 11) (13, 3) (21, 27) (21, 17) (14, 22) (14, 8) (14, 23) (14, 24) (19, 6) (19, 29) (29, 25) (29, 4) (29, 16) (29, 19) (24, 18) (24, 5) (24, 14) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most are as follows:
0 - 3 connections
13 - 3 connections
5 - 4 connections
8 - 4 connections
20 - 4 connections
9 - 4 connections
15 - 4 connections
27 - 4 connections
7 - 6 connections
1 - 6 connections
19 - 6 connections
6 - 7 connections
18 - 7 connections
22 - 7 connections
12 - 7 connections
25 - 7 connections
14 - 8 connections
4 - 8 connections
23 - 8 connections
28 - 8 connections
2 - 8 connections
29 - 8 connections
11 - 8 connections
16 - 9 connections
26 - 9 connections
10 - 9 connections
17 - 9 connections
21 - 9 connections
24 - 9 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Counting the triangles, we find the total number of triangles to be [32] in the graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 6, 12>
<1, 6, 26>
<1, 20, 26>
<4, 18, 24>
<4, 18, 25>
