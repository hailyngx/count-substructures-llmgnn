Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 3) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 4) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows these steps:

1. Sort vertices based on the number of connections:
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 11: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 14: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 10: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 12: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 13: 6 connections
Vertex 9: 6 connections

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
0: 5
1: 11
2: 6
3: 8
4: 2
5: 0
6: 7
7: 14
8: 3
9: 10
10: 1
11: 12
12: 4
13: 13
14: 9

3. Check for triangles:
Triangles found:
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 13>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 3, 13>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 2, 4>
<2, 4, 1>
<5, 7, 13>
<3, 8, 12>
<3, 8, 4>
<3, 10, 1>
<3, 10, 14>
<3, 12, 4>
<3, 12, 6>
<4, 12, 6>
<7, 13, 14>

Total number of triangles: [15]
