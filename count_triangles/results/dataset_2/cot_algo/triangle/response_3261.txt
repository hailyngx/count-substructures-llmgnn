Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (10, 4) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 13) (8, 10) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 0) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Nodes sorted by their number of connections:
Node 5: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 10: Degree 2
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 6
Node 12: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 5
