Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 4) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 4) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes with degrees:  
1: 4  
2: 4  
3: 5  
4: 5  
5: 5  
6: 5  
7: 4  
8: 4  
9: 4  
10: 5  
11: 5  
12: 4  
13: 4  
14: 3  

Now, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles:

1. For vertex 14 (degree 3):  
(14, 6) - Does not form a triangle.  

2. For vertex 2 (degree 4):  
(2, 8) - Does not form a triangle.  
(2, 1) - Forms a triangle with shared connection 1.  

3. For vertex 8 (degree 4):  
(8, 11) - Does not form a triangle.  
(8, 2) - Forms a triangle with shared connection 2.  
(8, 12) - Does not form a triangle.  

4. For vertex 12 (degree 4):  
(12, 9) - Does not form a triangle.  
(12, 10) - Does not form a triangle.  
(12, 11) - Does not form a triangle.  

5. For vertex 9 (degree 4):  
(9, 10) - Does not form a triangle.  

6. For vertex 7 (degree 4):  
(7, 9) - Does not form a triangle.  

7. For vertex 13 (degree 4):  
(13, 9) - Does not form a triangle.  

8. For vertex 11 (degree 5):  
(11, 1) - Forms a triangle with shared connection 1.  
(11, 13) - Does not form a triangle.  
(11, 8) - Does not form a triangle.  
(11, 12) - Does not form a triangle.  

9. For vertex 10 (degree 5):  
(10, 6) - Forms a triangle with shared connection 6.  

10. For vertex 4 (degree 5):  
(4, 5) - Forms a triangle with shared connection 5.  
(4, 11) - Forms a triangle with shared connection 11.  
(4, 6) - Forms a triangle with shared connection 6.  
(4, 2) - Forms a triangle with shared connection 2.  
(4, 14) - Does not form a triangle.  

11. For vertex 6 (degree 5):  
(6, 5) - Forms a triangle with shared connection 5.  
(6, 10) - Forms a triangle with shared connection 10.  

12. For vertex 5 (degree 5):  
(5, 6) - Forms a triangle with shared connection 6.  
(5, 4) - Forms a triangle with shared connection 4.  
(5, 3) - Does not form a triangle.  
(5, 7) - Does not form a triangle.  

The total number of triangles is [9] which are <2, 11, 1>, <6, 10, 5>, <5, 6, 10>, <4, 5, 11>, <4, 6, 5>, <4, 11, 1>, <4, 2, 1>, <4, 6, 10>, <1, 8, 11>.
