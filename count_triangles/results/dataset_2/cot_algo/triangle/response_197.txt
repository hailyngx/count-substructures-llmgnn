Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 15) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 1) (5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 1) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 18) (16, 0) (3, 14) (3, 9) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 2) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 9) (19, 11) (19, 17) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 14) (15, 11) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 18) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 18) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 6) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be used to count the number of triangles in the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges that you provided. First, let's construct the graph with the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 
Edges: (10, 6), (11, 1), (11, 19), (11, 0), (11, 15), (4, 8), (4, 2), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 18), (7, 12), (7, 14), (7, 13), (7, 17), (12, 7), (12, 1), (5, 13), (5, 15), (5, 14), (13, 7), (13, 5), (13, 1), (0, 11), (0, 16), (0, 15), (0, 18), (16, 0), (3, 14), (3, 9), (17, 7), (17, 9), (17, 19), (17, 2), (1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 13), (1, 9), (19, 11), (19, 17), (14, 7), (14, 5), (14, 3), (14, 2), (2, 4), (2, 17), (2, 14), (15, 11), (15, 5), (15, 0), (15, 18), (6, 10), (6, 8), (6, 18), (18, 8), (18, 0), (18, 15), (18, 6), (9, 3), (9, 17), (9, 1)

Next, we sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:

Nodes sorted by degree: 10, 16, 12, 3, 4, 6, 5, 9, 14, 2, 8, 1, 19, 13, 17, 7, 0, 18, 15, 11

Now, we analyze the edges in order of the node with the smaller label:

1. Edge (0, 16): Shared connections with node 0: [11, 15, 18]. Shared connections with node 16: [0]. Therefore, a triangle is formed using nodes 0, 16, and 11. (Note that we only count this once)

2. Edge (3, 9): Shared connections with node 3: [14]. Shared connections with node 9: [1, 17]. There are no shared connections between 3 and 9.

3. Edge (12, 1): Shared connections with node 12: [7]. Shared connections with node 1: [11, 9, 13]. Therefore, a triangle is formed using nodes 1, 12, and 7. (Again, counted only once)

4. ...

After analyzing all edges, we determine the number of triangles present in the graph:

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles found: <0, 16, 11>, <1, 12, 7>
