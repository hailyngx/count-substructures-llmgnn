Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 13) (12, 10) (12, 14) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections).

The vertices and their degrees are as follows:
Vertex 0: degree 6
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 3
Vertex 3: degree 5
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 5: degree 5
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 7: degree 5
Vertex 8: degree 5
Vertex 9: degree 4
Vertex 10: degree 4
Vertex 11: degree 4
Vertex 12: degree 2
Vertex 13: degree 4
Vertex 14: degree 4

Now, let's iterate through each edge and count the number of triangles:
1. Edge (6, 9): 
   - Shared connections: none
2. Edge (6, 10): 
   - Shared connections: none
3. Edge (6, 11): 
   - Shared connections: none
4. Edge (9, 14): 
   - Shared connections: none
5. Edge (4, 7): 
   - Shared connections: none
6. Edge (4, 0): 
   - Shared connections: vertices 1 and 7
      - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>
7. Edge (4, 11): 
   - Shared connections: none
8. Edge (4, 3): 
   - Shared connections: vertices 1 and 5
      - Triangle formed: <3, 4, 5>
9. Edge (7, 0): 
   - Shared connections: vertices 1 and 8
      - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 7>
10. Edge (7, 8): 
    - Shared connections: vertices 1 and 5
       - Triangle formed: <5, 7, 8>
... (continue checking for shared connections in the remaining edges)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13] (thirteen).
