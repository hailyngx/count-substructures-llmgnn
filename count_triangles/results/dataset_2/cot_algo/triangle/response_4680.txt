Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 11) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (11, 15) (11, 9) (0, 5) (0, 13) (7, 10) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 12) (17, 16) (4, 15) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 18) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 4) (19, 18) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (8, 5) (8, 10) (16, 3) (16, 6) (16, 17) (16, 2) (2, 9) (2, 16) 

Response:
The given graph consists of 20 nodes and 60 edges.
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. First, sort the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:
   Nodes with degree:
   0: 2 connections
   7, 17, 18, 19: 2 connections
   8, 13: 3 connections
   2, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15: 4 connections
   1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 16: 4 connections
   3: 5 connections

2. Relabel the nodes accordingly:
   0: 1, 7, 17, 18, 19
   1: 2, 8, 13
   2: 3, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15
   3: 4, 5, 6, 9, 16
   4: 5
   5: 6

3. Apply the edge criteria for counting triangles:
   - For each edge, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 
   - Check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to find triangles.

4. Count the triangles:
   - We find the following unique triangles in the given graph:
     <6, 2, 10>
     <9, 11, 14>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
