Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 25) (7, 2) (21, 7) (21, 15) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 19) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 14) (23, 8) (23, 2) (28, 17) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 5) (29, 28) (29, 24) (29, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 23) (2, 13) (13, 2) (13, 26) (13, 11) (26, 10) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 20) (24, 29) (24, 26) (24, 12) (4, 16) (4, 15) (27, 22) (16, 28) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 9) (25, 7) (25, 19) (25, 6) (12, 24) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 15) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 25) (19, 18) (0, 16) (0, 9) (3, 14) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 20) (20, 26) (20, 14) (20, 22) (20, 9) (22, 27) (22, 20) (22, 6) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 20) (1, 10) (1, 14) (5, 28) (5, 18) (5, 15) (6, 25) (6, 22) (6, 11) (15, 21) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 5) (11, 29) (11, 13) (11, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: (7, 21), (7, 25), (7, 2), (21, 15), (10, 17), (10, 26), (10, 18), (10, 1), (10, 19), (17, 28), (8, 23), (8, 14), (23, 2), (28, 29), (28, 16), (2, 13), (13, 26), (13, 11), (26, 24), (26, 20), (24, 12), (4, 16), (27, 22), (16, 0), (16, 9), (25, 6), (12, 24), (5, 28), (6, 11), (15, 4)

Now, let's sort the nodes by their number of connections:

Nodes by degree: 3, 0, 7, 27, 22, 12, 1, 9, 25, 5, 13, 20, 4, 8, 14, 11, 15, 18, 23, 24, 2, 10, 19, 28, 6, 26, 16, 21, 17, 29

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [48]
Unique triangles found: <4, 5, 28>, <5, 15, 18>, <0, 4, 16>, <0, 9, 16>, <1, 13, 26>, <1, 14, 20>, <2, 8, 23>, <2, 13, 26>, <6, 11, 29>, <6, 22, 25>, <10, 17, 28>, <10, 18, 19>, <10, 18, 5>, <10, 19, 25>, <16, 20, 22>, <16, 20, 9>, <18, 19, 25>, <12, 24, 29>, <0, 9, 20>, <23, 2, 8>, <24, 12, 29>, <7, 21, 25>, <26, 13, 11>, <13, 26, 20>, <15, 4, 16>, <15, 18, 5>, <14, 8, 23>, <14, 1, 20>, <17, 10, 28>, <17, 19, 25>
