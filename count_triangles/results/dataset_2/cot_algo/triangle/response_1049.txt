Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 26) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 29) (4, 15) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 20) (8, 18) (8, 27) (11, 28) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 9) (28, 24) (28, 5) (24, 28) (24, 26) (26, 17) (26, 24) (26, 7) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 21) (3, 5) (21, 3) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 2) (0, 7) (0, 29) (0, 6) (7, 26) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 9) (25, 27) (25, 5) (25, 2) (27, 8) (27, 25) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 13) (19, 7) (19, 29) (19, 23) (16, 28) (10, 6) (10, 22) (12, 18) (12, 9) (20, 8) (29, 4) (29, 0) (29, 19) (29, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 10) (9, 28) (9, 7) (9, 12) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 18) (5, 28) (5, 3) (5, 25) (5, 29) (5, 22) (2, 14) (2, 15) (2, 25) (2, 23) (23, 19) (23, 2) (22, 10) (22, 5) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degree (number of connections) is as follows:
Degree 2: 10, 12, 16, 21, 23, 24, 27
Degree 3: 0, 6, 9, 15, 19, 20, 22, 25
Degree 4: 1, 5, 7
Degree 5: 18
Degree 6: 29
Degree 7: 17, 26
Degree 8: 4, 8
Degree 9: 13, 3
Degree 10: 11
Degree 12: 28
Degree 13: 14

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles. 

The total number of triangles is [26]. 

The unique triangles found are:
