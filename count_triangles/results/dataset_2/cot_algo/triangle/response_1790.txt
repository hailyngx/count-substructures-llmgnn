Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 4) (7, 14) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 10) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 5)
