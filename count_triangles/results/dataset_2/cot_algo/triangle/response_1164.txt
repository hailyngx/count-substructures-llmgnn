Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
The sorted vertices by their degree are: 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 0, 13, 2, 8, 12, 6, 7, 9, 14, 11.
