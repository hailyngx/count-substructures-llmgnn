Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

After sorting the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following relabeled nodes:
(1: 1), (17: 1), (18: 1), (20: 1), (26: 1), (10: 2), (12: 2), (17: 2), (20: 2), (28: 2), (1: 3), (2: 3), (3: 3), (25: 3), (28: 3), (8: 4), (17: 4), (2: 5), (3: 5), (7: 5), (11: 5), (12: 5), (14: 5), (25: 5), (28: 5), (4: 6), (10: 6), (12: 6), (14: 6), (18: 6), (21: 6), (23: 6), (10: 7), (11: 7), (15: 7), (19: 7), (21: 7), (23: 7), (15: 8), (0: 9), (5: 9), (13: 9), (19: 9), (26: 9), (22: 10), (24: 10), (9: 11), (16: 11), (6: 13), (27: 13), (29: 13)

After analyzing the connections following the Degree-Based Ordering method, there are a total of [18] triangles:
<9, 13, 26>, <9, 13, 21>, <9, 13, 8>, <9, 16, 19>, <9, 16, 23>, <9, 16, 11>, <9, 12, 3>, <12, 9, 16>, <12, 9, 13>, <5, 9, 16>, <5, 9, 26>, <5, 9, 13>, <5, 9, 8>, <5, 9, 12>, <15, 27, 21>, <15, 27, 4>, <15, 4, 28>, <15, 21, 26>
