Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 23) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 28) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 4) (29, 11) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (1, 21) (1, 18) (21, 5) (21, 1) (21, 22) (4, 2) (4, 18) (18, 1) (18, 4) (18, 23) (18, 20) (18, 24) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 15) (7, 19) (25, 7) (25, 0) (25, 12) (25, 24) (10, 15) (10, 26) (10, 13) (10, 14) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 16) (17, 8) (17, 27) (12, 5) (12, 25) (12, 19) (26, 10) (26, 3) (8, 17) (8, 28) (8, 11) (28, 9) (28, 8) (28, 14) (28, 23) (3, 6) (3, 26) (3, 13) (3, 19) (16, 2) (16, 15) (24, 18) (24, 25) (23, 5) (23, 18) (23, 28) (11, 29) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 0) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 14) (20, 18) (20, 7) (13, 10) (13, 3) (14, 10) (14, 28) (14, 19) (14, 27) (27, 5) (27, 17) (27, 14) (22, 21) (0, 25) (0, 11) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
(5, 9) (5, 23) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 27) 
(9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 28) 
(2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 4) 
(29, 11) 
(6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) 
(1, 21) (1, 18) 
(21, 5) (21, 1) (21, 22) 
(4, 2) (4, 18) 
(18, 1) (18, 4) (18, 23) (18, 20) (18, 24) 
(7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 15) (7, 19) 
(25, 7) (25, 0) (25, 12) (25, 24) 
(10, 15) (10, 26) (10, 13) (10, 14) 
(15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 16) 
(17, 8) (17, 27) 
(12, 5) (12, 25) (12, 19) 
(26, 10) (26, 3) 
(8, 17) (8, 28) (8, 11) 
(28, 9) (28, 8) (28, 14) (28, 23) 
(3, 6) (3, 26) (3, 13) (3, 19) 
(16, 2) (16, 15) 
(24, 18) (24, 25) 
(23, 5) (23, 18) (23, 28) 
(11, 29) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 0) 
(19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 14) 
(20, 18) (20, 7) 
(13, 10) (13, 3) 
(14, 10) (14, 28) (14, 19) (14, 27) 
(27, 5) (27, 17) (27, 14) 
(22, 21) 
(0, 25) (0, 11) 

Now, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree and relabel them accordingly. 

After relabeling, the sorted nodes are: 29, 22, 7, 0, 2, 4, 16, 3, 13, 26, 6, 1, 18, 20, 24, 10, 15, 12, 19, 21, 23, 5, 17, 11, 8, 28, 14, 27, 9, 25

Next, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The total number of triangles is [33].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 25, 11>
<0, 25, 12>
<1, 18, 4>
<1, 18, 21>
<3, 6, 2>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 13, 10>
<3, 13, 26>
<3, 19, 11>
<3, 19, 7>
<4, 2, 6>
<4, 18, 1>
<5, 23, 9>
<5, 12, 25>
<5, 21, 1>
<5, 21, 22>
<7, 20, 18>
<7, 25, 0>
<8, 11, 19>
<8, 17, 27>
<9, 5, 23>
<10, 13, 3>
<10, 14, 27>
<10, 14, 28>
<10, 15, 16>
<11, 19, 7>
<12, 19, 3>
<14, 19, 11>
<14, 19, 27>
<15, 16, 2>
<15, 16, 10>
<18, 20, 7>
<19, 11, 0>
<19, 14, 28>
