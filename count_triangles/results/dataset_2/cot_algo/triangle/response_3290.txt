Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (27, 4) (27, 13) (27, 16) (14, 10) (17, 28) (17, 15) (17, 26) (22, 23) (22, 7) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 15) (6, 13) (6, 20) (28, 17) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 19) (26, 17) (26, 23) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 20) (7, 22) (7, 3) (7, 20) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 25) (4, 0) (4, 27) (4, 16) (4, 25) (4, 2) (10, 14) (10, 21) (10, 13) (21, 22) (21, 10) (21, 29) (8, 19) (8, 11) (19, 28) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 24) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 5) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 12) (11, 29) (29, 21) (29, 11) (29, 16) (29, 12) (1, 24) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 24) (20, 6) (20, 26) (20, 7) (20, 24) (9, 28) (9, 2) (9, 12) (25, 18) (25, 4) (15, 17) (15, 23) (16, 27) (16, 4) (16, 3) (16, 29) (5, 18) (5, 3) (12, 11) (12, 29) (12, 9) (24, 19) (24, 1) (24, 2) (24, 20) (13, 27) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with 30 nodes and 90 edges. To count the number of triangles, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Here is the list of triangles found in the graph:

[<4, 0, 27>, <4, 16, 27>, <4, 25, 27>, <4, 16, 3>, <4, 16, 29>, <4, 2, 9>, <17, 15, 23>, <17, 26, 15>, <17, 26, 23>, <17, 28, 26>, <17, 19, 28>, <26, 18, 5>, <26, 20, 5>, <26, 7, 20>, <22, 23, 15>, <22, 21, 10>, <22, 21, 29>, <26, 20, 24>]

Total number of triangles: [17]
