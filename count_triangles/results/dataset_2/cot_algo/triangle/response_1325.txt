Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 5) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 10) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 4) (14, 10) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 14) 

Response:
Let's create the graph representation:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- Node 0: (1, 13), (2, 0)
- Node 1: (0, 12), (1, 3), (1, 11)
- Node 2: (0, 5), (2, 4), (2, 13)
- Node 3: (1, 6), (3, 4), (3, 8)
- Node 4: (2, 5), (4, 6), (4, 14)
- Node 5: (2, 11), (5, 10), (5, 12)
- Node 6: (3, 11), (6, 10), (6, 14)
- Node 7: (9, 13), (7, 12)
- Node 8: (3, 10), (8, 11), (8, 13)
- Node 9: (7, 13)
- Node 10: (5, 14), (10, 12)
- Node 11: (6, 8), (11, 14)
- Node 12: (1, 7)
- Node 13: (0, 7)
- Node 14: (2, 4)

Next, we will sort the nodes by their degree:

Nodes by degree:
9. Node 9 - degree 1
13. Node 13 - degree 3
0. Node 0 - degree 2
12. Node 12 - degree 2
7. Node 7 - degree 2
8. Node 8 - degree 3
10. Node 10 - degree 3
14. Node 14 - degree 3
1. Node 1 - degree 3
5. Node 5 - degree 3
2. Node 2 - degree 3
4. Node 4 - degree 3
6. Node 6 - degree 3
11. Node 11 - degree 3
3. Node 3 - degree 4

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
Total number of triangles: [20]
Unique triangles: <1, 3, 6>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 5, 11>, <1, 5, 10>, <1, 5, 12>, <1, 10, 12>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 14>, <2, 5, 10>, <2, 5, 11>, <2, 14, 4>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 11>, <4, 5, 10>, <4, 5, 11>, <4, 5, 14>, <5, 10, 12>, <5, 11, 14>
