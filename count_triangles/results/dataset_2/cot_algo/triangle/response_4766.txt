Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
The nodes can be relabeled based on their degrees as follows: 
Node 0 has degree 6
Node 1 has degree 6
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 6
Node 8 has degree 3
Node 9 has degree 5

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph.

Total number of triangles: [16]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 1, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 5>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 0, 9>, <4, 6, 9>
