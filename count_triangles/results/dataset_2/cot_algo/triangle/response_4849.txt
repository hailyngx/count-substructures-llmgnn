This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 22) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 26) (3, 17) (3, 4) (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 12) (1, 21) (1, 10) (21, 1) (21, 23) (21, 22) (21, 29) (27, 17) (4, 3) (4, 13) (8, 28) (8, 10) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 18) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 29) (6, 22) (6, 26) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 20) (7, 26) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 29) (13, 4) (13, 5) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 24) (0, 17) (17, 3) (17, 27) (17, 5) (17, 0) (23, 11) (23, 21) (23, 19) (14, 28) (14, 29) (26, 16) (26, 5) (26, 6) (26, 7) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 9) (28, 8) (28, 14) (28, 18) (9, 10) (25, 15) (25, 19) (25, 24) (20, 7) (20, 22) (20, 24) (19, 23) (19, 25) (29, 11) (29, 21) (29, 6) (29, 12) (29, 14) (24, 0) (24, 25) (24, 20) (18, 5) (18, 28) (22, 11) (22, 15) (22, 21) (22, 6) (22, 20) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method first requires us to sort the vertices by their number of connections, from least to most connected. 
Here is the sorted list of vertices with their respective connections: 

Vertex 2: Degree 0
Vertex 9: Degree 1
Vertex 14: Degree 2
Vertex 16: Degree 2
Vertex 3: Degree 2
Vertex 27: Degree 2
Vertex 1: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 4
Vertex 18: Degree 4
Vertex 19: Degree 4
Vertex 5: Degree 5
Vertex 7: Degree 5
Vertex 20: Degree 5
Vertex 13: Degree 6
Vertex 10: Degree 6
Vertex 24: Degree 6
Vertex 15: Degree 7
Vertex 17: Degree 7
Vertex 25: Degree 7
Vertex 4: Degree 8
Vertex 0: Degree 8
Vertex 6: Degree 8
Vertex 21: Degree 8
Vertex 23: Degree 8
Vertex 29: Degree 8
Vertex 12: Degree 9
Vertex 26: Degree 9
Vertex 11: Degree 10
Vertex 22: Degree 10
