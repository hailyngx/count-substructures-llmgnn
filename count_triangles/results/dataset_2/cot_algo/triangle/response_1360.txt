Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 13) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 16) (6, 19) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 13) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 14) (17, 9) (17, 2) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 5) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 11) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 5) (14, 10) (14, 15) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 15) (1, 2) (1, 11) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 19) (19, 4) (19, 6) (19, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 16) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 8) (15, 14) (15, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Nodes sorted by their degrees:
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 15: 2 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 17: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 14: 2 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 19: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 16: 3 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 4: 4 connections

The triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 16>
<0, 5, 12>
<0, 5, 16>
<1, 2, 11>
<1, 2, 17>
<2, 5, 12>
<2, 5, 18>
<3, 6, 5>
<3, 6, 11>
<3, 6, 13>
<4, 6, 19>
<4, 13, 7>
<5, 12, 10>
<5, 12, 14>
<5, 16, 8>
<6, 13, 4>
<8, 9, 17>
<9, 13, 4>
<10, 14, 15>
<11, 12, 5>
<11, 12, 3>
<13, 3, 6>
<13, 3, 9>
<13, 4, 6>
<13, 4, 7>
<15, 14, 11>
<16, 0, 5>
<16, 0, 8>
<17, 9, 13>

The total number of triangles is [29].
