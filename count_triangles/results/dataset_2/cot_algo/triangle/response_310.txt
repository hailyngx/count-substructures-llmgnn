Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 16) (9, 3) (4, 19) (4, 0) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 17) (2, 8) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 16) (1, 7) (1, 12) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 15) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 12) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 19) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 12) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 18) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 15) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 2) (16, 9) (16, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) from least to most. The relabeling of the vertices is as follows:

Node 4 -> Degree 2
Node 5 -> Degree 2
Node 7 -> Degree 2
Node 10 -> Degree 2
Node 18 -> Degree 2
Node 1 -> Degree 3
Node 6 -> Degree 3
Node 12 -> Degree 4
Node 0 -> Degree 4
Node 17 -> Degree 5
Node 15 -> Degree 3
Node 2 -> Degree 2
Node 13 -> Degree 2
Node 11 -> Degree 4
Node 14 -> Degree 3
Node 19 -> Degree 4
Node 3 -> Degree 5
Node 8 -> Degree 6
Node 16 -> Degree 2
Node 9 -> Degree 5

Now, by following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can identify the triangles present in the graph:

1. Triangle <1, 7, 14>
2. Triangle <1, 7, 15>
3. Triangle <1, 12, 15>
4. Triangle <4, 0, 11>
5. Triangle <6, 3, 12>
6. Triangle <6, 3, 19>
7. Triangle <9, 7, 8>
8. Triangle <9, 7, 14>
9. Triangle <9, 8, 13>
10. Triangle <9, 8, 15>
11. Triangle <9, 12, 15>
12. Triangle <11, 10, 12>
13. Triangle <13, 3, 8>
14. Triangle <17, 11, 12>
15. Triangle <17, 15, 12>
16. Triangle <17, 15, 19>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
