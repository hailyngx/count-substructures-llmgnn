Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 23) (1, 19) (1, 12) (21, 3) (21, 23) (21, 17) (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 24) (7, 14) (12, 1) (12, 27) (12, 25) (12, 11) (27, 4) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 17) (17, 21) (17, 27) (17, 0) (29, 22) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 26) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 22) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 16) (9, 14) (9, 15) (9, 11) (22, 29) (22, 8) (3, 21) (3, 27) (3, 0) (11, 12) (11, 9) (11, 28) (11, 5) (13, 26) (13, 19) (26, 2) (26, 13) (26, 6) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 24) (10, 5) (15, 9) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 13) (28, 11) (28, 18) (28, 5) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 28) (5, 25) (20, 16) (23, 1) (23, 21) (23, 16) (6, 26) (6, 10) (6, 18) (24, 7) (24, 10) (18, 10) (18, 28) (18, 6) (25, 12) (25, 5) (16, 14) (16, 20) (16, 23) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. Here is the list of vertices with their corresponding degrees in ascending order:
Vertices: (Degree)
1: 3
13: 3
20: 3
29: 3
4: 4
22: 4
9: 4
15: 4
2: 4
8: 4
28: 4
18: 4
6: 4
10: 4
24: 4
0: 4
3: 4
5: 4
25: 4
7: 5
17: 5
19: 5
11: 5
16: 5
26: 5
12: 5
21: 5
27: 5
14: 6
23: 6

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we will now count the triangles in the graph.

Total number of triangles: [33]

Unique triangles:
