Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degree (number of connections) is:
0 (degree: 5)
1 (degree: 4)
2 (degree: 4)
3 (degree: 4)
5 (degree: 4)
7 (degree: 6)
8 (degree: 3)
4 (degree: 2)
6 (degree: 3)
9 (degree: 5)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now go through the edges and count the triangles formed:
1. (4, 7) - No triangles
2. (4, 1) - No triangles
3. (7, 4) - No triangles
4. (7, 3) - No triangles
5. (7, 9) - Forms a triangle <3, 7, 9>
6. (7, 5) - Forms a triangle <5, 7, 9>
7. (7, 8) - Forms a triangle <7, 8, 5>
8. (6, 9) - No triangles
9. (6, 5) - Forms a triangle <5, 6, 9>
10. (6, 2) - No triangles
11. (9, 7) - Forms a triangle <7, 9, 0>
12. (9, 6) - Forms a triangle <5, 9, 6>
13. (9, 2) - Forms a triangle <0, 9, 2>
14. (9, 3) - Forms a triangle <7, 9, 3>
15. (9, 0) - Forms a triangle <0, 9, 7>
16. (8, 7) - No triangles
17. (8, 5) - Forms a triangle <5, 8, 7>
18. (8, 3) - Forms a triangle <3, 8, 7>
19. (8, 1) - No triangles
20. (5, 7) - No triangles
21. (5, 6) - Forms a triangle <5, 6, 9>
22. (5, 8) - Forms a triangle <5, 8, 7>
23. (5, 0) - No triangles
24. (0, 9) - Forms a triangle <0, 9, 7>
25. (0, 5) - No triangles
26. (0, 2) - No triangles
27. (0, 3) - Forms a triangle <0, 3, 7>
28. (0, 1) - No triangles
29. (2, 6) - No triangles
30. (2, 9) - Forms a triangle <0, 9, 2>
31. (2, 0) - No triangles
32. (2, 1) - No triangles
33. (1, 4) - No triangles
34. (1, 8) - No triangles
35. (1, 0) - No triangles
36. (1, 2) - No triangles
37. (3, 7) - Forms a triangle <3, 7, 9>
38. (3, 9) - Forms a triangle <3, 9, 7>
39. (3, 8) - Forms a triangle <3, 8, 7>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10]. 
The unique triangles found in the graph are <7, 8, 5>, <3, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 9, 2>, and <3, 8, 7>.
