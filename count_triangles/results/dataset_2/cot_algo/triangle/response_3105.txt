Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 18) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 15) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 15) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 6) (3, 11) (3, 16) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 3) (9, 18) (9, 19) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 13) (1, 4) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 19) (19, 2) (19, 9) (19, 16) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting the number of triangles in this graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
   - Vertex 1: Degree 1
   - Vertex 3: Degree 2
   - Vertex 10: Degree 2
   - Vertex 4: Degree 3
   - Vertex 5: Degree 3
   - Vertex 9: Degree 3
   - Vertex 0: Degree 4
   - Vertex 8: Degree 4
   - Vertex 18: Degree 4
   - Vertex 2: Degree 5
   - Vertex 6: Degree 5
   - Vertex 14: Degree 2
   - Vertex 12: Degree 4
   - Vertex 15: Degree 3
   - Vertex 16: Degree 4
   - Vertex 19: Degree 3
   - Vertex 7: Degree 4
   - Vertex 11: Degree 3
   - Vertex 17: Degree 3
   - Vertex 13: Degree 4

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   - Vertex 1 -> Vertex 0
   - Vertex 3 -> Vertex 1
   - Vertex 10 -> Vertex 1
   - Vertex 4 -> Vertex 2
   - Vertex 5 -> Vertex 3
   - Vertex 9 -> Vertex 4
   - Vertex 0 -> Vertex 5
   - Vertex 8 -> Vertex 6
   - Vertex 18 -> Vertex 7
   - Vertex 2 -> Vertex 8
   - Vertex 6 -> Vertex 9
   - Vertex 14 -> Vertex 10
   - Vertex 12 -> Vertex 11
   - Vertex 15 -> Vertex 12
   - Vertex 16 -> Vertex 13
   - Vertex 19 -> Vertex 14
   - Vertex 7 -> Vertex 15
   - Vertex 11 -> Vertex 16
   - Vertex 17 -> Vertex 17
   - Vertex 13 -> Vertex 18

3. Check for triangles:

   - Triangles found: <0, 1, 11>, <4, 11, 12>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 13>, <5, 8, 18>, <5, 13, 18>, <6, 9, 18>, <6, 13, 18>, <7, 11, 15>, <8, 9, 13>, <8, 9, 18>, <8, 12, 13>, <11, 13, 15>

4. Count the total number of triangles:

   - Total number of triangles: [13]
