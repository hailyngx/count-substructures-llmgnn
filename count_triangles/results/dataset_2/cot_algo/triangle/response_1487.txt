Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 6) (13, 16) (13, 3) (13, 0) (10, 12) (10, 5) (17, 15) (17, 4) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 15) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 14) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 0) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 2) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 1) (1, 8) (1, 19) (2, 11) (2, 4) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 2) (4, 3) (9, 14) (9, 7) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 15) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 14) (18, 12) (18, 15) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 15) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 5) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as:
- Node 0 is connected to Nodes 6 and 13.
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 8 and 19.
- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 4 and 11.
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 4, 5, and 13.
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 2, 3, 17, and 19.
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 3, 10, and 11.
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 0, 8, and 19.
- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 8, 9, 15.
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 1, 6, 7, 16.
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 7 and 14.
- Node 10 is connected to Nodes 5 and 12.
- Node 11 is connected to Nodes 2, 5, and 19.
- Node 12 is connected to Nodes 10, 15, 16, 18.
- Node 13 is connected to Nodes 0, 3, 16.
- Node 14 is connected to Nodes 9, 15, 16.
- Node 15 is connected to Nodes 7, 12, 14, 17, 18.
- Node 16 is connected to Nodes 8, 12, 13, 14.
- Node 17 is connected to Nodes 4 and 15.
- Node 18 is connected to Nodes 12, 15.
- Node 19 is connected to Nodes 1, 4, 6, 11.

Now, let's start by sorting the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 2 (Degree 2)
Node 0 (Degree 2)
Node 1 (Degree 2)
Node 9 (Degree 2)
Node 10 (Degree 2)
Node 7 (Degree 3)
Node 17 (Degree 3)
Node 18 (Degree 3)
Node 3 (Degree 3)
Node 13 (Degree 3)
Node 5 (Degree 3)
Node 4 (Degree 4)
Node 11 (Degree 4)
Node 14 (Degree 4)
Node 6 (Degree 4)
Node 19 (Degree 4)
Node 12 (Degree 4)
Node 16 (Degree 4)
Node 8 (Degree 4)
Node 15 (Degree 5)

Let's count the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Start counting triangles based on the connections between lower-degree nodes and higher-degree nodes.

There are no triangles found based on the provided edges.
