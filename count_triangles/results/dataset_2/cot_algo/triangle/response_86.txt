Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 25) (9, 2) (26, 9) (26, 28) (3, 2) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 6) (15, 16) (14, 11) (14, 7) (17, 19) (17, 18) (25, 9) (25, 27) (25, 0) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (27, 25) (27, 22) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 18) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 1) (18, 29) (28, 26) (28, 29) (28, 0) (28, 24) (28, 5) (29, 18) (29, 28) (29, 8) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 23) (22, 27) (6, 15) (6, 21) (6, 8) (21, 6) (21, 23) (21, 4) (4, 12) (4, 21) (4, 20) (4, 11) (0, 25) (0, 28) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 24) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 24) (16, 15) (16, 12) (24, 28) (24, 10) (24, 11) (24, 1) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 10) (5, 28) (5, 8) (8, 29) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 20) (8, 1) (20, 4) (20, 8) (20, 13) (23, 15) (23, 7) (23, 21) (23, 1) (13, 20) (1, 18) (1, 10) (1, 24) (1, 8) (1, 23) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:
Vertices in decreasing order of degree: 

29 (degree: 4)
28 (degree: 4)
18 (degree: 4)
1 (degree: 4)
8 (degree: 4)
15 (degree: 4)
4 (degree: 4)
23 (degree: 4)
10 (degree: 4)
0 (degree: 3)
25 (degree: 3)
24 (degree: 3)
19 (degree: 3)
12 (degree: 3)
27 (degree: 2)
2 (degree: 2)
14 (degree: 2)
6 (degree: 2)
7 (degree: 2)
21 (degree: 2)
11 (degree: 2)
5 (degree: 1)
17 (degree: 1)
22 (degree: 1)
3 (degree: 1)
26 (degree: 2)
9 (degree: 3)
13 (degree: 1)
20 (degree: 3)

Now, let's count the triangles by considering the edges:
Triangles: [2850]
Unique triangles: <0, 10, 24>, <0, 25, 27>, <0, 28, 24>, <0, 28, 5>, <1, 24, 23>, <1, 24, 10>, <1, 8, 23>, <1, 8, 24>, <2, 18, 1>, <2, 18, 3>, <4, 12, 16>, <4, 12, 21>, <4, 11, 24>, <4, 11, 14>, <6, 15, 23>, <6, 15, 21>, <8, 1, 23>, <8, 1, 24>, <8, 20, 13>, <8, 20, 4>, <15, 6, 21>, <15, 6, 16>, <15, 19, 17>, <15, 19, 10>, <18, 1, 10>, <18, 1, 24>, <19, 15, 10>, <20, 4, 13>, <23, 15, 21>, <23, 15, 7>
