Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 14) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 10) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. Let's label the vertices accordingly:

Vertices sorted by degree:
Vertex 5: (4 connections)
Vertex 6: (4 connections)
Vertex 8: (4 connections)
Vertex 13: (4 connections)
Vertex 14: (4 connections)
Vertex 0: (5 connections)
Vertex 7: (5 connections)
Vertex 3: (5 connections)
Vertex 9: (6 connections)
Vertex 12: (6 connections)
Vertex 2: (7 connections)
Vertex 11: (7 connections)
Vertex 1: (7 connections)
Vertex 4: (7 connections)
Vertex 10: (7 connections)

Now, we can count the triangles by checking the shared connections between vertices with edges. 

The total number of triangles is [21] 

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 0, 6>
<2, 0, 3>
<2, 4, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 11, 7>
<6, 1, 9>
<4, 11, 12>
<10, 13, 11>
<3, 10, 13>
<3, 1, 9>
<10, 14, 8>
<10, 12, 14>
<10, 12, 13>
<11, 4, 8>
<7, 11, 13>
<7, 14, 8>
<1, 14, 8>
<1, 3, 0>
<2, 4, 6>
<12, 4, 11>
<0, 2, 7>
