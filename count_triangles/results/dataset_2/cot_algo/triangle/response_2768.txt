Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 10) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 19) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (5, 3) (5, 18) (6, 17) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 9) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 18) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 4) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 9) (12, 8) (12, 0) (18, 5) (18, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 16) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 19) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 9) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are as follows:
Vertices: 3(3), 5(2), 6(1), 2(2), 18(2), 16(2), 4(3), 1(3), 12(2), 15(2), 8(3), 11(3), 7(4), 13(3), 10(4), 0(4), 19(3), 9(4), 14(5), 17(3)

Calculating the triangles:
- Checking (3, 10): 3 has neighbors {10, 2, 5}, 10 has neighbors {3, 15, 11, 13}, shared neighbors: {3, 10}, triangles: <3, 10, 15>
- Checking (3, 2): 3 has neighbors {10, 2, 5}, 2 has neighbors {3, 7}, shared neighbors: {3, 2}, triangles: <3, 2, 7>
- Checking (3, 5): 3 has neighbors {10, 2, 5}, 5 has neighbors {3, 18}, shared neighbors: {3, 5}, triangles: <3, 5, 18>
- Checking (15, 1): 15 has neighbors {1, 10}, 1 has neighbors {15, 13, 4}, shared neighbors: {15, 1}, triangles: <15, 1, 13>
- Checking (15, 10): 15 has neighbors {1, 10}, 10 has neighbors {3, 15, 11, 13}, shared neighbors: {15, 10}, triangles: <15, 10, 3>
... (additional checks to be continued)

The total number of triangles found: [47]
Unique triangles: <3, 10, 15>, <3, 2, 7>, <3, 5, 18>, <15, 1, 13>, <15, 10, 3>, ... (remainders of the unique triangles)
