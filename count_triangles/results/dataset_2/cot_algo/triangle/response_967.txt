Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 12) (16, 10) (16, 15) (4, 7) (4, 15) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 9) (3, 19) (14, 8) (14, 13) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 5) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (18, 13) (18, 8) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 8) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 2) (19, 6) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 6) (15, 16) (15, 4) (15, 19) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 18) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 12) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 9) (13, 14) (13, 18) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method works as follows:
- We sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most.
- We relabel the vertices according to their degree, with the least connected vertex getting the label 0, next least connected getting label 1, and so on.

After relabeling the vertices, the new labels are as follows:
0: 16, 1: 3, 2: 4, 3: 6, 4: 0, 5: 5, 6: 1, 7: 2, 8: 9, 9: 7, 10: 10, 11: 8, 12: 11, 13: 14, 14: 17, 15: 18, 16: 12, 17: 13, 18: 19, 19: 15.

Now, let's count the triangles by examining the edges and shared connections between the vertices with the lower labels:
- Triangles: [<3, 5, 9>, <3, 9, 13>, <3, 17, 18>, <4, 9, 5>, <5, 9, 13>, <5, 13, 18>, <6, 0, 4>, <7, 2, 5>, <8, 12, 17>, <9, 13, 18>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
