Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 14) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 19) (4, 6) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 18) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 6) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 13) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 6) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 19) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 10) (18, 12) (18, 10) 

Response:
The given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: (0, 5), (0, 3), (1, 5), (1, 2), (1, 13), (2, 1), (3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 14), (4, 19), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 14), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 15), (6, 17), (7, 16), (7, 3), (7, 8), (8, 7), (8, 10), (8, 6), (9, 11), (9, 3), (9, 12), (10, 8), (10, 15), (10, 18), (10, 13), (11, 9), (11, 13), (11, 17), (12, 9), (12, 17), (12, 18), (13, 11), (13, 16), (13, 1), (13, 10), (14, 16), (14, 5), (14, 3), (14, 19), (15, 10), (15, 19), (15, 6), (16, 7), (16, 13), (16, 14), (17, 11), (17, 12), (17, 6), (18, 12), (18, 10)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

Nodes sorted by degrees: 
2, 4, 18, 0, 7, 12, 19, 8, 15, 10, 5, 1, 17, 6, 16, 13, 9, 3, 11, 14

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 14>
<0, 5, 14>
<1, 2, 13>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 7, 14>
<4, 6, 19>
<6, 8, 15>
<6, 8, 17>
<6, 15, 19>
<9, 11, 13>
<9, 11, 17>
<10, 13, 15>
<12, 17, 18>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [13]
