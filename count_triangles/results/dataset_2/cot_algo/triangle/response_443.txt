Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Sorted by degrees:
