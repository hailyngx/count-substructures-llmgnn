Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
0: 9, 1, 8, 7
1: 5, 0, 8, 7
2: 3, 4, 8, 5
3: 6, 9, 2, 5
4: 6, 9, 8, 2
5: 1, 3, 2
6: 9, 3, 8, 4
7: 9, 1, 0
8: 6, 1, 4, 2, 0
9: 6, 4, 3, 7, 0

Now, we will label the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

Node 5 (Degree 2)
Node 7 (Degree 3)
Node 2 (Degree 4)
Node 0 (Degree 4)
Node 1 (Degree 4)
Node 4 (Degree 5)
Node 3 (Degree 5)
Node 6 (Degree 5)
Node 8 (Degree 5)
Node 9 (Degree 5)

Now, applying the degree-based ordering method to count triangles:

Triangles: [<0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 5, 3>, <1, 8, 4>, <1, 8, 2>, <1, 0, 9>, <2, 8, 4>, <2, 8, 6>, <2, 8, 0>, <3, 5, 2>, <3, 9, 6>, <3, 9, 4>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 9, 6>, <4, 8, 6>, <5, 3, 2>, <6, 8, 4>]

Total number of triangles: [20]
