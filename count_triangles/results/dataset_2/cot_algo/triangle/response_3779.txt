Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 21) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 23) (26, 15) (26, 17) (26, 8) (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 27) (5, 14) (7, 29) (7, 1) (21, 9) (21, 28) (21, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 19) (8, 26) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 19) (10, 17) (10, 0) (17, 26) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 23) (17, 2) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 12) (20, 4) (25, 20) (25, 2) (0, 10) (0, 20) (0, 11) (4, 21) (4, 20) (4, 27) (18, 6) (18, 28) (18, 29) (28, 21) (28, 18) (28, 15) (14, 5) (27, 9) (27, 5) (27, 4) (27, 23) (15, 26) (15, 1) (15, 28) (15, 23) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 22) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 27) (23, 15) (23, 6) (22, 19) (22, 11) (16, 17) (24, 12) (24, 2) (29, 7) (29, 18) (12, 20) (12, 24) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 22) (11, 6) (2, 17) (2, 25) (2, 24) (6, 18) (6, 23) (6, 11) 

Response:
The given graph has been constructed with 30 nodes and 90 edges based on the information provided. 

Now, we will calculate the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by degree in ascending order:
(10, 16, 22) -> degree = 2
(2, 12, 14, 20, 24, 25, 29) -> degree = 3
(0, 3, 6, 7, 13, 18, 28) -> degree = 4
(1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 19, 21, 27) -> degree = 4
(5, 9, 26) -> degree = 4
(17, 23) -> degree = 5

Now, we will count the number of triangles:

<0, 2, 4>
<5, 9, 27>
<5, 21, 27>
<6, 11, 18>
<10, 17, 26>
<10, 20, 25>
<11, 22, 6>
<14, 5, 9>
<15, 1, 28>
<16, 17, 23>
<19, 1, 3>
<19, 13, 22>
<20, 0, 10>
<23, 6, 11>
<23, 15, 26>
<24, 2, 12>
<27, 4, 5>
<29, 7, 18>

Total number of triangles: [17]
