Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 2) (6, 13) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

1. Sort nodes by their number of connections (degree):
```
Node 11: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 13: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 6: degree 2
```

2. Relabel the nodes based on degree in ascending order:
```
Node 6: degree 2
Node 8: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 11: degree 5
```

3. Start counting triangles based on the edges given in the graph. 
  
Triangles found:
```
[Total number of triangles: 11]
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 12>
<0, 8, 13>
<0, 7, 12>
<0, 7, 3>
<1, 2, 12>
<3, 4, 13>
<3, 7, 6>
<4, 7, 12>
<12, 2, 14>
