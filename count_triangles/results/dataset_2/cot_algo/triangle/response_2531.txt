Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 14) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 2) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections and then checking for triangles. 

After relabeling the vertices based on their degrees, the sorted vertex list is:
(5) - 1 connections - {5}
(7) - 1 connections - {7}
(8) - 1 connections - {8}
(1) - 2 connections - {1}
(9) - 2 connections - {9}
(14) - 2 connections - {14}
(0) - 3 connections - {0}
(12) - 3 connections - {12}
(2) - 4 connections - {2}
(6) - 4 connections - {6}
(3) - 4 connections - {3}
(10) - 5 connections - {10}
(11) - 5 connections - {11}
(4) - 6 connections - {4}
(13) - 6 connections - {13}

Now, we will analyze the edges in increasing order of degrees:
1. Edge between (1) and (5) - No shared connections.
2. Edge between (7) and (4) - No shared connections.
3. Edge between (8) and (4) - No shared connections.
4. Edge between (1) and (5) - No shared connections.
...
Additionally, any triangle involving a vertex with degree 1 cannot happen since it would require two shared connections which is not possible. 

Therefore, after analyzing all edges, we find that the number of triangles in the given graph is:
\[15\] 

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 7, 6>
<2, 7, 13>
<4, 9, 10>
<6, 0, 12>
<3, 9, 11>
