Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 16) (7, 13) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 9) (15, 1) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 9) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 8) (16, 6) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 4) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 18) (19, 3) (19, 12) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 17) (9, 18) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 1) (8, 17) (8, 14) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (4, 16) (4, 3) (2, 6) (2, 16) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 14) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 4) (3, 10) (10, 3) 

Response:
The given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be visualized as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 11, 12, and 18.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 11, and 15.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 16.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 10, and 19.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 16.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 11, 12, and 14.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 16.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 13, and 16.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 14 and 17.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 13, 17, and 18.
- Node 10 is connected to node 3.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 14, and 19.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 17.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 12.
- Node 15 is connected to node 1.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 8, 9, and 13.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 0, 9, and 19.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 3, 12, and 18.

Now, let's sort the vertices by the number of connections:
0 (degree 3) < 15 (degree 1) < 4 (degree 2) < 10 (degree 1) < 8 (degree 2) < 2 (degree 2) < 1 (degree 3) < 19 (degree 3) < 14 (degree 3) < 3 (degree 4) < 18 (degree 3) < 6 (degree 4) < 16 (degree 4) < 7 (degree 3) < 17 (degree 3) < 13 (degree 3) < 5 (degree 5) < 11 (degree 3) < 12 (degree 4) < 9 (degree 4)

Using the degree-based ordering method, let's count the triangles:
Triangles: [46]
Unique triangles: <0, 11, 5>, <0, 12, 5>, <0, 12, 14>, <0, 18, 9>, <1, 11, 5>, <1, 9, 17>, <3, 4, 16>, <3, 10, 19>, <3, 12, 19>, <4, 16, 6>, <5, 11, 1>, <5, 12, 14>, <5, 13, 7>, <5, 14, 8>, <6, 16, 2>, <7, 13, 9>, <9, 13, 17>, <10, 3, 19>, <11, 5, 12>, <12, 14, 5>, <12, 19, 18>, <13, 7, 9>, <13, 9, 17>, <14, 5, 12>, <16, 6, 7>, <16, 4, 3>
