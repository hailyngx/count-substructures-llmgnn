Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
Let's first sort the nodes by their number of connections:

- Node 5 has 2 connections
- Node 9 has 3 connections
- Node 6 has 4 connections
- Node 3 has 4 connections
- Node 0 has 4 connections
- Node 2 has 4 connections
- Node 7 has 5 connections
- Node 8 has 5 connections
- Node 4 has 6 connections
- Node 1 has 6 connections

Now, let's list the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. (5, 4) shares a connection with:
   - (4, 1): Triangle <1, 4, 5>
   
2. (5, 6) shares a connection with:
   - No triangles can be formed since node 5 has the least number of connections.
   
3. (9, 8) shares a connection with:
   - (8, 7): Triangle <7, 8, 9>
   
4. (9, 3) shares a connection with:
   - No triangles can be formed since node 9 has the second least number of connections.
   
5. (9, 7) shares a connection with:
   - (7, 1): Triangle <1, 7, 9>
   
6. (1, 3) shares a connection with:
   - (3, 0): Triangle <0, 1, 3>
   
7. (1, 2) shares a connection with:
   - (2, 0): Triangle <0, 1, 2>
   
8. (1, 4) shares a connection with:
   - Triangle <1, 4, 5>
   
9. (1, 7) shares a connection with:
   - Triangle <1, 7, 9>
   
10. (3, 9) shares a connection with:
    - (9, 8): Triangle <8, 9, 3>
   
11. (3, 1) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <1, 3, 0>
   
12. (3, 0) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <0, 3, 4>
   
13. (3, 4) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <1, 3, 4>
   
14. (6, 5) shares a connection with:
    - No triangles can be formed since node 5 has the least number of connections.
   
15. (6, 7) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <6, 7, 1>
   
16. (6, 4) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <4, 6, 5>
   
17. (6, 8) shares a connection with:
    - (8, 7): Triangle <7, 8, 6>
   
18. (0, 3) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <0, 3, 4>
   
19. (0, 2) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <0, 2, 1>
   
20. (0, 4) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <0, 4, 5>
   
21. (0, 8) shares a connection with:
    - (8, 7): Triangle <7, 8, 0>
   
22. (2, 1) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <2, 1, 4>
   
23. (2, 0) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <0, 2, 1>
   
24. (2, 7) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <2, 7, 1>
   
25. (7, 9) shares a connection with:
    - (9, 8): Triangle <7, 8, 9>
   
26. (7, 1) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <7, 1, 3>
   
27. (7, 6) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <6, 7, 1>
   
28. (7, 2) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <2, 7, 1>
   
29. (7, 8) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <7, 8, 9>
   
30. (8, 9) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <8, 9, 3>
   
31. (8, 6) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <6, 8, 7>
   
32. (8, 0) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <8, 0, 3>
   
33. (8, 7) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <7, 8, 6>
   
34. (4, 5) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <1, 4, 5>
   
35. (4, 1) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <1, 4, 5>
   
36. (4, 3) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <1, 3, 4>
   
37. (4, 6) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <4, 6, 5>
   
38. (4, 0) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <0, 4, 5>
   
39. (4, 2) shares a connection with:
    - Triangle <2, 4, 1>

Hence, the total number of triangles is [39] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 4, 1>, <2, 7, 1>, <6, 7, 1>, <4, 6, 5>, <7, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 7>, <7, 8, 6>, <0, 2, 1>, <7, 1, 3>, and <8, 9, 3>.
