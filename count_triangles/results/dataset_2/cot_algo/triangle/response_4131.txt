Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Nodes with their respective degrees:
0: degree 3
1: degree 3
2: degree 4
3: degree 4
4: degree 5
5: degree 4
6: degree 5
7: degree 6
8: degree 6
9: degree 4

Nodes sorted in ascending order of their degrees:
0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 5, 6, 7, 8, 4

Triangles found: 
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [10]
