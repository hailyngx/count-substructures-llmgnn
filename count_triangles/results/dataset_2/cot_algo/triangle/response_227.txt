Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3)
