Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 4) (15, 2) (6, 18) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 10) (4, 11) (4, 15) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 18) (12, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 17) (5, 12) (5, 10) (19, 1) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 2) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 14) (1, 12) (1, 19) (1, 18) (18, 6) (18, 12) (18, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's first sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Nodes sorted by degree:
0 (degree 3)
1 (degree 3)
5 (degree 2)
6 (degree 2)
19 (degree 1)
11 (degree 4)
16 (degree 3)
3 (degree 6)
9 (degree 4)
10 (degree 4)
17 (degree 4)
7 (degree 4)
4 (degree 4)
8 (degree 4)
14 (degree 3)
13 (degree 3)
18 (degree 3)
2 (degree 5)
12 (degree 3)

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles:

Triangles:
[13] 

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
