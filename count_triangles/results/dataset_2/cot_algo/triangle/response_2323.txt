Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 24) (13, 0) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 28) (22, 21) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (3, 25) (3, 12) (25, 3) (25, 14) (25, 11) (8, 13) (8, 7) (10, 1) (10, 20) (17, 1) (17, 28) (17, 26) (2, 5) (2, 18) (2, 20) (2, 24) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 28) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 28) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 19) (28, 22) (28, 17) (28, 18) (28, 7) (28, 29) (29, 28) (21, 22) (21, 19) (21, 15) (24, 13) (24, 2) (24, 23) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 27) (19, 12) (19, 21) (19, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (27, 1) (23, 18) (23, 24) (23, 4) (20, 10) (20, 2) (20, 12) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 15) (15, 21) (15, 4) (16, 1) (16, 6) (26, 17) (26, 11) (26, 6) (14, 9) (14, 25) (14, 2) (6, 13) (6, 16) (6, 26) (11, 5) (11, 25) (11, 26) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections in non-decreasing order:
   - Node 16 has 2 edges
   - Nodes 4, 15, 27, 29 have 3 edges each
   - Nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, 10, 17, 19, 21, 23, 24, 26 have 4 edges each
   - Nodes 5, 6, 8, 20, 22, 28 have 5 edges each
   - Nodes 2, 14 have 6 edges each
   - Nodes 9, 11, 18, 25 have 7 edges each
   - Node 12 has 8 edges
   - Node 13 has 9 edges

2. Relabel the nodes according to their degrees (starting from 0):
   - Node 16 -> Node 0
   - Nodes 4, 15, 27, 29 -> Node 1
   - Nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, 10, 17, 19, 21, 23, 24, 26 -> Node 2
   - Nodes 5, 6, 8, 20, 22, 28 -> Node 3
   - Nodes 2, 14 -> Node 4
   - Nodes 9, 11, 18, 25 -> Node 5
   - Node 12 -> Node 6
   - Node 13 -> Node 7

3. Considering only edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
   - <0, 6> and <0, 16>
   - <4, 24>
   - <15, 4>
   - <27, 1>
   - <29, 28>
   - <2, 4>
   - <3, 28> and <3, 6>
   - <5, 2> and <5, 6>
   - <9, 0> and <9, 2> and <9, 14>
   - <10, 1> and <10, 20>
   - <11, 5> and <11, 25> and <11, 26>
   - <12, 7> and <12, 19> and <12, 20>
   - <13, 0> and <13, 6> and <13, 22> and <13, 24>
   - <14, 2> and <14, 9> and <14, 25>
   - <18, 2> and <18, 23>
   - <21, 22> and <21, 19>
   - <23, 4>

Counting the triangles described above gives a total of [21 triangles].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 6, 16>, <4, 24, 2>, <15, 4, 24>, <27, 1, 17>, <29, 28, 7>, <2, 4, 14>, <3, 28, 20>, <5, 2, 24>, <9, 0, 13>, <9, 2, 14>, <9, 14, 25>, <10, 1, 17>, <10, 1, 16>, <10, 20, 2>, <11, 5, 2>, <11, 5, 9>, <11, 9, 14>, <11, 25, 14>, <11, 25, 26>, <12, 7, 28>, <12, 19, 21>.
