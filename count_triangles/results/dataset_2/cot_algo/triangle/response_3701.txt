Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 6, 7, 0, and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 7, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 4, and 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 7, 3, and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 4, and 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 0.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 2.

Next, we can sort the vertices by their number of connections:

0 (Degree: 3)
8 (Degree: 3)
9 (Degree: 3)
7 (Degree: 4)
5 (Degree: 4)
1 (Degree: 4)
3 (Degree: 4)
4 (Degree: 5)
6 (Degree: 5)
2 (Degree: 6)

Now, we can count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- (0, 2) shares a common neighbor 5 -> Forms triangle <0, 2, 5>.
- (0, 8) does not form a triangle.
- (0, 5) does not form a triangle.
- (8, 1) does not form a triangle.
- (8, 4) does not form a triangle.
- (8, 0) does not form a triangle.
- (9, 5) does not form a triangle.
- (9, 2) shares a common neighbor 6 -> Forms triangle <9, 2, 6>.
- (9, 6) does not form a triangle.
- (2, 5) does not form a triangle.
- (2, 9) shares a common neighbor 6 -> Forms triangle <2, 9, 6>.
- (2, 6) shares a common neighbor 9 -> Forms triangle <2, 6, 9>.
- (2, 7) does not form a triangle.
- (5, 9) shares a common neighbor 2 -> Forms triangle <5, 9, 2>.
- (5, 0) shares a common neighbor 2 -> Forms triangle <5, 0, 2>.
- (5, 4) shares a common neighbor 0 -> Forms triangle <5, 4, 0>.
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <5, 0, 2>, <2, 9, 6>, and <5, 4, 0>.
