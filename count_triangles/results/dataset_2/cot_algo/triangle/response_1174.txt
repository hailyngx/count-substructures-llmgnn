Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees, i.e., the number of connections each node has. Let's denote the nodes as follows based on their degrees (starting from the lowest degree):

Node 3 : 2 connections
Node 7 : 3 connections
Node 0 : 4 connections
Node 8 : 4 connections
Node 2 : 5 connections
Node 1 : 5 connections
Node 6 : 5 connections
Node 5 : 5 connections
Node 9 : 5 connections
Node 4 : 5 connections

Next, we will analyze each edge, starting with the edges connected to the nodes with lower labels, and count the triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles formed: 
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 3, 2>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 8, 6>
