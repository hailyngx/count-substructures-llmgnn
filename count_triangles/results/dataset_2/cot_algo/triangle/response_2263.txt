Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 13) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 18) (3, 16) (3, 12) (3, 4) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 15) (17, 11) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 12) (4, 3) (8, 0) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 15) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 7) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 19) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 7) (19, 14) (19, 18) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 2) (16, 9) (16, 3) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 5) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be drawn as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0-8, 0-13
- 1-6, 1-11, 1-18
- 2-5, 2-15
- 3-4, 3-12, 3-16
- 4-3
- 5-2, 5-6, 5-11
- 6-1, 6-5, 6-7, 6-9
- 7-6, 7-12, 7-13
- 8-0, 8-18
- 9-6, 9-13, 9-15, 9-16, 9-18
- 10-12, 10-14, 10-17
- 11-1, 11-5, 11-14, 11-17
- 12-3, 12-7, 12-10
- 13-0, 13-7, 13-9
- 14-10, 14-11, 14-17, 14-19
- 15-2, 15-9, 15-17
- 16-3, 16-9
- 17-10, 17-14, 17-15
- 18-1, 18-8, 18-9, 18-19
- 19-14, 19-18

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:
1. Node 0: 2 connections
2. Node 2: 2 connections
3. Node 4: 1 connection
4. Node 5: 3 connections
5. Node 3: 3 connections
6. Node 7: 3 connections
7. Node 8: 2 connections
8. Node 10: 3 connections
9. Node 12: 3 connections
10. Node 13: 3 connections
11. Node 15: 3 connections
12. Node 16: 2 connections
13. Node 17: 4 connections
14. Node 1: 3 connections
15. Node 6: 4 connections
16. Node 9: 5 connections
17. Node 11: 4 connections
18. Node 14: 4 connections
19. Node 18: 4 connections
20. Node 19: 2 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [15]

Unique Triangles: <3, 12, 10>, <3, 12, 7>, <3, 10, 12>, <3, 10, 14>, <4, 3, 12>, <6, 1, 11>, <6, 1, 18>, <7, 6, 9>, <7, 6, 13>, <10, 12, 7>, <10, 12, 14>, <11, 1, 6>, <11, 1, 18>, <14, 10, 17>, <17, 11, 5>
