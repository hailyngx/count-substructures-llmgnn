Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 12) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 10) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 9) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 9) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 12) (9, 14) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows: <0, 6, 11, 14, 2, 5, 9, 13, 12, 10, 8, 7, 3, 1, 4>.

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we can find the number of triangles and unique triangles in the graph:

The total number of triangles: [14]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 12>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 12>
<2, 9, 12>
<2, 9, 14>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 13>
<3, 7, 13>
<4, 7, 13>
<5, 8, 10>
<7, 10, 12>
<9, 11, 14>
