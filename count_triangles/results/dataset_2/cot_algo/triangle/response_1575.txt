Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 13) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 1) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Relabel nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
   - Node 0 has 3 connections
   - Node 3 has 3 connections
   - Node 13 has 3 connections
   - Node 4 has 4 connections
   - Node 6 has 4 connections
   - Node 14 has 4 connections
   - Node 2 has 5 connections
   - Node 8 has 5 connections
   - Node 10 has 5 connections
   - Node 1 has 5 connections
   - Node 7 has 6 connections
   - Node 9 has 4 connections
   - Node 5 has 5 connections
   - Node 11 has 5 connections
   - Node 12 has 5 connections
   
2. Analyze the edges while considering the lower labeled node:
   - (2, 6): Nodes 2 and 6 share a connection with Node 7, forming a triangle <2, 6, 7>.
   - (2, 8): Node 2 shares connections with nodes 6 and 7, forming a triangle <2, 8, 7>.
   - (2, 0): No action as Node 0 has a higher label than Node 2.
   - (2, 7): Already counted in the edge (2, 6).
   - (8, 10): Nodes 8 and 10 share a connection with Node 4, forming a triangle <8, 10, 4>.
   - (8, 2): Already counted in the edge (2, 6).
   - (8, 0): No action as Node 0 has a higher label than Node 8.
   - (8, 7): Already counted in the edge (2, 8).
   - (8, 12): Nodes 8 and 12 share a connection with Node 1, forming a triangle <8, 12, 1>.
   - (0, 2): Already counted in the edge (2, 6).
   - (0, 8): Already counted in the edge (2, 8).
   - (0, 13): No action as Node 13 has a higher label than Node 0.
   - (1, 5): Node 1 shares connections with nodes 4 and 12, forming a triangle <1, 5, 4>.
   - (1, 14): No action as Node 14 has a higher label than Node 1.
   - (1, 4): Already counted in the edge (1, 5).
   - (1, 12): Already counted in the edge (1, 5).
   - (3, 7): Node 3 shares connections with nodes 4 and 14, forming a triangle <3, 7, 4>.
   - (3, 14): Already counted in the edge (3, 7).
   - (3, 4): Already counted in the edge (3, 7).
