Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 10) (15, 0) (27, 15) (27, 3) (27, 7) (27, 6) (4, 7) (4, 24) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 27) (7, 4) (7, 9) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 27) (3, 0) (3, 26) (20, 17) (20, 28) (6, 27) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 8) (28, 20) (28, 6) (28, 18) (9, 7) (9, 22) (22, 9) (22, 17) (22, 12) (5, 29) (5, 11) (13, 25) (13, 2) (13, 11) (24, 4) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 14) (24, 10) (26, 3) (26, 24) (26, 2) (26, 21) (0, 15) (0, 3) (10, 15) (10, 24) (10, 25) (21, 6) (21, 26) (21, 16) (17, 1) (17, 20) (17, 22) (17, 23) (16, 4) (16, 21) (16, 19) (2, 13) (2, 26) (2, 12) (12, 22) (12, 2) (18, 28) (18, 23) (19, 16) (19, 29) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 24) (11, 25) (23, 17) (23, 18) (25, 13) (25, 10) (25, 11) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 29) (14, 1) (14, 24) (29, 5) (29, 19) (29, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order, then relabeling the vertices accordingly.

The vertices with their degrees are as follows:
(0: 2), (1: 3), (2: 3), (3: 4), (4: 4), (5: 2), (6: 4), (7: 4), (8: 3), (9: 3), 
(10: 3), (11: 5), (12: 2), (13: 3), (14: 2), (15: 3), (16: 3), (17: 4), (18: 2), (19: 2), 
(20: 2), (21: 3), (22: 3), (23: 2), (24: 5), (25: 3), (26: 4), (27: 5), (28: 3), (29: 3)

Vertices sorted by degree: 
(0, 5, 12, 14, 18, 19, 20, 23, 15, 1, 8, 10, 2, 13, 22, 9, 16, 21, 28, 29, 25, 17, 3, 4, 26, 11, 24, 6, 7, 27)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we can count the number of triangles and list unique triangles as follows:

Total number of triangles: [52]
Unique triangles: 
<0, 3, 26>,  
<0, 3, 27>,  
<0, 3, 6>,  
<0, 10, 24>,  
<0, 10, 25>,  
<1, 13, 2>,  
<1, 8, 6>,  
<4, 11, 24>,  
<4, 5, 11>,  
<4, 7, 27>,  
<4, 9, 7>,  
<4, 14, 24>,  
<6, 8, 21>,  
<6, 8, 28>,  
<6, 21, 26>,  
<6, 21, 16>,  
<8, 1, 17>,  
<9, 7, 27>,
