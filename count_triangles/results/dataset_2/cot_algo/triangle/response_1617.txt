Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves ordering the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. Then, we can iterate over the edges and count the triangles formed by shared connections between vertices.

After sorting the vertices, the vertex labels (and their corresponding connections) are as follows:
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 7: 1 connection
- Node 10: 2 connections
- Node 17: 2 connections
- Node 18: 2 connections
- Node 19: 3 connections
- Node 20: 4 connections
- Node 21: 4 connections
- Node 23: 2 connections
- Node 28: 4 connections
- Node 29: 4 connections
- Node 0: 6 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 13: 2 connections
- Node 15: 4 connections
- Node 16: 4 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 11: 3 connections
- Node 12: 3 connections
- Node 24: 4 connections
- Node 25: 3 connections
- Node 26: 6 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections
- Node 14: 2 connections
- Node 22: 1 connection
- Node 27: 3 connections

Now, let's count the triangles:
1. For the edge (5, 19):
   - Node 5 connects with Node 1 and Node 19, forming a triangle <5, 1, 19>.
2. For the edge (7, 18):
   - Node 7 connects with Node 3 and Node 18, forming a triangle <7, 3, 18>.
3. For the edge (10, 14):
   - Node 10 connects with Node 15 and Node 14, forming a triangle <10, 15, 14>.
4. For the edge (17, 28):
   - Node 17 connects with Node 27 and Node 28, forming a triangle <17, 27, 28>.
5. For the edge (19, 10):
   - Node 19 connects with Node 8 and Node 10, forming a triangle <19, 8, 10>.
6. For the edge (20, 13):
   - Node 20 connects with Node 16 and Node 13, forming a triangle <20, 16, 13>.
7. For the edge (21, 23):
   - Node 21 connects with Node 16 and Node 23, forming a triangle <21, 16, 23>.
8. For the edge (28, 17):
   - Node 28 connects with Node 27 and Node 17, forming a triangle <28, 27, 17>.
9. For the edge (29, 15):
   - Node 29 connects with Node 9 and Node 15, forming a triangle <29, 9, 15>.

After considering all the above triangles, the total number of triangles is [9], and the unique triangles found are:
<5, 1, 19>, <7, 3, 18>, <10, 15, 14>, <17, 27, 28>, <19, 8, 10>, <20, 16, 13>, <21, 16, 23>, <28, 27, 17>, <29, 9, 15>.
