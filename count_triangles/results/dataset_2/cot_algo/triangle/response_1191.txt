Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 23) (26, 29) (26, 12) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 10) (3, 25) (3, 0) (15, 5) (15, 0) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 4) (25, 18) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 20) (18, 5) (18, 25) (18, 2) (18, 14) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 21) (0, 19) (20, 2) (20, 0) (20, 1) (20, 14) (22, 19) (22, 6) (22, 28) (22, 10) (11, 28) (11, 8) (28, 22) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 7) (4, 25) (4, 27) (4, 13) (4, 17) (27, 9) (27, 25) (27, 4) (16, 2) (16, 28) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 12) (29, 24) (21, 0) (21, 13) (23, 26) (23, 6) (19, 0) (19, 22) (19, 7) (19, 14) (24, 29) (24, 8) (7, 28) (7, 19) (7, 1) (17, 4) (13, 4) (13, 21) (6, 22) (6, 23) (1, 20) (1, 7) (8, 11) (8, 24) (8, 10) (14, 18) (14, 20) (14, 19) (10, 5) (10, 22) (10, 8) (12, 26) (12, 29) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, we relabel the vertices according to this order. 

Based on the provided list of edges, and the fact that there are 30 nodes in total, the sorted list of vertices with their respective degrees is as follows:
(3, 4), (23, 4), (1, 4), (16, 4), (13, 4), (6, 4), (17, 4), (24, 3), (2, 4), (7, 4), (8, 3), (10, 3), (14, 3), (15, 2), (18, 4), (21, 2), (4, 4), (27, 4), (5, 4), (25, 4), (0, 5), (19, 4), (20, 4), (22, 4), (26, 4), (28, 4), (29, 4), (9, 4), (11, 2), (12, 2).

Now, we go through each edge and check for shared connections to count the triangles. Since each triangle should be counted only once, we only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Number of triangles: [22]
