By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph. 

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [16].
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 21>
<6, 20, 28>
<10, 14, 25>
<4, 14, 26>
<4, 16, 19>
<6, 16, 20>
<4, 8, 28>
<10, 13, 25>
<1, 4, 7>
<6, 14, 20>
<16, 20, 25>
<18, 21, 28>
<9, 11, 27>
<4, 5, 19>
<3, 6, 28>
<13, 14, 10>
