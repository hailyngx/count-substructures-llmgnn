Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 0) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) (19, 7) (19, 12) (15, 6) (16, 13) (16, 17) (12, 4) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 18) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 18) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 17) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 8) (7, 19) (17, 16) (17, 2) (14, 2) (14, 18) (18, 12) (18, 6) (18, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's first construct the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3), (9, 4), (10, 0), (10, 8), (11, 1), (11, 0), (8, 13), (8, 7), (13, 16), (13, 2), (4, 12), (4, 6), (3, 2), (19, 7), (15, 6), (16, 17), (12, 19), (12, 18), (1, 6), (2, 14)

Now let's sort the vertices by the number of connections:
Vertices: 5, 9, 10, 11, 3, 19, 15, 7, 17, 18, 16, 6, 12, 8, 13, 4, 2, 0, 1, 14

Now, based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's proceed with counting the triangles.

[Total number of triangles: 18]

<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 10, 8>, <1, 5, 11>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 13, 17>, <2, 12, 18>, <2, 14, 18>, <2, 17, 16>, <3, 2, 5>, <4, 12, 18>, <4, 9, 5>, <6, 12, 18>, <6, 15, 18>, <8, 10, 0>, <8, 13, 16>
