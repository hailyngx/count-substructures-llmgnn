Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 21) (9, 23) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 12) (15, 4) (15, 28) (27, 11) (27, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 28) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 25) (3, 8) (7, 27) (7, 19) (21, 9) (21, 24) (25, 3) (25, 6) (25, 16) (25, 24) (10, 17) (10, 22) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 28) (17, 2) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 13) (24, 21) (24, 25) (22, 10) (22, 12) (22, 8) (11, 27) (11, 1) (11, 28) (11, 18) (11, 4) (28, 15) (28, 1) (28, 17) (28, 11) (28, 5) (5, 26) (5, 28) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 4) (13, 17) (13, 14) (13, 2) (16, 25) (29, 0) (6, 25) (6, 14) (6, 23) (12, 9) (12, 26) (12, 22) (12, 18) (4, 15) (4, 11) (4, 19) (18, 14) (18, 11) (18, 12) (2, 17) (2, 13) (2, 23) (23, 9) (23, 10) (23, 6) (23, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 22) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29
Edges: 
- 0: [8, 14, 29]
- 1: [3, 8, 11, 19, 28]
- 2: [13, 17, 23]
- 3: [1, 8, 25]
- 4: [11, 15, 19]
- 5: [26, 28]
- 6: [14, 23, 25]
- 7: [11, 19, 27]
- 8: [0, 1, 3, 22]
- 9: [12, 21, 23, 26]
- 10: [12, 17, 22, 23]
- 11: [1, 4, 11, 18, 27, 28]
- 12: [9, 18, 22, 26]
- 13: [2, 14, 17]
- 14: [0, 13, 18]
- 15: [4, 28]
- 16: [25]
- 17: [2, 13, 17, 28]
- 18: [11, 12, 14]
- 19: [1, 4, 7, 19]
- 20: []
- 21: [9, 24]
- 22: [8, 10, 12]
- 23: [2, 6, 10, 23]
- 24: [21, 25]
- 25: [3, 6, 16, 24]
- 26: [5, 9, 12]
- 27: [7, 11]
- 28: [1, 5, 11, 15, 17]
- 29: [0]

Now, we will find the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [<1, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 23>, <2, 13, 17>, <4, 11, 28>, <4, 15, 28>, <6, 14, 25>, <9, 12, 26>, <11, 18, 28>, <17, 2, 13>]

Total number of triangles: [9]
