Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 0) (16, 14) (16, 10) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 3) (1, 6) (1, 18) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 12) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 17) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 9) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 16) (14, 8) (14, 19) (2, 3) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 18) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 10) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 18) (18, 1) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort the nodes by their degree.

Node degrees:
Node 0: 4
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 2
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 2
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 4
Node 8: 3
Node 9: 4
Node 10: 5
Node 11: 2
Node 12: 5
Node 13: 3
Node 14: 4
Node 15: 2
Node 16: 2
Node 17: 4
Node 18: 4
Node 19: 4

Sorted nodes:
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 2
Node 4: 2
Node 5: 2
Node 15: 2
Node 16: 2
Node 11: 2
Node 13: 3
Node 8: 3
Node 0: 4
Node 14: 4
Node 3: 4
Node 7: 4
Node 9: 4
Node 17: 4
Node 18: 4
Node 19: 4
Node 6: 4
Node 12: 5
Node 10: 5

Now, we count the triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 10]

<0, 12, 18>
<0, 12, 7>
<0, 14, 19>
<6, 10, 19>
<6, 10, 4>
<6, 17, 7>
<7, 9, 12>
<7, 9, 3>
<10, 16, 14>
<12, 17, 18>
