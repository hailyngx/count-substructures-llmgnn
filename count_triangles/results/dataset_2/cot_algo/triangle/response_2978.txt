Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 11) (18, 14) (18, 22) (18, 20) (18, 0) (18, 3) (22, 18) (22, 4) (22, 5) (20, 18) (20, 21) (25, 19) (25, 15) (25, 0) (25, 12) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 27) (13, 5) (1, 26) (1, 12) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 10) (26, 7) (28, 26) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 27) (29, 12) (5, 14) (5, 22) (5, 13) (6, 16) (6, 27) (21, 20) (19, 14) (19, 25) (19, 23) (23, 19) (0, 18) (0, 25) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 24) (10, 26) (10, 0) (10, 3) (4, 22) (4, 24) (4, 16) (7, 14) (7, 26) (7, 11) (7, 15) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 24) (24, 0) (24, 4) (24, 16) (24, 9) (27, 8) (27, 29) (27, 6) (3, 18) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 25) (15, 7) (15, 11) (2, 11) (9, 11) (9, 24) (12, 25) (12, 1) (12, 29) (12, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 7), (14, 19), (14, 5), (17, 11), (18, 22), (18, 20), (22, 4), (20, 21), (25, 15), (25, 12), (8, 16), (8, 27), (13, 5), (1, 26), (26, 28), (28, 29), (29, 27), (5, 13), (6, 16), (6, 27), (19, 23), (0, 10), (4, 24), (7, 15), (11, 9), (16, 6), (24, 9), (27, 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, after sorting by the number of connections, the relabeled nodes are as follows:
Nodes: 9, 2, 10, 13, 17, 21, 23, 7, 15, 19, 22, 24, 26, 29, 1, 20, 6, 8, 11, 12, 18, 0, 14, 16, 25, 27, 28, 3, 4, 5

After checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 10, 12>, <0, 10, 3>, <0, 12, 25>, <0, 24, 16>, <0, 24, 4>, <0, 25, 12>, <0, 25, 18>, <1, 26, 12>, <10, 12, 25>, <11, 15, 7>, <12, 25, 19>, <14, 17, 11>, <14, 19, 23>, <14, 5, 13>, <14, 5, 22>, <16, 6, 27>, <16, 8, 27>, <17, 14, 11>, <18, 20, 21>, <18, 4, 22>, <19, 14, 25>, <27, 6, 16>, <29, 12, 25>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [23].
