Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 0) (5, 4) (2, 6) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 0) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 7) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 13) 

Response:
The vertices and their connections based on the given edges are as follows:

Vertex 0: 1, 4, 12, 14
Vertex 1: 0, 3, 8, 11, 12
Vertex 2: 6, 13
Vertex 3: 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12
Vertex 4: 0, 3, 5
Vertex 5: 4
Vertex 6: 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14
Vertex 7: 3, 6, 11, 14
Vertex 8: 1, 3, 6, 8, 11, 13
Vertex 9: 6, 10, 12, 14
Vertex 10: 3, 9, 13
Vertex 11: 1, 6, 7, 8
Vertex 12: 0, 1, 3, 9
Vertex 13: 2, 8, 10, 14
Vertex 14: 0, 6, 7, 9, 13

Following the degree-based ordering method, we can relabel the vertices as:
Vertices by degree: 5, 2, 9, 4, 0, 13, 7, 11, 8, 12, 1, 10, 14, 6, 3

Now, we will count the number of triangles formed by the shared connections between edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

After analyzing all the connections, we find that there are a total of 16 triangles in the graph. 

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16]. 
And the unique triangles found are:
<3, 8, 13>
<3, 8, 1>
<13, 2, 6>
<11, 6, 1>
<3, 8, 11>
<3, 1, 12>
<6, 11, 7>
<6, 8, 11>
<0, 1, 12>
<3, 12, 9>
<0, 12, 9>
<3, 10, 13>
<0, 1, 4>
<3, 10, 9>
<0, 4, 5>
<4, 0, 12>
