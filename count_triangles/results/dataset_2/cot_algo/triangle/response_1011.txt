Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (3, 1), (8, 1), (3, 6), (2, 6), (0, 6)
- 1: (5, 1), (1, 3), (1, 0), (8, 1)
- 2: (5, 2), (9, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2)
- 3: (5, 3), (4, 3), (7, 3), (1, 3), (3, 0), (3, 6)
- 4: (9, 4), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4)
- 5: (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (3, 5)
- 6: (5, 6), (6, 3), (2, 6), (0, 6)
- 7: (7, 4), (7, 2), (7, 8), (7, 3)
- 8: (9, 8), (4, 8), (7, 8), (1, 8), (8, 1), (8, 4)
- 9: (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 2)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes by degree:
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 3

Next, we will count the triangles:

[Number of triangles: 9]

Unique triangles:
<3, 1, 5>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<4, 9, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 0>
