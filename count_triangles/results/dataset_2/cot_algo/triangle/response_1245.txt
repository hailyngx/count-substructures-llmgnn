Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
The sorted vertices by their degree are as follows:
Vertices: 0, 5, 9, 1, 8, 7, 3, 11, 12, 10, 6, 2, 13, 4, 14

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles: 

Triangles: [5]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. 

Unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 4, 14>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 11, 12>
