Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps us efficiently count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Here is the list of vertices sorted by the number of connections (degree) in increasing order:
1. Node 7 - Degree 3
2. Node 1 - Degree 3
3. Node 8 - Degree 4
4. Node 0 - Degree 4
5. Node 2 - Degree 4
6. Node 9 - Degree 4
7. Node 4 - Degree 4
8. Node 5 - Degree 4
9. Node 6 - Degree 5
10. Node 3 - Degree 5

Now, let's count the triangles using the degree-based ordering method:

1. (7, 0) shares connection 0 with (0, 9) and connection 7 with (7, 9). Triangle formed: <7, 0, 9>.
2. (2, 7) shares connection 2 with (7, 3) and connection 7 with (7, 9). Triangle formed: <2, 7, 9>.
3. (2, 3) shares connection 2 with (2, 1) and connection 3 with (3, 1). Triangle formed: <2, 3, 1>.
4. (4, 1) shares connection 4 with (4, 8) and connection 1 with (1, 2). Triangle formed: <4, 1, 2>.
5. (0, 7) shares connection 0 with (0, 9) and connection 7 with (7, 9). Triangle formed: <0, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
