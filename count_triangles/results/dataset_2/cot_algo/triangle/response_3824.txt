Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 2) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 19) (19, 5) (19, 11) (8, 9) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 18) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 16) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 7) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 0) (6, 15) (6, 14) (4, 15) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 1) (18, 10) (18, 13) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 1) 

Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. 

Let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes: 
0 - degree: 3
1 - degree: 3
8 - degree: 1
12 - degree: 2
17 - degree: 4
10 - degree: 3
18 - degree: 2
11 - degree: 3
7 - degree: 3
5 - degree: 5
19 - degree: 3
9 - degree: 4
13 - degree: 6
14 - degree: 4
6 - degree: 3
4 - degree: 4
2 - degree: 4
16 - degree: 5
15 - degree: 5
3 - degree: 2

Now, we will count the number of triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method.

[Total number of triangles: 16]
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 10>
<1, 0, 4>
<1, 0, 10>
<2, 4, 15>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 1>
<2, 4, 0>
<4, 2, 5>
<4, 2, 1>
<4, 2, 0>
<5, 2, 4>
<5, 2, 16>
<5, 2, 15>
<10, 1, 11>
<13, 9, 12>
