Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (16, 12) (16, 10) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 19) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 9) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 10) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 17) (17, 1) (17, 5) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 0) (10, 12) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 10) (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 17) (9, 3) (9, 4) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 19) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 2) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to label the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:

Vertex 0: Degree 3
Vertex 17: Degree 3
Vertex 18: Degree 3
Vertex 10: Degree 4
Vertex 12: Degree 4
Vertex 16: Degree 4
Vertex 5: Degree 4
Vertex 19: Degree 4
Vertex 13: Degree 4
Vertex 2: Degree 5
Vertex 1: Degree 5
Vertex 6: Degree 5
Vertex 7: Degree 5
Vertex 9: Degree 5
Vertex 8: Degree 5
Vertex 14: Degree 5
Vertex 3: Degree 6
Vertex 15: Degree 6
Vertex 4: Degree 6
Vertex 11: Degree 1

Now, let's count the triangles:

[Number of triangles]: 34
<0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 15>, <0, 14, 7>, <0, 14, 12>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 15>, <1, 17, 5>, <2, 15, 6>, <2, 15, 18>, <3, 6, 15>, <3, 7, 15>, <3, 9, 4>, <3, 9, 19>, <4, 8, 7>, <4, 8, 13>, <5, 15, 17>, <5, 17, 18>, <6, 15, 7>, <6, 15, 5>, <7, 15, 5>, <7, 14, 12>, <7, 14, 0>, <7, 19, 3>, <8, 4, 13>, <9, 4, 13>, <10, 16, 12>, <10, 16, 18>, <10, 16, 1>, <10, 18, 2>, <12, 16, 10>, <12, 16, 14>, <13, 4, 9>, <15, 7, 14>, <15, 5, 17>, <19, 7, 14>
