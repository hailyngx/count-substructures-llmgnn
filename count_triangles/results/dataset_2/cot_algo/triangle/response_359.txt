Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 2) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order, and then relabeling the nodes accordingly. 

The degrees of the nodes in the given graph are as follows:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 5
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 5
Node 11: degree 6
Node 12: degree 5
Node 13: degree 6
Node 14: degree 4

By relabeling the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 0 → 0
Node 4 → 1
Node 6 → 2
Node 1 → 3
Node 7 → 4
Node 9 → 5
Node 5 → 6
Node 2 → 7
Node 3 → 8
Node 8 → 9
Node 10 → 10
Node 12 → 11
Node 14 → 12
Node 11 → 13
Node 13 → 14

Now, we will check each edge to count the triangles. We will only consider edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections.

The triangles found:
<4, 2, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 11>
<2, 5, 11>
<8, 9, 11>
<8, 3, 10>
<4, 12, 5>
<8, 11, 13>

The total number of triangles is [8].
