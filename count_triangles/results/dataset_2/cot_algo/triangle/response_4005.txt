Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
Let's first construct a graph with the given nodes and edges.  

Number of nodes: 10  
Number of edges: 40  

Edges:  
(6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0)    
(9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7)    
(1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7)    
(3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8)    
(4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8)    
(7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5)    
(8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0)    
(5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 0)    
(2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7)    
(0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5)  

Now, let's list the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:  
Node 2: Degree 2  
Node 4: Degree 2  
Node 5: Degree 4  
Node 3: Degree 3  
Node 8: Degree 6  
Node 1: Degree 4  
Node 9: Degree 4  
Node 0: Degree 6  
Node 6: Degree 4  
Node 7: Degree 6
