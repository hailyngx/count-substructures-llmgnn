Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most.

The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are:
Node 4 (Degree: 2)
Node 3 (Degree: 3)
Node 2 (Degree: 3)
Node 0 (Degree: 4)
Node 8 (Degree: 4)
Node 6 (Degree: 4)
Node 1 (Degree: 5)
Node 7 (Degree: 5)
Node 9 (Degree: 5)
Node 5 (Degree: 5)

Starting from the edge with the lower labeled vertex, we go through the edges and check for shared connections to count triangles.

Triangles:
<3, 1, 6>
<3, 1, 7>
<2, 0, 6>
<6, 0, 5>
<6, 1, 7>
<1, 3, 6>

Total number of triangles: [6]
