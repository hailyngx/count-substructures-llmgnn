Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 9) (12, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 11) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 10) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices sorted by connections:
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 11: 5 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the order:

(1, 14) - Not considered as 1 has more connections than 14.
(1, 9) - Not considered as 1 has more connections than 9.
(1, 8) - Not considered as 1 has more connections than 8.
(3, 13) - Not considered as 3 has more connections than 13.
(5, 8) - Not considered as 5 has more connections than 8.
(13, 3) - Not considered as 13 has more connections than 3.
(0, 7) - Considered as 0 has fewer connections than 7.
Shared connections: 2
(3, 4) - Not considered as 3 has more connections than 4.
(4, 7) - Not considered as 4 has more connections than 7.
(5, 8) - Not considered as 5 has more connections than 8.
(10, 14) - Considered as 10 has fewer connections than 14.
Shared connections: 0, 2
(0, 2) - Considered as 0 has fewer connections than 2.
Shared connections: 7
(0, 5) - Considered as 0 has fewer connections than 5.
Shared connections: 8
(0, 6) - Considered as 0 has fewer connections than 6.
Shared connections: 4
(1, 8) - Not considered as 1 has more connections than 8.
(9, 1) - Not considered as 9 has more connections than 1.
(8, 3) - Not considered as 8 has more connections than 3.
(1, 9) - Not considered as 1 has more connections than 9.
(9, 2) - Considered as 9 has fewer connections than 2.
Shared connections: 1
(9, 8) - Not considered as 9 has more connections than 8.
(12, 4) - Considered as 12 has fewer connections than 4.
Shared connections: 9
(13, 6) - Considered as 13 has fewer connections than 6.
Shared connections: 3
(11, 6) - Considered as 11 has fewer connections than 6.
Shared connections: 4
(11, 13) - Considered as 11 has fewer connections than 13.
Shared connections: 6
(11, 14) - Considered as 11 has fewer connections than 14.
Shared connections: 14
(12, 14) - Not considered as 12 has more connections than 14.
