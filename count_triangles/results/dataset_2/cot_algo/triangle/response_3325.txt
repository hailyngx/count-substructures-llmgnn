Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 12) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 3) (12, 11) (12, 2) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. The degrees of the vertices in this graph are as follows:
0: 5
1: 7
2: 6
3: 4
4: 3
5: 4
6: 3
7: 4
8: 4
9: 5
10: 4
11: 5
12: 2
13: 4
14: 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, the vertices from lowest degree to highest degree are: 12, 6, 4, 8, 13, 2, 10, 7, 3, 14, 0, 5, 11, 9, 1.

Now, we will go through the edges while considering the lower-degree node first. We will count the triangles formed by each edge.

Triangles formed by the edges:
(12, 2): <12, 2, 8>
(6, 3): <6, 3, 11>
(4, 0): <4, 0, 10>, <4, 0, 1>, <4, 0, 9>, <4, 0, 7>
(8, 1): <8, 1, 4>, <8, 1, 5>, <8, 1, 14>, <8, 1, 9>
(13, 3): <13, 3, 6>, <13, 3, 7>, <13, 3, 10>
(2, 0): No triangle formed
(10, 0): <10, 0, 4>, <10, 0, 1>
(7, 4): <7, 4, 0>, <7, 4, 1>, <7, 4, 11>
(3, 6): <3, 6, 11>
(14, 1): <14, 1, 4>, <14, 1, 5>, <14, 1, 8>
(9, 0): <9, 0, 4>, <9, 0, 1>, <9, 0, 5>
(5, 1): <5, 1, 4>, <5, 1, 14>, <5, 1, 9>, <5, 1, 13>

Total number of triangles: [22]
