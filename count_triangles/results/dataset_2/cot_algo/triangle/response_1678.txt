Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 5) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 9) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (2, 5) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 1) (8, 5) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 9) (13, 10) (13, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Here are the vertices labeled from the least connected to the most connected:
Vertices: 2, 7, 13, 0, 4, 5, 8, 13, 11, 1, 3, 6, 10, 12, 14

Now, we will analyze the edges based on the vertex labels:
Edges:
(0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 9)
(14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 8)
(4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6)
(12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3)
(1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8)
(6, 3)
(7, 9)
(11, 9) (11, 4)
(3, 5) (3, 9)
(5, 2) (5, 8)
(8, 5)
(10, 13) (10, 9)
(13, 9)


Now, let's count the triangles by looking at the shared connections:
Triangles:
<1, 6, 14>
<1, 8, 14>
<3, 5, 12>
<5, 8, 14>
<9, 10, 13>
<9, 11, 4>
<0, 8, 14> 
<4, 6, 11> 
<5, 8, 14> 
<9, 11, 4>
[10] triangles found.
