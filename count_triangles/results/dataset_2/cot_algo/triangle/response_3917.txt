Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, we assign new labels to the vertices based on this sorting order. 

After sorting the vertices by their degree, we have the following order: 

0 (degree 4)
3 (degree 2)
1 (degree 4)
7 (degree 4)
2 (degree 4)
8 (degree 4)
5 (degree 4)
4 (degree 4)
6 (degree 5)
9 (degree 4)

Now, we go through each edge and only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles found:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 7, 5>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
