Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 1) (16, 9) (16, 5) (16, 6) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 14) (4, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 0) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 10) (17, 0) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 15) (18, 9) (18, 2) (8, 11) (8, 5) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 0) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 12) (1, 16) (1, 14) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 0) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 19) (14, 1) (14, 13) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 12) (13, 15) (13, 14) 

Response:
The given graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 17, 19, 12
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 16, 14
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 18, 14
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 11, 7, 12
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 16, 8, 12
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 16, 9, 19
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 2
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 11, 5
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 16, 6, 18, 0
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 17, 12
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 8, 15
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 3, 10, 5, 0
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 15, 14
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 15, 2, 19, 1, 13
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 11, 18, 13, 14
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 1, 9, 5, 6
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 10, 0
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 15, 9, 2
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 6, 14, 0

After sorting nodes by their degrees in ascending order: 
Nodes: {4, 1, 17, 10, 8, 13, 5, 7, 2, 16, 18, 3, 12, 0, 6, 9, 11, 15, 14, 19}

Triangles found: <9, 0, 12>, <9, 16, 6>, <0, 17, 10>, <2, 7, 3>, <12, 0, 17>, <12, 0, 9>, <18, 15, 14>, <18, 2, 7>, <18, 9, 16>, <18, 9, 6>, <5, 8, 11>, <5, 12, 0>, <14, 1, 16>, <14, 13, 15>
  
Final answer:
Total number of triangles: [14]
