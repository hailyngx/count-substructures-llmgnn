Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 0) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 11) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 3) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 10) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 11) (17, 7) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 0) (15, 2) (15, 1) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 9) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 12) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 3) (10, 1) (16, 8) (16, 1) (7, 2) (7, 17) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 11) (13, 19) (13, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. Then, we relabel the vertices according to this sorting.

The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is as follows:
(6, 7) (14, 7) (10, 7) (16, 7) (13, 8) (18, 8) (7, 8) (19, 8) (15, 8) (2, 9) (5, 9) (4, 9) (3, 9) (8, 10) (1, 10) (11, 10) (12, 10) (17, 10) (0, 10) (9, 11)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles. We only count a triangle if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections than the other vertex.

Based on this method, the number of triangles in the graph is [21].

Here are the unique triangles found:
<0, 11, 19>
<1, 10, 17>
<2, 7, 17>
<2, 7, 11>
<2, 11, 18>
<2, 11, 17>
<2, 14, 18>
<3, 8, 12>
<3, 8, 13>
<4, 5, 12>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 8, 16>
<5, 8, 12>
<5, 12, 19>
<8, 12, 16>
<9, 0, 11>
<9, 0, 19>
<9, 11, 14>
<9, 14, 17>
<13, 3, 19>
<16, 1, 17>
