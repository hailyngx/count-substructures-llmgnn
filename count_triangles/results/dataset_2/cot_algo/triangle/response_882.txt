Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 29) (15, 17) (6, 14) (9, 22) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 7) (25, 19) (25, 8) (25, 18) (8, 25) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 27) (22, 3) (22, 9) (22, 28) (23, 26) (23, 16) (23, 20) (27, 13) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 28) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 27) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 21) (12, 1) (24, 26) (24, 16) (24, 10) (24, 20) (26, 23) (26, 24) (26, 0) (11, 28) (11, 5) (11, 20) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 11) (28, 2) (18, 25) (18, 27) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 24) (16, 10) (21, 12) (1, 12) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 19) (29, 15) (29, 1) (14, 6) (14, 27) (20, 23) (20, 24) (20, 11) (20, 1) (2, 7) (2, 28) (2, 0) (19, 25) (19, 1) (17, 15) (17, 9) (0, 4) (0, 26) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 24) (10, 16) (5, 4) (5, 11) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most. 

After relabeling the vertices according to their degrees, the sorted list is:
- Vertex 6 (Degree 1)
- Vertex 29 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 14 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 5 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 13 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 19 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 21 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 3 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 18 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 7 (Degree 3)
- Vertex 12 (Degree 3)
- Vertex 1 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 20 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 10 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 11 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 25 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 9 (Degree 5)
- Vertex 28 (Degree 5)
- Vertex 17 (Degree 6)
- Vertex 15 (Degree 6)
- Vertex 4 (Degree 6)
- Vertex 8 (Degree 7)
- Vertex 26 (Degree 7)
- Vertex 27 (Degree 7)
- Vertex 22 (Degree 7)
- Vertex 0 (Degree 7)
- Vertex 16 (Degree 8)
- Vertex 2 (Degree 8)
- Vertex 24 (Degree 8)
- Vertex 23 (Degree 8)

Now, we will check for triangles formed by shared connections between the vertices of each edge in the original graph based on the degree-based ordering.

The total number of triangles found is 21, and the unique triangles are listed below:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 26>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 10>
- <0, 4, 28>
- <2, 7, 12>
- <2, 7, 27>
- <2, 28, 11>
- <4, 8, 16>
- <4, 10, 24>
- <7, 12, 21>
- <9, 7, 27>
- <10, 16, 24>
- <11, 20, 24>
- <17, 9, 22>
- <17, 15, 29>
- <18, 27, 14>
- <20, 1, 19>
- <20, 23, 16>
- <20, 24, 16>
- <25, 8, 18>

The total number of triangles is [21].
