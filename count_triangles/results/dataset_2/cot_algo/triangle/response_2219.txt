Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 12) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 11) (27, 9) (18, 26) (18, 23) (18, 25) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 6) (15, 24) (15, 16) (20, 9) (20, 4) (20, 6) (2, 14) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (26, 18) (26, 22) (26, 10) (9, 27) (9, 22) (9, 20) (5, 13) (5, 24) (5, 28) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 29) (13, 3) (7, 25) (7, 23) (7, 17) (25, 18) (25, 7) (10, 26) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 27) (11, 23) (23, 18) (23, 7) (23, 11) (23, 12) (4, 20) (4, 3) (4, 17) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 23) (12, 3) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 14) (6, 22) (6, 20) (6, 24) (24, 15) (24, 5) (24, 6) (17, 13) (17, 7) (17, 4) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 29) (21, 27) (21, 13) (21, 19) (19, 21) (19, 29) (19, 28) (29, 13) (29, 16) (29, 19) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) (14, 1) (28, 5) (28, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their degree, i.e., the number of connections each vertex has.

Here is the sorted list of vertices with their degrees:
(0: 2), (1: 3), (2: 1), (3: 6), (4: 4), (5: 3), (6: 4), (7: 3), (8: 3), (9: 4), (10: 3), (11: 3), (12: 4), (13: 4), (14: 3), (15: 2), (16: 3), (17: 4), (18: 3), (19: 3), (20: 4), (21: 3), (22: 3), (23: 4), (24: 4), (25: 3), (26: 4), (27: 4), (28: 2), (29: 3)

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
1. <3, 12, 23>
2. <3, 13, 17>
3. <3, 4, 7>
4. <3, 4, 17>
5. <3, 8, 12>
6. <3, 8, 13>
7. <3, 10, 14>
8. <4, 17, 7>
9. <4, 17, 13>
10. <4, 20, 6>
11. <6, 20, 24>
12. <7, 17, 13>
13. <9, 20, 6>
14. <9, 22, 26>
15. <9, 27, 0>
16. <10, 14, 1>
17. <13, 17, 7>
18. <13, 17, 4>
19. <13, 21, 19>
20. <16, 1, 14>
21. <19, 21, 13>
22. <19, 21, 27>
23. <19, 28, 5>
24. <20, 4, 3>
25. <23, 12, 3>

Total number of triangles: [25]
