Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 0), (9, 6), (9, 3), (9, 0), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 1), (7, 6), (7, 2), (6, 2)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

Degree of each node:
0: 5 connections
1: 2 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 5 connections
4: 7 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 4 connections

Interpreting the nodes in order of least to most connections:
1. 1 (Degree: 2)
2. 8 (Degree: 2)
3. 5 (Degree: 3)
4. 7 (Degree: 3)
5. 6 (Degree: 4)
6. 2 (Degree: 4)
7. 9 (Degree: 4)
8. 0 (Degree: 5)
9. 3 (Degree: 5)
10. 4 (Degree: 7)
