Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 16) (17, 0) (17, 19) (10, 8) (10, 19) (11, 7) (11, 13) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 5) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 19) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 5) (9, 15) (1, 18) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 13) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 12) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 0) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 3) (15, 2) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 13) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 15) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by the number of connections:
```
1. 1 connections: 9
2. 2 connections: 14, 4, 6, 9
3. 3 connections: 13, 19, 1
4. 4 connections: 0, 10, 11, 18
5. 5 connections: 5, 15, 7, 8
6. 6 connections: 12, 16, 2, 3
