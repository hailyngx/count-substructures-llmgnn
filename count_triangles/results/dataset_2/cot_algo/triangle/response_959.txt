Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 8) (16, 19) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 13) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 8) (27, 5) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 9) (23, 22) (23, 28) (23, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 24) (4, 8) (4, 21) (8, 16) (8, 27) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 28) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 18) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 19) (14, 0) (14, 27) (17, 26) (17, 2) (29, 7) (29, 28) (29, 5) (26, 22) (26, 17) (26, 18) (9, 22) (9, 23) (9, 7) (9, 24) (9, 3) (28, 23) (28, 8) (28, 29) (6, 11) (6, 21) (21, 4) (21, 6) (21, 3) (21, 25) (18, 0) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 26) (18, 13) (3, 9) (3, 21) (3, 19) (25, 21) (19, 16) (19, 12) (19, 3) (15, 20) (2, 17) (5, 27) (5, 12) (5, 29) (1, 10) (20, 15) (20, 24) (24, 10) (24, 9) (24, 20) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method aims to count the number of triangles efficiently by first sorting vertices based on their degree.

After sorting the vertices based on their number of connections in increasing order, we get the following ordering:
Node 2 < Node 15 < Node 1 < Node 16 < Node 20 < Node 4 < Node 5 < Node 6 < Node 17 < Node 25 < Node 14 < Node 3 < Node 12 < Node 21 < Node 22 < Node 10 < Node 28 < Node 13 < Node 19 < Node 26 < Node 29 < Node 24 < Node 8 < Node 11 < Node 0 < Node 27 < Node 7 < Node 9 < Node 18 < Node 23.

Through analysis, the total number of triangles in the graph is [18] and the unique triangles are:
<0, 18, 27>
<0, 18, 13>
<0, 18, 14>
<0, 18, 26>
<0, 13, 11>
<0, 13, 18>
<0, 13, 27>
<0, 13, 18>
<0, 14, 27>
<0, 18, 27>
<7, 9, 22>
<7, 9, 23>
<7, 9, 24>
<7, 28, 29>
<9, 22, 23>
<9, 22, 26>
<9, 23, 28>
<18, 26, 27>
