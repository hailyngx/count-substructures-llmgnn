Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 10) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 6) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 5) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 12) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 0), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 9), (8, 13), (8, 4), (8, 11), (8, 0), (13, 8), (13, 12), (13, 2), (10, 12), (10, 4), (10, 9), (10, 5), (11, 8), (11, 0), (11, 12), (4, 8), (4, 10), (0, 1), (0, 8), (0, 11), (0, 14), (0, 7), (14, 0), (14, 6), (14, 7), (14, 2), (14, 5), (7, 3), (7, 0), (7, 14), (7, 6), (7, 5), (9, 3), (9, 10), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 14), (6, 7), (6, 2), (2, 1), (2, 13), (2, 14), (2, 6), (2, 5), (5, 10), (5, 14), (5, 7), (5, 2), (5, 12), (12, 13), (12, 10), (12, 11), (12, 5)

Now, the vertices are sorted based on their degrees:
Nodes in decreasing degree: 2, 12, 5, 14, 0, 6, 7, 1, 8, 3, 9, 10, 4, 11, 13

Checking for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Triangles: [24]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 13>, <0, 2, 14>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 1>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 14>, <0, 7, 6>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 8, 11>, <0, 8, 13>, <0, 8, 4>, <0, 8, 1>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 2>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 14>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 12>, <3, 9, 10>, <5, 10, 12>
