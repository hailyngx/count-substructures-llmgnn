Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 4) (16, 18) (16, 19) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 8) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (19, 16) (19, 2) (15, 8) (15, 14) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 0) (12, 2) (3, 0) (17, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 15) (8, 14) (8, 18) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 8) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 8) (13, 9) (13, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 17) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(11, 10), (11, 7), (11, 4)
(16, 18), (16, 19)
(6, 9), (6, 1)
(9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 13)
(10, 18), (10, 4)
(0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 12), (0, 8)
(7, 8)
(5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 4)
(19, 2)
(15, 14), (15, 8)
(1, 14)
(2, 12)
(3, 0)
(17, 4)
(8, 18)

Next, we need to sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order for Degree-Based Ordering:

Nodes by Degree:
Node 3: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 17: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 12: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 2
Node 14: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 15: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 16: Degree 2
Node 18: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 6
Node 19: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 6
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 10: Degree 3
Node 11: Degree 3

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles formed by the edges. 

After counting, the total number of triangles is [34].
