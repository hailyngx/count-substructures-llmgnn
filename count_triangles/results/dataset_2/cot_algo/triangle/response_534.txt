Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph mentioned are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Given the edges:
(4, 7), (4, 1), (4, 6), (7, 4), (7, 12), (7, 9), (7, 5), (7, 13), (6, 4), (6, 9), (6, 2), (6, 11), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 10), (9, 3), (9, 13), (10, 9), (10, 11), (10, 8), (10, 12), (10, 5), (11, 6), (11, 10), (11, 0), (11, 8), (11, 2), (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 13), (8, 5), (8, 3), (13, 7), (13, 9), (13, 8), (13, 14), (12, 7), (12, 10), (12, 0), (0, 11), (0, 12), (0, 5), (0, 1), (0, 2), (14, 13), (14, 2), (3, 9), (3, 8), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 6), (2, 11), (2, 0), (2, 14), (2, 5), (5, 7), (5, 10), (5, 8), (5, 0), (5, 2).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method: 
Vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most:
(3) (4, 1) (14) (8, 12, 13) (2, 6) (10, 5, 11) (0, 9, 7).
