Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 10) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 9) (8, 11) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 9) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by degree are:
Node 7: Degree 1
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 13: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 10: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 14: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 6

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Calculating the triangles:
Triangles: [66]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 13>, <0, 5, 14>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 14>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 10>, <5, 8, 14>, <5, 13, 10>, <6, 10, 13>, <8, 9, 14>, <8, 11, 12>, <9, 10, 13>, <11, 12, 13>
