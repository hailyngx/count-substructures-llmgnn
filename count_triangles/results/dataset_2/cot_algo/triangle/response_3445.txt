Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 14) (3, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 13) (2, 0) (2, 6) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 19) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 12) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 17) (13, 0) (13, 5) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 17) (9, 18) (9, 8) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 17) (14, 1) (14, 3) (15, 12) (15, 16) (19, 0) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 12) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 19) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (16, 18) (16, 15) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 19)
(1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 8)
(2, 0) (2, 6)
(3, 14) (3, 4)
(4, 18) (4, 19)
(5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 0)
(6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 2)
(7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 19)
(8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 9)
(9, 18) (9, 8)
(10, 8) (10, 6)
(11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 7)
(12, 15) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 18)
(13, 0) (13, 5)
(14, 1) (14, 3)
(15, 16) (15, 12)
(16, 15) (16, 18)
(17, 7) (17, 8) (17, 5)
(18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 4) (18, 12)
(19, 0) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 18)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order: 
Nodes with their degrees:
0: 4, 1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 4, 5: 4, 6: 3, 7: 3, 8: 4, 9: 2, 10: 2, 11: 3, 12: 5, 13: 2, 14: 2, 15: 2, 16: 2, 17: 3, 18: 4, 19: 6

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles found in the graph are:

Total number of triangles: [18]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 19>, <0, 5, 13>, <0, 5, 19>, <0, 12, 19>, <1, 8, 11>, <1, 11, 12>, <4, 5, 12>, <4, 12, 18>, <5, 7, 17>, <5, 12, 19>, <6, 10, 19>, <8, 9, 17>, <8, 10, 17>, <8, 10, 6>, <8, 17, 19>, <12, 18, 19>, <13, 5, 19>, <16, 18, 19>
