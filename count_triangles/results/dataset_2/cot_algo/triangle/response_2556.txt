Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 8) (15, 0) (15, 12) (1, 3) (1, 4) (10, 17) (11, 7) (11, 19) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 12) (5, 19) (5, 0) (6, 17) (6, 14) (18, 12) (18, 13) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 16) (13, 18) (13, 12) (13, 2) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 9) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 16) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 2) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 0) (16, 19) (16, 14) (16, 9) (2, 17) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 16) 

Response:
The vertices with their corresponding degrees (number of connections) are as follows:
- Vertex 0: degree 4
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 5
- Vertex 3: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 3
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 4
- Vertex 8: degree 4
- Vertex 9: degree 2
- Vertex 10: degree 2
- Vertex 11: degree 2
- Vertex 12: degree 5
- Vertex 13: degree 3
- Vertex 14: degree 4
- Vertex 15: degree 2
- Vertex 16: degree 3
- Vertex 17: degree 4
- Vertex 18: degree 3
- Vertex 19: degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's relabel the vertices in ascending order of degree:  
- Vertex 1 -> new label 0
- Vertex 10 -> new label 1
- Vertex 3 -> new label 2
- Vertex 5 -> new label 3
- Vertex 6 -> new label 4
- Vertex 11 -> new label 5
- Vertex 9 -> new label 6
- Vertex 4 -> new label 7
- Vertex 13 -> new label 8
- Vertex 18 -> new label 9
- Vertex 7 -> new label 10
- Vertex 16 -> new label 11
- Vertex 8 -> new label 12
- Vertex 2 -> new label 13
- Vertex 14 -> new label 14
- Vertex 0 -> new label 15
- Vertex 12 -> new label 16
- Vertex 17 -> new label 17
- Vertex 19 -> new label 18

Now, let's check for triangles using the relabeled vertices:
- Triangle <7, 12, 19>
- Triangle <0, 2, 15>
- Triangle <7, 10, 17>
- Triangle <7, 14, 17>
- Triangle <2, 13, 14>
- Triangle <0, 5, 15>
- Triangle <2, 13, 18>
- Triangle <4, 7, 8>
- Triangle <13, 16, 18>
- Triangle <16, 9, 14>
- Triangle <6, 10, 17>
- Triangle <9, 14, 16>
- Triangle <10, 14, 17>
- Triangle <11, 14, 19>
- Triangle <2, 0, 15>
- Triangle <12, 13, 18>
- Triangle <2, 7, 17>
- Triangle <12, 15, 18>
- Triangle <8, 4, 19>
- Triangle <7, 14, 6>
- Triangle <9, 7, 16>
- Triangle <16, 14, 7>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [22].
