Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, the Degree-Based Ordering method proceeds as follows:

Vertices:
0: 4 connections
1: 2 connections
2: 5 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 5 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 5 connections
8: 3 connections
9: 5 connections
