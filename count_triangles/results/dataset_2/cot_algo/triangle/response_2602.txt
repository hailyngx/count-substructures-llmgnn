Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph and count the number of triangles.

The graph with 10 nodes and the given 40 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 7), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0), (4, 0), (4, 3), (7, 8), (7, 1), (7, 6), (1, 3), (3, 4), (8, 0), (6, 0), (2, 0)

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices in decreasing order of degree: 9, 0, 1, 5, 3, 7, 6, 8, 2, 4

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. (5, 1): Shared connections for (5, 1) are 9. So, we have one triangle <5, 1, 9>.
2. (5, 7): Shared connections for (5, 7) are 1. So, we have one triangle <5, 7, 1>.
3. (5, 9): Shared connections for (5, 9) are 1. So, we have one triangle <5, 9, 1>.
4. (5, 6): Shared connections for (5, 6) are 1. So, we have one triangle <5, 6, 1>.
5. (9, 8): No triangle since vertex 9 has more connections.
6. (9, 2): No triangle since vertex 9 has more connections.
7. (9, 3): No triangle since vertex 9 has more connections.
8. (9, 1): Shared connections for (9, 1) are 5, 7. So, we have two triangles <9, 1, 5> and <9, 1, 7>.
9. (9, 0): Shared connections for (9, 0) are 1. So, we have one triangle <9, 0, 1>.
10. (4, 0): No triangle since vertex 4 has more connections.
11. (4, 3): No triangle since vertex 4 has more connections.
12. (7, 8): No triangle since vertex 7 has more connections.
13. (7, 1): Shared connections for (7, 1) are 5. So, we have one triangle <7, 1, 5>.
14. (7, 6): No triangle since vertex 7 has more connections.
15. (1, 3): Shared connections for (1, 3) are 5. So, we have one triangle <1, 3, 5>.
16. (3, 4): No triangle since vertex 3 has more connections.
17. (8, 0): No triangle since vertex 8 has more connections.
18. (6, 0): Shared connections for (6, 0) are 5. So, we have one triangle <6, 0, 5>.
19. (2, 0): No triangle since vertex 2 has more connections.

Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles found: <5, 1, 9>, <5, 7, 1>, <5, 6, 1>, <9, 1, 5>, <9, 1, 7>, <9, 0, 1>, <1, 3, 5>
