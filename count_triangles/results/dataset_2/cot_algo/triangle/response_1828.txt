Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 2, 9, 7, 6, 5, 0, 8, 4, 3, 1.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following triangles: 
<0, 1, 5> 
<1, 3, 8> 

[Total number of triangles: 2]
