After sorting the vertices by their degree from least connected to most connected, we have the following labels:
Nodes: 30
Labels: 
0 - 3 connections
3 - 1 connection
5 - 2 connections
10 - 3 connections
28 - 1 connection
27 - 3 connections
8 - 3 connections
19 - 2 connections
20 - 3 connections
21 - 4 connections
23 - 2 connections
25 - 3 connections
26 - 2 connections
2 - 3 connections
6 - 3 connections
9 - 3 connections
1 - 4 connections
18 - 3 connections
4 - 5 connections
12 - 4 connections
7 - 3 connections
11 - 3 connections
15 - 3 connections
16 - 4 connections
22 - 5 connections
14 - 3 connections
17 - 5 connections
24 - 4 connections
29 - 4 connections

Based on this ordering, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.

The total number of triangles is [38].
