Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- 0: {1, 3, 7}
- 1: {0, 3, 4, 5}
- 2: {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- 3: {0, 1, 4, 8}
- 4: {1, 3, 9}
- 5: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- 6: {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- 7: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- 8: {2, 3, 6, 9}
- 9: {2, 4, 6, 8}

Degree-Based Ordering:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5
