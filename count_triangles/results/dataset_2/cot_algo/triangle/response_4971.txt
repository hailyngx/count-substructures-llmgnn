Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) 

Response:
Let's label the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 5: 6 connections

Now, let's count the triangles:
- For the edge (5, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- For the edge (5, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- For the edge (5, 8): No triangles can be formed.
- For the edge (5, 4): Possible triangle: <4, 5, 8>.
- For the edge (5, 3): Possible triangle: <3, 5, 8>.
- For the edge (5, 7): No triangles can be formed.
- For the edge (9, 3): No triangles can be formed.
- For the edge (9, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- For the edge (1, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- For the edge (1, 4): No triangles can be formed.
- For the edge (3, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- For the edge (3, 8): No triangles can be formed.
- For the edge (3, 4): Possible triangle: <3, 4, 5>.
- For the edge (4, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- For the edge (4, 8): Possible triangle: <4, 5, 8>.
- For the edge (4, 0): No triangles can be formed.
- For the edge (4, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- For the edge (8, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- For the edge (8, 7): Possible triangle: <7, 8, 6>.
- For the edge (8, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- For the edge (6, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- For the edge (6, 7): No triangles can be formed.
- For the edge (0, 4): No triangles can be formed.
- For the edge (0, 7): No triangles can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <4, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, <7, 8, 6>.
