Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 1) (20, 22) (15, 7) (15, 18) (3, 11) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 6) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (21, 3) (21, 22) (21, 29) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 1) (17, 12) (17, 2) (18, 15) (18, 23) (18, 29) (19, 25) (19, 7) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 8) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (14, 27) (14, 28) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 22) (2, 17) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 25) (5, 0) (5, 10) (23, 18) (23, 12) (23, 9) (16, 13) (16, 9) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 24) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 23) (9, 16) (9, 27) (26, 27) (26, 12) (29, 21) (29, 18) (29, 10) (24, 7) (24, 12) (12, 17) (12, 23) (12, 26) (12, 24) (27, 14) (27, 9) (27, 26) (27, 8) (27, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 25) (8, 1) (8, 27) (8, 22) (25, 19) (25, 2) (25, 4) (25, 22) (22, 20) (22, 21) (22, 28) (22, 8) (22, 25) (10, 5) (10, 29) (10, 27) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices based on the number of connections they have. The vertex with the lowest degree is labeled as 0, the next lowest as 1, and so on.

The sorted vertices are as follows:
Nodes: 0 5 10 13 17 19 20 24 26 16 18 23 7 15 1 2 6 21 28 29 3 4 14 25 8 9 11 12 27 22

Now, we will count the number of triangles by examining the given edges and shared connections between vertices. 

The output total number of triangles is: [21]

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 8, 22>
<3, 4, 11>
<3, 6, 25>
<3, 9, 27>
<4, 13, 25>
<5, 10, 29>
<6, 9, 27>
<6, 9, 23>
<7, 19, 24>
<8, 1, 27>
<9, 11, 27>
<9, 12, 27>
<9, 16, 27>
<11, 9, 27>
<12, 17, 23>
<12, 24, 27>
<12, 26, 27>
<17, 12, 23>
<22, 8, 25>
<22, 25, 28>
<22, 25, 2>
