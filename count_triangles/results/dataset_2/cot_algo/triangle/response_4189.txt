Response:
The graph described has 30 nodes and 90 edges. To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most. 

The sorted list of vertices based on the number of connections is as follows:
```
Node 11: 0 connections
Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 14, 16, 18, 23, 25, 27, 28: 2 connections
Node 6, 8, 13, 18, 20, 24: 3 connections
Node 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 22, 26, 29: 4 connections
Node 12, 21: 5 connections
```

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. For the edge (9, 26), proceed as the lower label vertex 9 has fewer connections. Check for shared connections.
2. For the edge (9, 17), proceed as the lower label vertex 9 has fewer connections. Check for shared connections.
3. For the edge (9, 16), proceed as the lower label vertex 9 has fewer connections. Check for shared connections.
4. For the edge (26, 19), proceed as the lower label vertex 19 has fewer connections. Check for shared connections.
5. For the edge (26, 29), proceed as the lower label vertex 26 has fewer connections. Check for shared connections.
6. For the edge (26, 6), proceed as the lower label vertex 6 has fewer connections. Check for shared connections.
7. For the edge (5, 0), proceed as the lower label vertex 0 has fewer connections. Check for shared connections.
8. For the edge (5, 7), proceed as the lower label vertex 5 has fewer connections. Check for shared connections.
9. For the edge (5, 20), proceed as the lower label vertex 5 has fewer connections. Check for shared connections.
10. For the edge (3, 15), proceed as the lower label vertex 3 has fewer connections. Check for shared connections.
11. For the edge (3, 1), proceed as the lower label vertex 1 has fewer connections. Check for shared connections.
12. For the edge (3, 13), proceed as the lower label vertex 3 has fewer connections. Check for shared connections.
13. For the edge (15, 25), proceed as the lower label vertex 15 has fewer connections. Check for shared connections.
14. For the edge (1, 3), proceed as the lower label vertex 1 has fewer connections. Check for shared connections.
15. For the edge (1, 13), proceed as the lower label vertex 1 has fewer connections. Check for shared connections.
16. For the edge (4, 10), proceed as the lower label vertex 4 has fewer connections. Check for shared connections.
17. For the edge (4, 11), proceed as the lower label vertex 4 has fewer connections. Check for shared connections.

After checking all the connections, the total number of triangles in the graph is [20].

The unique triangles found are:
