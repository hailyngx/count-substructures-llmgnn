Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

The connections for each node are:
0: 8, 5, 1, 3, 2
1: 4, 2, 0
2: 6, 9, 1, 3, 0
3: 6, 4, 0, 2
4: 9, 7, 8, 1, 3
5: 6, 7, 8, 0
6: 9, 5, 3, 2
7: 4, 8, 5
8: 4, 7, 5, 0
9: 6, 4, 2

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
1 -> 7 -> 9 -> 0 -> 8 -> 5 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles:
- For edge (1, 2) we find shared connection 4, forming triangle <1, 2, 4>.
- For edge (7, 8) we find shared connection 5, forming triangle <7, 8, 5>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
