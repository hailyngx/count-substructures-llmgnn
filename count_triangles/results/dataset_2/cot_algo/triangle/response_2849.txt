Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 10) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 9) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 11) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 9) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 15 nodes and the given 60 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(4, 0), (4, 5), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 5), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 14), (1, 12),
(3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 10), (3, 2), (3, 12), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 13), (5, 10), 
(6, 7), (6, 10), (6, 2), (6, 11), (6, 13), (12, 1), (12, 3), (12, 10), 
(0, 4), (0, 14), (0, 11), (0, 13), (0, 9), (14, 1), (14, 0), (14, 11), (14, 8),
(2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 11), (8, 7), (8, 14), (13, 5), (13, 6), (13, 0), 
(13, 10), (13, 9), (9, 0), (9, 13), (9, 11), (10, 3), (10, 5), (10, 6), (10, 12),
(10, 13), (11, 6), (11, 0), (11, 14), (11, 2), (11, 9)

Now, we will order the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices by degrees: (vertex: degree)
0: 5
1: 4
2: 4
4: 2
5: 4
6: 5
7: 4
8: 2
9: 3
10: 5
11: 5
12: 3
13: 4
14: 4
3: 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 10]
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 13, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 10, 3>, <4, 0, 13>, <5, 7, 13>, <6, 11, 0>, <6, 10, 3>, <10, 6, 13>
