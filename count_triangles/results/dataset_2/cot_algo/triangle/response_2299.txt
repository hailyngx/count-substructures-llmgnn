Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 11) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling the nodes accordingly.

Here is the list of nodes sorted by degree:
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 6 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 11: 5 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections

We will now count the triangles by considering each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections to avoid redundancy.

Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles found: 
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 13>
<1, 3, 2>
<3, 0, 11>
<3, 0, 12>
<3, 13, 2>
<8, 7, 14>
<8, 4, 13>
<8, 4, 10>
<11, 0, 12>
