Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 27) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 17) (16, 28) (16, 12) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (0, 21) (0, 19) (27, 11) (27, 19) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 10) (23, 8) (23, 18) (23, 13) (20, 17) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 24) (1, 20) (26, 25) (26, 4) (2, 11) (2, 4) (28, 16) (28, 29) (29, 3) (29, 28) (29, 5) (29, 14) (22, 9) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 14) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 20) (17, 18) (19, 0) (19, 27) (19, 18) (10, 8) (10, 21) (10, 7) (21, 0) (21, 10) (21, 5) (7, 20) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 25) (7, 14) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 18) (18, 23) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 25) (12, 11) (12, 16) (13, 15) (13, 23) (13, 24) (5, 15) (5, 29) (5, 21) (24, 8) (24, 20) (24, 13) (24, 14) (14, 29) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 24) (4, 15) (4, 26) (4, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order.  

Here are the nodes sorted from least connected to most connected:
Node 16 - degree: 2
Node 0 - degree: 2
Node 1 - degree: 2
Node 5 - degree: 3
Node 6 - degree: 3
Node 22 - degree: 3
Node 25 - degree: 3
Node 27 - degree: 3
Node 28 - degree: 3
Node 2 - degree: 4
Node 4 - degree: 4
Node 8 - degree: 4
Node 10 - degree: 4
Node 12 - degree: 4
Node 20 - degree: 4
Node 21 - degree: 4
Node 24 - degree: 4
Node 11 - degree: 4
Node 14 - degree: 5
Node 15 - degree: 5
Node 18 - degree: 5
Node 19 - degree: 5
Node 23 - degree: 5
Node 26 - degree: 5
Node 3 - degree: 6
Node 7 - degree: 6
Node 9 - degree: 6
Node 29 - degree: 6
Node 17 - degree: 6

Using the given edges and the order of the nodes above, we can count the number of triangles in the graph. 

The total number of triangles is: [28]

The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 5, 21>
<0, 5, 29>
<1, 20, 24>
<9, 18, 25>
<13, 15, 23>
<14, 29, 7>
<16, 12, 28>
<17, 11, 20>
<20, 24, 13>
<23, 8, 18>
<25, 7, 14>
<4, 2, 26>
<5, 15, 4>
<7, 9, 18>
<7, 9, 22>
<7, 10, 25>
<7, 14, 29>
<7, 20, 24>
<11, 17, 20>
<11, 17, 3>
