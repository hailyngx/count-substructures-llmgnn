Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 7), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0), (4, 7), (4, 3), (7, 2), (5, 8), (2, 0), (8, 3)

Next, we will sort the vertices by their degree (number of connections):

Vertices in order of degree: 
0 (deg: 4), 8 (deg: 4), 4 (deg: 4), 3 (deg: 4), 5 (deg: 3), 7 (deg: 3), 1 (deg: 4), 9 (deg: 5), 2 (deg: 4), 6 (deg: 4)

Now, we will go through each edge starting from the one with the lower degree vertex to count the triangles:

Triangles: [9]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 8>
