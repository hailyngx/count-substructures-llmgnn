Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 29) (1, 24) (1, 12) (21, 23) (21, 14) (6, 9) (6, 26) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 24) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 20) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 7) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 14) (25, 3) (25, 14) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 29) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 17) (2, 22) (18, 5) (18, 28) (19, 29) (19, 7) (19, 14) (26, 6) (26, 23) (26, 16) (11, 28) (11, 22) (11, 17) (11, 15) (28, 18) (28, 11) (10, 12) (10, 15) (10, 29) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 22) (15, 5) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 11) (22, 15) (23, 21) (23, 26) (23, 5) (23, 16) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 19) (29, 1) (29, 12) (29, 19) (29, 10) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 23) (5, 17) (14, 21) (14, 3) (14, 25) (14, 19) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 26) (16, 23) (16, 17) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 16) (20, 8) (20, 24) (24, 1) (24, 9) (24, 13) (24, 20) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph. We will now sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices in descending order of degree:
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 29: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 3
Node 21: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 13: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 25: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 22: Degree 4
Node 18: Degree 2
Node 19: Degree 4
Node 26: Degree 3
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 28: Degree 3
Node 10: Degree 3
Node 15: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 14: Degree 4
Node 16: Degree 5
Node 17: Degree 4
Node 20: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 3

Now, we will count the number of triangles by considering each edge and checking for shared connections:

[Number of triangles: 19]
<1, 12, 29>
<6, 9, 26>
<6, 16, 26>
<8, 13, 24>
<3, 7, 14>
<3, 14, 25>
<4, 8, 22>
<11, 15, 22>
<11, 17, 22>
<15, 17, 22>
<11, 15, 28>
<5, 15, 23>
<5, 17, 23>
<5, 18, 28>
<5, 15, 18>
<14, 19, 25>
<16, 23, 26>
<16, 17, 26>
<16, 17, 23>
