Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 7, 8

Now let's label the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):

Nodes by degree:
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 5

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles: 

Triangles: [<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 9>]

Total number of triangles: [7]
