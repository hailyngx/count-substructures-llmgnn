Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
Nodes sorted by their degree:  
Node 1: Degree 2  
Node 5: Degree 3  
Node 7: Degree 2  
Node 2: Degree 2  
Node 0: Degree 4  
Node 6: Degree 4  
Node 8: Degree 5  
Node 3: Degree 6  
Node 4: Degree 6  
Node 9: Degree 6  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:  
Considering lower-degree vertices first, we begin counting triangles.
