Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 2) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 10) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 10) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 8) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 

Node 4: 3 edges
Node 9: 4 edges
Node 3: 4 edges
Node 7: 4 edges
Node 8: 4 edges
Node 5: 4 edges
Node 12: 4 edges
Node 13: 4 edges
Node 6: 4 edges
Node 1: 5 edges
Node 10: 5 edges
Node 0: 6 edges
Node 11: 6 edges
Node 2: 6 edges
Node 14: 6 edges

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method on the given graph, we find the total number of triangles is [8].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 14>
<4, 8, 1>
<4, 10, 2>
<7, 11, 6>
<7, 11, 3>
<2, 6, 11>
<2, 10, 4>
