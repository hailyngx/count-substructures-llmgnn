Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (3, 5) (3, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

Vertex 3: Degree 2  
Vertex 7: Degree 2  
Vertex 13: Degree 3  
Vertex 2: Degree 3  
Vertex 8: Degree 3  
Vertex 0: Degree 3  
Vertex 12: Degree 3  
Vertex 11: Degree 4  
Vertex 4: Degree 4  
Vertex 5: Degree 5  
Vertex 9: Degree 5  
Vertex 10: Degree 5  
Vertex 6: Degree 6  
Vertex 1: Degree 6  
Vertex 14: Degree 7  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles is [9].

The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 8, 0>
<1, 8, 6>
<1, 0, 5>
<1, 0, 8>
<1, 6, 5>
<8, 6, 5>
<11, 2, 14>
<4, 6, 9>
