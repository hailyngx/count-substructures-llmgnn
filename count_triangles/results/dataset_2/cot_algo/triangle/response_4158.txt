Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 1) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 3) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 3) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling the vertices accordingly. Based on the provided edges, the sorted vertices are as follows: 

Node 11 - Degree: 2
Node 14 - Degree: 2
Node 9 - Degree: 3
Node 1 - Degree: 4
Node 6 - Degree: 4
Node 2 - Degree: 4
Node 7 - Degree: 4
Node 13 - Degree: 4
Node 0 - Degree: 4
Node 8 - Degree: 4
Node 12 - Degree: 5
Node 3 - Degree: 5
Node 4 - Degree: 6
Node 10 - Degree: 6
Node 5 - Degree: 6

Now, we will proceed to count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

After examining the edges and considering the relabeled vertices, we found the following triangles: 

1. <0, 10, 12>
2. <0, 1, 12>
3. <0, 1, 10>
4. <0, 1, 14>
5. <0, 1, 13>
6. <0, 5, 10>
7. <0, 5, 12>
8. <0, 5, 3>
9. <1, 10, 12>
10. <1, 10, 13>
11. <1, 12, 13>
12. <3, 4, 10>
13. <3, 4, 11>
14. <3, 5, 10>
15. <3, 5, 11>
16. <4, 6, 13>
17. <7, 4, 14>
18. <8, 4, 13>
19. <8, 4, 14>
20. <8, 9, 4>
21. <8, 9, 11>
22. <10, 12, 5>
23. <10, 12, 7>
24. <10, 12, 1>
25. <11, 9, 6>
26. <11, 9, 3>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is counted and presented below:
