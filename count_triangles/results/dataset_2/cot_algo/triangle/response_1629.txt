Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (7, 12) (7, 6) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 15) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 18) (10, 12) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 4) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 19) (17, 12) (17, 13) (0, 10) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 6) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 18) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 16) (11, 12) (11, 0) (3, 19) (3, 14) (14, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 10) (4, 0) (18, 13) (18, 16) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method starts by relabeling the nodes based on their degree. Here is the sorted list of nodes with their degrees:
1. Node 3 (Degree 2)
2. Node 7 (Degree 2)
3. Node 8 (Degree 2)
4. Node 11 (Degree 2)
5. Node 14 (Degree 2)
6. Node 5 (Degree 3)
7. Node 6 (Degree 3)
8. Node 9 (Degree 4)
9. Node 17 (Degree 4)
10. Node 19 (Degree 4)
11. Node 1 (Degree 5)
12. Node 4 (Degree 5)
13. Node 13 (Degree 5)
14. Node 16 (Degree 5)
15. Node 0 (Degree 6)
16. Node 12 (Degree 6)
17. Node 10 (Degree 7)
18. Node 2 (Degree 8)
19. Node 15 (Degree 8)
20. Node 18 (Degree 2)

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph.

Number of triangles: [39]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 10>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 16>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 12>
<1, 8, 2>
<1, 9, 13>
<2, 15, 19>
<2, 16, 0>
<2, 16, 18>
<3, 14, 19>
<4, 10, 12>
<5, 13, 9>
<6, 7, 12>
<10, 12, 17>
<13, 15, 19>
<13, 17, 12>
<15, 19, 2>
<16, 18, 13>
<1, 9, 8>
<5, 13, 17>

<0, 16, 2>
<0, 16, 1>
<0, 16, 18>
<0, 16, 2>
<0, 16, 1>
<12, 17, 13>
