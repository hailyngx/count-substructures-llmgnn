Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 12) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 8 has 0 connections
Nodes 6, 8, and 5 have 1 connection each
Nodes 13, 3, and 11 have 2 connections each
Nodes 12, 6, and 4 have 3 connections each
Nodes 0, 1, and 9 have 4 connections each
Nodes 7 and 2 have 5 connections each
Node 10 has 6 connections

Now, let's check for triangles using the sorted nodes and the given edges:

- <1, 9, 4> (shared connection: 9)
- <0, 1, 9> (shared connection: 1)
- <12, 0, 13> (shared connection: 0)
- <2, 6, 3> (shared connection: 6)
- <0, 7, 12> (shared connection: 12)
- <2, 6, 10> (shared connection: 6)
- <3, 11, 14> (shared connection: 11)

Thus, the total number of triangles in this graph is [7].
