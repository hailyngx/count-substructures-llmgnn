Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 0) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 3) (10, 13) (10, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 14) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) 
(9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) 
(8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) 
(13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 7) 
(4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) 
(2, 12) 
(1, 11) (1, 14) 
(6, 12) (6, 0) 
(12, 11) 
(14, 3) (14, 7) 

Let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes sorted by degree:
0 (degree 4) <11> 
1 (degree 3) <14> 
4 (degree 3) 
6 (degree 3) 
7 (degree 3) 
2 (degree 2) <12> 
8 (degree 2) 
10 (degree 2) 
3 (degree 2) 
13 (degree 2) 
5 (degree 1) 
9 (degree 1) 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles formed by shared connections between vertices with lower labels and fewer connections.

Let's identify the triangles:

Triangles: 
<8, 13, 14> 
<0, 3, 11> 
<0, 6, 12> 
<0, 4, 6>

Based on the calculations, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
