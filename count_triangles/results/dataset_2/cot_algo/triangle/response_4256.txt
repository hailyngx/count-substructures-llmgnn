Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 7) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 13) (1, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 14) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 0) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 7)

Now, let's find the total number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The vertices in the order of their degree are:
1. 1 (Degree: 1)
2. 13 (Degree: 2)
3. 0 (Degree: 4)
4. 8 (Degree: 3)
5. 10 (Degree: 4)
6. 14 (Degree: 4)
7. 5 (Degree: 4)
8. 7 (Degree: 4)
9. 4 (Degree: 4)
10. 6 (Degree: 4)
11. 2 (Degree: 5)
12. 3 (Degree: 5)
13. 12 (Degree: 5)
14. 11 (Degree: 5)
15. 9 (Degree: 5)

Now, we will count the triangles by looking at each edge. 

The total number of triangles in this graph is: [15]

The unique triangles are:
<0, 12, 13>
<0, 2, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 10, 7>
<2, 10, 9>
<3, 11, 7>
<4, 8, 10>
<4, 12, 14>
<5, 6, 11>
<6, 9, 11>
<7, 11, 14>
<10, 7, 14>
