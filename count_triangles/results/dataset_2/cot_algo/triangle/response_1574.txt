Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 6) (3, 25) (3, 4) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 29) (25, 10) (10, 25) (10, 11) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 14) (11, 5) (8, 23) (8, 28) (8, 17) (23, 11) (23, 8) (4, 3) (4, 12) (6, 13) (6, 22) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 12) (28, 8) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 1) (18, 19) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 29) (12, 19) (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 5) (1, 0) (14, 11) (14, 26) (14, 7) (14, 16) (26, 14) (26, 21) (24, 27) (7, 14) (7, 27) (19, 18) (19, 12) (19, 2) (19, 0) (29, 25) (29, 12) (0, 28) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 17) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 15) (21, 26) (21, 15) (21, 17) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 1) (27, 24) (27, 7) (27, 20) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 15) (17, 8) (17, 0) (17, 21) (9, 10) (20, 27) (15, 2) (15, 21) (15, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections and relabeling them accordingly. The sorted list of nodes with their degrees is as follows:

(13 - 4), (22 - 2), (3 - 3), (25 - 3), (10 - 4), (11 - 4), (8 - 3), (23 - 2), (4 - 2), (6 - 5), (28 - 4), (12 - 5), (1 - 4), (14 - 4), (26 - 2), (24 - 1), (7 - 3), (19 - 4), (29 - 2), (0 - 4), (2 - 5), (21 - 3), (5 - 3), (27 - 3), (16 - 4), (17 - 3), (9 - 1), (20 - 1), (15 - 3), (18 - 1)

Based on this ordering, we proceed with counting the triangles:

1. (8, 28) - Shared connection with 1 node: (8, 1, 28)
2. (8, 23) - Shared connection with 1 node: (8, 11, 23)
3. (8, 17) - Shared connection with 1 node: (8, 0, 17)
4. (28, 6) - Shared connection with 2 nodes: (28, 1, 6)
5. (28, 0) - Shared connection with 2 nodes: (28, 1, 0)
6. (12, 4) - Shared connection with 1 node: (12, 3, 4)
7 .(12, 6) - Shared connection with 2 nodes: (12, 1, 6)
8. (12, 5) - Shared connection with 1 node: (12, 1, 5)
9. (12, 29) - Shared connection with 1 node: (12, 25, 29)
10. (1, 6) - Shared connection with 3 nodes: (1, 28, 6)
11. (1, 5) - Shared connection with 2 nodes: (1, 12, 5)
12. (1, 0) - Shared connection with 2 nodes: (1, 28, 0)
13. (14, 11) - Shared connection with 4 nodes: (14, 8, 11)
14. (14, 7) - Shared connection with 2 nodes: (14, 27, 7)
15. (19, 0) - Shared connection with 2 nodes: (19, 1, 0)
16. (19, 2) - Shared connection with 2 nodes: (19, 3, 2)
17. (19, 12) - Shared connection with 4 nodes: (19, 1, 12)
18. (29, 25) - Shared connection with 1 node: (29, 10, 25)
19. (2, 16) - Shared connection with 3 nodes: (2, 13, 16)
20. (2, 15) - Shared connection with 2 nodes: (2, 21, 15)
21. (2, 3) - Shared connection with 3 nodes: (2, 25, 3)
22. (2, 19) - Shared connection with 3 nodes: (2, 12, 19)
23. (16, 15) - Shared connection with 1 node: (16, 21, 15)

After counting, we find that there are a total of 23 triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [23]. The unique triangles found are:
<8, 1, 28>, <8, 11, 23>, <8, 0, 17>, <28, 1, 6>, <28, 1, 0>, <12, 3, 4>, <12, 1, 6>, <12, 1, 5>, <12, 25, 29>, <1, 28, 6>, <1, 12, 5>, <1, 28, 0>, <14, 8, 11>, <14, 27, 7>, <19, 1, 0>, <19, 3, 2>, <19, 1, 12>, <29, 10, 25>, <2, 13, 16>, <2, 21, 15>, <2, 25, 3>, <2, 12, 19>, <16, 21, 15>.
