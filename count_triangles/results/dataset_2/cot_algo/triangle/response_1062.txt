Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

(0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 10), (0, 20), (0, 23),
(1, 9), (1, 24),
(2, 14), (2, 19),
(3, 0), (3, 15), (3, 20), (3, 27),

(29, 11), (29, 18), (29, 27), (29, 28)

Now, let's list the number of connections for each node:
0: 5 connections
1: 2 connections
2: 2 connections
3: 5 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 2 connections
8: 3 connections
9: 2 connections
10: 2 connections
11: 1 connection
12: 2 connections
13: 5 connections
14: 2 connections
15: 4 connections
16: 2 connections
17: 3 connections
18: 2 connections
19: 4 connections
20: 4 connections
21: 4 connections
22: 2 connections
23: 4 connections
24: 1 connection
25: 4 connections
26: 3 connections
27: 4 connections
28: 4 connections
29: 4 connections

After sorting by the number of connections, the sorted nodes are:
11, 24, 2, 1, 10, 18, 22, 7, 16, 0, 4, 6, 9, 14, 19, 12, 8, 20, 26, 5, 3, 15, 17, 23, 25, 27, 21, 28, 29

Now, we will count the triangles:

[Total triangles: 11]

<2, 4, 17>, <2, 14, 17>, <2, 19, 7>, <2, 19, 13>, <2, 19, 16>, <2, 19, 2>, <2, 7, 19>, <4, 17, 25>, <4, 8, 21>, <17, 14, 25>, <17, 25, 5>
