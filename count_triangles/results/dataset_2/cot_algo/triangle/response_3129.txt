Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 14) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 21) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 9) (21, 23) (21, 10) (21, 13) (21, 20) (28, 1) (7, 22) (25, 27) (25, 0) (25, 12) (25, 11) (16, 17) (16, 27) (13, 21) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 27) (19, 9) (27, 25) (27, 16) (27, 5) (27, 10) (9, 18) (9, 19) (9, 29) (9, 24) (29, 9) (29, 1) (29, 26) (10, 8) (10, 21) (10, 13) (10, 27) (22, 7) (22, 24) (12, 25) (1, 28) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 29) (1, 4) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 26) (6, 0) (14, 15) (14, 23) (14, 2) (20, 21) (20, 24) (26, 29) (26, 6) (0, 8) (0, 25) (0, 6) (0, 24) (24, 9) (24, 22) (24, 20) (24, 0) (11, 25) (11, 5) (11, 4) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Nodes sorted by degree:

Node 28: 1 edge
Node 7: 1 edge
Node 19: 1 edge
Node 22: 2 edges
Node 16: 2 edges
Node 2: 3 edges
Node 7: 3 edges
Node 3: 3 edges
Node 20: 3 edges
Node 18: 4 edges
Node 29: 4 edges
Node 12: 4 edges
Node 26: 4 edges
Node 14: 4 edges
Node 6: 4 edges
Node 0: 4 edges
Node 5: 4 edges
Node 21: 4 edges
Node 1: 5 edges
Node 15: 5 edges
Node 17: 5 edges
Node 10: 5 edges
Node 24: 6 edges
Node 8: 8 edges
Node 25: 6 edges
Node 13: 6 edges
Node 11: 3 edges
Node 4: 3 edges
Node 23: 3 edges
Node 9: 4 edges

The triangles found are:
