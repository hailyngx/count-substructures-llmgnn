Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 7), 
(9, 2), 
(6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 0), 
(1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 0), (1, 7), 
(3, 5), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 8), 
(4, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), 
(8, 5), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 7), 
(2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 0), 
(0, 6), (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 2), 
(7, 5), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 8)

Applying Degree-Based Ordering (from least to most connections):
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections (renamed to 3)
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 5: 6 connections

Counting triangles: 
Triangles: [<0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 1, 6>, <2, 1, 6>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 5>]
