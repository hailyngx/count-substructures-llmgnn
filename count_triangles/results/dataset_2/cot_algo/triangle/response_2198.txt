Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 0) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 2) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 5) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help to find the number of triangles in the given graph.

Nodes sorted by their degrees:
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 3 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

Triangles:
Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 3>
<1, 10, 9>
<1, 10, 13>
<1, 13, 8>
<4, 6, 1>
<7, 12, 3>
