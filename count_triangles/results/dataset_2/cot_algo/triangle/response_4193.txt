Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 18) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (10, 13) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 0) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 18) (19, 15) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 18) (2, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 11) (18, 13) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are:

0: 3 connections
2: 3 connections
5: 2 connections
19: 2 connections
10: 2 connections
14: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
2: 2 connections
19: 2 connections
7: 4 connections
1: 4 connections
5: 4 connections
11: 4 connections
6: 3 connections
15: 3 connections
10: 3 connections
12: 4 connections
18: 5 connections
13: 4 connections
9: 5 connections
4: 4 connections
8: 5 connections
17: 4 connections
16: 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following unique triangles:

<0, 8, 17>
<0, 16, 18>
<1, 7, 17>
<1, 11, 14>
<3, 9, 18>
<4, 7, 17>
<4, 9, 11>
<7, 8, 17>
<8, 13, 17>
<12, 16, 18>

Thus, the total number of triangles is [10].
