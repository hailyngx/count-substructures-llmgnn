Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 12) (1, 5) (1, 12) (17, 3) (17, 19) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 16) (18, 11) (18, 0) (18, 12) (19, 17) (19, 0) (7, 16) (7, 10) (16, 5) (16, 7) (16, 12) (11, 18) (11, 4) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 15) (12, 2) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 16) (12, 10) (6, 10) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 3) (3, 8) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 4) (9, 10) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 14) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 9) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order. 

Here is the sorted list of vertices with their degrees:
- Vertex 0: degree 6
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 17: degree 2
- Vertex 19: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 9: degree 2
- Vertex 18: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 11: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 3
- Vertex 10: degree 4
- Vertex 12: degree 5
- Vertex 16: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 5: degree 6
- Vertex 3: degree 6
- Vertex 8: degree 4
- Vertex 13: degree 4
- Vertex 14: degree 4
- Vertex 15: degree 4

Now, we can list the number of triangles by examining each edge based on the degree ordering. Using the given edges, we find the following triangles:

Triangles:
- <3, 5, 13>
- <2, 5, 13> 
- <5, 14, 15> 
- <3, 14, 15>
- <3, 8, 13> 

[Total number of triangles: 5]
