Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 3) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 0) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order. The labeled vertices are as follows:
- 0: degree 4
- 6: degree 1
- 5: degree 2
- 10: degree 3
- 11: degree 3
- 12: degree 3
- 14: degree 4
- 1: degree 4
- 13: degree 4
- 3: degree 4
- 7: degree 4
- 2: degree 4
- 9: degree 4
- 4: degree 5
- 8: degree 5

Now, we will check the edges based on the labeling to count the number of triangles. We ignore any edge where the vertex with the lower label has more connections.

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 1, 13>
- <0, 1, 14>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <0, 4, 13>
- <0, 5, 10>
- <1, 13, 14>
- <2, 7, 9>
- <2, 9, 13>
- <3, 7, 12>
- <3, 7, 13>
- <3, 12, 13>
- <7, 9, 13>
- <8, 12, 14>
- <8, 1, 14>
- <9, 13, 7>
- <13, 1, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
