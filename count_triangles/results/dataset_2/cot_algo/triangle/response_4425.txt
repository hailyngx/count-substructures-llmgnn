Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 4) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 13) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 7) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Nodes sorted by degree: 
Node 5: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 2: degree 3
Node 8: degree 6
Node 3: degree 3
Node 0: degree 5
Node 7: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 1: degree 5
Node 14: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4

Now, we will analyze the edges based on the ordering of the nodes:

Edges contributing to triangles:
(5, 8): shared connection 3
(5, 3): shared connection none
(5, 7): shared connection none
(9, 4): shared connection 11
(9, 14): shared connection 6
(9, 1): shared connection 11
(9, 12): shared connection 0
(10, 1): shared connection 11
(10, 13): shared connection 3
(10, 14): shared connection 6
(11, 1): shared connection 0
(11, 6): shared connection 4
(11, 4): shared connection 9
(6, 11): shared connection 4
(6, 14): shared connection 9
(6, 7): shared connection none
(2, 8): shared connection none
(2, 12): shared connection none
(2, 4): shared connection none
(8, 5): shared connection 3
(8, 6): shared connection none
(8, 2): shared connection none
(8, 0): shared connection none
(8, 3): shared connection none
(8, 1): shared connection 11
(3, 5): shared connection none
(3, 8): shared connection none
(3, 13): shared connection 10
(0, 11): shared connection 4
(0, 8): shared connection none
(0, 7): shared connection none
(0, 12): shared connection none
(0, 1): shared connection 11
(7, 5): shared connection none
(7, 6): shared connection none
(7, 0): shared connection none
(7, 14): shared connection none
(7, 13): shared connection none
(4, 9): shared connection 11
(4, 11): shared connection 9
(4, 2): shared connection none
(12, 9): shared connection 0
(12, 2): shared connection none
(12, 0): shared connection none
(12, 13): shared connection 10
(1, 9): shared connection 11
(1, 10): shared connection 11
(1, 11): shared connection 0
(1, 8): shared connection 11
(1, 0): shared connection 11
(14, 9): shared connection 6
(14, 10): shared connection 6
(14, 6): shared connection 9
(14, 7): shared connection none
(13, 10): shared connection 3
(13, 3): shared connection 10
(13, 7): shared connection none
(13, 12): shared connection 10

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6], and the unique triangles found are the following: 
<1, 8, 11>
<10, 13, 3>
<1, 9, 11>
<9, 4, 11>
<9, 14, 6>
<0, 1, 11>
