Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 9) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 11) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 10) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges and count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Vertices sorted by their number of connections (degree):
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 11: 6 connections
Node 13: 7 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 14: 4 connections

By analyzing the edges, we have:
- Node 6 shares an edge with Node 14 and Node 0.
- Node 9 shares an edge with Node 3, Node 1, Node 7, and Node 12.
- Node 8 shares an edge with Node 13, Node 2, Node 11, and Node 7.
- Node 13 shares an edge with Node 8, Node 5, Node 4, Node 3, Node 10, and Node 14.
- Node 2 shares an edge with Node 8, Node 1, and Node 7.
- Node 5 shares an edge with Node 13, Node 1, Node 11, and Node 10.
- Node 4 shares an edge with Node 13, Node 3, Node 14, and Node 11.
- Node 12 shares an edge with Node 9 and Node 1.
- Node 0 shares an edge with Node 6, Node 11, and Node 1.
- Node 10 shares an edge with Node 13, Node 5, and Node 14.
- Node 3 shares an edge with Node 9, Node 13, Node 4, and Node 7.
- Node 7 shares an edge with Node 9, Node 8, Node 2, Node 5, and Node 3.
- Node 1 shares an edge with Node 9, Node 2, Node 5, Node 12, Node 0, and Node 11.
- Node 11 shares an edge with Node 8, Node 5, Node 4, Node 0, and Node 1.
- Node 14 shares an edge with Node 6, Node 13, Node 4, and Node 10.

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph: 
There are 27 triangles in total.
