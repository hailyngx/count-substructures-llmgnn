Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (4, 1) (4, 13) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 7) (2, 10) (2, 7) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) 
(9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) 
(6, 7) (6, 10) 
(1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 8) 
(3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) 
(10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 14) 
(11, 13) 
(8, 13) (8, 1) 
(13, 4) (13, 0) 
(4, 1) 
(0, 14) (0, 7) 
(7, 12) (7, 2)

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new order is: {7, 2, 4, 0, 5, 6, 11, 8, 3, 14, 10, 12, 1, 9, 13}

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Triangles with vertex 7:
- (7, 6, 3)
- (7, 6, 12)
- (7, 2, 10)

2. Triangles with vertex 2:
- (2, 7, 10)

3. Triangles with vertex 4:
- (4, 1, 13)

4. Triangles with vertex 0:
- (0, 14, 7)

5. Triangles with vertex 5, 6, 11, 8, 3, 14, 10, 12, 1, 9, 13:
- No triangles can be formed as these nodes have more connections than their adjacent nodes.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are <7, 6, 3>, <7, 6, 12>, <7, 2, 10>, <4, 1, 13>, and <0, 14, 7>.
