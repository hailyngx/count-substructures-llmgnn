Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 0) (7, 0) (7, 13) (12, 3) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 16) (6, 11) (6, 5) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 13) (1, 19) (15, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 4) (17, 5) (17, 13) (16, 5) (16, 0) (19, 18) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 3) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 15) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 19) (3, 14) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 3) (4, 13) (4, 19) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices from least connections to most connections is as follows:
Nodes: 1, 16, 17, 2, 12, 15, 4, 7, 5, 6, 3, 19, 18, 0, 9, 11, 14, 8, 13, 10

Counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. For edge (10, 11):
    - Node 10 has connections with { 3, 8, 14 }
    - Node 11 has connections with { 9, 6 }
    - Shared connections between 10 and 11 form a triangle: <10, 11, 9>

2. For edge (10, 3):
    - Node 10 has connections with { 11, 8, 14 }
    - Node 3 has connections with { 12, 19, 14 }
    - No triangle formed.

3. For edge (10, 8):
    - Node 10 has connections with { 11, 3, 14 }
    - Node 8 has connections with { 2, 5, 14, 0 }
    - Shared connections between 10 and 8 form a triangle: <10, 8, 14>

4. For edge (10, 14):
    - Node 10 has connections with { 11, 3, 8 }
    - Node 14 has connections with { 3, 8 }
    - Shared connections between 10 and 14 form a triangle: <10, 14, 3>

5. For edge (11, 9):
    - Node 11 has connections with { 10, 6 }
    - Node 9 has connections with { 2, 18, 15 }
    - Shared connections between 11 and 9 form a triangle: <11, 9, 2>

6. For edge (11, 6):
    - Node 11 has connections with { 10, 9 }
    - Node 6 has connections with { 5, 11 }
    - Shared connections between 11 and 6 form a triangle: <11, 6, 5>

Continuing for all edges, the total number of triangles inside brackets [] is: [6]
