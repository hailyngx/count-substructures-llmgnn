Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
The graph constructed from the given edges is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: (5, 9), (1, 9), (8, 9)
- 1: (9, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 6), (3, 7), (2, 7), (0, 1)
- 2: (9, 8), (1, 3), (1, 7), (3, 7), (6, 8)
- 3: (1, 2), (8, 4), (2, 1), (2, 7)
- 4: (7, 9), (8, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (6, 8)
- 5: (9, 0), (0, 9)
- 6: (4, 8), (8, 6), (2, 6)
- 7: (9, 4), (4, 2), (2, 1)
- 8: (9, 0), (4, 1), (3, 8), (8, 6), (0, 8), (6, 4)
- 9: (5, 0), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 7), (0, 5), (2, 9), (1, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9)

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method and sorting by the number of connections, we get the following relabeled vertices:
Nodes (sorted): 5, 3, 6, 7, 0, 8, 4, 1, 2, 9

Now, we count the triangles using the ordered edges:
- Triangle <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle <1, 6, 8>
- Triangle <1, 7, 9>
- Triangle <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle <3, 4, 7>

[Total number of triangles: 6]
