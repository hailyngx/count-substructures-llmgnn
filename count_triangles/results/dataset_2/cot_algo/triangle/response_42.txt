Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Degree-Based Ordering:
Node 7: degree 1
Node 1: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5
Node 9: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 5: degree 6

Edges processed:
(3, 0) - Forms triangle with 2: <0, 3, 2>
(6, 4) - Forms triangle with 9: <4, 6, 9>
(7, 8) - Forms triangle with 2: <2, 7, 8>
(8, 0) - Forms triangle with 5: <0, 8, 5>
(3, 2) - Forms triangle with 9: <2, 3, 9>
(2, 0) - Forms triangle with 1: <0, 2, 1>

Total number of triangles: [5]
