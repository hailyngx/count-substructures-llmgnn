Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 10) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 4) (11, 14) (11, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 1) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) 

Response:
The given graph with the provided edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: (6, 10), (6, 2), (6, 4), (9, 13), (9, 7), (9, 0), (7, 9), (7, 12), (7, 3), (7, 8), (12, 7), (12, 13), (12, 5), (12, 8), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 13), (2, 14), (8, 7), (8, 12), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 0), (8, 1), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 10), (0, 1), (14, 2), (14, 11), (14, 4), (14, 10), (3, 7), (3, 11), (3, 4), (11, 14), (11, 3), (10, 6), (10, 0), (10, 14), (10, 1), (10, 4), (10, 13), (5, 12), (5, 8), (5, 1), (13, 9), (13, 12), (13, 2), (13, 10), (1, 8), (1, 0), (1, 10), (1, 5), (1, 4), (4, 6), (4, 14), (4, 3), (4, 10), (4, 1)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree in ascending order, relabel them accordingly, and count the number of triangles in the graph. Let's calculate it.
