Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees from least to most are:
Vertices: 1, 7, 8, 4, 5, 6, 3, 9, 13, 12, 14, 11, 2, 0, 10

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges to count triangles:
1. Edge (6, 14):
    - Vertices 6 and 14 have common neighbors: 10, 13
    - Formed triangle: <6, 10, 13>

2. Edge (6, 10):
    - Vertex 6 has common neighbors 13 with 10
    - Formed triangle: <6, 13, 10>

3. Edge (6, 13):
    - Vertices 6 and 13 have common neighbors: 10
    - Formed triangle: <6, 10, 13>

4. Edge (9, 13):
    - Vertices 9 and 13 have common neighbors: 0, 10, 12
    - Formed triangles: <9, 0, 12> and <9, 10, 13>

5. Edge (9, 0):
    - Vertex 9 has a common neighbor 13 with 0
    - Formed triangle: <9, 13, 0>

6. Edge (9, 12):
    - Vertex 9 has a common neighbor 13 with 12
    - Formed triangle: <9, 13, 12>

7. Edge (1, 3):
    - No triangles formed.

8. Edge (1, 2):
    - No triangles formed.

9. Edge (3, 1):
    - No triangles formed.

10. Edge (3, 13):
    - Vertices 3 and 13 have common neighbors: 6, 10
    - Formed triangle: <3, 6, 10>

... (continuing for all edges)

By calculating the total number of triangles, we get:
[15]

The unique triangles found are:
<6, 10, 13>, <9, 0, 12>, <9, 10, 13>, <3, 6, 10>, <0, 7, 11>, <0, 7, 13>, <2, 8, 11>, <1, 2, 10>, <2, 8, 14>, <4, 8, 12>
