Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we construct the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: 4, 7, 6, 9, 2
- 1: 7, 8, 6, 9, 2
- 2: 7, 0, 9, 1, 3
- 3: 4, 5, 6, 2
- 4: 0, 5, 3
- 5: 4, 3
- 6: 8, 1, 3, 0
- 7: 0, 9, 8, 2, 1
- 8: 7, 6, 1
- 9: 7, 0, 2, 1

Next, we sort the vertices based on the number of connections:
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting triangles:
- Edge (0, 4) [4 and 0 have 5 connections] forms a triangle with node 6
- Edge (0, 7) [7 and 0 have 5 connections] does not form any new triangles
- Edge (0, 6) [6 and 0 have 4 connections] does not form any new triangles
- Edge (0, 9) [9 and 0 have 3 connections] does not form any new triangles
- Edge (0, 2) [2 and 0 have 5 connections] does not form any new triangles
- Edge (1, 6) [6 and 1 have 4 connections] does not form any new triangles
- Edge (1, 8) [8 and 1 have 1 connection] does not form any new triangles
- Edge (1, 9) [9 and 1 have 3 connections] does not form any new triangles
- Edge (1, 2) [2 and 1 have 5 connections] forms a triangle with node 3
- Edge (2, 7) [7 and 2 have 5 connections] does not form any new triangles

After going through all edges, we obtained a total of 2 triangles. 

So, the answer is:
[2]
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 3>
