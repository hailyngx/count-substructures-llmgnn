Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 2) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 8) 

Response:
The vertices with their degrees are:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now list the edges: 
(5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 7) (3, 4) (12, 2) (12, 14) (6, 7) (11, 8) (3, 6) (11, 1) (13, 2) (10, 1)

Now, we will count the triangles using the shared connections between vertices of each edge:

Total number of triangles: [15]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 12>
<0, 8, 14>
<1, 10, 8>
<1, 10, 4>
<1, 11, 3>
<2, 12, 14>
<2, 13, 6>
<2, 13, 12>
<2, 14, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 11>
<4, 7, 6>
<8, 9, 13>
