Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 14) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 14) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
(6, 9), (6, 3), (6, 2), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 13), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 0), (1, 7), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 14), (3, 13), (3, 12), (10, 11), (10, 4), (10, 13), (11, 10), (11, 12), (11, 4), (2, 6), (2, 14), (2, 4), (8, 9), (8, 12), (8, 7), (5, 13), (5, 12), (5, 0), (5, 7), (13, 9), (13, 3), (13, 10), (13, 5), (13, 14), (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 4), (7, 1), (7, 8), (7, 5), (7, 0), (7, 14), (14, 3), (14, 2), (14, 13), (14, 7), (14, 12), (12, 3), (12, 11), (12, 8), (12, 5), (12, 14), (4, 1), (4, 10), (4, 11), (4, 2), (4, 0)

By sorting the nodes based on their degree, we get the following relabeling:
Nodes: 10, 11, 6, 8, 5, 0, 2, 7, 4, 1, 13, 12, 3, 14, 9

Proceeding with the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles counted: 13

Total number of triangles: [13]

Unique triangles found: 
<4, 1, 0>, <5, 7, 0>, <5, 12, 13>, <5, 7, 1>, <7, 1, 0>, <7, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 12>, <14, 2, 6>, <13, 9, 6>, <13, 14, 3>, <13, 14, 7>, <13, 10, 4>, <13, 5, 0>
