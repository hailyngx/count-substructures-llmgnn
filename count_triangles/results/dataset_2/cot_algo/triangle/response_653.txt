Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 5) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 3) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 14) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (14, 8) (14, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 12) 

Response:
The nodes are as follows: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

After sorting the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order, we have the following mapping:
0 -> 4 connections
1 -> 3 connections
2 -> 4 connections
3 -> 5 connections
4 -> 5 connections
5 -> 4 connections
6 -> 3 connections
7 -> 5 connections
8 -> 4 connections
9 -> 4 connections
10 -> 4 connections
11 -> 4 connections
12 -> 4 connections
13 -> 4 connections
14 -> 2 connections

Now, we can count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
[15]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 3, 13>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 8, 12>
<0, 9, 11>
<2, 5, 14>
<3, 7, 11>
<3, 7, 13>
<4, 5, 7>
<8, 10, 12>
<9, 11, 13>
