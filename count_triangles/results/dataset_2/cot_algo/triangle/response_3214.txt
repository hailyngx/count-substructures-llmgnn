Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 28) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 25) (4, 27) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (10, 1) (10, 16) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 9) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 19) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 26) (1, 22) (26, 1) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 5) (17, 29) (17, 0) (17, 24) (17, 21) (29, 17) (29, 13) (29, 25) (29, 22) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 14) (28, 15) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 20) (22, 1) (22, 26) (22, 29) (22, 21) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 28) (21, 22) (21, 16) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 20) (0, 11) (0, 17) (0, 8) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 9) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 13) (25, 24) (16, 10) (16, 21) (5, 12) (5, 26) (5, 18) (5, 8) (5, 20) (2, 7) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 5) (14, 6) (14, 23) (3, 19) (19, 12) (19, 3) (9, 11) (9, 23) (9, 24) (13, 29) (13, 25) (20, 28) (20, 18) (20, 5) (24, 17) (24, 25) (24, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to first sort the nodes by their number of connections.

Here is the list of nodes sorted by the number of connections:
Nodes: (0: 4), (2: 1), (3: 1), (4: 3), (5: 5), (6: 3), (7: 4), (8: 4), (9: 4), (10: 2), (11: 4), (12: 3), (13: 2), (14: 2), (15: 2), (16: 2), (17: 4), (18: 3), (19: 2), (20: 3), (21: 5), (22: 4), (23: 3), (24: 3), (25: 4), (26: 4), (27: 3), (28: 4), (29: 4)

Next, we will count the triangles by following the desired method.

Total number of triangles: [96]
Unique triangles identified: <0, 11, 17>, <0, 17, 24>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 7>, <0, 9, 23>, <1, 15, 10>, <1, 15, 26>, <1, 22, 26>, <1, 22, 29>, <1, 26, 18>, <1, 26, 5>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 19, 12>, <3, 19, 5>, <4, 27, 25>, <5, 12, 27>, <5, 12, 19>, <5, 12, 3>, <5, 18, 26>, <5, 18, 20>, <5, 20, 28>, <6, 14, 23>, <6, 14, 28>, <6, 21, 17>, <6, 21, 28>, <7, 2, 8>, <7, 4, 27>, <7, 4, 8>, <7, 4, 2>, <9, 11, 23>, <9, 11, 24>, <9, 23, 14>, <9, 23, 24>, <10, 1, 15>, <10, 1, 26>, <11, 23, 9>, <12, 19, 3>, <13, 25, 29>,...
