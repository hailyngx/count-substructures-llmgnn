Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 12) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (12, 11) (12, 1) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 13) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 4) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertices by connections:
(5: 5 connections),
(9: 4 connections),
(10: 4 connections),
(3: 5 connections),
(2: 4 connections),
(11: 2 connections),
(12: 2 connections),
(14: 3 connections),
(7: 4 connections),
(6: 4 connections),
(1: 5 connections),
(8: 6 connections),
(13: 4 connections),
(4: 4 connections),
(0: 3 connections)

After relabeling the vertices:
(0: 1),
(4: 2),
(11: 3),
(12: 4),
(14: 5),
(6: 6),
(7: 7),
(2: 8),
(9: 9),
(1: 10),
(13: 11),
(10: 12),
(8: 13),
(3: 14),
(5: 15)

Now, we will count the triangles:
There are 18 triangles in total.

Total number of triangles: [18]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 9>, <4, 13, 5>, <4, 13, 14>, <4, 5, 9>, <11, 12, 1>, <6, 7, 10>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 3, 10>, <6, 3, 7>, <7, 8, 10>, <2, 9, 5>, <1, 12, 11>, <1, 14, 13>, <13, 14, 5>, <3, 5, 7>.
