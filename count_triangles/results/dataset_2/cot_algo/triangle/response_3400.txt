Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees. Let's calculate the degrees of the vertices:

- Node 0: Degree 5
- Node 1: Degree 3
- Node 2: Degree 4
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 5
- Node 5: Degree 5
- Node 6: Degree 3
- Node 7: Degree 4
- Node 8: Degree 5
- Node 9: Degree 4

Based on the ordering of vertices by degree, we have the following new labels for the nodes:  
Node 1 (Degree 3) -> Node 0  
Node 6 (Degree 3) -> Node 1  
Node 3 (Degree 4) -> Node 2  
Node 4 (Degree 5) -> Node 3  
Node 7 (Degree 4) -> Node 4  
Node 9 (Degree 4) -> Node 5  
Node 2 (Degree 4) -> Node 6  
Node 8 (Degree 5) -> Node 7  
Node 5 (Degree 5) -> Node 8  
Node 0 (Degree 5) -> Node 9  

Next, we will proceed with the edges in the graph where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. (1, 0): Forms a triangle with shared connection 5 -> <1, 0, 5>
2. (1, 6): No triangle formed
3. (2, 3): Forms a triangle with shared connection 5 -> <2, 3, 5>
4. (2, 9): Forms a triangle with shared connection 8 -> <2, 9, 8>
5. (2, 5): Forms a triangle with shared connection 3 -> <2, 5, 3>
6. (0, 4): No triangle formed
7. (0, 3): Forms a triangle with shared connection 5 -> <0, 3, 5>
8. (0, 8): No triangle formed

Hence, the total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [4], and the unique triangles found are <1, 0, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 9, 8>, and <2, 5, 3>.
