Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 15) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 17) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 16) (13, 7) (13, 4) (1, 14) (1, 19) (15, 12) (15, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 3) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 3) (19, 6) (0, 12) (0, 15) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 6) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 11) (6, 19) (6, 11) (6, 17) (17, 2) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 5) (16, 17) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 19) (3, 10) (4, 5) (4, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Let's follow the steps outlined in the task:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections):
   Vertex 16 has 2 connections
   Vertex 10 has 2 connections
   Vertex 6 has 3 connections
   Vertex 1 has 3 connections
   Vertex 9 has 3 connections
   Vertex 14 has 3 connections
   Vertex 15 has 3 connections
   Vertex 0 has 3 connections
   Vertex 12 has 3 connections
   Vertex 2 has 4 connections
   Vertex 11 has 4 connections
   Vertex 5 has 4 connections
   Vertex 7 has 4 connections
   Vertex 13 has 4 connections
   Vertex 3 has 6 connections
   Vertex 18 has 6 connections
   Vertex 4 has 6 connections
   Vertex 17 has 6 connections
   Vertex 8 has 6 connections
   Vertex 19 has 6 connections

2. Relabel the vertices from 0 to 19 based on the sorted order above.

3. Follow the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

   - Triangle 1: <0, 2, 8>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 2, 5>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 2, 17>
   - Triangle 4: <0, 5, 17>
   - Triangle 5: <0, 12, 15>
   - Triangle 6: <2, 5, 17>
   - Triangle 7: <2, 8, 3>
   - Triangle 8: <2, 8, 7>
   - Triangle 9: <2, 8, 5>
   - Triangle 10: <3, 8, 7>
   - Triangle 11: <3, 8, 9>
   - Triangle 12: <3, 8, 19>
   - Triangle 13: <3, 8, 18>
   - Triangle 14: <3, 8, 5>
   - Triangle 15: <3, 8, 2>
   - Triangle 16: <3, 8, 17>
   - Triangle 17: <3, 9, 19>
   - Triangle 18: <3, 9, 7>
   - Triangle 19: <3, 9, 8>
   - Triangle 20: <3, 9, 13>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
