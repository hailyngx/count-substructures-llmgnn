Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 

Edges:
(10, 11), (10, 17), (10, 4), (11, 10), (11, 23), (11, 22), (11, 15), (12, 21), (12, 29), (12, 6), (27, 28), (27, 17), (2, 3), (2, 14), (2, 17), (18, 5), (18, 20), (17, 10), (17, 27), (17, 2), (17, 4), (0, 14), (0, 24), (0, 6), (14, 2), (14, 0), (14, 26), (21, 12), (21, 20), (28, 27), (28, 9), (28, 22), (1, 29), (1, 19), (26, 14), (26, 23), (26, 20), (7, 15), (25, 19), (20, 18), (20, 21), (20, 26), (20, 29), (20, 22), (29, 12), (29, 1), (29, 20), (29, 23), (23, 11), (23, 26), (23, 29), (23, 24), (8, 19), (8, 5), (19, 1), (19, 25), (19, 8), (19, 16), (6, 12), (6, 0), (6, 24), (24, 0), (24, 23), (24, 6), (24, 5), (24, 15), (13, 4), (13, 3), (3, 2), (3, 13), (3, 9), (5, 18), (5, 8), (5, 24), (5, 16), (15, 11), (15, 7), (15, 24), (15, 16), (22, 11), (22, 28), (22, 20), (9, 28), (9, 3), (4, 10), (4, 17), (4, 13), (16, 19), (16, 5), (16, 15)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:

Vertices by degree:  
1: 1 connections  
7: 1 connections  
8: 2 connections  
9: 2 connections  
13: 2 connections  
18: 2 connections  
25: 1 connections  
27: 2 connections  
0: 3 connections  
2: 3 connections  
22: 3 connections  
26: 3 connections  
5: 4 connections  
12: 3 connections  
28: 3 connections  
3: 4 connections  
6: 4 connections  
21: 2 connections  
24: 4 connections   
15: 5 connections  
17: 5 connections  
19: 5 connections  
11: 6 connections  
16: 5 connections  
4: 6 connections  
20: 6 connections  
10: 6 connections  
23: 6 connections  
29: 6 connections

Now, we find the triangles in the graph using Degree-Based Ordering. 

After examining the edges according to the lowest degree of their vertices:  
The total number of triangles is [12].  
The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 6, 24>  
<0, 6, 12>  
<0, 10, 4>  
<0, 17, 10>  
<0, 17, 4>  
<2, 14, 0>  
<2, 14, 26>  
<2, 17, 10>  
<2, 17, 27>  
<3, 13, 4>  
<3, 13, 9>  
<4, 13, 3>
