Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) 

Response:
The given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 3), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 0), (1, 8), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 2), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 7), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 1), (0, 6), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 2), (7, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 0), (6, 7)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we relabel the vertices as follows based on their degree (number of connections):
0 - degree 4
1 - degree 4
2 - degree 3
3 - degree 4
4 - degree 4
5 - degree 5
6 - degree 4
7 - degree 4
8 - degree 3
9 - degree 4

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Start with the edge with the vertex having the lower label and fewer connections. 
- Check for shared connections to find triangles.

Based on the given edges, the total number of triangles is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 9>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 9>
