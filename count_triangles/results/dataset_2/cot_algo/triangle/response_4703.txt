Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows:
0 (degree 5)
1 (degree 3)
5 (degree 3)
9 (degree 3)
6 (degree 4)
3 (degree 4)
7 (degree 4)
2 (degree 5)
8 (degree 6)
4 (degree 6)

By examining the edges and applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph. 

The total number of triangles is [9].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
