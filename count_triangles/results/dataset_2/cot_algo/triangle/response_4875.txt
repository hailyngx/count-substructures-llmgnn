Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (2, 16) (2, 17) (18, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 13) (14, 18) (14, 16) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 11) (15, 0) (15, 1) (8, 10) (8, 6) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 3) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (5, 12) (5, 17) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 9) (17, 4) (17, 2) (17, 9) (17, 5) (19, 4) (19, 13) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree of connections. The nodes are relabeled accordingly.
Here is the list of nodes sorted by their degrees:
Node 11: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 18: degree 2
Node 19: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 2
Node 9: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 12: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 7: degree 4
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 3
Node 10: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 13: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4

Starting with the edge analysis, focusing only on cases where the lower labelled node has fewer connections:
- Edge (4, 7): Both 4 and 7 have 4 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (4, 19): Node 4 has 5 connections, Node 19 has 3 connections. Formed triangle: <4, 19, 13>.
- Edge (4, 10): Node 4 has 5 connections, Node 10 has 5 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (4, 17): Node 4 has 5 connections, Node 17 has 4 connections. Formed triangle: <4, 17, 2>.
- Edge (7, 11): Both 7 and 11 have 4 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (7, 10): Node 7 has 4 connections, Node 10 has 5 connections. Formed triangle: <7, 10, 0>.
- Edge (2, 16): Both 2 and 16 have 2 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (2, 17): Node 2 has 2 connections, Node 17 has 4 connections. Formed triangle: <2, 17, 4>.
- Edge (18, 14): Both 18 and 14 have 2 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (12, 5): Both 12 and 5 have 2 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (12, 6): Both 12 and 6 have 5 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (12, 3): Node 12 has 4 connections, Node 3 has 5 connections. Formed triangle: <12, 3, 6>.
...

After analyzing all the edges, the total number of triangles found inside brackets [] is [9].
The unique triangles found are:
<4, 19, 13>
<4, 17, 2>
<7, 10, 0>
<3, 0, 15>
<3, 0, 13>
<3, 0, 6>
<3, 6, 8>
<10, 0, 13>
<10, 0, 3>
