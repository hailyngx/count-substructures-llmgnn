Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 15) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 16) (1, 10) (1, 6) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 4) (9, 16) (9, 12) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 15) (2, 4) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 16) (3, 18) (3, 5) (3, 12) (19, 2) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 15) (7, 8) (7, 17) (7, 15) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 7) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 3) (16, 14) (16, 9) (16, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. Here, we will sort the vertices based on the number of connections each node has, from least to most connections:

Vertices: 
0 - 2 connections
1 - 2 connections
3 - 3 connections
7 - 3 connections
9 - 3 connections
13 - 3 connections
19 - 3 connections
10 - 5 connections
11 - 3 connections
17 - 4 connections
8 - 2 connections
14 - 2 connections
18 - 4 connections
12 - 3 connections
16 - 3 connections
6 - 5 connections
5 - 4 connections
15 - 5 connections
2 - 5 connections
4 - 4 connections

Based on the sorting above, we can start counting triangles. We will only consider an edge if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections than the other vertex.

Total number of triangles: [9]
