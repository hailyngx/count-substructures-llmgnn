Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows: <0, 4, 5, 9, 8, 7, 1, 2, 6, 3>.

Counting triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
For the given edge list, the triangles found are: 
<1, 3, 6>    
<3, 4, 6>    
<1, 4, 6>   
<4, 5, 8>  

Total number of triangles: [4]
