Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 16) (8, 11) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 18) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 17) (5, 19) (5, 14) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 9) (15, 4) (15, 16) (15, 17) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 10) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (12, 14) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 1) (10, 16) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 9) (17, 3) (17, 11) (17, 15) (17, 18) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 5) (14, 19) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 10) (9, 14) (13, 11) (13, 6) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 10) (18, 17) (1, 7) (1, 0) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 7 (Degree 3)
Node 8 (Degree 2)
Node 3 (Degree 4)
Node 13 (Degree 2)
Node 5 (Degree 2)
Node 19 (Degree 3)
Node 15 (Degree 3)
Node 16 (Degree 3)
Node 2 (Degree 3)
Node 12 (Degree 1)
Node 11 (Degree 4)
Node 14 (Degree 5)
Node 9 (Degree 4)
Node 6 (Degree 2)
Node 4 (Degree 3)
Node 10 (Degree 4)
Node 18 (Degree 4)
Node 1 (Degree 2)
Node 0 (Degree 3)
Node 17 (Degree 4)

From the degree-based ordering, we will only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Considering these edges and checking for shared connections to form triangles, we find the following unique triangles:

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 10>
<0, 2, 18>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 18, 10>
<0, 18, 3>
<1, 7, 0>
<1, 7, 2>
<2, 10, 0>
<2, 10, 16>
<2, 10, 18>
<2, 10, 9>
<2, 7, 0>
<2, 7, 4>

<3, 17, 11>
<4, 7, 1>

<16, 8, 11>
<17, 3, 11>
