Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 0), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0), (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 1), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (8, 5), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 3), (2, 0), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 7), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 0), (6, 2), (6, 0), (6, 3), (3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 2), (3, 6)
```

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

Nodes by degrees:
```
Node 8: degree = 1
Node 6: degree = 2
Node 5: degree = 4
Node 4: degree = 4
Node 3: degree = 4
Node 9: degree = 4
Node 7: degree = 5
Node 1: degree = 5
Node 2: degree = 6
Node 0: degree = 8
```

Now, we will relabel the nodes according to their degrees from least to most, starting from 0. The relabeled nodes are:
```
Node 0 (degree: 8) -> Node A
Node 8 (degree: 1) -> Node B
Node 6 (degree: 2) -> Node C
Node 5 (degree: 4) -> Node D
Node 4 (degree: 4) -> Node E
Node 3 (degree: 4) -> Node F
Node 9 (degree: 4) -> Node G
Node 7 (degree: 5) -> Node H
Node 1 (degree: 5) -> Node I
Node 2 (degree: 6) -> Node J
```

Now, we will check for triangles by examining the connections between the nodes in decreasing order of their degrees. Once the triangles are found, we will output the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].

The unique triangles are:
```
<4, 0, 1>
<4, 0, 9>
<3, 0, 6>
<2, 0, 7>
```
