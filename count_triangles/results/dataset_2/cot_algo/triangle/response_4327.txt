Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort the nodes by their degrees (number of connections):
   - Node 5: degree 5
   - Node 9: degree 5
   - Node 6: degree 4
   - Node 1: degree 4
   - Node 3: degree 4
   - Node 4: degree 4
   - Node 8: degree 4
   - Node 13: degree 4
   - Node 12: degree 4
   - Node 0: degree 3
   - Node 2: degree 3
   - Node 14: degree 3
   - Node 11: degree 3
   - Node 7: degree 3
   - Node 10: degree 3

2. Relabel the nodes from 0 to 14 based on their degrees.

   Nodes by label:
   - Node 0: degree 3
   - Node 1: degree 4
   - Node 2: degree 3
   - Node 3: degree 4
   - Node 4: degree 4
   - Node 5: degree 5
   - Node 6: degree 4
   - Node 7: degree 3
   - Node 8: degree 4
   - Node 9: degree 5
   - Node 10: degree 3
   - Node 11: degree 3
   - Node 12: degree 4
   - Node 13: degree 4
   - Node 14: degree 3

3. Count the triangles by examining the edges in the graph:

   - Triangles: 
     <1, 3, 4>
     <1, 3, 13>
     <1, 4, 8>
     <1, 4, 13>
     <3, 4, 13>

4. Output the total number of triangles inside brackets []:

   Total number of triangles: [5]
