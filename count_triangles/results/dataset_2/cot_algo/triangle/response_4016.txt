Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows:
0 (degree: 3)
8 (degree: 3)
7 (degree: 4)
6 (degree: 4)
5 (degree: 5)
9 (degree: 5)
4 (degree: 6)
2 (degree: 6)
1 (degree: 7)
3 (degree: 7)

Calculating the triangles:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 5, 9>

The total number of triangles is [10].
