Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 14) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 4) (27, 29) (27, 24) (21, 9) (21, 5) (21, 22) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 10) (24, 27) (24, 26) (24, 17) (26, 28) (26, 24) (26, 7) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 3) (20, 19) (20, 6) (29, 27) (29, 12) (3, 11) (3, 18) (3, 4) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 7) (19, 20) (19, 6) (2, 22) (2, 12) (2, 5) (22, 21) (22, 2) (22, 7) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 7) (6, 20) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 13) (12, 29) (12, 2) (5, 11) (5, 21) (5, 8) (5, 2) (9, 21) (9, 28) (9, 25) (25, 9) (25, 0) (25, 4) (25, 10) (14, 16) (14, 15) (7, 15) (7, 26) (7, 8) (7, 22) (7, 1) (10, 28) (10, 25) (0, 25) (0, 4) (0, 23) (17, 24) (17, 18) (17, 8) (17, 23) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 25) (4, 0) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 4) (23, 0) (23, 17) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, relabel the vertices based on this ordering. 

Here is the sorted list of vertices with their degrees:
0 (degree 4), 1 (degree 4), 19 (degree 2), 6 (degree 4), 13 (degree 2), 2 (degree 3), 12 (degree 2), 23 (degree 2), 20 (degree 2), 5 (degree 4), 25 (degree 4), 9 (degree 3), 28 (degree 3), 14 (degree 2), 15 (degree 2), 4 (degree 5), 22 (degree 3), 7 (degree 5), 10 (degree 2), 17 (degree 4), 8 (degree 3), 26 (degree 3), 27 (degree 3), 29 (degree 2), 21 (degree 3), 18 (degree 3), 24 (degree 3), 3 (degree 3), 11 (degree 5)

Now, we will proceed with counting the triangles:

1. For the edge (11, 16), as both vertices have the same degree (5), we proceed based on the ordering of the vertices. 
    => 11 and 16 share connections with 5, so the triangle <5, 11, 16> is formed.
    
2. For the edge (11, 3), as 11 has a higher degree than 3, we cannot form a triangle.

3. For the edge (11, 1), as 11 has a higher degree than 1, we cannot form a triangle.

4. For the edge (11, 18), as 11 has a higher degree than 18, we cannot form a triangle.

5. For the edge (11, 5), as 11 has a higher degree than 5, we cannot form a triangle.

6. For the edge (16, 14), as 14 has a lower degree than 16, we cannot form a triangle.

7. For the edge (15, 7), as both vertices have the same degree (2), we proceed based on the ordering of the vertices. 
    => 15 and 7 share connections with 14, so the triangle <14, 15, 7> is formed.

(Continuing this process for all edges...)

After considering all edges, we count a total of 3 triangles:

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 11, 16>, <14, 15, 7>, <14, 22, 7>
