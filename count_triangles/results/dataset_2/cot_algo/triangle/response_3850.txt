Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 19) (16, 15) (15, 16) (15, 27) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 2) (27, 28) (27, 5) (4, 7) (4, 28) (4, 25) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 23) (7, 22) (18, 26) (18, 12) (22, 7) (8, 23) (8, 9) (8, 21) (8, 0) (23, 7) (23, 8) (19, 16) (19, 6) (26, 18) (26, 13) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 24) (1, 20) (1, 25) (17, 20) (17, 24) (17, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (20, 1) (20, 17) (20, 10) (10, 20) (10, 21) (10, 2) (21, 8) (21, 10) (21, 25) (21, 29) (2, 16) (2, 27) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 3) (5, 27) (5, 17) (5, 2) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 24) (3, 6) (25, 4) (25, 9) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 24) (14, 15) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 28) (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 3) (6, 14) (24, 9) (24, 17) (24, 3) (24, 25) (12, 18) (13, 26) (13, 0) (13, 29) (29, 21) (29, 13) (28, 27) (28, 4) (28, 14) 

Response:
The graph contains the following nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}.
The graph has a total of 90 edges connecting these nodes.

After sorting the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order, we obtain the following list:
{11, 12, 1, 18, 24, 3, 17, 13, 5, 0, 6, 10, 7, 8, 9, 19, 4, 14, 15, 28, 20, 29, 2, 23, 21, 25, 26, 16, 27}.

Based on the sorted list, we can now analyze the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangles involving node 11: None
2. Triangles involving node 12: None
3. Triangles involving node 1: None
4. Triangles involving node 18: None
5. Triangles involving node 24: None
6. Triangles involving node 3: None
7. Triangles involving node 17: None
8. Triangles involving node 13: None
9. Triangles involving node 5: None
10. Triangles involving node 0: None
11. Triangles involving node 6: None
12. Triangles involving node 10: None
13. Triangles involving node 7: None
14. Triangles involving node 8: None
15. Triangles involving node 9: None
16. Triangles involving node 19: None
17. Triangles involving node 4: None
18. Triangles involving node 14: <3, 6, 14>
19. Triangles involving node 15: <16, 15, 27>
20. Triangles involving node 28: None
21. Triangles involving node 20: None
22. Triangles involving node 29: None
23. Triangles involving node 2: <16, 2, 27>
24. Triangles involving node 23: None
25. Triangles involving node 21: None
26. Triangles involving node 25: <9, 25, 24>
27. Triangles involving node 26: None
28. Triangles involving node 16: <16, 15, 27>
29. Triangles involving node 27: <16, 15, 27>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
