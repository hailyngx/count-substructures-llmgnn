Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 14) (9, 18) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 18) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 5) (2, 16) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 2) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 19) (15, 8) (15, 19) (19, 18) (19, 15) (17, 6) (17, 8) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 16) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) 

Response:
The vertices and their degrees are as follows:
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 2: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 5
- Vertex 5: degree 4
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 6
- Vertex 8: degree 5
- Vertex 9: degree 4
- Vertex 10: degree 3
- Vertex 11: degree 2
- Vertex 12: degree 3
- Vertex 13: degree 3
- Vertex 14: degree 5
- Vertex 15: degree 2
- Vertex 16: degree 3
- Vertex 17: degree 3
- Vertex 18: degree 5
- Vertex 19: degree 2

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Start with the edge (0, 1): Proceed since vertex 0 has degree 2.
2. Start with the edge (0, 7): Proceed since vertex 0 has degree 2.
3. Start with the edge (0, 1): Proceed since vertex 0 has degree 2.
4. Start with the edge (1, 3): Proceed since vertex 1 has degree 3.
5. Start with the edge (1, 13): Proceed since vertex 1 has degree 3.
6. Start with the edge (2, 12): Proceed since vertex 2 has degree 3.
7. Start with the edge (3, 13): Proceed since vertex 3 has degree 3.
8. Start with the edge (4, 8): Skip since both vertices have the same degree.
9. Start with the edge (5, 16): Proceed since vertex 5 has degree 4.
10. Start with the edge (6, 14): Skip since both vertices have the same degree.
11. Start with the edge (7, 18): Skip since both vertices have the same degree.
12. Start with the edge (8, 17): Skip since both vertices have the same degree.
13. Start with the edge (9, 13): Proceed since vertex 9 has degree 4.
14. Start with the edge (10, 18): Skip since both vertices have the same degree.
15. Start with the edge (11, 14): Skip since both vertices have the same degree.
16. Start with the edge (15, 19): Proceed since vertex 15 has degree 2.
17. Start with the edge (15, 19): Proceed since vertex 15 has degree 2.
18. Start with the edge (18, 19): Skip since both vertices have the same degree.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [10], and they are: 
<3, 1, 13>, <13, 9, 12>, <2, 14, 4>, <3, 8, 4>, <5, 16, 7>, <5, 16, 4>, <7, 4, 8>, <7, 18, 9>, <0, 7, 1>, <15, 19, 18>.
