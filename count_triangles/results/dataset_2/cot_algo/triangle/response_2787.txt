Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 13) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 3) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 13) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 5) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 12) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 7) (12, 10) (19, 15) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 16) (17, 5) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 13) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 16) (8, 6) (8, 10) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 14) (7, 9) (7, 15) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 14) (14, 16) (14, 13) 

Response:
The degree-based reordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 7 (degree 2)
Node 2 (degree 2)
Node 12 (degree 2)
Node 19 (degree 2)
Node 8 (degree 2)
Node 18 (degree 4)
Node 11 (degree 4)
Node 5 (degree 4)
Node 0 (degree 4)
Node 1 (degree 4)
Node 3 (degree 5)
Node 4 (degree 5)
Node 10 (degree 5)
Node 14 (degree 2)
Node 6 (degree 4)
Node 9 (degree 5)
Node 15 (degree 5)
Node 13 (degree 6)
Node 16 (degree 5)
Node 17 (degree 6)

With this reordering, we can count the number of triangles present in the graph:
[Total number of triangles: 24]
