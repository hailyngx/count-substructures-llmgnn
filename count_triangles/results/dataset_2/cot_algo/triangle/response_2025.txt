The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (16, 12) (16, 29) (5, 21) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 20) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 18) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 28) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 22) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 1) (2, 6) (2, 18) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 8) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 26) (1, 17) (1, 27) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 29) (26, 0) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 19) (21, 5) (21, 28) (21, 23) (28, 4) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 19) (15, 10) (15, 20) (20, 9) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 27) (0, 26) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 29) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 24) (17, 22) (25, 9) (22, 7) (22, 17) (23, 26) (23, 21) (8, 18) (8, 28) (8, 0) (8, 3) (19, 12) (19, 28) (19, 14) (19, 24) (29, 16) (29, 26) (29, 14) (13, 4) (13, 20) (13, 27) (24, 17) (24, 19) (27, 1) (27, 20) (27, 13) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges based on the given information:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: (11, 3), (16, 12), (16, 29), (5, 21), (9, 6), (9, 25), (9, 20), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 18), (4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 13), (4, 28), (4, 17), (7, 4), (7, 12), (7, 22), (10, 15), (10, 3), (10, 1), (2, 6), (2, 18), (18, 6), (18, 2), (18, 8), (1, 6), (1, 10), (1, 26), (1, 17), (1, 27), (26, 1), (26, 23), (26, 29), (26, 0), (12, 16), (12, 4), (12, 7), (12, 19), (21, 5), (21, 28), (21, 23), (28, 4), (28, 21), (28, 8), (28, 19), (15, 10), (15, 20), (20, 9), (20, 15), (20, 13), (20, 27), (0, 26), (0, 14), (0, 8), (14, 0), (14, 19), (14, 29), (3, 11), (3, 10), (3, 8), (17, 4), (17, 1), (17, 24), (17, 22), (25, 9), (22, 7), (22, 17), (23, 26), (23, 21), (8, 18), (8, 28), (8, 0), (8, 3), (19, 12), (19, 28), (19, 14), (19, 24), (29, 16), (29, 26), (29, 14), (13, 4), (13, 20), (13, 27), (24, 17), (24, 19), (27, 1), (27, 20), (27, 13)
```

Next, let's sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:

```
Nodes by Degree: 5, 11, 2, 15, 9, 7, 22, 10, 13, 0, 3, 23, 24, 27, 1, 17, 20, 28, 6, 8, 14, 21, 25, 29, 4, 12, 18, 19, 26, 16
```

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- We will only consider the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
- <4, 12, 7>
- <1, 17, 4>
- <3, 10, 1>
- <18, 8, 28>
- <19, 14, 0>
- <20, 13, 4>
- <20, 13, 27>
- <27, 1, 17>

Count of Triangles: [8]
