Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 19) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 28) (22, 5) (15, 25) (27, 12) (27, 7) (27, 8) (9, 29) (9, 18) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 16) (17, 10) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 25) (7, 27) (7, 12) (7, 1) (7, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 28) (14, 25) (21, 28) (21, 5) (21, 2) (28, 22) (28, 14) (28, 21) (28, 11) (11, 14) (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 26) (11, 20) (26, 11) (26, 29) (20, 11) (20, 4) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 8) (29, 4) (4, 22) (4, 12) (4, 20) (4, 29) (4, 16) (3, 2) (23, 18) (23, 24) (18, 9) (18, 23) (18, 1) (18, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 24) (8, 27) (8, 29) (8, 18) (8, 24) (24, 23) (24, 1) (24, 8) (24, 2) (2, 10) (2, 21) (2, 3) (2, 24) (25, 13) (25, 15) (25, 12) (25, 14) (16, 10) (16, 4) (16, 19) (5, 22) (5, 10) (5, 21) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections from least to most. Then labelling the vertices accordingly, we have:

Vertices sorted by the degree:
Node 3: 0 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 17: 2 connections
Node 20: 2 connections
Node 23: 2 connections
Node 26: 2 connections
Node 15: 2 connections
Node 27: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 21: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 18: 5 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 24: 5 connections
Node 29: 5 connections
Node 19: 5 connections
Node 16: 6 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 11: 6 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 14: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 10: 6 connections
Node 12: 6 connections
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 25: 4 connections
Node 22: 4 connections
Node 28: 5 connections
Node 0: 0 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
