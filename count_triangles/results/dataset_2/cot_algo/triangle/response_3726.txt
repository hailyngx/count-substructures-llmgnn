Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the nodes from least to most connected is:
Node 2 - degree 2
Node 8 - degree 3
Node 9 - degree 4
Node 6 - degree 5
Node 1 - degree 5
Node 5 - degree 5
Node 3 - degree 5
Node 0 - degree 6
Node 4 - degree 6
Node 7 - degree 8

Following the given edges and the degree-based ordering method, we find the following triangles:
- Triangle: <1, 3, 5>
- Triangle: <0, 3, 6>
- Triangle: <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle: <6, 8, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 4]
