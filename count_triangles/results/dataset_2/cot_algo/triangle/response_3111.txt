Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the nodes based on their degree. Here is the sorted list of nodes along with their degrees:

0: 3 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 3 connections
9: 3 connections
5: 3 connections
4: 5 connections
7: 5 connections
1: 7 connections
6: 5 connections
8: 7 connections

We will now process the edges according to the method mentioned earlier.
