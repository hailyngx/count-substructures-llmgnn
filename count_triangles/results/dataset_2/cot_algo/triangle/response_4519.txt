Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 7) (9, 23) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 22) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 21) (27, 18) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 19) (20, 25) (20, 14) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 8) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 19) (4, 21) (8, 25) (8, 4) (8, 17) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 28) (1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 18) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 24) (21, 27) (21, 4) (21, 23) (14, 20) (14, 26) (14, 24) (26, 14) (26, 15) (26, 6) (26, 12) (3, 28) (3, 19) (28, 2) (28, 3) (6, 26) (6, 22) (6, 15) (22, 0) (22, 4) (22, 6) (16, 20) (16, 1) (16, 24) (16, 29) (24, 7) (24, 14) (24, 16) (24, 18) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 3) (15, 26) (15, 6) (15, 13) (29, 27) (29, 16) (29, 12) (23, 9) (23, 17) (23, 21) (12, 26) (12, 29) (13, 15) (18, 27) (18, 17) (18, 24) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the given nodes and edges. Now, let's proceed with counting the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

After sorting the vertices by their degrees in increasing order, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:
0: degree 4
1: degree 2
3: degree 2
6: degree 3
13: degree 1
15: degree 3
16: degree 4
18: degree 3
12: degree 2
19: degree 4
23: degree 3
26: degree 4
29: degree 3
2: degree 3
5: degree 2
27: degree 4
10: degree 1
21: degree 3
22: degree 3
4: degree 4
8: degree 3
17: degree 4
7: degree 5
9: degree 2
11: degree 3
14: degree 3
20: degree 4
24: degree 4
25: degree 2
28: degree 2

Now, let's count the triangles and list them.

Total number of triangles: [16]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 27>
<0, 4, 21>
<0, 4, 22>
<0, 7, 27>
<0, 7, 10>
<2, 4, 21>
<2, 4, 22>
<2, 5, 11>
<2, 5, 27>
<2, 5, 11>
<2, 5, 27>
<4, 8, 25>
<4, 8, 17>
<4, 21, 23>
<4, 21, 27>
