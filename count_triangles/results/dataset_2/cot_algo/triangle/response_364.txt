Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 1) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 3), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 10), (2, 5), (2, 12), (2, 11), (2, 14), (3, 8), (3, 0), (3, 11), (3, 14), (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 14), (4, 1), (5, 13), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 10), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 10), (6, 12), (7, 4), (7, 12), (7, 8), (8, 7), (8, 13), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 1), (9, 13), (9, 12), (9, 11), (9, 10), (9, 1), (10, 5), (10, 6), (10, 9), (10, 1), (11, 13), (11, 3), (11, 9), (11, 2), (12, 7), (12, 6), (12, 2), (12, 9), (13, 8), (13, 5), (13, 11), (13, 9), (14, 4), (14, 3), (14, 2)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Vertices: 
0 (Degree 3)
2 (Degree 4)
7 (Degree 4)
5 (Degree 4)
14 (Degree 4)
6 (Degree 4)
10 (Degree 4)
11 (Degree 4)
12 (Degree 4)
9 (Degree 5)
13 (Degree 5)
3 (Degree 5)
1 (Degree 5)
8 (Degree 5)
4 (Degree 6)

Calculating triangles:
- Triangle 1: <1, 4, 9>
- Triangle 2: <1, 4, 10>
- Triangle 3: <1, 6, 10>
- Triangle 4: <1, 6, 9>
- Triangle 5: <4, 6, 12>
- Triangle 6: <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle 7: <6, 12, 2>
- Triangle 8: <12, 9, 11>
- Triangle 9: <5, 10, 1>
- Triangle 10: <5, 10, 6>
- Triangle 11: <10, 9, 11>
- Triangle 12: <2, 14, 4>
- Triangle 13: <0, 4, 1>
- Triangle 14: <0, 4, 8>
- Triangle 15: <3, 0, 8>
- Triangle 16: <3, 0, 4>
- Triangle 17: <3, 0, 11>
- Triangle 18: <3, 14, 2>
- Triangle 19: <3, 11, 9>
- Triangle 20: <13, 8, 0>
- Triangle 21: <13, 8, 1>
- Triangle 22: <13, 8, 3>
- Triangle 23: <13, 11, 9>
- Triangle 24: <5, 13, 9>
- Triangle 25: <5, 13, 11>
- Triangle 26: <13, 11, 2>
- Triangle 27: <5, 6, 10>
- Triangle 28: <9, 12, 7>
- Triangle 29: <9, 12, 6>
- Triangle 30: <9, 12, 2>
