Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 0) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: {(5, 13), (9, 4), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 12), (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 10), (1, 0), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 14), (3, 2), (3, 12), (8, 13), (8, 14), (8, 10), (8, 0), (8, 6), (8, 12), (13, 5), (13, 8), (13, 2), (13, 10), (13, 14), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 2), (11, 7), (11, 0), (11, 12), (11, 4), (4, 9), (4, 11), (4, 12), (4, 0), (12, 9), (12, 3), (12, 8), (12, 11), (12, 4), (0, 1), (0, 8), (0, 11), (0, 4), (0, 10), (10, 1), (10, 8), (10, 13), (10, 0), (7, 9), (7, 3), (7, 11), (14, 3), (14, 8), (14, 13), (2, 3), (2, 13), (2, 6)}

Now, let's arrange the vertices in ascending order based on their degree:
Nodes degree: [(5, 1), (7, 2), (14, 2), (6, 3), (2, 3), (10, 3), (0, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (11, 4), (12, 5), (9, 5), (13, 5), (1, 6), (3, 6), (8, 6)]

By using the Degree-Based Ordering method (proceeding only when the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections), the total number of triangles found in the graph is: [36]

Unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 10>
<0, 3, 12>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 4, 11>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 12>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 9, 12>
<1, 10, 13>
<2, 3, 13>
<2, 6, 13>
<3, 7, 11>
<3, 8, 12>
<3, 12, 14>
<4, 9, 12>
<4, 11, 12>
<6, 8, 13>
<8, 10, 13>
