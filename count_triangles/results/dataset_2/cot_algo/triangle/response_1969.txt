Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 18) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 19) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 17) (6, 5) (6, 16) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 10) (14, 8) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 8) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 11) (15, 19) (15, 8) (8, 14) (8, 18) (8, 15) (8, 19) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 13) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 13) (2, 3) (2, 19) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 16) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 19. Based on the given edges and using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we first sort the nodes by their number of connections:

Nodes sorted by the number of connections:
(2 connections) 5, 6, 9
(3 connections) 1, 7, 12, 16, 17, 18
(4 connections) 0, 3, 4, 8, 10, 11, 13, 19
(5 connections) 14
(6 connections) 15

Now, we examine each edge to count the triangles formed using the lower labeled node when both nodes have different degrees:

1. Triangle <1, 3, 17>
2. Triangle <1, 3, 19>
3. Triangle <1, 12, 0>
4. Triangle <1, 17, 11>
5. Triangle <1, 17, 4>
6. Triangle <3, 19, 15>
7. Triangle <3, 19, 13>
8. Triangle <3, 19, 8>
9. Triangle <3, 13, 16>
10. Triangle <7, 4, 17>
11. Triangle <7, 4, 16>
12. Triangle <12, 0, 5>
13. Triangle <12, 0, 6>
14. Triangle <12, 16, 13>
15. Triangle <16, 13, 18>
16. Triangle <16, 13, 19>

Total number of triangles: [16]
