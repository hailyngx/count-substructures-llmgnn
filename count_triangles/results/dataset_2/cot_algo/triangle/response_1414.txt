Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 10) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 18) (1, 29) (1, 7) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 22) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 23) (10, 14) (10, 11) (10, 24) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 5) (11, 6) (26, 6) (29, 1) (28, 3) (28, 11) (28, 12) (28, 2) (24, 10) (24, 0) (24, 7) (2, 17) (2, 28) (2, 22) (2, 27) (2, 16) (22, 8) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (25, 27) (27, 2) (27, 25) (27, 21) (27, 23) (4, 22) (4, 12) (12, 28) (12, 22) (12, 4) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 9) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 23) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 19) (0, 18) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 15) (7, 9) (21, 27) (21, 9) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 2) (20, 14) (20, 9) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 21) (9, 20) (6, 11) (6, 26) (18, 17) (18, 0) (23, 14) (23, 13) (23, 27) (23, 19) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with 30 nodes and 90 edges based on the provided information. Here is the graph with the nodes and edges:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}
- Edges: {(14, 23), (14, 20), (14, 10), (17, 16), (17, 2), (17, 18), (1, 29), (1, 7), (3, 28), (3, 0), (3, 7), (3, 5), (8, 13), (8, 22), (13, 8), (13, 19), (13, 23), (10, 14), (10, 11), (10, 24), (10, 16), (11, 10), (11, 28), (11, 5), (11, 6), (26, 6), (29, 1), (28, 3), (...}

Next, let's label the nodes based on their degree from least to most connections:

Degree 0: {25, 26}
Degree 1: {17, 21}
Degree 2: {16, 18, 20, 24, 27, 29}
Degree 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 15}
Degree 4: {2, 8, 19}
Degree 5: {10, 22, 23, 28}
Degree 6: {3, 13, 14}

After labeling the nodes, we can count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method. Counting the triangles reveals the output:

[Total number of triangles: 81]
<0, 3, 19>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 24>, <0, 18, 17>, <0, 18, 19>, <0, 23, 19>, <1, 7, 15>, <2, 16, 17>, <2, 16, 10>, <2, 16, 27>, <2, 18, 17>, <2, 18, 0>, <2, 19, 18>, <2, 19, 23>, <2, 22, 12>, <3, 7, 15>, <3, 7, 24>, <3, 28, 11>, <3, 28, 12>, <3, 28...
