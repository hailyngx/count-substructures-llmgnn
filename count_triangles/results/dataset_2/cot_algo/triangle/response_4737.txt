Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 13) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 4) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 13) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 2) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 3) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by the number of connections are: 

1. 5 (degree: 2)
2. 4 (degree: 3)
3. 6 (degree: 3)
4. 7 (degree: 4)
5. 0 (degree: 4)
6. 10 (degree: 4)
7. 11 (degree: 6)
8. 12 (degree: 6)
9. 14 (degree: 6)
10. 3 (degree: 3)
11. 1 (degree: 3)
12. 2 (degree: 5)
13. 8 (degree: 5)
14. 9 (degree: 5)
15. 13 (degree: 4)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
1. Looking at the edges, 6 is connected to 3 and 2, and 3 is connected to 0 and 13. This forms a triangle <6, 3, 0>.
2. Next, we have 6 connected to 11, and 11 connected to 4 and 14. This forms another triangle <6, 11, 4>.
3. Then, we have 4 connected to 11, and 11 connected to 8 and 1. This forms another triangle <4, 11, 1>.
4. Continuing, we can observe the triangle <7, 10, 5> because 7 is connected to 10 and 8, and 10 is connected to 5.
5. Next, we find the triangle <7, 12, 9> because 7 is connected to 10 and 8, and 10 is connected to 7.
6. Moving forward, we identify the triangle <12, 0, 13> because 12 is connected to 8 and 9, and 9 is connected to 14.
7. Lastly, we notice the triangle <12, 7, 8> because 12 is connected to 0 and 13, and 13 is connected to 3 and 14.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
