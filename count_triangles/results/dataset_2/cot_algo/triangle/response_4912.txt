Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 17) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 15) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 2) (15, 14) (15, 3) (15, 12) (13, 5) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 19) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 12) (12, 15) (12, 19) (16, 4) (16, 6) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 19) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 0) (6, 10) (6, 16) (0, 5) (0, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (7, 5) (7, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we should first sort the vertices by their degrees. The vertices are labelled as follows:

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 10: 3 connections
Vertex 11: 3 connections
Vertex 12: 2 connections
Vertex 13: 2 connections
Vertex 14: 3 connections
Vertex 15: 3 connections
Vertex 16: 2 connections
Vertex 17: 3 connections
Vertex 18: 3 connections
Vertex 19: 4 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed:

- Edge (5, 9): Forms triangle with vertex 7
- Edge (5, 13): No triangles formed
- Edge (5, 0): No triangles formed
- Edge (5, 7): No triangles formed
- Edge (9, 5): Forms triangle with vertex 7
- Edge (9, 18): No triangles formed
- Edge (9, 17): Forms triangle with vertices 2 and 19
- Edge (14, 11): No triangles formed
- Edge (14, 7): No triangles formed
- Edge (14, 15): No triangles formed
- Edge (17, 9): Forms triangle with vertex 2
- Edge (17, 19): Forms triangle with vertex 2
- Edge (17, 2): No triangles formed
- Edge (1, 3): Forms triangle with vertex 8
- Edge (1, 2): No triangles formed
- Edge (1, 10): Forms triangle with vertex 6
- Edge (1, 18): No triangles formed
- Edge (1, 8): No triangles formed
- Edge (3, 1): Forms triangle with vertex 8
- Edge (3, 15): Forms triangle with vertex 12
- Edge (3, 10): Forms triangle with vertex 6
- Edge (3, 8): No triangles formed
- Edge (10, 1): Forms triangle with vertex 6
- Edge (10, 3): Forms triangle with vertex 6
- Edge (10, 11): No triangles formed
- Edge (10, 6): No triangles formed
- Edge (11, 14): No triangles formed
- Edge (11, 10): No triangles formed
- Edge (11, 2): No triangles formed
- Edge (15, 14): No triangles formed
- Edge (15, 3): Forms triangle with vertex 12
- Edge (15, 12): No triangles formed
- Edge (13, 5): No triangles formed
- Edge (18, 9): No triangles formed
- Edge (18, 1): No triangles formed
- Edge (18, 19): Forms triangle with vertex 2
- Edge (19, 17): Forms triangle with vertex 2
- Edge (19, 18): Forms triangle with vertex 2
- Edge (19, 2): No triangles formed
- Edge (19, 4): No triangles formed
- Edge (19, 12): No triangles formed
- Edge (12, 15): No triangles formed
- Edge (12, 19): No triangles formed
- Edge (16, 4): No triangles formed
- Edge (16, 6): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 17): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 1): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 11): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 19): Forms triangle with vertex 18
- Edge (4, 19): No triangles formed
- Edge (4, 16): No triangles formed
- Edge (4, 0): No triangles formed
- Edge (6, 10): No triangles formed
- Edge (6, 16): No triangles formed
- Edge (0, 5): No triangles formed
- Edge (0, 4): No triangles formed
- Edge (8, 1): No triangles formed
- Edge (8, 3): No triangles formed
- Edge (7, 5): No triangles formed
- Edge (7, 14): No triangles formed

With this analysis, we can see that the total number of triangles in the graph is 9. 

Therefore, the output is: [9]
And the unique triangles found are: <2, 17, 19>, <5, 7, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 10>, <3, 10, 6>, <2, 17, 19>, <2, 18, 19>, <15, 3, 12>, <5, 7, 9>.
