Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps us efficiently count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Let's label the vertices based on their degree in increasing order:
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections

Now, we will consider each edge, making sure we only count triangles where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

The triangles formed by the edges are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
