Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 18) (4, 19) (18, 3) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 12) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 10) (8, 19) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 15) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 10) (6, 16) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 12) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 17) (15, 19) (15, 8) (14, 5) (14, 8) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 12) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. 

The nodes sorted by degree are: 
```
Node 4: Degree 1
Node 18: Degree 2
Node 15: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 12: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 16: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 17: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 19: Degree 6
Node 11: Degree 6
```

Now, we will check the edges according to the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Starting with edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:

Edge (11, 16) - Both nodes have the same degree of 6.
Edge (11, 9) - Both nodes have the same degree of 6.
Edge (11, 17) - Both nodes have the same degree of 6.
Edge (16, 17) - Node 16 (Degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 17 (Degree 5). Checking for shared connections:

Shared connections of Node 16 and Node 17: Node 6
Triangle found: <16, 17, 6>

Edge (16, 6) - Node 16 (Degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 6 (Degree 3). Checking for shared connections:

Shared connections of Node 16 and Node 6: None

Edge (1, 3) - Both nodes have the same degree of 5.
Edge (1, 7) - Node 1 (Degree 2) has fewer connections than Node 7 (Degree 5). Checking for shared connections:

Shared connections of Node 1 and Node 7: Node 0
Triangle found: <1, 7, 0>

... (continue checking remaining edges) ...

After checking all edges, the total number of triangles in the graph is [45]. 

Unique triangles found:
