Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 10) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 12) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 4) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Then we relabel the vertices accordingly. 

Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
1. 5 (degree 5)
2. 14 (degree 5)
3. 12 (degree 5)
4. 4 (degree 5)
5. 10 (degree 5)
6. 13 (degree 4)
7. 8 (degree 4)
8. 2 (degree 4)
9. 0 (degree 4)
10. 1 (degree 4)
11. 6 (degree 2)
12. 9 (degree 3)
13. 11 (degree 4)
14. 7 (degree 3)
15. 3 (degree 2)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed.

Triangles formed:
1. <0, 14, 4>
2. <2, 12, 4>
3. <2, 10, 4>
4. <2, 12, 10>
5. <2, 10, 1>
6. <7, 8, 10>
7. <7, 10, 1>
8. <0, 14, 1>
9. <0, 4, 11>
10. <0, 1, 11>

Total number of triangles: [10]
