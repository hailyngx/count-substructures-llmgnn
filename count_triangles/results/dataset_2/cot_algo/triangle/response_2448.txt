Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 17) (10, 12) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 15) (17, 10) (17, 3) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 7) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 6) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 6) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 3) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 4) (0, 4) (0, 18) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 2) (6, 18) (6, 13) (6, 19) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 16) (7, 18) (7, 13) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 16) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 16) (16, 2) (16, 15) (16, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. 
After relabeling the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels would be:
0: 3 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 6 connections
4: 6 connections
5: 1 connection
6: 4 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 3 connections
9: 4 connections
10: 2 connections
11: 4 connections
12: 5 connections
13: 4 connections
14: 3 connections
15: 3 connections
16: 3 connections
17: 2 connections
18: 4 connections
19: 4 connections

Now, counting the triangles with the given edges, we find the following triangles: 
<0, 4, 12>
<1, 2, 13>
<1, 11, 19>
<1, 13, 6>
<2, 4, 12>
<2, 9, 14>
<3, 8, 15>
<4, 12, 10>
<4, 12, 18>
<6, 13, 18>
<8, 15, 16>
<9, 12, 10>
<9, 12, 14>
<11, 15, 16>
<13, 6, 19>
<14, 9, 19>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
