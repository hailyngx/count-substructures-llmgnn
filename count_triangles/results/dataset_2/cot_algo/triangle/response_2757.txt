Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) 

Response:
The given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows:
```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
(6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) 
(9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1)
(4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2)
(8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
(5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) 
(0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3)
(2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) 
(1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) 
(3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) 
(7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) 
```

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5

Using Degree-Based Ordering, we proceed with the edges in a way that only the node with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. (2, 4) - Forms a triangle <2, 4, 0>
2. (2, 0) - Also forms a triangle <2, 0, 3>
3. (2, 7) - Forms a triangle <2, 7, 6>
4. (1, 6) - Forms a triangle <1, 6, 9>
5. (1, 9) - Also forms a triangle <1, 9, 4>
6. (1, 4) - Forms a triangle <1, 4, 0>
7. (3, 9) - Forms a triangle <3, 9, 4>
8. (3, 5) - Also forms a triangle <3, 5, 0>
9. (3, 0) - Also forms a triangle <3, 0, 4>
10. (3, 7) - Forms a triangle <3, 7, 6>
11. (7, 6) - Also forms a triangle <7, 6, 9>
12. (7, 8) - Forms a triangle <7, 8, 9>
13. (7, 2) - Forms a triangle <7, 2, 4>

Total number of triangles: [13]
