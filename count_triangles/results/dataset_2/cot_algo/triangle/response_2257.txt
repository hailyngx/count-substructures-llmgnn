Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 8) (15, 25) (15, 17) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 14) (21, 23) (28, 12) (28, 18) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 19) (22, 14) (22, 7) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 4) (9, 22) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 27) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 24) (4, 26) (4, 27) (27, 1) (27, 4) (27, 25) (8, 15) (8, 10) (25, 15) (25, 17) (25, 27) (25, 19) (25, 29) (19, 22) (19, 25) (19, 14) (19, 12) (10, 26) (10, 8) (12, 28) (12, 19) (12, 13) (12, 6) (16, 24) (16, 6) (24, 17) (24, 16) (24, 18) (24, 29) (2, 23) (14, 20) (14, 22) (14, 19) (14, 23) (7, 20) (7, 22) (7, 1) (0, 11) (0, 29) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 11) (18, 28) (18, 24) (18, 6) (6, 12) (6, 16) (6, 18) (23, 21) (23, 2) (23, 14) (23, 29) (11, 26) (11, 0) (11, 13) (3, 5) (3, 29) (29, 25) (29, 24) (29, 0) (29, 23) (29, 3) (5, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in efficiently counting triangles in a graph. 

After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new node labels become:
Node 0: degree 1
Node 2: degree 1
Node 5: degree 1
Node 9: degree 1
Node 8: degree 2
Node 16: degree 2
Node 21: degree 2
Node 28: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 11: degree 3
Node 19: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 18: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 20: degree 4
Node 22: degree 5
Node 7: degree 5
Node 24: degree 5
Node 12: degree 5
Node 17: degree 5
Node 26: degree 5
Node 27: degree 5
Node 15: degree 6
Node 23: degree 6
Node 25: degree 6
Node 29: degree 6

Now, let's count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 13]

Unique triangles: 
<6, 12, 13>
<9, 19, 22>
<9, 19, 14>
<9, 19, 12>
<4, 6, 16>
<7, 14, 22>
<7, 1, 14>
<7, 1, 17>
<18, 24, 29>
<18, 24, 16>
<18, 6, 24>
<18, 6, 16>
<18, 6, 12>
