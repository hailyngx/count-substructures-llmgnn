Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 4) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) 

Response:
The degrees of each node are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 5
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4

In Degree-Based Ordering, the nodes are relabeled as follows:
- Node 3 -> 0
- Node 8 -> 1
- Node 9 -> 2
- Node 13 -> 3
- Node 14 -> 4
- Node 2 -> 5
- Node 12 -> 6
- Node 4 -> 7
- Node 6 -> 8
- Node 11 -> 9
- Node 0 -> 10
- Node 7 -> 11
- Node 1 -> 12
- Node 5 -> 13
- Node 10 -> 14

Now, considering the edges based on the relabeled nodes with lower degree nodes coming first:
(3, 13) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 12) (8, 11) (8, 13) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (13, 12) (2, 1) (12, 13) (4, 6)

Count of triangles = 3
Unique triangles found: <3, 1, 7> <4, 1, 13> <2, 1, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
