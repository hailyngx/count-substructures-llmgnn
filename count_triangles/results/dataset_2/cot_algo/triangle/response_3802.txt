Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- 0: (9, 0), (4, 0), (8, 0)
- 1: (5, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (8, 1)
- 2: (5, 2), (6, 2), (3, 2)
- 3: (1, 3), (7, 3), (4, 3), (8, 3), (2, 3)
- 4: (1, 4), (3, 4), (7, 4), (0, 4)
- 5: (9, 5), (6, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (7, 5)
- 6: (5, 6), (7, 6), (2, 6), (8, 6)
- 7: (5, 7), (6, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (8, 7)
- 8: (6, 8), (1, 8), (3, 8), (7, 8), (0, 8)
- 9: (5, 9), (9, 0)


Now, we reorder the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes in increasing order of degree: 0, 2, 9, 8, 4, 6, 5, 7, 1, 3
