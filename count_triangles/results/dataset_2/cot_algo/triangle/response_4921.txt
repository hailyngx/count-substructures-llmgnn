Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: (6, 3)
- 1: (9, 8, 2)
- 2: (4, 7, 6, 8, 1)
- 3: (5, 9, 4, 7, 8, 0)
- 4: (7, 8, 3, 2)
- 5: (9, 6, 3)
- 6: (5, 9, 7, 2, 0)
- 7: (4, 3, 6, 2)
- 8: (4, 2, 3, 1)
- 9: (5, 6, 3, 1)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using Degree-Based Ordering:

Degree of each node:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 4
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 4

Now, we sort the nodes by their degrees:
Nodes in ascending order of degrees: 0, 5, 1, 7, 8, 9, 4, 6, 2, 3

Counting the triangles:
- Total number of triangles is [13]
- Unique triangles found: 
<0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 8, 9>
