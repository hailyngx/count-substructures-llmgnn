Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degrees. After relabeling the nodes according to their degrees, we can identify the triangles in the graph.

Nodes:  
0 (degree 4)  
1 (degree 6)  
2 (degree 3)  
3 (degree 5)  
4 (degree 5)  
5 (degree 2)  
6 (degree 5)  
7 (degree 4)  
8 (degree 3)  
9 (degree 5)

Edges:  
(5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4)

Triangles:  
<3, 5, 8>  
<3, 1, 4>  
<3, 6, 4>  
<1, 4, 9>  
<1, 0, 4>  

Total number of triangles: [5]
