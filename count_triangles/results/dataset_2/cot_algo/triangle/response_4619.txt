Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 9) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 7) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (4, 15) (4, 3) (18, 9) (18, 1) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 9) (8, 5) (8, 1) (19, 3) (19, 6) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 13) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 10) (10, 13) (10, 6) (1, 12) (1, 18) (1, 8) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 13) 

Response:
The vertices sorted based on their degree are: 

0 (degree 2)
2 (degree 2)
4 (degree 2)
8 (degree 2)
18 (degree 2)
19 (degree 2)
5 (degree 3)
10 (degree 3)
14 (degree 3)
1 (degree 4)
16 (degree 4)
17 (degree 4)
9 (degree 4)
12 (degree 4)
13 (degree 4)
3 (degree 5)
7 (degree 5)
6 (degree 5)
11 (degree 5)
15 (degree 4)

Based on the rule of choosing the edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will consider the edges in the following order:

1. (2, 0)
2. (0, 12)
3. (4, 15)
4. (8, 1)
5. (18, 1)
6. (19, 3)
7. (10, 13)
8. (14, 17)
9. (8, 5)
10. (13, 10)
11. (16, 3)
12. (17, 13)
13. (9, 13)
14. (12, 6)
15. (7, 3)
16. (6, 10)
17. (6, 12)
18. (7, 12)
19. (6, 7)
20. (15, 4)
21. (11, 6)
22. (7, 11)
23. (16, 9)
24. (11, 15)
25. (17, 7)
26. (9, 18)
27. (3, 4)
28. (3, 5)
29. (15, 13)

Within these edges, the triangles are:
<0, 2, 12>
<2, 0, 12>
<4, 15, 11>
<8, 1, 12>
<18, 1, 12>
<19, 3, 16>
<10, 13, 15>
<14, 17, 13>
<8, 5, 3>
<13, 10, 6>
<13, 10, 6>
<16, 3, 7>
<17, 13, 9>
<17, 13, 9>
<9, 13, 12>
<12, 6, 7>
<12, 6, 7>
<7, 3, 4>
<6, 10, 13>
<6, 10, 13>
<6, 12, 7>
<7, 12, 0>
<6, 7, 11>
<4, 15, 13>
<11, 6, 7>
<11, 6, 7>
<7, 11, 16>
<16, 9, 18>
<11, 15, 4>
<17, 7, 12>
<9, 18, 1>
<3, 4, 15>
<3, 5, 8>
<13, 15, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [33].
