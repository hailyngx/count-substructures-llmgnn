Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 13) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 11) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (12, 5) (11, 7) (11, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 10) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges:
- 0: 3, 5, 9, 14
- 1: 2, 6, 7
- 2: 1, 5, 7
- 3: 0, 8, 13
- 4: 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14
- 5: 0, 2, 10, 12, 14
- 6: 1, 4, 8, 10, 14
- 7: 1, 2, 4, 8, 11, 13
- 8: 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
- 9: 0, 8, 11
- 10: 4, 5, 6, 13
- 11: 7, 9
- 12: 5
- 13: 3, 4, 7, 10, 14
- 14: 0, 4, 5, 6, 13

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections, we have the following unique triangles: 
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <0, 5, 14>
- <0, 9, 11>
- <1, 2, 7>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <4, 6, 10>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <4, 13, 14>
- <5, 6, 10>
- <5, 10, 13>
- <6, 10, 13>
- <7, 8, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
