Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 12) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly. 

The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 
Vertex 12 (Degree 3)
Vertex 10 (Degree 3)
Vertex 13 (Degree 3)
Vertex 5 (Degree 4)
Vertex 6 (Degree 4)
Vertex 14 (Degree 4)
Vertex 0 (Degree 5)
Vertex 1 (Degree 5)
Vertex 8 (Degree 5)
Vertex 3 (Degree 5)
Vertex 9 (Degree 5)
Vertex 2 (Degree 6)
Vertex 7 (Degree 6)
Vertex 11 (Degree 6)
Vertex 4 (Degree 6)

Now, we will check each edge using the given rule that involves only considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Counting the triangles based on the provided edges: 
Total number of triangles: [20]
