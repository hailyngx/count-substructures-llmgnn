Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. The sorted list along with their degrees is as follows:

Vertex 4 - Degree 4
Vertex 7 - Degree 5
Vertex 6 - Degree 4
Vertex 9 - Degree 5
Vertex 1 - Degree 4
Vertex 3 - Degree 5
Vertex 8 - Degree 3
Vertex 5 - Degree 2
Vertex 0 - Degree 4
Vertex 2 - Degree 4

Considering the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections, we can calculate and count the triangles formed. 

[The total number of triangles is 8]

Unique triangles found:
<4, 0, 6>
<4, 0, 2>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 2, 9>
<7, 0, 1>
<7, 0, 6>
<7, 6, 9>
<3, 1, 9>
