Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 2) (14, 4) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their number of connections. Then, for each edge, we only consider those where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Here is the list of nodes sorted by their degree:
0: 5 connections
6: 5 connections
11: 5 connections
13: 5 connections
1: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 4 connections
2: 3 connections
4: 3 connections
10: 3 connections
12: 3 connections
7: 2 connections
14: 2 connections

Now, let's count the triangles:
- For node 0 (5 connections): No triangles can be formed.
- For node 6, 11, 13 (5 connections each): No triangles can be formed.
- For node 1, 3, 8, 9 (4 connections each):
  - (1, 9, 3) form a triangle: <1, 3, 9>.
- For node 2, 4, 10, 12 (3 connections each): 
  - (2, 4, 6) form a triangle: <2, 4, 6>.
- For node 7, 14 (2 connections each): No triangles can be formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <1, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 6>
