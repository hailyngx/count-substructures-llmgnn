Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 14) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 13) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
The graph for the given data is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
- (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 3)
- (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 10), (9, 13)
- (6, 9), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 12), (6, 4), (6, 13)
- (10, 9), (10, 12), (10, 7), (10, 13)
- (11, 14), (11, 8), (11, 4), (11, 2)
- (7, 10), (7, 12), (7, 1), (7, 8)
- (12, 6), (12, 10), (12, 7), (12, 0)
- (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 11), (2, 8), (2, 14)
- (8, 11), (8, 7), (8, 2), (8, 14)
- (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 11), (4, 14)
- (14, 11), (14, 2), (14, 8), (14, 4)
- (3, 5), (3, 6)
- (0, 5), (0, 12), (0, 13)
- (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 13)
- (13, 9), (13, 6), (13, 10), (13, 0), (13, 1)

To count the number of triangles, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Sorted vertices by degree (number of connections):
0(3) < 1(3) < 3(3) < 7(4) < 12(4) < 8(4) < 14(4) < 5(4) < 11(4) < 9(4) < 10(4) < 6(6) < 4(6) < 2(5) < 13(5)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we will only check edges where the vertex with the smaller label has fewer connections.

The triangles in the graph are:

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 12>
<0, 6, 12>
<1, 7, 10>
<1, 7, 13>
<1, 8, 14>
<2, 6, 13>
<2, 8, 14>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 13>
<4, 8, 14>
<5, 7, 13>
<6, 9, 13>
<6, 10, 13>
<6, 12, 13>
<6, 12, 10>
<9, 10, 13>
