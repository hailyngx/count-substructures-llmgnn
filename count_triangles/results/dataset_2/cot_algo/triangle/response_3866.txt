Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 5), (7, 6), (7, 9), (7, 5), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 9), (3, 0), (3, 6), (3, 9), (8, 2), (8, 9), (8, 5), (5, 1), (5, 8), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 0), (0, 2), (9, 1), (9, 3)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their degree (number of connections) from least to most as follows:
Vertices: 0, 2, 1, 8, 3, 6, 9, 7, 5, 4

Next, we will find triangles based on the sorted vertices and the given edges:
Shared connections between vertices for triangles:
- For vertex 0: (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 6)
- For vertex 2: (2, 8), (2, 0), (2, 9)
- For vertex 1: (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 9)
- For vertex 8: (8, 2), (8, 9), (8, 5)
- For vertex 3: (3, 0), (3, 6), (3, 9)
- For vertex 6: (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 0), (6, 5)
- For vertex 9: (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 8), (9, 2)
- For vertex 7: (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9), (7, 5)
- For vertex 5: (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 1), (5, 8), (5, 6)
- For vertex 4: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 5)

Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 6, 5>, <2, 8, 9>, <2, 0, 3>, <1, 6, 5>, <8, 2, 9>, <3, 6, 0>, <6, 7, 5>, <6, 3, 0>, <9, 4, 7>, <9, 4, 1>, <9, 4, 3>, <9, 4, 8>, <9, 7, 5>, <9, 7, 8>, <9, 1, 5>, <9, 1, 8>, <7, 4, 8>, <7, 4, 5>, <7, 6, 5>, <5, 4, 8>, <5, 7, 8>
