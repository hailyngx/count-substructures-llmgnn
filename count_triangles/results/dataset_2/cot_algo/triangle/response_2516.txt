Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
The degrees of each node are as follows:
Node 0: 5
Node 1: 5
Node 2: 5
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 4
Node 5: 6
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 2
Node 8: 3
Node 9: 3

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will sort the nodes in ascending order of their degrees:
Nodes in order: 7, 8, 9, 6, 3, 4, 2, 0, 1, 5

Now, we will count triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method by only considering edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

There are 9 triangles in total:

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 8>
