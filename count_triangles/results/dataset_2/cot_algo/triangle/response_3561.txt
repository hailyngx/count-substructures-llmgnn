Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will involve sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections). The given graph's nodes and their degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4

We will now label the nodes in increasing order of degrees as follows:
- Node 0 -> Node 5
- Node 1 -> Node 9
- Node 2 -> Node 6
- Node 3 -> Node 2
- Node 4 -> Node 3
- Node 5 -> Node 0
- Node 6 -> Node 8
- Node 7 -> Node 7
- Node 8 -> Node 1
- Node 9 -> Node 4

Now, we will proceed with counting the triangles based on the given steps. After examining the edges and counting the triangles, the total number of triangles is found to be [12]. The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 6, 7>, <4, 5, 9>, and <4, 8, 9>.
