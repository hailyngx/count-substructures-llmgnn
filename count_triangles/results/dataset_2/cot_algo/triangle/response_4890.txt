Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes and edges are as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 0)
- (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 3)
- (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 0)
- (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 2)
- (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 1)
- (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 1)
- (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 0)
- (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 2), (1, 0)
- (3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 2)
- (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 2), (0, 1)

Now, we will apply Degree-Based Ordering to count the number of triangles. The vertices are relabeled based on their number of connections:

Nodes sorted by degree: 4, 7, 3, 6, 0, 5, 8, 1, 2, 9

Triangles found: 
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 1>
<2, 4, 3>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 8>
<6, 1, 5>
<6, 1, 0>
<6, 5, 0>
<9, 5, 0>
<9, 5, 1>

Total number of triangles: [15]
