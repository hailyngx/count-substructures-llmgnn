Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 5, 9, 7, 6, 2, 4, 0, 3, 1, 8.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method with the edges given, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <1, 3, 8>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 4, 0>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <3, 1, 8>
- <3, 1, 6>
- <4, 6, 1>
- <4, 6, 0>
- <6, 5, 2>

There are a total of [12] triangles in the given graph.
