Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 10) (7, 8) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 0) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 11) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 11) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 12) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 12), (0, 14), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 13), (2, 5), (2, 11), (2, 13), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (4, 7), (4, 10), (5, 7), (5, 11), (5, 14), (6, 3), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 8), (7, 14), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 13), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 10), (9, 1), (10, 3), (10, 4), (10, 9), (10, 12), (11, 2), (11, 5), (11, 12), (11, 13), (12, 0), (12, 10), (12, 11), (13, 1), (13, 2), (13, 8), (13, 11), (13, 14), (14, 0), (14, 5), (14, 7), (14, 13)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes by degree: {2, 6, 4, 12, 14, 9, 10, 11, 0, 5, 7, 1, 13, 8, 3}

Using the degree-based ordering method, we can count the number of triangles. 

There are [11] triangles in the graph:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 14>, <0, 12, 10>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 10>, <1, 4, 10>, <1, 8, 13>, <3, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 14>, <11, 12, 13>
