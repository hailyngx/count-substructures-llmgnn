Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 2) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 0) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
- Sort nodes by their degree in ascending order:  
0(3), 4(2), 6(2), 8(3), 13(3), 3(4), 7(6), 5(3), 10(4), 12(4), 2(4), 9(6), 11(6), 1(7), 14(7)

Based on the sorting, let's relabel the nodes with new numbers:
0(0), 4(1), 6(2), 8(3), 13(4), 3(5), 7(6), 5(7), 10(8), 12(9), 2(10), 9(11), 11(12), 1(13), 14(14)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:  
[11]  
<7, 9, 11>  
<9, 12, 14>  
<1, 4, 13>  
<1, 6, 13>  
<3, 5, 7>  
<1, 8, 13>  
<0, 3, 5>  
<7, 10, 12>  
<4, 13, 14>  
<0, 1, 8>  
<3, 7, 13>
