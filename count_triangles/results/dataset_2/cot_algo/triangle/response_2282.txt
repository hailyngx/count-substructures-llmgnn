Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 20) (15, 8) (15, 5) (5, 15) (5, 28) (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (6, 16) (10, 0) (10, 23) (10, 28) (22, 7) (23, 10) (23, 26) (23, 1) (23, 27) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 13) (27, 23) (27, 12) (27, 16) (27, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 25) (18, 26) (18, 16) (18, 29) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 19) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 24) (7, 14) (21, 7) (21, 26) (26, 23) (26, 18) (26, 21) (26, 17) (29, 9) (29, 18) (29, 19) (29, 0) (8, 15) (8, 27) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 2) (19, 20) (19, 29) (19, 8) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 29) (0, 13) (17, 3) (17, 26) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 24) (1, 9) (1, 23) (1, 20) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 4) (24, 7) (24, 13) (28, 5) (28, 10) (28, 25) (25, 2) (25, 28) (16, 6) (16, 27) (16, 18) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Nodes with 1 connection: 11, 15, 17, 22, 24
Nodes with 2 connections: 7, 13
Nodes with 3 connections: 5, 11, 14, 20, 21
Nodes with 4 connections: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9
Nodes with 5 connections: 10, 12
Nodes with 6 connections: 6, 28
Nodes with 7 connections: 23, 26, 27
Nodes with 8 connections: 2, 19
Nodes with 9 connections: 29
Nodes with 10 connections: 16
Nodes with 11 connections: 3
Nodes with 12 connections: 25
Nodes with 14 connections: 18
