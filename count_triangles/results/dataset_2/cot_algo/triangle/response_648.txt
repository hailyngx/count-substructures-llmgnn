Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 19) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 16) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 15) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 2) (3, 0) (3, 16) (15, 17) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 19) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 4) (4, 8) (4, 13) (1, 17) (1, 12) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 16) (18, 6) (18, 19) (0, 5) (0, 17) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 12) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 0) (16, 6) (16, 3) (16, 19) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 19) (7, 6) (7, 10) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 20 nodes and the given 60 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: (5, 13), (5, 0), (9, 6), (9, 19), (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 18), (6, 16), (14, 17), (14, 11), (14, 2), (17, 14), (17, 1), (17, 0), (17, 12), (17, 15), (10, 11), (10, 0), (10, 7), (11, 14), (11, 10), (11, 8), (11, 2), (3, 0), (3, 16), (15, 17), (8, 11), (8, 4), (8, 19), (13, 5), (13, 12), (13, 4), (4, 8), (4, 13), (1, 17), (1, 12), (19, 9), (19, 8), (19, 18), (19, 2), (19, 16), (18, 6), (18, 19), (0, 5), (0, 17), (0, 10), (0, 3), (0, 12), (12, 17), (12, 13), (12, 1), (12, 0), (16, 6), (16, 3), (16, 19), (2, 14), (2, 11), (2, 19), (7, 6), (7, 10)

Next, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering to count the triangles:

Sorted vertices by degree:
Node 5: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 15: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 8: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 18: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 12: degree 4
Node 17: degree 5
Node 10: degree 5
Node 16: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 6: degree 5
Node 2: degree 4
Node 0: degree 6
Node 11: degree 5
Node 19: degree 5
