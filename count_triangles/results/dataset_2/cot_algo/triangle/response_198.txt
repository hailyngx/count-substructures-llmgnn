Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 1) (11, 19) (11, 5) (17, 10) (17, 19) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 4) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 15) (5, 11) (5, 16) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 16) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 12) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 15) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 15) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 5) (16, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. 

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the labels of the vertices are as follows:
Vertices: (0< ->5), (12 ->6), (9 ->7), (17 ->8), (11 ->9), (5 ->10), (6 ->11), (10 ->12), (7 ->13), (19 ->14), (18 ->15), (2 ->16), (14 ->17), (15 ->18), (13 ->19), (1 ->20), (3 ->21), (8 ->22), (16 ->23), (4 ->24).

Now, we can count the triangles:
Triangles: [8]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 6, 12>
<1, 6, 13>
<1, 10, 12>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 13, 15>
<12, 13, 15>
<15, 17, 19>
<16, 17, 19>
