Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 13) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 2) (0, 3) (0, 10) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the graph is as follows:

1. Sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 13: degree 6
Node 11: degree 6
Node 8: degree 4
Node 4: degree 5
Node 9: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 14: degree 5
Node 3: degree 4

2. Relabel the nodes in increasing order of degree:
0, 1, 5, 7, 12, 2, 10, 8, 6, 9, 14, 4, 11, 3, 13

3. Count the triangles:
- From the given edges, only consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.
- After checking for shared connections, count the total number of triangles.

Based on this method, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [42]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 13>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 13>, <1, 3, 13>, <5, 10, 12>, <5, 10, 2>, <5, 10, 0>, <5, 10, 7>, <5, 2, 12>, <5, 2, 10>, <5, 2, 0>, <5, 2, 7>, <5, 12, 10>, <5, 12, 0>, <5, 7, 10>, <5, 7, 2>, <12, 2, 10>, <12, 2, 0>, <12, 10, 0>, <12, 10, 7>, <2, 10, 0>, <2, 10, 7>, <2, 10, 14>, <2, 10, 11>, <2, 0, 7>, <2, 0, 10>, <2, 7, 10>, <2, 7, 11>, <2, 7, 4>, <2, 7, 11>, <10, 0, 7>, <10, 7, 2>, <10, 7, 11>, <10, 7, 4>, <8, 9, 6>, <8, 9, 14>, <8, 6, 14>, <6, 9, 14>, <9, 4, 13>, <9, 4, 8>, <9, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 11>.
