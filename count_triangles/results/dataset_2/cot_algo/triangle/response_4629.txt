Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
The given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 0), (9, 4), 
(9, 2), (9, 7), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 0), 
(3, 4), (3, 8), (4, 8), (8, 7), (0, 5)

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes and their degrees:
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections

Next, we proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method considering edges only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles in the graph: [10]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 3>
<1, 2, 4>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
