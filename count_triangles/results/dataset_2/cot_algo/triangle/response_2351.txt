Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 12) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 10) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 14 based on the given edges. 

1. Node 0 has 5 edges: (0, 10), (0, 3), (0, 11), (0, 8), (0, 1)
2. Node 1 has 4 edges: (1, 2), (1, 11), (1, 0)
3. Node 2 has 2 edges: (2, 1), (2, 10)
4. Node 3 has 4 edges: (3, 0), (3, 11), (3, 6), (3, 4)
5. Node 4 has 3 edges: (4, 14), (4, 3), (4, 6)
6. Node 5 has 5 edges: (5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 11), (5, 10), (5, 7)
7. Node 6 has 5 edges: (6, 14), (6, 8), (6, 3), (6, 11), (6, 4)
8. Node 7 has 4 edges: (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 14), (7, 10)
9. Node 8 has 3 edges: (8, 0), (8, 6), (8, 12)
10. Node 9 has 5 edges: (9, 5), (9, 11), (9, 10), (9, 7), (9, 12)
11. Node 10 has 5 edges: (10, 5), (10, 9), (10, 0), (10, 2), (10, 7)
12. Node 11 has 6 edges: (11, 5), (11, 9), (11, 0), (11, 3), (11, 1), (11, 6)
13. Node 12 has 3 edges: (12, 9), (12, 8), (12, 13)
14. Node 13 has 3 edges: (13, 5), (13, 14), (13, 12)
15. Node 14 has 4 edges: (14, 6), (14, 7), (14, 4), (14, 13)

Now, we will proceed to count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Since there are 60 edges, we need to consider each edge to identify triangles.

The total number of triangles is [10].

Sample unique triangles (not an exhaustive list) found in the graph are: 
<0, 1, 11>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 10, 11>
<3, 4, 6>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 10, 11>
<6, 7, 14>
<9, 10, 11>
<13, 14, 6>
