Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 22) (16, 2) (16, 19) (16, 6) (7, 21) (7, 26) (7, 5) (7, 17) (21, 7) (21, 12) (21, 25) (12, 21) (27, 14) (27, 9) (27, 13) (5, 7) (5, 18) (5, 22) (6, 16) (24, 22) (24, 2) (26, 7) (26, 8) (26, 4) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 20) (17, 25) (20, 17) (20, 8) (20, 4) (20, 10) (10, 20) (10, 9) (15, 9) (2, 16) (2, 24) (2, 22) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 24) (22, 2) (22, 0) (25, 21) (25, 17) (25, 29) (0, 22) (0, 3) (0, 23) (3, 0) (3, 23) (3, 29) (3, 18) (1, 28) (1, 4) (14, 27) (14, 19) (9, 11) (9, 27) (9, 10) (9, 15) (9, 23) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 28) (8, 26) (8, 20) (8, 29) (4, 26) (4, 20) (4, 1) (4, 13) (13, 27) (13, 4) (13, 29) (29, 25) (29, 3) (29, 8) (29, 13) (28, 1) (28, 18) (23, 0) (23, 3) (23, 9) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves ordering the vertices by their degrees (number of connections). Let's relabel the vertices in such a way that the vertex with fewer connections gets the lower label.

After relabeling the vertices, the new order from the least connected node to the most connected node is as follows: 

Node 4 (degree: 4)  
Node 1 (degree: 2)  
Node 3 (degree: 3)  
Node 13 (degree: 3)  
Node 28 (degree: 2)  
Node 8 (degree: 3)  
Node 18 (degree: 3)  
Node 10 (degree: 3)  
Node 20 (degree: 4)  
Node 14 (degree: 2)  
Node 27 (degree: 3)  
Node 26 (degree: 3)  
Node 5 (degree: 3)  
Node 19 (degree: 2)  
Node 15 (degree: 1)  
Node 7 (degree: 4)  
Node 6 (degree: 1)  
Node 21 (degree: 3)  
Node 12 (degree: 1)  
Node 25 (degree: 3)  
Node 24 (degree: 2)  
Node 22 (degree: 6)  
Node 0 (degree: 3)  
Node 29 (degree: 4)  
Node 9 (degree: 5)  
Node 11 (degree: 5)  
Node 17 (degree: 4)  
Node 16 (degree: 6)  
Node 2 (degree: 4)  
Node 23 (degree: 3)  

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the edges in the order of vertices based on the Degree-Based Ordering method.
