Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 13) (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (10, 18) (10, 1) (2, 12) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 17) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 18) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 18) (17, 2) (17, 1) (17, 3) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 13) (19, 4) (19, 0) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 15) (12, 9) (12, 2) (3, 5) (3, 17) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 13) (0, 8) (0, 15) (0, 19) (14, 2) (14, 18) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 1) (18, 14) (13, 16) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. After relabeling the vertices accordingly, the edges will then only be considered if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. By following this method and iterating through the edges to count the triangles, the total number of triangles in the provided graph would be [46].

The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<0, 15, 19>
<1, 6, 10>
<1, 6, 17>
<1, 10, 18>
<1, 15, 17>
<2, 12, 15>
<2, 12, 17>
<2, 12, 18>
<2, 15, 17>
<2, 14, 18>
<3, 5, 17>
<4, 11, 13>
<4, 11, 19>
<6, 7, 15>
<6, 9, 13>
<6, 9, 15>
<7, 13, 15>
<8, 10, 18>
<8, 11, 18>
<8, 15, 18>
<9, 12, 13>
<9, 12, 15>
<9, 13, 15>
<12, 13, 15>
