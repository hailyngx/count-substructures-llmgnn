Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (25, 26) (25, 29) (25, 18) (15, 20) (15, 21) (15, 16) (20, 15) (20, 24) (0, 19) (0, 13) (2, 7) (2, 21) (2, 4) (28, 29) (28, 12) (28, 18) (29, 25) (29, 28) (29, 4) (29, 24) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 17) (26, 25) (26, 22) (26, 17) (9, 3) (9, 22) (9, 21) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 2) (4, 29) (4, 5) (27, 1) (11, 23) (11, 14) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 16) (23, 10) (13, 0) (13, 9) (13, 17) (17, 22) (17, 26) (17, 13) (17, 7) (5, 4) (5, 23) (5, 7) (5, 14) (12, 28) (12, 21) (12, 18) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 16) (19, 0) (19, 22) (7, 2) (7, 17) (7, 5) (24, 20) (24, 29) (24, 8) (8, 24) (8, 1) (21, 15) (21, 2) (21, 9) (21, 12) (10, 23) (10, 1) (18, 25) (18, 28) (18, 12) (18, 14) (16, 15) (16, 22) (16, 23) (16, 14) (1, 9) (1, 27) (1, 8) (1, 10) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
(0, 19), (0, 13), (1, 27), (1, 8), (1, 10), (2, 7), (2, 21), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 29), (4, 5), (5, 23), (5, 7), (5, 14), (6, 19), (6, 13), (7, 17), (8, 24), (9, 22), (9, 13), (9, 21), (10, 23), (11, 23), (11, 14), (12, 21), (12, 18), (12, 28), (13, 17), (14, 18), (14, 16), (15, 20), (15, 21), (15, 16), (16, 22), (16, 23), (17, 26), (18, 25), (18, 28), (19, 22), (20, 15), (20, 24), (21, 9), (22, 26), (22, 17), (23, 16), (24, 8), (24, 20), (25, 26), (25, 29), (25, 18), (26, 25), (27, 1), (28, 29), (28, 12), (29, 24)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Sorted vertices by their number of connections: 
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 0, 10, 11, 27, 20, 8, 5, 7, 16, 4, 14, 1, 3: 2 connections
Node 2, 12, 26, 28, 19, 21: 3 connections
Node 18, 29, 25, 15, 22, 13, 17, 24, 9, 23: 4 connections

Triangles found:
<3, 9, 13>, <3, 9, 21>, <3, 9, 22>, <3, 9, 1>, <3, 9, 4>, <9, 22, 13>, <9, 22, 21>, <9, 13, 17>, <22, 17, 13>, <17, 26, 22>

Total number of triangles: [10]
