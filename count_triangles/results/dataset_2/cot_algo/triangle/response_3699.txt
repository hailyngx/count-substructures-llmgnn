Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 8) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 16) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 14) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 19) (11, 4) (11, 2) (19, 8) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 0) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 16) (2, 10) (2, 11) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 9) (7, 15) (7, 5) (7, 19) (14, 8) (18, 17) (18, 0) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 18) (0, 9) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 13) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 9) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of vertices is as follows:
Node 14: degree 1
Node 18: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 17: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 15: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4
Node 1: degree 5
Node 13: degree 5
Node 19: degree 6
Node 0: degree 6
Node 9: degree 5

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
<[0, 9, 13]>
<[1, 3, 8]>
<[1, 5, 6]>
<[1, 8, 19]>
<[1, 13, 19]>
<[2, 10, 16]>
<[4, 9, 12]>
<[6, 8, 19]>
<[7, 15, 16]>
<[7, 15, 19]>
<[8, 15, 16]>
<[17, 12, 16]>

Total number of triangles: [12]
