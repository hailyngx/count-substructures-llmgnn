Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 12) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 11) (8, 18) (0, 5) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 18) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 7) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 16) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 16) (4, 9) (4, 11) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 11) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 16) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 7) (16, 18) (18, 3) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 16) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 13: 0 connections
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 13: 1 connection
Node 17: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 19: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 18: 6 connections
Node 16: 4 connections

Now, we will count the triangles by examining each edge. We only consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles: 
- <0, 5, 14>
- <4, 11, 12>
- <7, 16, 19>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <2, 6, 12>
- <2, 14, 18>
- <1, 12, 15>
- <9, 11, 12>
- <2, 8, 18>
- <1, 12, 17>
- <12, 15, 18>
- <1, 12, 18>
- <7, 16, 17>
- <6, 12, 15>
- <2, 8, 11>
- <5, 6, 12>
- <10, 15, 16>
- <6, 12, 18>
- <12, 14, 18>
- <15, 16, 18>
- <8, 16, 18>

Total number of triangles: [20]
