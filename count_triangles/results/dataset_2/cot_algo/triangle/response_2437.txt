Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 0) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections:
```
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 14: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 11: Degree 5
Node 10: Degree 5
Node 0: Degree 6
Node 12: Degree 6
```

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
```
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 14: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 5
Node 10: Degree 5
Node 0: Degree 6
Node 12: Degree 6
```

3. Count the triangles:
```
Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 10, 4>
<0, 10, 5>
<1, 10, 4>
<1, 10, 5>
<2, 13, 1>
```
