Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. Based on the given edges, we can construct the sorted list of vertices with their degrees as follows:

Node 4: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 9: degree 5
Node 5: degree 5

We will now count the number of triangles using the method described earlier. 

The total number of triangles is [26] and they are: 
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 3>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <6, 1, 2>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 1, 5>, <6, 2, 8>
