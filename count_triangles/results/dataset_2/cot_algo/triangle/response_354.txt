Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 0), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 3), (7, 2), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 0), (8, 4), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 3), (0, 9), (0, 6), (0, 2), (3, 4), (1, 7)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

0: degree 3
1: degree 2
2: degree 3
3: degree 3
4: degree 3
5: degree 5
6: degree 3
7: degree 4
8: degree 3
9: degree 5

Now, we will count the triangles:

1. (0-2): Shared connection with 6 -> Triangle: <0, 2, 6>
2. (0-6): Shared connections with 3, 9 -> Triangles: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 6, 9>
3. (0-9): Shared connection with 6 -> Triangle: <0, 6, 9>
4. (1-4): Shared connection with 7 -> Triangle: <1, 4, 7>
5. (1-7): Shared connections with 4, 5 -> Triangles: <1, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 7>
6. (2-5): Shared connection with 7 -> Triangle: <2, 5, 7>
7. (2-7): Shared connections with 5, 1 -> Triangles: <2, 5, 1>, <2, 5, 7>
8. (3-4): Shared connection with 6 -> Triangle: <3, 4, 6>
9. (3-6): Shared connections with 0, 9 -> Triangles: <0, 3, 6>, <3, 6, 9>
10. (3-9): Shared connection with 6 -> Triangle: <0, 6, 9>
11. (4-7): Shared connections with 1, 8 -> Triangles: <1, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 8>
12. (5-7): Shared connections with 2, 9 -> Triangles: <2, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 9>
13. (6-8): Shared connection with 4 -> Triangle: <4, 6, 8>
14. (7-9): Shared connections with 5, 6 -> Triangles: <5, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [14]
