Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 6) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 2) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 8) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 18) (9, 1) (9, 8) (19, 14) (0, 16) (0, 4) (16, 5) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 2) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 18) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (14, 19) (14, 4) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 6) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (3, 16) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 18) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 12) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method first involves sorting the vertices by their degree of connections from least to most. The vertices with their degrees are as follows:

Vertex 19: Degree 1
Vertex 0: Degree 2
Vertex 1: Degree 4
Vertex 13: Degree 2
Vertex 17: Degree 2
Vertex 15: Degree 3
Vertex 8: Degree 3
Vertex 9: Degree 2
Vertex 14: Degree 2
Vertex 5: Degree 4
Vertex 11: Degree 3
Vertex 2: Degree 4
Vertex 6: Degree 4
Vertex 16: Degree 5
Vertex 7: Degree 3
Vertex 3: Degree 4
Vertex 10: Degree 3
Vertex 18: Degree 4
Vertex 4: Degree 2
Vertex 12: Degree 3

Now, Let's find the number of triangles and list them:

There are 25 triangles in total inside brackets []:
[<2, 5, 16> <2, 6, 16> <2, 11, 16> <2, 13, 5> <2, 6, 3> <3, 7, 16> <3, 10, 18> <3, 11, 12> <3, 11, 16> <3, 12, 18> <5, 11, 16> <5, 13, 16> <5, 16, 7> <6, 15, 17> <6, 15, 1> <6, 15, 2> <6, 17, 1> <7, 10, 18> <7, 16, 3> <8, 9, 1> <11, 12, 3> <11, 12, 18> <13, 2, 5> <16, 2, 6> <16, 2, 11>]
