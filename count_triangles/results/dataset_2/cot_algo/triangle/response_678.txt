Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 4) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 4) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 11), (0, 12)
(1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 11)
(2, 12)
(3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 10), (3, 12), (3, 13)
(4, 6)
(5, 8), (5, 9)
(6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 11)
(7, 8), (7, 10), (7, 13)
(8, 13)
(9, 12), (9, 14)
(10, 13), (10, 14)
(11, 12)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Node degrees: 
0 (6), 1 (5), 2 (2), 3 (5), 4 (2), 5 (5), 6 (4), 7 (4), 8 (2), 9 (3), 10 (4), 11 (3), 12 (4), 13 (4), 14 (2)

After relabeling:
0 (2), 1 (5), 2 (11), 3 (5), 4 (11), 5 (5), 6 (7), 7 (7), 8 (11), 9 (10), 10 (7), 11 (10), 12 (7), 13 (7), 14 (11)

Now, we will count the triangles:
Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 5>
