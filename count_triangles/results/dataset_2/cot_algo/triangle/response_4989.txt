Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges.

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8, 6, 5, 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 0
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 9, 5
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 9, 3, 5, 6, 2
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, 1, 3, 4
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 8, 9, 5
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 2, 1, 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 1, 3

Now, let's find the number of triangles and list them using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Degree-Based Ordering:
- Node 0: Degree 3
- Node 1: Degree 4
- Node 2: Degree 2
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 6
- Node 5: Degree 6
- Node 6: Degree 5
- Node 7: Degree 3
- Node 8: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 4

Triangles found (in the format <node1, node2, node3>):
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <5, 7, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 14]
