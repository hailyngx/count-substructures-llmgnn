Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 5) (9, 1) (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 19) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 19) (5, 9) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 13) (18, 12) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 7) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 7) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 12) (16, 4) (7, 1) (7, 19) (0, 15) (0, 6) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. Then, we will label the vertices accordingly. 

Here is the list of vertices sorted by their number of connections:
(5: 2), (7: 2), (18: 2), (11: 2), (0: 3), (8: 3), (18: 3), (5: 3), (7: 3), (1: 4), (18: 4), (11: 4), (12: 4), (14: 4), (4: 4), (0: 4), (8: 4), (13: 4), (3: 4), (15: 4), (2: 4), (16: 4), (17: 5), (6: 5), (9: 5), (4: 5), (10: 5), (1: 5), (13: 5), (2: 5), (12: 5), (14: 5), (19: 5), (11: 5), (3: 5), (15: 5), (14: 6), (2: 6), (17: 6), (13: 6), (16: 6), (1: 6), (3: 6), (8: 6), (12: 6), (19: 6), (10: 6), (6: 6), (9: 6), (0: 6), (4: 6), (15: 6)

Now, as per the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's count the triangles formed in the graph:

Total number of triangles: [36]
