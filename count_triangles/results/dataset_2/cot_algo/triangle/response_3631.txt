Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0 --- 1
- 0 --- 2
- 0 --- 3
- 0 --- 6
- 0 --- 9
- 1 --- 2
- 1 --- 3
- 1 --- 7
- 1 --- 8
- 2 --- 7
- 2 --- 8
- 3 --- 6
- 3 --- 7
- 3 --- 9
- 4 --- 6
- 4 --- 8
- 4 --- 9
- 5 --- 6
- 5 --- 8
- 6 --- 9
- 7 --- 3
- 7 --- 1
- 8 --- 9

Next, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):
0: 5 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 3 connections
5: 2 connections
4: 3 connections
3: 5 connections
6: 4 connections
9: 4 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 4 connections

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start counting the triangles:

Triangles: 
[13]
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 1>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 3>
<1, 8, 4>
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 4, 9>
