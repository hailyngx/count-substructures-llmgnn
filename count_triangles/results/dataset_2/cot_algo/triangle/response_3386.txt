Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 23) (1, 27) (21, 13) (21, 27) (21, 11) (4, 28) (4, 11) (4, 15) (7, 20) (7, 19) (7, 18) (7, 8) (2, 22) (2, 16) (29, 28) (8, 7) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 12) (8, 22) (23, 1) (23, 8) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 12) (20, 7) (20, 0) (20, 24) (20, 10) (26, 1) (26, 27) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 25) (6, 22) (6, 12) (28, 4) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 19) (18, 7) (18, 13) (22, 2) (22, 8) (22, 0) (22, 6) (22, 3) (3, 22) (17, 12) (17, 27) (9, 25) (9, 15) (25, 6) (25, 9) (25, 15) (13, 21) (13, 18) (13, 12) (13, 14) (24, 8) (24, 20) (19, 7) (19, 28) (19, 14) (19, 16) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 25) (15, 5) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 13) (27, 1) (27, 21) (27, 26) (27, 17) (10, 20) (10, 6) (10, 5) (16, 2) (16, 19) (14, 13) (14, 19) (5, 15) (5, 10) (11, 21) (11, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will now apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

The vertices sorted by their degrees are:  
Node 16 has degree 2  
Node 5 has degree 2  
Node 9 has degree 2  
Node 17 has degree 2  
Node 3 has degree 2  
Node 29 has degree 2  
Node 1 has degree 3  
Node 26 has degree 3  
Node 24 has degree 3  
Node 27 has degree 4  
Node 11 has degree 4  
Node 19 has degree 4  
Node 14 has degree 4  
Node 18 has degree 4  
Node 10 has degree 4  
Node 0 has degree 4  
Node 2 has degree 5  
Node 7 has degree 5  
Node 4 has degree 5  
Node 6 has degree 6  
Node 12 has degree 6  
Node 13 has degree 6  
Node 20 has degree 6  
Node 22 has degree 6  
Node 25 has degree 6  
Node 8 has degree 6  
Node 21 has degree 7  
Node 15 has degree 7  
Node 28 has degree 7  

Following the rule where we only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will count the triangles formed by shared connections.

The number of triangles found is [36].

Unique triangles found are:  
<0, 7, 20>  
<0, 8, 22>  
<0, 10, 20>  
<0, 12, 17>  
<1, 26, 27>  
<1, 23, 8>  
<4, 11, 21>
