Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (10, 4) (10, 0) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 12) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 12) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 2) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 12), 
(9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 14), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 0), 
(4, 7), (4, 10), (4, 14), (4, 1), (4, 3), 
(7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 14), 
(10, 4), (10, 0), 
(11, 14), (11, 1), (11, 8), 
(8, 9), (8, 11), (8, 13), (8, 0), (8, 12), 
(13, 8), (13, 2), (13, 3), (13, 6), 
(6, 13), (6, 2), (6, 12), 
(0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 8), (0, 14), 
(14, 9), (14, 4), (14, 7), (14, 11), (14, 0), (14, 12), 
(3, 4), (3, 13), (3, 12), 
(2, 5), (2, 13), (2, 6), (2, 1), 
(1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 11), (1, 2), 
(12, 5), (12, 8), (12, 6), (12, 14), (12, 3)

Now let's sort the nodes by their degrees:
Nodes by degrees: (0:4), (3:4), (6:4), (10:2), (11:3), (12:4), (13:4), (7:3), (5:3), (2:4), (1:4), (4:5), (8:5), (14:6), (9:6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

Triangles: [20]
Unique triangles: <0, 9, 14>, <1, 9, 11>, <1, 9, 14>, <1, 11, 8>, <1, 11, 14>, <2, 5, 13>, <3, 4, 13>, <3, 12, 14>, <4, 7, 14>, <4, 10, 0>, <4, 10, 14>, <8, 9, 14>, <8, 11, 14>, <8, 12, 14>, <9, 5, 2>, <9, 7, 4>, <9, 14, 11>, <13, 2, 6>, <13, 3, 12>, <13, 6, 2>
