Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows:
0 (degree 1)
5 (degree 1)
0 (degree 1)
8 (degree 2)
5 (degree 2)
7 (degree 2)
1 (degree 3)
9 (degree 4)
6 (degree 4)
4 (degree 5)
2 (degree 5)
3 (degree 5)

Based on the given edges, the triangles formed are:
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 1>
<2, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 3>
<1, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<6, 4, 7>
<6, 4, 9>
<6, 4, 3>
<6, 4, 0>
<7, 4, 8>
<7, 4, 6>
<8, 4, 9>
<8, 4, 1>
<8, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [20].
