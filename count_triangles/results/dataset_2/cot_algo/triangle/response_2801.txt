Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 0), (5, 7), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 1), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 1), (4, 3), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 1), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 8), (3, 4), (3, 0), (3, 6), (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8), (8, 4), (8, 1), (8, 6), (8, 2), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 2), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 0)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Nodes' degrees:
0: 4
1: 5
2: 4
3: 3
4: 4
5: 4
6: 5
7: 4
8: 4
9: 4

According to the Degree-Based Ordering, the sorted nodes are: 3, 2, 0, 9, 5, 4, 7, 8, 6, 1

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Starting with edge (3, 4): Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 4, so proceed.
  Check for shared connections between 3 and 4: Edge (3, 0)
  There is a triangle: <0, 3, 4>

- Moving to edge (2, 0): Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 0, so proceed.
  Check for shared connections between 2 and 0: No shared connection.

- Next, edge (0, 2): Node 0 has fewer connections than Node 2, so proceed.
  Check for shared connections between 0 and 2: No shared connection.

- Continue with the remaining edges using the same logic.

The total number of triangles found is: [1]
The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 4>
