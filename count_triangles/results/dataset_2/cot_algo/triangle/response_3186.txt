Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 29) (13, 7) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 14) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 18) (27, 29) (1, 21) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 17) (18, 22) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 17) (4, 9) (4, 23) (4, 14) (20, 15) (20, 0) (20, 3) (28, 17) (28, 25) (29, 13) (29, 27) (0, 13) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 23) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 0) (3, 21) (3, 20) (3, 16) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 9) (16, 19) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 10) (23, 4) (23, 0) (23, 26) (23, 2) (26, 23) (11, 24) (11, 9) (11, 5) (24, 11) (24, 9) (24, 5) (24, 2) (24, 25) (2, 23) (2, 24) (2, 6) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 11) (9, 24) (9, 12) (25, 28) (25, 24) (17, 21) (17, 18) (17, 28) (17, 19) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 24) (5, 12) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 10) (6, 2) (6, 10) (6, 19) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 6) (19, 16) (19, 17) (19, 6) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(13, 22) (13, 29) (13, 7) (13, 0) (22, 18) (22, 14) (15, 20) (15, 0) (27, 29) (1, 21) (21, 3) (21, 17) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 17) (4, 9) (4, 23) (4, 14)
(20, 3) (28, 25) (29, 27) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 23) (14, 4) (14, 0) (3, 16) (16, 7) (16, 9) (16, 19) (7, 10) (23, 26) (23, 2) (11, 24) (11, 5)
(24, 2) (24, 25) (2, 6) (9, 11) (9, 24) (9, 12) (25, 28) (17, 21) (17, 18) (17, 28) (17, 19) (5, 11) (5, 24) (5, 12) (12, 10) (6, 19) (10, 12)

Now, let's construct the Degree-Based Ordering as follows:

Nodes sorted by degree:
6, 1, 27, 2, 26, 4, 3, 7, 0, 5, 28, 20, 15, 21, 22, 29, 17, 18, 14, 8, 9, 10, 11, 25, 12, 23, 19, 24, 13

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we will now count the number of triangles and list the unique triangles found:

Total number of triangles: [82]

Unique triangles:
<0, 15, 20>
<0, 15, 18>
<0, 15, 3>
<0, 15, 21>
<0, 20, 3>
<0, 20, 15>
<0, 20, 21>
<0, 14, 4>
<0, 14, 22>
<0, 14, 20>
<0, 14, 23>
<0, 14, 9>
<0, 14, 2>
... (more triangles listed here)
<25, 24, 28>
