Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 12) (10, 13) (10, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (9, 5), (5, 4), (5, 14), (9, 12), (8, 0), (0, 3), (12, 0)
- 1: (9, 2), (1, 3), (1, 11), (1, 14), (1, 4), (1, 8), (8, 1), (11, 1), (0, 9), (0, 8)
- 2: (9, 7), (2, 4), (2, 11), (2, 12), (2, 7), (12, 2)
- 3: (9, 0), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 13), (13, 3)
- 4: (9, 7), (4, 5), (4, 1), (4, 8), (4, 6), (8, 4), (11, 2), (2, 4), (6, 4)
- 5: (5, 9), (5, 4), (5, 14), (14, 5)
- 6: (10, 6), (6, 4), (6, 14), (14, 6)
- 7: (9, 13), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 2), (13, 7)
- 8: (9, 2), (1, 8), (8, 13), (8, 4), (8, 14), (8, 0), (8, 7), (13, 8), (14, 8)
- 9: (5, 9), (9, 2), (9, 7), (9, 0), (9, 12), (7, 9), (0, 9), (2, 9), (12, 9)
- 10: (13, 10), (10, 6)
- 11: (1, 11), (2, 11)
- 12: (9, 12), (0, 12), (2, 12), (12, 2)
- 13: (8, 13), (13, 3), (13, 10), (13, 14), (13, 7), (7, 13)
- 14: (5, 14), (1, 14), (8, 14), (13, 14), (14, 6)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted nodes are:
0, 11, 6, 10, 3, 12, 7, 2, 5, 4, 1, 13, 8, 9, 14

Calculating the number of triangles using the shared connections between vertices based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we find:
Total triangles: [3]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 9, 12>
