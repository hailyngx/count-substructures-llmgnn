Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 1) (4, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges:
- 0: 1, 3, 4, 8
- 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5
- 2: 1, 5, 6, 7
- 3: 0, 1, 7, 8
- 4: 0, 1
- 5: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
- 6: 2, 8, 9
- 7: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
- 8: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9
- 9: 5, 6, 8

Next, we sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes sorted by degree: 4, 6, 0, 9, 2, 7, 5, 3, 8, 1

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles:

Triangles: [<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <7, 8, 3>]

Total number of triangles: [7]
