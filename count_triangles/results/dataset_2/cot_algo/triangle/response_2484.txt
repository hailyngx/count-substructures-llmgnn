Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 9) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 15) (9, 10) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 10) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 8) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 12) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (17, 19) (17, 13) (17, 4) (1, 5) (1, 14) (6, 12) (7, 13) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 6) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 13) (14, 1) (8, 5) (8, 18) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 18) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 17) 

Response:
The graph constructed based on the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: 
(11, 16) (11, 12) (11, 4) 
(16, 4) (16, 14)
(3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 12) 
(15, 9) (15, 0)
(5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 1) 
(9, 10)
(2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 10)
(18, 8) 
(19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 12)
(13, 17) (13, 7)
(17, 4)
(1, 14) 
(6, 12) 
(7, 13) 
(0, 14)

Next, let's sort the nodes by their degrees in increasing order: 
Nodes by degree: 1, 6, 7, 11, 8, 9, 10, 2, 5, 19, 16, 15, 18, 12, 0, 3, 17, 4, 13, 14

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 6]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 15>
<0, 12, 19>
<3, 11, 16>
<4, 13, 17>
<5, 8, 18>
