Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 18) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 19) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 7) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 10) (16, 5) (16, 0) (7, 17) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 8) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (12, 13) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 19) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 2) (14, 5) (14, 8) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 19) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 14) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Sorting the nodes by their degrees:  
Node 4: degree 0  
Node 12: degree 0  
Node 20: degree 0  
Node 16: degree 2  
Node 0: degree 3  
Node 5: degree 3  
Node 7: degree 3  
Node 14: degree 3  
Node 8: degree 3  
Node 9: degree 4  
Node 6: degree 4  
Node 1: degree 4  
Node 3: degree 4  
Node 18: degree 4  
Node 15: degree 4  
Node 19: degree 5  
Node 11: degree 5  
Node 10: degree 5  
Node 2: degree 5  
Node 17: degree 5  
- Relabelling the nodes:  
Node 4 -> 0  
Node 12 -> 1  
Node 20 -> 2  
Node 16 -> 3  
Node 0 -> 4  
Node 5 -> 5  
Node 7 -> 6  
Node 14 -> 7  
Node 8 -> 8  
Node 9 -> 9  
Node 6 -> 10  
Node 1 -> 11  
Node 3 -> 12  
Node 18 -> 13  
Node 15 -> 14  
Node 19 -> 15  
Node 11 -> 16  
Node 10 -> 17  
Node 2 -> 18  
Node 17 -> 19  

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering:
- Looking at each edge, we only consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.  
Triangles:
<2, 12, 13>  
<6, 7, 9>  
<6, 9, 10>  
<6, 9, 11>  
<6, 9, 15>  
<6, 10, 11>  
<6, 11, 19>  
<6, 14, 15>  
<6, 15, 18>  
<7, 14, 15>  
<9, 10, 11>  
<9, 11, 13>  
<9, 11, 15>  
<9, 13, 15>  
<10, 11, 15>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15], and the unique triangles found are: <2, 12, 13>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 9, 10>, <6, 9, 11>, <6, 9, 15>, <6, 10, 11>, <6, 11, 19>, <6, 14, 15>, <6, 15, 18>, <7, 14, 15>, <9, 10, 11>, <9, 11, 13>, <9, 11, 15>, <9, 13, 15>, <10, 11, 15>.
