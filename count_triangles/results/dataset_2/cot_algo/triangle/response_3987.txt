Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 5) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 7) (10, 15) (10, 6) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 6) (12, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 5) (16, 3) (16, 18) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 15) (5, 14) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 13) (9, 0) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 7) (0, 2) (0, 19) (0, 9) (0, 13) (8, 17) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 13) (7, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently.

After sorting the vertices by the number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Nodes: 3(0), 16(1), 15(2), 1(3), 17(4), 10(5), 4(6), 12(7), 6(8), 14(9), 11(10), 5(11), 2(12), 19(13), 9(14), 13(15), 18(16), 0(17), 8(18), 7(19)

The triangles formed by the given graph are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 1, 16>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<4, 8, 10>
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 9, 10>
<17, 1, 3>
<5, 9, 11>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
