Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- Node 0: {5, 7, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 8}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 1}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 1, 0, 7}
- Node 6: {7, 2, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 4, 0, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {9, 7, 6, 1, 3, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 9, 8, 4, 1}

Degree-based ordering of vertices: 
{3, 8, 0, 4, 2, 6, 1, 7, 5, 9}
