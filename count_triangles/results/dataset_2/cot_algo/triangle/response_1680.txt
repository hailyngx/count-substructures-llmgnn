Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 9) (6, 18) (6, 4) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 18) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 18) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 15) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 14) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 10) (7, 14) (0, 17) (0, 18) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 19) (10, 12) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 7) (12, 16) (12, 10) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 0) (15, 17) (15, 19) (2, 13) (2, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort the vertices based on their number of connections (degrees):
   Node 7: Degree 1
   Node 0: Degree 2
   Node 2: Degree 2
   Node 15: Degree 2
   Node 12: Degree 3
   Node 5: Degree 3
   Node 19: Degree 3
   Node 11: Degree 0
   Node 20: Degree 0
   Node 16: Degree 4
   Node 8: Degree 4
   Node 13: Degree 4
   Node 1: Degree 5
   Node 3: Degree 5
   Node 17: Degree 5
   Node 10: Degree 5
   Node 18: Degree 5
   Node 9: Degree 6
   Node 6: Degree 6
   Node 4: Degree 6

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
   Node 7: Degree 1 -> Node 0
   Node 0: Degree 2 -> Node 1
   Node 2: Degree 2 -> Node 2
   Node 15: Degree 2 -> Node 3
   Node 12: Degree 3 -> Node 4
   Node 5: Degree 3 -> Node 5
   Node 19: Degree 3 -> Node 6
   Node 11: Degree 0 -> Node 7
   Node 20: Degree 0 -> Node 8
   Node 16: Degree 4 -> Node 9
   Node 8: Degree 4 -> Node 10
   Node 13: Degree 4 -> Node 11
   Node 1: Degree 5 -> Node 12
   Node 3: Degree 5 -> Node 13
   Node 17: Degree 5 -> Node 14
   Node 10: Degree 5 -> Node 15
   Node 18: Degree 5 -> Node 16
   Node 9: Degree 6 -> Node 17
   Node 6: Degree 6 -> Node 18
   Node 4: Degree 6 -> Node 19

3. Count the triangles:
   - Note that only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

   Triangles:
   1. <0, 1, 2>
   2. <0, 1, 3>
   3. <0, 1, 4>
   4. <0, 1, 5>
   5. <0, 1, 6>
   6. <0, 2, 4>
   7. <0, 2, 5>
   8. <0, 2, 6>
   9. <0, 3, 4>
   10. <0, 3, 5>
   11. <0, 3, 6>
   12. <1, 4, 5>
   13. <1, 4, 6>
   14. <1, 5, 6>
   15. <2, 4, 18>
   16. <2, 4, 3>
   17. <15, 5, 10>
   [17]
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 17.
