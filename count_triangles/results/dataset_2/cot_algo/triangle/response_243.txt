Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 11) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (4, 19) (4, 6) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 7) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 3) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 15) (3, 5) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 17) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 12) (2, 12) (2, 16) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (19, 4) (19, 13) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 13) (13, 19) (13, 15) 

Response:
The graph given can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 20
Edges: 
- 0: 9, 14, 10, 15
- 1: 
- 2: 12, 16
- 3: 5, 18, 7, 12
- 4: 19, 6
- 5: 3, 7
- 6: 14, 10, 4, 12
- 7: 5, 9, 8, 3
- 8: 16, 15, 7
- 9: 11, 7, 0
- 10: 17, 0, 6, 12
- 11: 9, 17
- 12: 10, 3, 6, 2
- 13: 19, 15
- 14: 17, 0, 6
- 15: 8, 18, 0, 13
- 16: 17, 8, 2
- 17: 14, 10, 16, 18, 11
- 18: 17, 15, 3
- 19: 4, 13

Next, let's calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by degree:
1. Node 1: Degree 0
2. Node 2: Degree 2
3. Node 4: Degree 2
4. Node 13: Degree 2
5. Node 5: Degree 2
6. Node 8: Degree 3
7. Node 11: Degree 2
8. Node 19: Degree 2
9. Node 9: Degree 3
10. Node 0: Degree 4
11. Node 3: Degree 4
12. Node 6: Degree 4
13. Node 7: Degree 4
14. Node 10: Degree 4
15. Node 14: Degree 3
16. Node 15: Degree 4
17. Node 16: Degree 3
18. Node 12: Degree 4
19. Node 17: Degree 5
20. Node 18: Degree 3

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles and find that there are 27 triangles in this graph. 

Therefore, the result is [27]. 

The unique triangles found are:
- <0, 9, 11>
- <0, 9, 14>
- <0, 9, 15>
- <0, 10, 14>
- <0, 10, 15>
- <0, 10, 17>
- <0, 12, 14>
- <0, 12, 15>
- <0, 12, 16>
- <0, 15, 17>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <3, 7, 18>
- <3, 7, 10>
- <3, 7, 12>
- <3, 7, 17>
- <7, 9, 11>
- <6, 10, 14>
- <6, 10, 17>
- <6, 10, 12>
- <10, 12, 16>
- <10, 12, 17>
- <10, 14, 17>
