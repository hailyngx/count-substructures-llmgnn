Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: 5, 9, 7, 6, 2
- 1: 5, 9, 3
- 2: 5, 4, 7, 3, 0
- 3: 9, 1, 2
- 4: 7, 8, 6, 2
- 5: 9, 2, 1, 0
- 6: 4, 7, 8, 0
- 7: 4, 0, 6, 2, 8
- 8: 4, 7, 6
- 9: 5, 3, 1, 0

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Node 3 - degree 2
Node 8 - degree 2
Node 6 - degree 3
Node 1 - degree 3
Node 9 - degree 4
Node 4 - degree 4
Node 7 - degree 5
Node 0 - degree 5
Node 2 - degree 5
Node 5 - degree 5

We will now count the triangles:
- (3, 8) does not form a triangle with any other node.
- (3, 8) does not form a triangle with any other node.
- (6, 8) forms triangles with (4, 7) and (7, 8), 2 triangles.
- (1, 3) does not form a triangle with any other node.
- (4, 9) forms a triangle with (7, 8).
- (5, 7) forms a triangle with (0, 1).
- (0, 6) forms triangles with (5, 7) and (2, 7), 2 triangles.
- (2, 4) forms triangles with (0, 7) and (7, 4), 2 triangles.
- (5, 9) forms a triangle with (0, 1).
- (5, 2) forms a triangle with (0, 7).
- (5, 1) forms a triangle with (0, 7).
- (5, 0) forms a triangle with (2, 7).
- (4, 7) forms a triangle with (0, 2).
- (4, 2) forms a triangle with (7, 0).

Total number of triangles: [9]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <0, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <2, 5, 7>
