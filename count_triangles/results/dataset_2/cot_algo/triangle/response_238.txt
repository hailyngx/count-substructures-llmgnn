Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (12, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 10) (9, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 6) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 13) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 6) (13, 0) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) from least to most. After relabeling the vertices accordingly, we can count the number of triangles in the given graph.

The sorted vertex labels with their degrees are as follows:
Vertex 9 - Degree 2
Vertex 7 - Degree 2
Vertex 12 - Degree 2
Vertex 2 - Degree 3
Vertex 15 - Degree 3
Vertex 6 - Degree 4
Vertex 4 - Degree 4
Vertex 3 - Degree 4
Vertex 13 - Degree 5
Vertex 14 - Degree 5
Vertex 1 - Degree 5
Vertex 8 - Degree 6
Vertex 5 - Degree 7
Vertex 10 - Degree 7
Vertex 11 - Degree 7
Vertex 0 - Degree 7

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles. We only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections to avoid duplicate counting. Here are the triangles found:

[Total number of triangles: 14]
<4, 6, 10>
<14, 2, 5>
<14, 3, 11>
<13, 0, 10>
<1, 8, 11>
<8, 5, 10>
<1, 9, 10>
<5, 0, 11>
<4, 2, 6>
<5, 3, 11>
<8, 1, 11>
<1, 9, 10>
<5, 0, 13>
<6, 4, 10>
