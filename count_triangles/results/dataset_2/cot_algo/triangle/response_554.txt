Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. The next step is to relabel the nodes according to their sorted degree. 

Nodes with their new labels:
0 → 4
1 → 2
2 → 3
3 → 1
4 → 5
5 → 0
6 → 6
7 → 7
8 → 8
9 → 9

After relabeling, the edges become:
(0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 3) 
(1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) 
(2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) 
(3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 
(4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) 
(5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) 
(6, 7) (6, 1) 
(7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) 
(8, 2) 
(9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Now we will count the triangles based on the shared connections between edges:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 3, 4>
3. <1, 2, 5>
4. <1, 6, 7>
5. <2, 3, 4>
6. <2, 5, 7>
7. <2, 7, 4>
8. <3, 4, 7>
9. <4, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
