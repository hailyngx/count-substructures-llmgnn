Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 9) (11, 27) (16, 11) (16, 17) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 27) (17, 16) (17, 27) (1, 3) (1, 29) (1, 10) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 4) (20, 18) (20, 2) (20, 19) (25, 5) (25, 26) (25, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 29) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 18) (4, 3) (4, 25) (4, 8) (15, 19) (15, 7) (28, 11) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 5) (24, 26) (24, 9) (26, 25) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 0) (18, 14) (18, 20) (18, 13) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 22) (22, 6) (22, 27) (22, 0) (19, 3) (19, 20) (19, 15) (19, 28) (29, 1) (29, 8) (29, 21) (21, 29) (21, 0) (0, 26) (0, 22) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 5) (7, 15) (7, 27) (27, 11) (27, 14) (27, 17) (27, 22) (27, 7) (10, 1) (10, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 28) (9, 24) (9, 12) (2, 20) (5, 25) (5, 28) (5, 0) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering is as follows after sorting nodes by their degree in ascending order:

Node 7: degree 2
Node 2: degree 3
Node 15: degree 3
Node 17: degree 3
Node 21: degree 3
Node 24: degree 3
Node 10: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4
Node 18: degree 4
Node 22: degree 4
Node 29: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 5: degree 5
Node 14: degree 5
Node 25: degree 5
Node 13: degree 6
Node 3: degree 6
Node 19: degree 6
Node 8: degree 6
Node 4: degree 7
Node 1: degree 7
Node 20: degree 7
Node 0: degree 7
Node 26: degree 8
Node 27: degree 8
Node 11: degree 9
Node 12: degree 9
Node 9: degree 10
Node 28: degree 10

Calculating the triangles based on the shared connections:
