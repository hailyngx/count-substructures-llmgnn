Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 14) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 8) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: {(6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 11), (6, 0), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 10), (9, 1), (3, 7), (10, 8), (11, 7), (11, 12), (4, 2), (5, 13), (0, 7), (14, 13), (12, 1), (8, 5), (14, 2)}
