Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 24) (5, 28) (5, 14) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 26) (1, 28) (1, 22) (3, 9) (3, 21) (3, 26) (10, 17) (10, 7) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 23) (17, 11) (26, 1) (26, 3) (26, 6) (26, 7) (29, 17) (29, 18) (0, 7) (0, 21) (7, 10) (7, 26) (7, 0) (21, 3) (21, 0) (21, 12) (21, 19) (18, 29) (18, 20) (11, 17) (11, 24) (11, 25) (24, 5) (24, 11) (24, 22) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 28) (19, 21) (19, 15) (19, 13) (12, 21) (12, 20) (12, 28) (20, 18) (20, 12) (20, 27) (20, 6) (20, 16) (8, 25) (8, 27) (23, 17) (23, 15) (23, 14) (23, 16) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 14) (25, 11) (25, 8) (27, 20) (27, 8) (27, 6) (14, 5) (14, 23) (14, 13) (14, 4) (6, 26) (6, 20) (6, 27) (6, 22) (22, 1) (22, 24) (22, 6) (28, 5) (28, 1) (28, 15) (28, 12) (2, 4) (4, 14) (4, 2) (16, 20) (16, 23) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. The nodes' degrees are as follows:

Node 2: degree 1
Node 8: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 15: degree 3
Node 18: degree 3
Node 22: degree 3
Node 28: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4
Node 24: degree 4
Node 21: degree 5
Node 29: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5
Node 16: degree 5
Node 20: degree 5
Node 26: degree 5
Node 27: degree 5
Node 14: degree 6
Node 17: degree 6
Node 25: degree 6
Node 23: degree 6

Now, we iterate through the edges only considering edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections than the other node. We count the number of triangles formed by each edge.

The total number of triangles is [16] and the unique triangles found are: 
<1, 3, 26>
<1, 22, 24>
<3, 9, 17>
<3, 9, 26>
<3, 21, 0>
<3, 21, 12>
<7, 10, 17>
<7, 10, 26>
<10, 17, 29>
<10, 17, 23>
<15, 19, 23>
<15, 19, 28>
<17, 23, 15>
<17, 29, 18>
<19, 21, 15>
<20, 12, 21>
