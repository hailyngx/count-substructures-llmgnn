Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering can be applied as follows:

Sort the vertices by the number of connections:
- Node 5 has 1 connection.
- Nodes 7, 8, and 6 have 2 connections.
- Nodes 1 and 4 have 3 connections.
- Nodes 0 and 3 have 4 connections.
- Node 9 has 5 connections.
- Node 2 has 6 connections.

Relabel the nodes accordingly:
- Label Node 5 as 0.
- Label Nodes 7, 8, and 6 as 1, 2, and 3.
- Label Nodes 1 and 4 as 4 and 5.
- Label Nodes 0 and 3 as 6 and 7.
- Label Node 9 as 8.
- Label Node 2 as 9.

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Counting triangles involving the edge (5, 2)... No triangles.
- Counting triangles involving the edge (7, 1)... No triangles.
- Counting triangles involving the edge (8, 3)... No triangles.
- Counting triangles involving the edge (1, 4)... Triangle <1, 4, 7>.
- Counting triangles involving the edge (0, 6)... Triangle <0, 6, 9>.
- Counting triangles involving the edge (3, 0)... Triangle <0, 3, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
