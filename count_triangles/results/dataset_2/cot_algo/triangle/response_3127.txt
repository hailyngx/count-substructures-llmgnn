Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 18) (15, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (10, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 2) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 8) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 12) (4, 15) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (9, 17) (9, 4) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 17) (12, 11) (19, 7) (19, 16) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 16) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 8) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 2) (14, 5) (14, 7) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. The sorted vertices are: <3, 19, 15, 10, 1, 12, 9, 19, 0, 18, 13, 14, 2, 16, 7, 11, 5, 4, 6, 8>.

Now, let's count the triangles based on the given edges:

1. For the edge (3, 18), since vertex 3 is lower in the ordering and has fewer connections, we check for shared connections. Vertex 3 has a connection with vertex 18. So, there is a triangle formed with vertices 3, 18, and the common connection (vertex 0). This forms triangle <3, 18, 0>.

2. Similarly, going through all the edges, we find additional triangles:
   - <1, 11, 12>
   - <4, 5, 1>
   - <5, 6, 7>
   - <5, 14, 7>
   - <5, 16, 2>
   - <7, 18, 2>
   - <8, 17, 0>
   - <8, 18, 7>
   - <9, 17, 4>
   - <16, 2, 13>
   - <16, 5, 10>

Counting all these unique triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
