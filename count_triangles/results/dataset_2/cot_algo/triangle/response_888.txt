Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 3) (11, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 1) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 5) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph. 
First, we sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections):

Vertex 1 has 2 connections
Vertex 11 has 2 connections
Vertex 15 has 2 connections
Vertex 10 has 3 connections
Vertex 12 has 3 connections
Vertex 6 has 3 connections
Vertex 13 has 3 connections
Vertex 3 has 4 connections
Vertex 7 has 4 connections
Vertex 5 has 4 connections
Vertex 9 has 4 connections
Vertex 14 has 5 connections
Vertex 2 has 6 connections
Vertex 8 has 6 connections
Vertex 4 has 7 connections

Next, we relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 1 -> 1
Vertex 11 -> 2
Vertex 15 -> 3
Vertex 10 -> 4
Vertex 12 -> 5
Vertex 6 -> 6
Vertex 13 -> 7
Vertex 3 -> 8
Vertex 7 -> 9
Vertex 5 -> 10
Vertex 9 -> 11
Vertex 14 -> 12
Vertex 2 -> 13
Vertex 8 -> 14
Vertex 4 -> 15

Now, we can proceed to count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [24]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 3, 14>
<0, 5, 14>
<0, 12, 14>
<1, 5, 14>
<2, 3, 14>
<2, 5, 14>
<2, 13, 14>
<3, 5, 14>
<3, 13, 14>
<5, 13, 14>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 4>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 9, 4>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 4>
<3, 9, 4>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 4>
<5, 9, 4>
<6, 9, 4>
<7, 9, 10>
