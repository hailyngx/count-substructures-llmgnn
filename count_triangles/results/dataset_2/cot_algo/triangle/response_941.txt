Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 11) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 7) (0, 14) (0, 16) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 11) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 17) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 17) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 0) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (11, 15) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 17) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 6) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 10) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 18) (17, 8) (17, 19) (17, 2) (18, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on their degree and relabeling them accordingly. 
Here's the relabeled graph based on the provided edges:

- Original node numbers (sorted by degree): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
- Relabeled numbers (sorted): 12, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 5, 0, 10, 9, 13, 11, 3, 18, 14, 15, 16, 17, 8, 19

Considering the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- Triangle <7, 5, 3>
- Triangle <8, 10, 19>
- Triangle <6, 10, 4>
- Triangle <3, 5, 7>
- Triangle <10, 2, 17>
- Triangle <7, 1, 11>
- Triangle <2, 13, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
