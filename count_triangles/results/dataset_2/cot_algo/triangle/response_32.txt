Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and edges:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 0), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 2), (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 3), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 8), (8, 5), (8, 6), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 1), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 0), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 2), (3, 0)

To count the number of triangles in the graph using Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

1. Node 5 (Degree: 4)
2. Node 6 (Degree: 4)
3. Node 8 (Degree: 2)
4. Node 1 (Degree: 4)
5. Node 7 (Degree: 3)
6. Node 9 (Degree: 3)
7. Node 2 (Degree: 5)
8. Node 0 (Degree: 5)
9. Node 3 (Degree: 5)
10. Node 4 (Degree: 6)

Considering the lower degree nodes first, we will count triangles based on the given edges. The triangles found are:

[Total number of triangles: 7]
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 7>
