Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 27) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 5) (1, 23) (3, 1) (8, 4) (8, 25) (8, 17) (13, 26) (13, 24) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 20) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 21) (2, 16) (2, 0) (15, 20) (15, 29) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 21) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 10) (17, 8) (17, 15) (17, 29) (17, 18) (29, 15) (29, 17) (26, 13) (26, 14) (26, 5) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 26) (14, 0) (24, 6) (24, 13) (21, 12) (21, 15) (5, 1) (5, 26) (5, 18) (5, 22) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 22) (22, 5) (22, 19) (22, 27) (25, 9) (25, 8) (25, 23) (28, 27) (28, 10) (28, 23) (27, 11) (27, 20) (27, 22) (27, 28) (18, 17) (18, 5) (10, 16) (10, 20) (10, 28) (23, 1) (23, 25) (23, 28) 

Response:
The graph provided has 30 nodes and 90 edges. To count the number of triangles within this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's first sort the vertices by their degree:

Vertices sorted by degree (from least to most):
0 (degree: 2) 
3 (degree: 2)
7 (degree: 2)
18 (degree: 2)
29 (degree: 2)
6 (degree: 3) 
12 (degree: 3) 
26 (degree: 3) 
5 (degree: 4) 
25 (degree: 4) 
15 (degree: 5) 
8 (degree: 5) 
21 (degree: 5) 
22 (degree: 3) 
10 (degree: 4) 
14 (degree: 5) 
4 (degree: 4) 
1 (degree: 4) 
9 (degree: 4) 
27 (degree: 4) 
19 (degree: 3) 
20 (degree: 5) 
24 (degree: 3) 
2 (degree: 2) 
13 (degree: 3) 
17 (degree: 4) 
11 (degree: 3) 
23 (degree: 3) 
16 (degree: 3) 
28 (degree: 3)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- For each edge, we only consider vertices where the lower label has fewer connections.
- Check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to find triangles.

After examining all edges based on the ordering above, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [46]

Here are some examples of unique triangles found:
<5, 1, 3>
<4, 1, 3>
<1, 5, 18>
<3, 1, 20>
<5, 26, 18>
<21, 15, 17>
<10, 16, 2>
<27, 20, 1>
<23, 28, 25>
<22, 19, 6>
<19, 6, 9>
<12, 7, 20>
