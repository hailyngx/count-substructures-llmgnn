Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles is as follows:
1. Sort vertices by their number of connections in ascending order.
2. Relabel the vertices accordingly.
3. For each edge, consider only the case where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Here is the list of vertices with their connections sorted in ascending order:
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 0: 6 connections
Vertex 1: 6 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (5, 9): Consider only for Vertex 5 and Vertex 9, as 5 < 9
   Shared connections between 5 and 9: 1
   Triangles formed: <5, 9, 1>, <5, 9, 0>
   
2. Edge (5, 6): Consider only for Vertex 5 and Vertex 6, as 5 < 6
   Shared connections between 5 and 6: 1
   Triangles formed: <5, 6, 1>, <5, 6, 0>
   
3. Edge (5, 1): Consider only for Vertex 5 and Vertex 1, as 5 < 1
   Shared connections between 5 and 1: 1
   Triangle formed: <5, 1, 0>
   
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are <5, 9, 1>, <5, 9, 0>, <5, 6, 1>, <5, 6, 0>, <5, 1, 0>.
