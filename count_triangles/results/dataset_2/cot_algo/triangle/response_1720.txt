Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 9) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 5) (14, 18) (14, 13) (14, 10) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 9) (2, 16) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 2) (18, 3) (18, 8) (3, 18) (3, 13) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 6) (15, 1) (15, 0) (8, 18) (8, 19) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 12) (12, 4) (12, 19) (12, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 6) (10, 14) (10, 2) (5, 16) (5, 4) (13, 16) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their number of connections is:
Vertices: 16-8, 14-7, 3-7, 4-6, 18-6, 2-6, 13-6, 19-6, 1-4, 0-5, 11-3, 9-3, 12-3, 6-3, 5-2, 10-2, 7-2, 15-2

Counting triangles:

Checking edge (11, 16): 
    Vertices 11 and 16 have 3 common connections: 9, 1, 13
    <11, 16, 9>, <11, 16, 1>, <11, 16, 13>

Checking edge (11, 1):
    Vertices 11 and 1 have 1 common connection: 9
    <11, 1, 9>

Checking edge (11, 9):
    Vertices 11 and 9 have 1 common connection: 7
    <11, 9, 7>

Total number of triangles: [6]
