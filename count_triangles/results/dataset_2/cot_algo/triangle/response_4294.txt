Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 10) (13, 0) (22, 12) (11, 19) (11, 29) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 8) (9, 26) (9, 2) (9, 28) (9, 10) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 15) (26, 27) (26, 4) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 29) (21, 16) (21, 7) (21, 28) (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 1) (20, 6) (25, 20) (25, 8) (12, 22) (12, 10) (12, 17) (27, 9) (27, 26) (6, 20) (6, 28) (6, 17) (28, 9) (28, 21) (28, 6) (28, 1) (28, 5) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 23) (3, 14) (17, 20) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 8) (18, 19) (18, 24) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 24) (19, 1) (4, 26) (4, 2) (15, 26) (15, 19) (15, 24) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (5, 28) (24, 16) (24, 18) (24, 19) (24, 15) (29, 11) (29, 7) (29, 23) (1, 20) (1, 28) (1, 19) (1, 2) (1, 10) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 1) (23, 14) (23, 29) (8, 16) (8, 25) (8, 17) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order. Once the nodes are relabeled accordingly, we will proceed to count the triangles in the graph.

After relabeling the nodes, the sorted degree-based ordering is as follows:
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 10: 5 connections
Node 11: 5 connections
Node 12: 5 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 16: 4 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 19: 5 connections
Node 20: 5 connections
Node 21: 4 connections
Node 22: 2 connections
Node 23: 2 connections
Node 24: 5 connections
Node 25: 2 connections
Node 26: 5 connections
Node 27: 2 connections
Node 28: 5 connections
Node 29: 3 connections

Now, let's count the triangles based on the given edges and the degree-based ordering of nodes. 

The total number of triangles is [15].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 7, 21>
<9, 10, 12>
<9, 10, 28>
<9, 10, 1>
<9, 26, 15>
<9, 26, 27>
<9, 26, 4>
<16, 7, 21>
<16, 21, 28>
<19, 1, 20>
<19, 1, 2>
<19, 18, 24>
<19, 24, 15>
<26, 9, 27>
<28, 1, 20>
