Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 12) (3, 13) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 19) (15, 13) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (2, 5) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 6) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 19) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 4) (1, 9) (18, 3) (18, 17) (18, 0) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 14) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: (7, 17), (18, 0), (6, 0)
- 1: (9, 8)
- 2: (5, 2)
- 3: (13, 3), (18, 3), (4, 3)
- 4: (17, 4), (12, 4), (6, 4)
- 5: (2, 5), (8, 5), (19, 5)
- 6: (0, 6), (10, 6), (4, 6), (14, 6)
- 7: (17, 7), (0, 7), (10, 7)
- 8: (5, 8), (9, 8), (19, 8)
- 9: (8, 9), (1, 9), (12, 9)
- 10: (7, 10), (6, 10), (12, 10), (11, 10)
- 11: (16, 11), (10, 11), (19, 11)
- 12: (9, 12), (4, 12), (10, 12), (16, 12)
- 13: (15, 13), (3, 13), (14, 13)
- 14: (13, 14), (6, 14), (17, 14)
- 15: (19, 15), (13, 15)
- 16: (11, 16), (12, 16)
- 17: (14, 17), (4, 17), (18, 17), (7, 17)
- 18: (17, 18), (3, 18), (0, 18)
- 19: (11, 19), (15, 19), (8, 19), (5, 19)

Next, we'll sort the nodes based on their degree:
Node degrees in ascending order: 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4

After relabeling, the new order of nodes becomes:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Now, we will proceed with counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method to find the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles:
<0, 6, 10>
<2, 5, 19>
<3, 4, 13>
<3, 4, 17>
<3, 13, 14>
<3, 13, 15>
<3, 14, 17>
<4, 6, 10>
<4, 6, 12>
<4, 6, 14>
<4, 12, 16>
<8, 9, 12>
