Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 13) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 6) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 14) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (12, 10) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 14) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 1 connection
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 13: 5 connections
Vertex 10: 5 connections
Vertex 11: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 12: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 6 connections
Vertex 14: 6 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. For edge (0, 4): Shared connections: 7
2. For edge (0, 13): Shared connections: 7
3. For edge (1, 2): Shared connections: None
4. For edge (1, 3): Shared connections: None
5. For edge (1, 8): Shared connections: None
6. For edge (2, 6): Shared connections: None
7. For edge (3, 4): Shared connections: 11
8. For edge (3, 6): Shared connections: None
9. For edge (3, 13): Shared connections: 7
10. For edge (3, 14): Shared connections: None
11. For edge (4, 9): Shared connections: 11
12. For edge (6, 10): Shared connections: 13
13. For edge (7, 9): Shared connections: 11
14. For edge (7, 10): Shared connections: 13
15. For edge (7, 13): Shared connections: 10

Based on the above calculations, the total number of triangles is [15].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <6, 7, 10>, <4, 7, 9>.
