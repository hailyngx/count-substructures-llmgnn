Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 12) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by degree: 
(1) 11 - degree 3
(2) 14 - degree 3
(3) 5 - degree 4
(4) 9 - degree 4
(5) 1 - degree 3
(6) 3 - degree 4
(7) 2 - degree 5
(8) 13 - degree 4
(9) 12 - degree 5
(10) 10 - degree 3
(11) 0 - degree 7
(12) 4 - degree 6
(13) 7 - degree 5
(14) 6 - degree 6
Edges with lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
<1, 11>, <1, 4>, <1, 0>, <3, 2>, <3, 14>, <5, 2>, <5, 10>, <6, 5>, <6, 9>, <7, 2>, <7, 13>, <9, 6>, <9, 12>, <10, 5>
Total number of triangles: [9]
