Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 25) (26, 8) (26, 12) (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 29) (27, 9) (27, 15) (27, 25) (27, 18) (27, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 24) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 28) (17, 23) (17, 22) (6, 2) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 18) (11, 2) (20, 29) (20, 22) (20, 24) (29, 15) (29, 20) (29, 21) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 21) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 23) (7, 18) (16, 22) (16, 14) (4, 23) (12, 26) (19, 10) (19, 22) (19, 0) (22, 17) (22, 11) (22, 20) (22, 16) (22, 19) (8, 26) (8, 27) (8, 3) (8, 28) (8, 0) (28, 10) (28, 8) (14, 3) (14, 16) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (24, 3) (24, 20) (24, 13) (0, 19) (0, 8) (0, 21) (21, 29) (21, 25) (21, 0) (13, 1) (13, 24) (18, 15) (18, 27) (18, 11) (18, 7) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling the nodes accordingly.

The sorted nodes with their degrees are as follows:
(1: 4), (4: 1), (5: 0), (6: 2), (7: 4), (8: 5), (9: 4), (10: 3), (11: 4), (12: 1), (13: 2), (14: 2), (15: 3), (16: 2), (17: 2), (18: 4), (19: 3), (20: 3), (21: 3), (22: 5), (23: 3), (24: 4), (25: 3), (26: 4), (27: 5), (28: 2), (29: 3), (30: 0)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge and count the triangles formed by shared connections.

Based on the given graph and the properties of triangles, the total number of triangles is [110].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 8, 21>
<0, 19, 22>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 8, 21>
<1, 13, 24>
<2, 6, 11>
<3, 11, 22>
<3, 18, 27>
<4, 7, 23>
<7, 18, 27>
<8, 26, 27>
<10, 19, 22>
<14, 16, 22>
<15, 18, 27>
<19, 22, 26>
<20, 24, 29>
<21, 25, 29>
<22, 23, 26>
<22, 26, 27>
<23, 26, 27>
