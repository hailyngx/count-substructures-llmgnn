Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 11) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 12) (8, 19) (8, 10) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 19) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 12) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 18) (18, 2) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 7) (7, 3) (7, 19) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 9) (12, 11) (0, 17) (0, 4) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 15) (4, 5) (4, 0) 

Response:
The vertices and their corresponding number of connections are as follows:
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 4 connections
- Vertex 2: 3 connections
- Vertex 3: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 6: 4 connections
- Vertex 7: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 4 connections
- Vertex 10: 5 connections
- Vertex 11: 3 connections
- Vertex 12: 4 connections
- Vertex 13: 4 connections
- Vertex 14: 5 connections
- Vertex 15: 3 connections
- Vertex 16: 0 connections
- Vertex 17: 5 connections
- Vertex 18: 1 connection
- Vertex 19: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now proceed to count the triangles.

The total number of triangles is [18].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 4, 17>
<1, 3, 15>
<1, 5, 13>
<1, 9, 12>
<2, 14, 17>
<2, 14, 13>
<2, 17, 11>
<3, 9, 12>
<4, 5, 10>
<4, 10, 5>
<4, 10, 6>
<4, 0, 17>
<5, 10, 6>
<5, 10, 13>
<6, 10, 13>
<10, 9, 13>
<11, 12, 17>
