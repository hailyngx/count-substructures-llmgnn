Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 17) (6, 3) (6, 5) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 13) (7, 19) (7, 10) (10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 5) (11, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 18) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 2) (5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 19) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 2) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 18) (14, 1) (14, 18) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 2) (18, 10) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 14) 

Response:
The graph has the following structure based on the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6)
(15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 17)
(6, 3) (6, 5)
(9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 12)
(4, 13)
(7, 19) (7, 10)
(10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 5)
(11, 1)
(8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12)
(13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 18)
(17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 2)
(5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 13)
(2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 19)
(0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 13)
(12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 2)
(1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 18)
(14, 1) (14, 18)
(19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 2)
(18, 10) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 14)

Now, let's count the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by degree:
11, 4, 6, 7, 19, 0, 14, 3, 16, 12, 1, 9, 8, 18, 15, 17, 10, 5, 13, 2

Triangles:
[32]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 8>, <0, 8, 2>, <0, 8, 13>, <0, 13, 8>, <1, 11, 14>, <2, 9, 5>, <2, 9, 12>, <2, 9, 17>, <2, 9, 19>, <2, 12, 8>, <2, 12, 9>, <2, 17, 9>, <2, 17, 10>, <2, 19, 9>, <3, 6, 5>, <3, 6, 15>, <4, 13, 8>, <4, 8, 13>, <5, 9, 2>, <5, 9, 10>, <5, 9, 13>, <6, 3, 15>, <7, 10, 17>, <7, 10, 5>, <8, 0, 13>, <8, 0, 3>, <8, 2, 12>, <9, 2, 5>, <9, 2, 12>, <9, 5, 10>, <9, 5, 13>, <10, 7, 17>
