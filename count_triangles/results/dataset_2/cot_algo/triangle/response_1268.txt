Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 5), (7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 5), (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 8), (6, 7), (6, 5), (6, 8), (9, 4), (9, 8), (9, 2), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 9), (8, 0), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 0), (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 5), (0, 2), (2, 3), (2, 9), (2, 0)

Next, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0: degree 5
1: degree 2
2: degree 3
5: degree 6
6: degree 3
9: degree 3
3: degree 6
7: degree 4
8: degree 7
4: degree 4

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
[12]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<8, 9, 4>
