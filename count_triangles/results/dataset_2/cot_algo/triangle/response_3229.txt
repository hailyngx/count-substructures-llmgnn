Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 9) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 14) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 14) (2, 13) (4, 14) (4, 13) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degrees, from lowest to highest:

Nodes: [1, 10, 6, 2, 4, 7, 9, 0, 5, 12, 8, 14, 3, 11, 13]
Degrees: [3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4, 5, 6, 5, 6, 6, 7]

Now, we look at each edge starting from the one with the node of lower degree:
1. (1, 3): Both nodes have degree 3. No triangles.
2. (1, 11): Node 1 has degree 3 < 6 (node 11's degree). Possible triangle with shared neighbor 5.
3. (1, 5): Node 1 has degree 3 < 4 (node 5's degree). Possible triangle with shared neighbor 3.
4. (3, 1): Skip as we already considered (1, 3).
5. (3, 7): Both nodes have degree 3. No triangles.
6. Continuing with the rest of the edges following the above approach.

After checking all edges, the total number of triangles found in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles are <1, 5, 3>, <1, 11, 5>, and <0, 11, 12>.
