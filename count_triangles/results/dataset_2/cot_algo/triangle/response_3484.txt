Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 25) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 24) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 29) (7, 23) (1, 3) (1, 10) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 16) (25, 28) (21, 0) (21, 2) (21, 17) (12, 3) (12, 27) (12, 8) (27, 25) (27, 12) (27, 26) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 26) (8, 22) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (17, 21) (29, 7) (29, 13) (29, 5) (6, 15) (6, 28) (6, 18) (6, 13) (28, 25) (28, 6) (28, 0) (22, 8) (22, 26) (22, 16) (26, 27) (26, 8) (26, 22) (23, 7) (23, 20) (0, 21) (0, 28) (20, 23) (20, 13) (20, 18) (2, 4) (2, 21) (2, 10) (2, 14) (19, 24) (19, 13) (24, 15) (24, 19) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 16) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 18) (14, 16) (18, 6) (18, 20) (18, 14) (5, 29) (16, 25) (16, 22) (16, 9) (16, 14) (11, 4) (11, 9) (13, 29) (13, 6) (13, 20) (13, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will involve sorting the vertices by their number of connections and then relabeling them accordingly. The sorted vertices with their respective degrees are as follows:

Vertex 21: degree 3
Vertex 5: degree 3
Vertex 11: degree 3
Vertex 3: degree 4
Vertex 17: degree 4
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 10: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 4
Vertex 12: degree 4
Vertex 19: degree 4
Vertex 20: degree 4
Vertex 27: degree 4
Vertex 29: degree 4
Vertex 25: degree 5
Vertex 6: degree 5
Vertex 8: degree 5
Vertex 22: degree 5
Vertex 26: degree 5
Vertex 24: degree 5
Vertex 13: degree 5
Vertex 4: degree 6
Vertex 14: degree 6
Vertex 0: degree 6
Vertex 16: degree 6
Vertex 18: degree 6
Vertex 15: degree 6
Vertex 9: degree 6
Vertex 28: degree 6
Vertex 23: degree 6

Considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will count the triangles now.

Total number of triangles: [84]
