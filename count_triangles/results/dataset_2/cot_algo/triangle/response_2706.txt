Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 9) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 1) (2, 0) (2, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 
(4, 12), (4, 0), (4, 14), (4, 11), 
(7, 12), (7, 10), (7, 13), 
(8, 13), (8, 11), (8, 6), (8, 12), (8, 3), 
(13, 7), (13, 8), (13, 10), (13, 9), 
(10, 7), (10, 13), 
(11, 4), (11, 8), (11, 3), (11, 5), (11, 6), 
(12, 4), (12, 7), (12, 8), (12, 1), (12, 9), 
(0, 4), (0, 14), (0, 5), (0, 2), 
(14, 4), (14, 0), (14, 9), 
(3, 8), (3, 11), (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 5), 
(1, 12), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 9), 
(6, 8), (6, 11), (6, 3), (6, 1), 
(2, 0), (2, 1), 
(5, 11), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 1), 
(9, 13), (9, 12), (9, 14), (9, 3), (9, 1)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes sorted by degree:
1(5), 2(2), 10(2), 14(3), 5(4), 0(4), 13(4), 7(3), 6(4), 3(5), 11(5), 12(5), 8(5), 9(5), 4(4)

Now, we will find the triangles:

Triangles: [21]
Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 5, 3>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <6, 8, 11>, <6, 8, 3>, <6, 8, 1>, <6, 11, 3>, <3, 8, 11>, <3, 8, 9>, <3, 9, 1>, <3, 9, 12>, <3, 1, 12>, <5, 9, 1>, <9, 12, 13>
