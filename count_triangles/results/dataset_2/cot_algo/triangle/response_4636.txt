The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 20) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 23) (3, 17) (3, 11) (25, 4) (25, 22) (12, 9) (12, 27) (12, 2) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 7) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 8) (22, 25) (22, 5) (24, 4) (24, 13) (21, 0) (5, 22) (5, 13) (5, 28) (13, 24) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 2) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 23) (2, 16) (8, 26) (8, 28) (28, 5) (28, 8) (28, 19) (28, 15) (29, 7) (7, 14) (7, 27) (7, 29) (0, 9) (0, 21) (0, 11) (0, 18) (20, 14) (20, 4) (18, 6) (18, 27) (18, 0) (18, 15) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 23) (16, 19) (23, 17) (23, 2) (23, 16) (15, 28) (15, 18) (15, 4) (4, 25) (4, 24) (4, 20) (4, 15) (4, 10) (10, 13) (10, 4) (19, 28) (19, 16) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. Now, let's construct the graph with the provided edges:

```
Graph:
0: [9, 11, 18, 21]
1: [26]
2: [11, 12, 13, 16, 23]
3: [11, 17]
4: [10, 15, 20, 24, 25]
5: [13, 22, 28]
6: [9, 17, 18]
7: [14, 27, 29]
8: [26, 28]
9: [0, 6, 12, 16, 17]
10: [4, 13]
11: [0, 2, 3]
12: [2, 9, 27]
13: [2, 5, 10, 16]
14: [7, 17, 20]
15: [4, 15, 18, 28]
16: [2, 9, 13, 16, 19, 23]
17: [3, 6, 9, 14, 17, 23]
18: [0, 6, 15, 18, 27]
19: [16, 19, 28]
20: [4, 14, 20]
21: [0]
22: [5, 25]
23: [2, 16, 17, 23]
24: [4, 13]
25: [4, 22]
26: [1, 8]
27: [7, 12, 18]
28: [5, 8, 15, 19, 28]
29: [7]
```

Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: 86 [<1, 8, 26>, <2, 13, 16>, <4, 15, 28>, <4, 15, 18>, <4, 15, 28>, <4, 20, 24>, <4, 20, 24>, <4, 20, 14>, <4, 25, 22>, <4, 10, 13>, <4, 10, 13>, <4, 10, 15>, <5, 22, 25>, <5, 13, 10>, <5, 13, 10>, <5, 13, 24>, <5, 13, 24>, <5, 28, 15>, <5, 28, 19>, <5, 28, 8>, <6, 17, 9>, <6, 17, 14>, <7, 14, 17>, <7, 27, 12>, <9, 0, 11>, <9, 0, 21>, <9, 0, 18>, <9, 12, 27>, <9, 12, 2>, <9, 12, 27>, <9, 16, 13>, <9, 16, 2>, <9, 17, 6>, <9, 17, 3>, <9, 17, 23>, <9, 17, 14>, <9, 17, 23>, <9, 17, 3>, <9, 16, 13>, <9, 16, 2>, <10, 13, 24>, <10, 13, 24>, <11, 0, 2>, <11, 0, 18>, <11, 2, 13>, <11, 2, 16>, <11, 2, 23>, <12, 2, 13>, <12, 2, 27>, <13, 2, 16>, <13, 2, 23>, <14, 17, 7>, <15, 4, 24>, <16, 17, 23>, <16, 17, 23>, <16, 19, 28>, <16, 19, 28>, <16, 19, 28>, <16, 23, 2>, <16, 23, 17>, <16, 23, 2>, <17, 3, 11>, <17, 3, 23>, <18, 0, 21>, <18, 0, 27>, <18, 6, 17>, <18, 6, 27>, <18, 15, 28>, <18, 15, 4>, <19, 16, 19>, <19, 28, 5>, <19, 28, 8>, <20, 14, 17>, <20, 14, 4>, <22, 5, 25>, <23, 2, 16>, <23, 2, 16>, <23, 2, 17>, <23, 16, 17>, <24, 4, 13>, <24, 4, 13>, <28, 5, 8>, <28, 5, 19>, <28, 8, 26>]. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [86].
