Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 10) (27, 11) (27, 26) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 29) (8, 11) (13, 20) (13, 10) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 20) (11, 27) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 1) (23, 8) (23, 1) (22, 6) (22, 17) (22, 12) (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 20) (6, 22) (6, 28) (6, 17) (6, 12) (28, 6) (28, 16) (28, 12) (28, 15) (28, 20) (4, 5) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 16) (3, 19) (21, 25) (21, 2) (1, 11) (1, 23) (1, 15) (1, 9) (15, 28) (15, 1) (15, 29) (15, 14) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 2) (19, 5) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 24) (2, 21) (2, 16) (12, 22) (12, 6) (12, 28) (17, 22) (17, 6) (17, 4) (17, 7) (9, 1) (9, 20) (9, 7) (25, 21) (25, 19) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 29) (24, 8) (24, 19) (24, 7) (7, 17) (7, 9) (7, 24) (29, 8) (29, 15) (29, 14) (20, 13) (20, 10) (20, 5) (20, 28) (20, 9) (26, 27) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree, which is the number of connections each node has:

Node 0 has degree 2
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 1
Node 4 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 3
Node 10 has degree 5
Node 11 has degree 5
Node 12 has degree 4
Node 13 has degree 2
Node 14 has degree 3
Node 15 has degree 4
Node 16 has degree 3
Node 17 has degree 4
Node 18 has degree 2
Node 19 has degree 4
Node 20 has degree 5
Node 21 has degree 2
Node 22 has degree 4
Node 23 has degree 2
Node 24 has degree 3
Node 25 has degree 2
Node 26 has degree 1
Node 27 has degree 3
Node 28 has degree 5
Node 29 has degree 4

Based on the sorting, the vertices are now labeled as follows:
Node 3 -> 0
Node 26 -> 1
Node 0 -> 2
Node 21 -> 3
Node 18 -> 4
Node 3 -> 5
Node 5 -> 6
Node 22 -> 7
Node 16 -> 8
Node 24 -> 9
Node 25 -> 10
Node 13 -> 11
Node 1 -> 12
Node 27 -> 13
Node 29 -> 14
Node 14 -> 15
Node 15 -> 16
Node 19 -> 17
Node 17 -> 18
Node 6 -> 19
Node 23 -> 20
Node 7 -> 21
Node 4 -> 22
Node 9 -> 23
Node 8 -> 24
Node 12 -> 25
Node 28 -> 26
Node 2 -> 27
Node 26 -> 28
Node 11 -> 29

Now, let's count the triangles based on the given edges and the labeling above:
There are 18 unique triangles in the graph.

The total number of triangles is [18]. 
The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<0, 10, 13>
<0, 10, 11>
<8, 11, 10>
<8, 11, 1>
<8, 11, 27>
<8, 11, 10>
<13, 10, 20>
<13, 10, 11>
<10, 27, 11>
<10, 27, 11>
<10, 13, 20>
<10, 11, 1>
<10, 11, 13>
<10, 11, 1>
<10, 11, 27>
<10, 20, 28>
<10, 20, 5>
<10, 20, 28>
