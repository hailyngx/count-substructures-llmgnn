Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 18) (9, 2) (9, 12) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 18) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 18) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 16) (1, 16) (1, 14) (15, 19) (15, 7) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 6) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 17) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 4) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 18) (7, 10) (7, 15) (7, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 12) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 17) (13, 0) (13, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method steps are as follows:

1. Count the number of connections for each node:
   - Node 0: 4 connections
   - Node 1: 2 connections
   - Node 2: 5 connections
   - Node 3: 3 connections
   - Node 4: 2 connections
   - Node 5: 2 connections
   - Node 6: 3 connections
   - Node 7: 3 connections
   - Node 8: 4 connections
   - Node 9: 2 connections
   - Node 10: 3 connections
   - Node 11: 2 connections
   - Node 12: 3 connections
   - Node 13: 2 connections
   - Node 14: 3 connections
   - Node 15: 2 connections
   - Node 16: 4 connections
   - Node 17: 3 connections
   - Node 18: 5 connections
   - Node 19: 3 connections

2. Sort nodes based on their number of connections in ascending order:
   - Sorted nodes: 1, 4, 5, 9, 11, 13, 15, 7, 6, 3, 10, 12, 14, 17, 0, 16, 8, 19, 18, 2

3. Relabel the nodes accordingly:
   - Node 1: 0 connections
   - Node 4: 2 connections
   - Node 5: 2 connections
   - Node 9: 2 connections
   - Node 11: 2 connections
   - Node 13: 2 connections
   - Node 15: 2 connections
   - Node 7: 3 connections
   - Node 6: 3 connections
   - Node 3: 3 connections
   - Node 10: 3 connections
   - Node 12: 3 connections
   - Node 14: 3 connections
   - Node 17: 3 connections
   - Node 0: 4 connections
   - Node 16: 4 connections
   - Node 8: 4 connections
   - Node 19: 3 connections
   - Node 18: 5 connections
   - Node 2: 5 connections

4. Count the triangles:
   - Based on the connections, we can count the triangles using the edges provided:
     - <0, 2, 3>
     - <0, 2, 6>
     - <0, 2, 19>
     - <0, 4, 6>
     - <2, 3, 16>
     - <2, 8, 16>
     - <2, 8, 17>
     - <2, 8, 18>
     - <2, 11, 18>
     - <2, 18, 17>
     - <3, 16, 17>
     - <6, 4, 0>
     - <7, 10, 14>
     - <10, 7, 15>
     - <10, 14, 12>
     - <12, 14, 18>
   
5. Calculate the total number of triangles:
   - Total number of triangles: [15]

The unique triangles found are:
   - <0, 2, 3>
   - <0, 2, 6>
   - <0, 2, 19>
   - <0, 4, 6>
   - <2, 3, 16>
   - <2, 8, 16>
   - <2, 8, 17>
   - <2, 8, 18>
   - <2, 11, 18>
   - <2, 18, 17>
   - <3, 16, 17>
   - <6, 4, 0>
   - <7, 10, 14>
   - <10, 7, 15>
   - <10, 14, 12>
