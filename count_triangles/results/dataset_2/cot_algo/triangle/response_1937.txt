Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 9) (4, 14) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 12) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 12) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in the given graph efficiently. 

The nodes are sorted by their degrees in ascending order as follows:
Node 1: connections - 2
Node 4: connections - 2
Node 8: connections - 2
Node 5: connections - 5
Node 6: connections - 3
Node 3: connections - 3
Node 0: connections - 5
Node 7: connections - 5
Node 2: connections - 4
Node 12: connections - 4
Node 14: connections - 3
Node 10: connections - 5
Node 11: connections - 3
Node 13: connections - 5
Node 9: connections - 5

Since we have 15 nodes, we can count the number of triangles using the given edges. 

The total number of triangles is [21].

The unique triangles are:
<5, 9, 13>
<5, 8, 13>
<5, 10, 13>
<5, 1, 10>
<5, ,1 11>
<5, 1, 10>
<9, 6, 7>
<9, 6, 10>
<9, 4, 14>
<9, 4, 14>
<6, 7, 3>
<10, 6, 7>
<10, 6, 2>
<10, 12, 13>
<10, 13, 7>
<0, 13, 7>
<0, 7, 3>
<0, 12, 11>
<7, 3, 2>
<7, 13, 12>
<7, 13, 0>
