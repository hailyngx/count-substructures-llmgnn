Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections each vertex has. Then, we can relabel the vertices according to their sorted order.

The vertices sorted by degree are: 0, 1, 8, 9, 7, 4, 6, 2, 5, 3.

After relabeling, the edges in the new order are: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6).

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 7>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 3>
5. Triangle <1, 2, 7>
6. Triangle <2, 3, 6>
7. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
8. Triangle <4, 5, 8>
9. Triangle <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
