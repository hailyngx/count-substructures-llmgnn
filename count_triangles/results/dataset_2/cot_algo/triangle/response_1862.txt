Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
The edges can be visualized with the following graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) 
(7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) 
(6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) 
(9, 2) 
(10, 11) (10, 13) 
(11, 13) (11, 12) 
(8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) 
(13, 14) 
(1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) 
(3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 14) 
(5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) 
(2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) 
(0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 12) 
(14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) 
(12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) 

Next, we will construct the graph based on the Degree-Based Ordering method by sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

0: 4 connections
10: 2 connections
3: 3 connections
8: 3 connections
12: 4 connections
13: 4 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 6 connections
14: 6 connections
6: 5 connections
11: 5 connections
5: 5 connections
9: 4 connections
7: 4 connections
4: 4 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles with the Degree-Based Ordering method considering the sorted vertices. 

The total number of triangles is [14].

Unique triangles found are:
<4, 9, 14>
<6, 9, 2>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 6, 12>
<0, 3, 14>
<8, 12, 13>
<5, 12, 14>
<7, 4, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<6, 5, 1>
<11, 10, 13>
<5, 3, 14>
<14, 4, 13>
