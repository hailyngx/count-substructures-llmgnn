Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) 

Response:
The graph with nodes and edges described above is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 7), 
(9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 7), 
(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), 
(1, 8), 
(3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 2), 
(4, 8), 
(8, 0), 
(2, 3), 
(0, 7)

To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort nodes by their number of connections in ascending order:
Nodes by degrees: {0(2), 3(3), 7(3), 8(3), 6(4), 1(4), 4(4), 2(5), 9(6), 5(6)}

2. Relabel the nodes accordingly:
New labels: {0(1), 3(2), 7(3), 8(4), 6(5), 1(6), 4(7), 2(8), 9(9), 5(10)}

3. Check the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
Triangles found: 
<0, 2, 8>, 
<0, 7, 8>, 
<0, 3, 4>, 
<2, 4, 8>, 
<3, 4, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
