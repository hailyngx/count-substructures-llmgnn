Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees or number of connections. 

The degrees of the vertices in this graph are as follows:
0: 6 connections
1: 2 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 5 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 6 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 5 connections

Based on the degrees, the sorted vertices are: 1, 2, 7, 4, 5, 8, 3, 9, 0, 6

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles according to the method described earlier:

1. (5, 9): No triangles can be formed.
2. (5, 2): No triangles can be formed.
3. (5, 4): No triangles can be formed.
4. (5, 3): Triangle <3, 5, 6>.
5. (9, 5): No triangles can be formed.
6. (9, 6): Triangle <6, 7, 9>.
7. (9, 1): No triangles can be formed.
8. (9, 0): Triangle <0, 6, 9>.
9. (6, 9): No triangles can be formed.
10. (6, 3): No triangles can be formed.
11. (6, 2): No triangles can be formed.
12. (6, 8): Triangle <6, 7, 8>.
13. (6, 4): No triangles can be formed.
14. (6, 0): Triangle <0, 6, 7>.
15. (1, 9): No triangles can be formed.
16. (1, 7): No triangles can be formed.
17. (3, 5): Triangle <3, 5, 6>.
18. (3, 6): No triangles can be formed.
19. (3, 7): No triangles can be formed.
20. (3, 2): No triangles can be formed.
21. (3, 8): Triangle <3, 6, 8>.
22. (4, 5): No triangles can be formed.
23. (4, 6): No triangles can be formed.
24. (4, 0): Triangle <0, 4, 6>.
25. (7, 1): No triangles can be formed.
26. (7, 3): No triangles can be formed.
27. (7, 0): Triangle <0, 6, 7>.
28. (7, 8): Triangle <7, 6, 8>.
29. (8, 6): No triangles can be formed.
30. (8, 3): Triangle <3, 6, 8>.
31. (8, 7): Triangle <7, 6, 8>.
32. (8, 0): Triangle <0, 6, 7>.
33. (0, 9): Triangle <0, 6, 9>.
34. (0, 6): Triangle <0, 6, 7>.
35. (0, 4): Triangle <0, 4, 6>.
36. (0, 7): Triangle <0, 6, 7>.
37. (0, 8): Triangle <0, 6, 7>.
38. (2, 5): No triangles can be formed.
39. (2, 6): No triangles can be formed.
40. (2, 3): No triangles can be formed.

The total number of triangles inside brackets is [10].
Unique triangles found are <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 8>.
