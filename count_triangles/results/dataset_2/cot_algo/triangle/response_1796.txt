Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (4, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently. Let's sort the vertices by their degree:

0: degree 4
4: degree 1
6: degree 3
7: degree 3
5: degree 5
2: degree 4
8: degree 5
1: degree 5
3: degree 5
9: degree 5
10: degree 4
13: degree 5
11: degree 5
12: degree 4
14: degree 4

Using the degree-based ordering, we will check each edge to count triangles:

1. Edge (5, 9): Shared connections: 13. Triangle <5, 9, 13>.
2. Edge (5, 2): Shared connections: None.
