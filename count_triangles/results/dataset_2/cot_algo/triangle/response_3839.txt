Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 10) 

Response:
The vertices with their respective connections are as follows:

Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 6 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 10: 5 connections
Vertex 11: 4 connections
Vertex 12: 6 connections
Vertex 13: 3 connections
Vertex 14: 3 connections

Now, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees in non-decreasing order:
Vertices by degree: 9, 1, 5, 7, 14, 9, 15, 11, 8, 13, 6, 10, 11, 12, 12

Next, we go through each edge and count the number of triangles:
Triangles: [15]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15]. The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 4>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 13>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 2, 11>, <3, 2, 12>, <3, 2, 10>, <3, 11, 14>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 0, 8>, <4, 12, 10>, <4, 13, 10>, <6, 7, 4>, <8, 0, 14>, <12, 10, 13>.
