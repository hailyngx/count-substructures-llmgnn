Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 15) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 3) (19, 9) (19, 1) (19, 3) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 18) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 18) (16, 15) (16, 0) (11, 4) (11, 0) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 19) (3, 13) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 13) (6, 8) (6, 18) (2, 7) (1, 19) (1, 8) (1, 18) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 1) 

Response:
The graph formed by the given nodes and edges can be represented as follows:
- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
- Edges: [(5, 4), (5, 3), (9, 15), (9, 19), (14, 17), (14, 4), (17, 13), (17, 3), (17, 14), (7, 12), (7, 10), (7, 2), (12, 7), (12, 3), (19, 1), (19, 9), (19, 3), (10, 7), (10, 15), (10, 8), (10, 18), (15, 9), (15, 10), (15, 8), (15, 16), (13, 17), (13, 3), (13, 0), (13, 6), (4, 14), (4, 5), (4, 11), (0, 13), (0, 16), (0, 11), (0, 18), (16, 15), (16, 0), (11, 4), (11, 0), (3, 17), (3, 5), (3, 12), (3, 19), (3, 13), (8, 10), (8, 15), (8, 6), (8, 1), (6, 13), (6, 8), (6, 18), (2, 7), (1, 19), (1, 8), (1, 18), (18, 10), (18, 0), (18, 6), (18, 1)]

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections):
Node 16: degree 2, Node 4: degree 3, Node 5: degree 2, Node 2: degree 1, Node 14: degree 2, Node 17: degree 4, Node 12: degree 2, Node 1: degree 3, Node 0: degree 4, Node 3: degree 7, Node 6: degree 3, Node 7: degree 4, Node 18: degree 4, Node 8: degree 4, Node 15: degree 4, Node 10: degree 5, Node 19: degree 3, Node 9: degree 3, Node 13: degree 6, Node 11: degree 3

2. Relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 2: degree 1, Node 16: degree 2, Node 5: degree 2, Node 14: degree 2, Node 12: degree 2, Node 19: degree 3, Node 1: degree 3, Node 6: degree 3, Node 9: degree 3, Node 11: degree 3, Node 4: degree 3, Node 7: degree 4, Node 18: degree 4, Node 8: degree 4, Node 15: degree 4, Node 17: degree 4, Node 10: degree 5, Node 13: degree 6, Node 3: degree 7, Node 0: degree 4

3. Count the triangles:
- <3, 17, 13>
- <1, 8, 6>
- <0, 18, 6>
- <0, 18, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
