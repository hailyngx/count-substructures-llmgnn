Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 14) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 18) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 17) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 15) (8, 19) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 16) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 12) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 15) (18, 5) (18, 14) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 9) (16, 14) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 12) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 16) (0, 11) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 6) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 9), (4, 14), (7, 16), (7, 3), (7, 15), (7, 14), (10, 11), (10, 2), (10, 16), (11, 3), (11, 0), (5, 13), (5, 19), (5, 18), (13, 17), (13, 2), (3, 17), (19, 8), (8, 1), (9, 16), (17, 12), (12, 15), (18, 14), (1, 6)

Next, let's label the nodes based on their degree in increasing order:
Nodes and their degrees:
0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 3, 5: 3, 6: 2, 10: 3, 12: 3, 4: 4, 11: 3, 13: 3, 18: 2, 15: 3, 17: 3, 19: 3, 8: 3, 9: 3, 14: 4, 7: 5, 16: 4

Now, we will list the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method: []

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles: <4, 7, 16>
