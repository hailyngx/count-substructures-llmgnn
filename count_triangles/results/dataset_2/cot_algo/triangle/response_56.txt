Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) 

Response:
Let's list the nodes and their corresponding connections based on the given edges:

Node 0: 9, 6
Node 1: 9, 4, 7, 3
Node 2: 4, 7, 6, 8
Node 3: 9, 1, 6, 8
Node 4: 5, 9, 8, 2, 1
Node 5: 9, 6, 4, 7
Node 6: 5, 9, 3, 2, 0
Node 7: 5, 2, 1
Node 8: 4, 3, 2
Node 9: 5, 6, 4, 7, 1, 3, 0

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Sorted nodes:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 9: 7 connections

Now, we will count the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 5>
<2, 8, 4>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 5>
<3, 8, 4>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 5>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 7, 5>
<1, 7, 2>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 3, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<4, 3, 6>
<7, 2, 4>

Total number of triangles: [19]
