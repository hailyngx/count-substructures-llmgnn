Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 9) (16, 6) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 13) (7, 12) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 15) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 9) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 13) (19, 18) (19, 13) (15, 12) (15, 14) (14, 2) (14, 15) (6, 16) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 10) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 4) (0, 1) (0, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (9, 16) (9, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to count the number of triangles efficiently based on the information provided. 

Let us sort the vertices by their degree (number of connections):
1. Node 16: degree 2
2. Node 7: degree 2
3. Node 15: degree 2
4. Node 0: degree 2
5. Node 9: degree 2
6. Node 14: degree 2
7. Node 19: degree 2
8. Node 8: degree 2
9. Node 10: degree 2
10. Node 4: degree 3
11. Node 3: degree 3
12. Node 17: degree 3
13. Node 13: degree 4
14. Node 6: degree 4
15. Node 12: degree 5
16. Node 5: degree 4
17. Node 2: degree 5
18. Node 11: degree 4
19. Node 1: degree 5
20. Node 18: degree 6

We will relabel the vertices from 0 to 19 based on their degree in increasing order.

Now, let's count the number of triangles. 
We will only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections to ensure we do not double-count triangles.

The triangles are:
1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 1, 8>
3. <0, 1, 3>
4. <3, 4, 6>
5. <3, 4, 10>
6. <2, 4, 10>
7. <2, 10, 6>
8. <2, 14, 15>
9. <6, 10, 12>
10. <12, 14, 15>
11. <1, 5, 11>
12. <5, 11, 18>
13. <11, 18, 19>
14. <11, 13, 18>
15. <13, 17, 19>
16. <12, 13, 17>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
