Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 27) (3, 28) (3, 17) (3, 29) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 9) (11, 12) (0, 28) (0, 5) (14, 13) (14, 25) (26, 21) (26, 6) (26, 8) (28, 3) (28, 0) (28, 9) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 24) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 27) (13, 6) (7, 24) (7, 27) (25, 14) (25, 21) (8, 26) (8, 20) (8, 29) (8, 27) (19, 22) (19, 15) (19, 12) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 6) (22, 19) (22, 17) (22, 21) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 6) (29, 3) (29, 8) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 4) (17, 3) (17, 22) (17, 24) (16, 18) (24, 5) (24, 7) (24, 17) (24, 18) (18, 16) (18, 24) (18, 23) (18, 27) (23, 15) (23, 18) (23, 21) (23, 20) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 28) (20, 8) (20, 23) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 22) (21, 23) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 7) (27, 8) (27, 18) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 15) (6, 26) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Then, relabel the vertices accordingly to determine the order in which to process the edges.

Here is the list of nodes sorted by their degrees (number of connections):
1. Node 16 (Degree: 1)
2. Node 1 (Degree: 1)
3. Node 7 (Degree: 2)
4. Node 20 (Degree: 2)
5. Node 10 (Degree: 3)
6. Node 4 (Degree: 3)
7. Node 11 (Degree: 3)
8. Node 0 (Degree: 3)
9. Node 14 (Degree: 3)
10. Node 3 (Degree: 3)
11. Node 23 (Degree: 3)
12. Node 28 (Degree: 3)
13. Node 15 (Degree: 3)
14. Node 17 (Degree: 3)
15. Node 24 (Degree: 4)
16. Node 2 (Degree: 4)
17. Node 5 (Degree: 4)
18. Node 21 (Degree: 4)
19. Node 22 (Degree: 4)
20. Node 6 (Degree: 4)
21. Node 12 (Degree: 4)
22. Node 13 (Degree: 5)
23. Node 27 (Degree: 5)
24. Node 18 (Degree: 5)
25. Node 29 (Degree: 5)
26. Node 8 (Degree: 5)
27. Node 9 (Degree: 5)
28. Node 25 (Degree: 5)
29. Node 26 (Degree: 5)
30. Node 19 (Degree: 5)

Now, we will process the edges according to the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles. 

After counting all the triangles, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [42]. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 27, 7>
<1, 27, 13>
<3, 17, 22>
<3, 17, 24>
<3, 22, 21>
<3, 19, 15>
<2, 6, 26>
<2, 12, 6>
<0, 5, 13>
<0, 28, 9>
<0, 28, 3>
<10, 2, 5>
<10, 2, 6>
<10, 9, 11>
<11, 9, 28>
<11, 12, 6>
<14, 25, 21>
<14, 13, 5>
<22, 19, 15>
<26, 8, 20>
