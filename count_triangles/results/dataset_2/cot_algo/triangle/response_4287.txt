- (0, 12) - (0, 8)

Let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Nodes: 16 < 0, 16, 15 > (Degree: 2)
Nodes: 3 < 3, 13, 14 > (Degree: 3)
Nodes: 2 < 5, 9, 2 > (Degree: 4)
Nodes: 4 < 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 4 > (Degree: 6)
Nodes: 9 < 0, 2, 13, 14, 4, 9 > (Degree: 6)
Nodes: 7 < 4, 6, 7, 12, 13, 7 > (Degree: 6)
Nodes: 1 < 1, 8, 10, 11, 17, 18 > (Degree: 6)
Nodes: 13 < 8, 12, 1, 17, 13, 18 > (Degree: 6)
Nodes: 18 < 3, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19 > (Degree: 6)
Nodes: 19 < 3, 6, 10, 16, 18, 19 > (Degree: 6)
Nodes: 0 < 3, 8, 10, 12, 14, 0 > (Degree: 6)
Nodes: 8 < 0, 1, 4, 6, 11, 8 > (Degree: 6)
Nodes: 10 < 1, 4, 10, 10, 17, 19 > (Degree: 6)
Nodes: 5 < 2, 5, 12, 16, 17, 2 > (Degree: 6)
Nodes: 6 < 6, 7, 9, 19, 6, 8 > (Degree: 6)
Nodes: 11 < 11, 13, 16, 18, 11, 8 > (Degree: 6)
Nodes: 12 < 11, 12, 12, 17, 5, 7 > (Degree: 6)

Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles:
<6, 8, 19>
<4, 7, 13>
<7, 13, 17>
<10, 17, 18>
<3, 18, 19>
