Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 18) (12, 4) (12, 6) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 5) (17, 1) (17, 0) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 14) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 11) (13, 7) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (18, 8) (18, 10) (18, 6) (0, 17) (0, 3) (0, 11) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 18) (10, 3) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 10) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 9) (11, 19) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 0) (16, 8) (16, 1) (6, 12) (6, 18) (14, 19) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 19. Based on the given edges, the degree of each node is as follows: 
Node 0: 4
Node 1: 4
Node 2: 5
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 4
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 3
Node 7: 4
Node 8: 3
Node 9: 4
Node 10: 4
Node 11: 5
Node 12: 3
Node 13: 1
Node 14: 1
Node 15: 4
Node 16: 2
Node 17: 2
Node 18: 4
Node 19: 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices are:
Node 16: 2
Node 17: 2
Node 13: 1
Node 14: 1
Node 6: 3
Node 8: 3
Node 0: 4
Node 1: 4
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 4
Node 5: 4
Node 7: 4
Node 9: 4
Node 10: 4
Node 12: 3
Node 18: 4
Node 19: 4
Node 2: 5
Node 11: 5
Node 15: 4

Using the sorted vertices, we can count the triangles:
- Node 16 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 15: <1, 15, 16>
- Node 17 does not form any triangles.
- Node 13 does not form any triangles.
- Node 14 does not form any triangles.
- Node 6 does not form any triangles.
- Node 8 does not form any triangles.
- Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 17: <0, 1, 17>
- Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 0, 5, and 15: <0, 1, 17>, <1, 5, 17>, <1, 15, 16>
- Node 3 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 5: <0, 3, 5>
- Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 7 and 10: <4, 7, 10>
- Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 1, 2, and 19: <1, 2, 5>, <2, 5, 19>
- Node 7 forms triangles with nodes 2 and 15: <2, 7, 15>
- Node 9 forms a triangle with nodes 10 and 11: <9, 10, 11>
- Node 10 forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 18: <4, 10, 18>
- Node 12 does not form any triangles.
- Node 18 forms triangles with nodes 10 and 19: <10, 18, 19>
- Node 19 forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 11: <5, 11, 19>
- Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 7: <2, 5, 7>
- Node 11 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 15: <0, 11, 15>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
