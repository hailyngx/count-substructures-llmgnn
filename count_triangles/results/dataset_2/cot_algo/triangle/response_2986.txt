Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
0: 4, 7, 3, 2, 5, 9
1: 4, 6, 3, 5
2: 7, 8, 0
3: 4, 6, 1, 5, 0
4: 0, 1, 3
5: 9, 6, 1, 0, 3
6: 5, 9, 1, 3, 8
7: 9, 0, 2
8: 6, 2
9: 5, 6, 7, 0

Now, we can count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices by degree: 8, 2, 1, 7, 4, 3, 6, 0, 5, 9

Triangles found: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
