Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 29) (22, 5) (22, 0) (22, 20) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 17) (9, 6) (9, 29) (3, 25) (3, 18) (25, 3) (0, 22) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (20, 22) (20, 29) (20, 1) (20, 23) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 19) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 27) (28, 23) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 17) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (1, 6) (1, 20) (1, 26) (1, 16) (26, 28) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 21) (5, 13) (5, 22) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 16) (24, 18) (29, 13) (29, 9) (29, 20) (29, 27) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 10) (18, 3) (18, 24) (18, 10) (18, 17) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 18) (10, 2) (11, 0) (11, 24) (11, 14) (14, 11) (17, 6) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 18) (16, 1) (16, 24) (16, 15) (21, 13) (21, 26) (27, 28) (27, 29) (2, 7) (2, 19) (2, 10) (15, 16) (23, 20) (23, 28) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges is constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
(13, 5), (13, 21), (13, 29), (22, 5), (22, 0), (22, 20), (6, 9), (6, 28), (6, 1), (6, 17), (9, 29), (3, 25), (3, 18), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 12), (20, 23), (4, 8), (4, 17), (8, 19), (28, 26), (28, 27), (7, 2), (12, 10), (12, 7), (1, 16), (26, 24), (5, 22), (24, 11), (24, 18), (29, 27), (19, 2), (18, 24), (10, 2), (11, 14), (17, 7), (16, 15), (21, 26), (23, 28)

Next, we need to find the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles. 

Degree-Based Ordering:
1. Sorting nodes by degree: (sorted nodes follow) 
0, 14, 15, 3, 9, 16, 19, 2, 4, 5, 8, 11, 12, 1, 6, 7, 10, 13, 18, 20, 21, 26, 27, 23, 24, 25, 17, 22, 28, 29

2. Going through each edge to find triangles:
- There are 18 triangles in the graph.
