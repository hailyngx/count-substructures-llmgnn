Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and labeling them accordingly.

The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is:
1. Node 5 (Degree 3)
2. Node 1 (Degree 2)
3. Node 8 (Degree 4)
4. Node 3 (Degree 3)
5. Node 7 (Degree 4)
6. Node 2 (Degree 4)
7. Node 6 (Degree 4)
8. Node 4 (Degree 5)
9. Node 9 (Degree 6)
10. Node 0 (Degree 7)

Now, we will go through each edge and check for triangles. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Based on the edges provided, we can count the number of triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 7>
4. Triangle <0, 4, 1>
5. Triangle <0, 5, 3>
6. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
7. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
8. Triangle <2, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in total. 
The output is [8].
