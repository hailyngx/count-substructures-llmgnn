Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 1) (11, 18) (11, 4) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 6) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 15) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 9) (5, 13) (5, 14) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (12, 2) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 19) (19, 18) (19, 12) (19, 1) (0, 12) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 15) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 16) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 14) (9, 18) (9, 3) (9, 7) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 13) (6, 17) (6, 7) (15, 8) (15, 2) (15, 0) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections), as follows:

Vertices sorted by degree:
1. 7, degree 2
2. 10, degree 2
3. 11, degree 2
4. 14, degree 2
5. 18, degree 5
6. 4, degree 3
7. 5, degree 2
8. 8, degree 3
9. 12, degree 4
10. 15, degree 3
11. 17, degree 3
12. 19, degree 3
13. 1, degree 3
14. 3, degree 4
15. 0, degree 4
16. 9, degree 3
17. 6, degree 3
18. 13, degree 4
19. 2, degree 4
20. 16, degree 3

Now, we will iterate through the edges in increasing order of the lower degree vertex and count the triangles formed.
