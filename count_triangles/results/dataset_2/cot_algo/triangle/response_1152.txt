Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. 

The vertices and their corresponding degrees are as follows:
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 5: 6 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections 
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections

Based on the ordering above, we will now examine edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. (1, 6) - Not counted because Node 1 has more connections than Node 6.
2. (5, 6) - Not counted because Node 5 has more connections than Node 6.
3. (5, 2) - Counted as triangle <2, 5, 6>.
4. (3, 1) - Not counted because Node 1 has more connections than Node 3.
5. (6, 1) - Counted as triangle <1, 6, 5>.
6. (9, 3) - Not counted because Node 9 has more connections than Node 3.
7. (4, 3) - Counted as triangle <3, 4, 5>.
8. (3, 2) - Counted as triangle <2, 3, 5>.
9. (8, 7) - Not counted because both nodes have the same number of connections.
10. (0, 9) - Counted as triangle <0, 5, 9>.
11. (2, 3) - Counted as triangle <2, 3, 5>.
  
Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <2, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 5>, <3, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 9>.
