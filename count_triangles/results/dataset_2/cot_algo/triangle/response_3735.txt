Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method sorts the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. The nodes are relabeled as follows: 

Node 0 -> Degree 4
Node 1 -> Degree 3
Node 2 -> Degree 4
Node 3 -> Degree 4
Node 4 -> Degree 5
Node 5 -> Degree 6
Node 6 -> Degree 2
Node 7 -> Degree 3
Node 8 -> Degree 5
Node 9 -> Degree 5

Now, we look at each edge and identify the shared connections to find the triangles:

(5, 9): Shared connection with 8 -> <5, 8, 9>
(5, 8): Shared connection with 0 -> <5, 0, 8>
(5, 1): No shared connections
(5, 0): Shared connection with 4 -> <5, 0, 4>
(5, 3): No shared connections
(9, 8): Shared connection with 2 -> <9, 2, 8>
(9, 2): Shared connection with 6 -> <2, 6, 9>
(9, 7): No shared connections
(6, 2): Shared connection with 4 -> <6, 4, 2>
(6, 4): Shared connection with 0 -> <6, 0, 4>
(4, 0): Shared connection with 7 -> <4, 0, 7>
(4, 1): No shared connections
(4, 3): No shared connections
(7, 9): Shared connection with 8 -> <7, 8, 9>
(7, 0): Shared connection with 5 -> <7, 0, 5>
(7, 3): No shared connections
(2, 6): No shared connections
(2, 8): Shared connection with 5 -> <2, 5, 8>
(2, 1): No shared connections
(8, 5): Shared connection with 0 -> <8, 0, 5>
(8, 2): Shared connection with 9 -> <8, 9, 2>
(8, 0): Shared connection with 4 -> <8, 0, 4>
(8, 3): Shared connection with 7 -> <8, 3, 7>
(0, 5): Shared connection with 4 -> <0, 4, 5>
(0, 3): No shared connections
(3, 5): No shared connections
(3, 7): No shared connections
(1, 4): No shared connections
(1, 2): No shared connections

The total number of triangles is [10], which are:
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 0, 8>
<5, 0, 4>
<9, 2, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<6, 4, 2>
<6, 0, 4>
<4, 0, 7>
<7, 8, 9>
<7, 0, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<8, 0, 5>
<8, 9, 2>
<8, 0, 4>
<8, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 5>
