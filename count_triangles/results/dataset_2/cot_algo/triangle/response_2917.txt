Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves relabeling the vertices based on their number of connections. 

The original labels and their corresponding degrees are:
- Node 0: 6 edges
- Node 1: 4 edges
- Node 2: 6 edges
- Node 3: 4 edges
- Node 4: 4 edges
- Node 5: 4 edges
- Node 6: 4 edges
- Node 7: 2 edges
- Node 8: 4 edges
- Node 9: 4 edges

After relabeling the nodes from least connected to most connected:
- Node 7 (2 edges)
- Node 1 (4 edges)
- Node 3 (4 edges)
- Node 4 (4 edges)
- Node 5 (4 edges)
- Node 6 (4 edges)
- Node 8 (4 edges)
- Node 9 (4 edges)
- Node 0 (6 edges)
- Node 2 (6 edges)

Following the method as described:
- Only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 
- Check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to count triangles.

By using this method, we find the total number of triangles to be [8], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <5, 8, 1>.
