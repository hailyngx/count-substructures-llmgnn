Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The graph with the provided edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 3), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 0), (3, 7), (3, 2), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 1), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 7), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 0), (7, 5), (7, 8), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 2), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 7), (9, 8), (9, 3)

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph using Degree-Based Ordering method:

Degree of each node:
Node 0: 4
Node 1: 3
Node 2: 5
Node 3: 5
Node 4: 4
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 5
Node 8: 3
Node 9: 2

Vertices by decreasing degree: 9, 1, 8, 6, 5, 4, 7, 0, 3, 2

Triangles (counted only once) [7]:
<0, 4, 3>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 3, 7>
