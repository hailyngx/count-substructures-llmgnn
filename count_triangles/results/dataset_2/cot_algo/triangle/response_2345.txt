Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Let's find all the triangles in the given graph.

Nodes sorted by their degrees (from least to most):
(5, 4), (9, 4), (4, 4), (0, 4), (2, 4), (8, 4), (3, 4), (1, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5)

Triangles found using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
[<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 0, 4>, <2, 1, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 0, 2>, <4, 1, 5>, <4, 1, 6>, <4, 1, 7>, <4, 1, 9>, <6, 0, 1>, <6, 1, 5>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 1, 5>, <7, 1, 6>, <7, 3, 5>, <7, 3, 8>, <7, 4, 8>, <8, 2, 4>, <8, 3, 5>, <8, 4, 7>, <9, 6, 7>]

Total number of triangles: [29]
