Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 16) (7, 5) (12, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 5) (14, 0) (14, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 10) (17, 0) (17, 3) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 16) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 1) (16, 18) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 10) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 18) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 10) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 3) (18, 0) (18, 16) (18, 11) (15, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in non-decreasing order. Then, relabel the vertices based on this sorting.

After labeling the vertices from 0 to 19, we can construct the graph as follows:

Vertices:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 5) 
(1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 16) 
(2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8)
(3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 10) 
(4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15)
(5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 13) 
(6, 9) (6, 5) 
(7, 9) (7, 16)
(8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 19)
(9, 16)
(10, 13)

Next, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
The total number of triangles in the graph is [15].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 9, 16>
<0, 5, 14>
<0, 5, 17>
<0, 5, 18>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<9, 16, 7>
<9, 16, 11>
<4, 9, 11>
<3, 10, 13>
<0, 17, 3>
<0, 18, 16>
<0, 14, 3>
<8, 11, 19>
<5, 6, 7>
