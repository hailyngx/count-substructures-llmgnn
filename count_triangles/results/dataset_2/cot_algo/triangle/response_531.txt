Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 5) (16, 12) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (14, 17) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 19) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (6, 16) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 18) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 7) (15, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 19) (19, 17) (19, 1) (19, 8) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 12) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 0) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 0) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 7) (0, 12) (0, 18) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their number of connections:

Node 11: 2 connections
Node 16: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 14: 2 connections
Node 17: 2 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 15: 1 connection
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 18: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 0: 2 connections

Since the optimization requires us to consider only edges where the vertex with the smaller label has fewer connections, we will consider the following edges that meet this condition:
- (11, 10)
- (16, 12)
- (5, 9)
- (14, 17)
- (10, 2)
- (6, 7)
- (3, 13)
- (1, 7)
- (8, 14)
- (19, 17)
- (4, 13)
- (12, 16)
- (18, 13)
- (7, 1)
- (2, 15)
- (0, 12)
- (0, 18)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by these connections:
1. <5, 9, 18>
2. <10, 2, 15>
3. <6, 7, 1>
4. <3, 13, 4>
5. <8, 14, 17>
6. <19, 1, 7>
7. <4, 13, 18>
8. <12, 16, 6>
9. <0, 12, 18>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
