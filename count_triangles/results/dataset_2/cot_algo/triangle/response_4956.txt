Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 19) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 3) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 11) (1, 16) (1, 9) (15, 19) (15, 14) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 17) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 12) (6, 2) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 17) (10, 13) (10, 3) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 3) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 19) (14, 15) (14, 19) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 11) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 12) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, ..., 19

Edges:
- 0: 16, 17, 11
- 1: 16, 9
- 2: 8, 12, 6, 3
- 3: 4, 2, 10, 19
- 4: 7, 5, 3
- 5: 4, 18, 11
- 6: 2
- 7: 4, 11, 19
- 8: 13, 2, 9, 18
- 9: 8, 1, 17
- 10: 13, 3
- 11: 7, 18, 0, 5
- 12: 13, 2, 16, 17
- 13: 8, 12, 10
- 14: 15, 19
- 15: 19, 14
- 16: 1, 0, 12
- 17: 9, 0, 12
- 18: 8, 5, 11
- 19: 7, 15, 14, 3

Now, let's list the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes by degree: 6, 1, 10, 14, 15, 9, 0, 5, 7, 4, 3, 11, 19, 17, 12, 16, 2, 18, 8, 13

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method with the given edges, we count the total number of triangles inside brackets []:
