Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 26) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 2) (1, 17) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 19) (0, 9) (7, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (21, 27) (21, 0) (21, 4) (20, 29) (20, 8) (20, 2) (20, 10) (29, 20) (29, 22) (29, 14) (13, 17) (13, 25) (13, 23) (11, 25) (23, 13) (23, 26) (23, 2) (23, 10) (6, 26) (6, 8) (16, 18) (16, 19) (26, 15) (26, 23) (26, 6) (14, 29) (14, 22) (14, 24) (22, 29) (22, 14) (22, 5) (2, 27) (2, 17) (2, 20) (2, 23) (12, 17) (12, 9) (4, 21) (4, 9) (4, 28) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 4) (25, 13) (25, 11) (25, 8) (25, 24) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 24) (28, 4) (28, 19) (28, 5) (8, 17) (8, 3) (8, 20) (8, 6) (8, 25) (10, 20) (10, 23) (10, 18) (5, 22) (5, 28) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 28) (19, 24) (24, 14) (24, 25) (24, 18) (24, 19) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed based on the given information. Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 11: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 16: 2 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 29: 3 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 22: 4 connections
Node 28: 4 connections
Node 27: 4 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 21: 4 connections
Node 26: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 25: 4 connections
Node 24: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 20: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 23: 5 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 17: 6 connections
Node 19: 6 connections

By analyzing the connections, we find that there are a total of [41] triangles in the graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 27>
<0, 2, 15>
<0, 4, 21>
<0, 9, 4>
<1, 2, 17>
<9, 12, 4>
<9, 25, 24>
<10, 20, 23>
