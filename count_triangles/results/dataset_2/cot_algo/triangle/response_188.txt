Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (16, 1) (16, 18) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 7) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 18) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 17) (8, 2) (8, 17) (4, 0) (4, 17) (18, 16) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 10) (1, 16) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (17, 2) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 15) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 5) (12, 2) (19, 15) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 9) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 10) (9, 19) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given 20 nodes and 60 edges:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
- Edges: (11, 13), (16, 1), (16, 18), (3, 15), (15, 3), (15, 19), (15, 7), (5, 6), (5, 12), (5, 18), (5, 7), (6, 5), (6, 14), (6, 18), (6, 0), (2, 8), (2, 12), (2, 19), (2, 17), (8, 2), (8, 17), (4, 0), (4, 17), (18, 16), (18, 5), (18, 6), (18, 10), (1, 16), (1, 17), (1, 10), (1, 13), (1, 0), (17, 2), (17, 8), (17, 4), (17, 1), (0, 6), (0, 4), (0, 1), (0, 7), (7, 15), (7, 5), (7, 0), (12, 5), (12, 2), (19, 15), (19, 2), (19, 14), (19, 9), (14, 6), (14, 19), (14, 10), (9, 19), (10, 18), (10, 1), (10, 14), (10, 13), (13, 11), (13, 1), (13, 10)

Next, let's sort the nodes by their degree:

Node 9: 1 connection
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 16: 2 connections
Node 12: 2 connections
Node 11: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 19: 5 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 17: 5 connections
Node 18: 6 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 10: 6 connections
Node 13: 6 connections
Node 15: 6 connections

Now, let's count the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:
- We will only consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

Triangles: 
1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 1, 10>
3. <0, 1, 13>
4. <0, 6, 14>
5. <0, 6, 18>
6. <0, 7, 15>
7. <0, 4, 17>
8. <1, 10, 13>
9. <1, 13, 11>
10. <6, 14, 19>
11. <10, 13, 11>
12. <10, 13, 1>
13. <13, 11, 16>

Total number of triangles: [13]
