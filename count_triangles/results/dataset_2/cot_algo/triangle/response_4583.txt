Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 12) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 4) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (7, 12) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 12) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 4) (9, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 2) (13, 1) (13, 9) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 7, 11, 13, 2, 8, 0, 10, 12, 6, 9, 14, 1, 4, 5, 3.

The triangles in the graph are:
- <2, 8, 10>
- <0, 8, 12>

There are total of [2] triangles in the graph.
