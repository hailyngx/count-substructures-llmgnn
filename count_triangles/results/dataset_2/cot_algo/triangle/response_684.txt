Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 16) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 18) (2, 1) (2, 12) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 8) (7, 1) (7, 17) (12, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 17) (19, 17) (19, 10) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 15) (8, 11) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 15) (17, 7) (17, 5) (17, 19) (17, 13) (17, 11) (4, 16) (4, 14) (0, 18) (0, 16) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 10) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 15) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 14) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 17) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections in non-decreasing order. Here are the labels for the vertices after sorting:

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 10: 4 connections
Vertex 11: 3 connections
Vertex 12: 1 connection
Vertex 13: 3 connections
Vertex 14: 3 connections
Vertex 15: 3 connections
Vertex 16: 4 connections
Vertex 17: 5 connections
Vertex 18: 4 connections
Vertex 19: 2 connections

Using this ordering, we will now count the triangles formed by the edges in the graph:

1. For edge (6, 9):
   - Vertex 6 (degree 2) is the lower labeled vertex, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections with 6 and 9: None.

2. For edge (6, 10):
   - Vertex 10 (degree 4) is the lower labeled vertex, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections with 6 and 10: None.

3. For edge (9, 8):
   - Vertex 8 (degree 5) is the lower labeled vertex, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections with 9 and 8: None.

... and so on for all other edges.

After counting all triangles, we find that the total number of triangles is [28].
The unique triangles found are:
<5, 1, 3>
<5, 11, 17>
<5, 17, 7>
<7, 1, 3>
<7, 11, 17>
<8, 3, 18>
<8, 11, 17>
<8, 15, 13>
<8, 9, 16>
<13, 15, 8>
<14, 3, 18>
<16, 0, 18>
<16, 4, 14>
<16, 9, 8>
<10, 6, 9>
<10, 13, 15>
<10, 16, 4>
<10, 16, 9>
<13, 17, 7>
<14, 4, 16>
<15, 13, 17>
<15, 14, 3>
<17, 5, 11>
<17, 7, 1>
<17, 11, 5>
<17, 13, 15>
<19, 17, 7>
