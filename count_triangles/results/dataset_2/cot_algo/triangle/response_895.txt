Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows the given steps to count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree:
Node 5: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 0: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 5

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
Node 4 (degree 5) becomes Node 0
Node 0 (degree 3) becomes Node 1
Node 2 (degree 3) becomes Node 2
Node 3 (degree 3) becomes Node 3
Node 5 (degree 4) becomes Node 4
Node 7 (degree 4) becomes Node 5
Node 9 (degree 4) becomes Node 6
Node 1 (degree 4) becomes Node 7
Node 6 (degree 4) becomes Node 8
Node 8 (degree 4) becomes Node 9

By relabeling the vertices, let's write down the edges:
(4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 0) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8)

We can now count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
[Total triangles: 15]

Unique triangles found in the graph:
<1, 0, 4>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 0>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 1>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 4>
<9, 7, 5>
<9, 7, 6>
<9, 3, 6>
<9, 3, 4>
<9, 3, 8>
<9, 8, 7>
