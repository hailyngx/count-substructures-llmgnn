Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 19) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 27) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 2) (27, 22) (27, 18) (27, 19) (3, 25) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 29) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 29) (25, 12) (25, 18) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 1) (23, 20) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 11) (8, 21) (8, 1) (28, 29) (28, 18) (28, 5) (29, 3) (29, 25) (29, 28) (26, 10) (26, 7) (6, 21) (6, 17) (21, 8) (21, 6) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 26) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 2) (9, 25) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 12) (12, 25) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 5) (5, 28) (5, 12) (18, 27) (18, 25) (18, 28) (19, 13) (19, 22) (19, 15) (19, 27) (14, 11) (14, 7) (17, 3) (17, 6) (7, 26) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 20) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 7) (20, 23) (20, 7) (24, 8) (24, 0) (0, 24) (1, 23) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 9) (2, 15) (2, 11) 

Response:
Solving for the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. The degree of each node is as follows:
   - Node 0: degree 1
   - Node 1: degree 4
   - Node 2: degree 2
   - Node 3: degree 4
   - Node 4: degree 2
   - Node 5: degree 2
   - Node 6: degree 2
   - Node 7: degree 4
   - Node 8: degree 5
   - Node 9: degree 3
   - Node 10: degree 5
   - Node 11: degree 3
   - Node 12: degree 4
   - Node 13: degree 3
   - Node 14: degree 2
   - Node 15: degree 3
   - Node 16: degree 3
   - Node 17: degree 2
   - Node 18: degree 3
   - Node 19: degree 4
   - Node 20: degree 2
   - Node 21: degree 2
   - Node 22: degree 4
   - Node 23: degree 4
   - Node 24: degree 2
   - Node 25: degree 5
   - Node 26: degree 2
   - Node 27: degree 4
   - Node 28: degree 3
   - Node 29: degree 4

2. Sorting the nodes in non-decreasing order of their degrees:
   - Lowest degree: 0, 4, 5, 6, 14, 16, 17, 20, 21, 24, 2, 26
   - Highest degree: 25, 8, 10, 22, 23, 27, 19, 1, 3, 9, 12, 28, 7, 11, 13, 15, 18, 29

3. Counting the triangles:
   - There are 44 triangles in total.

4. Unique triangles found:
   - <1, 10, 23>
   - <1, 2, 15>
   - <1, 8, 21>
   - <1, 8, 23>
   - <1, 9, 25>
   - <3, 10, 25>
   - <3, 10, 27>
   - <3, 25, 27>
   - <7, 11, 14>
   - <7, 11, 16>
   - <7, 16, 20>
   - <11, 14, 7>
   - <11, 14, 16>
   - <12, 16, 25>
   - <18, 25, 27>
   - <22, 23, 27>
   - <9, 10, 25>
   - <1, 8, 10>
   - <1, 8, 9>
   - <1, 10, 9>
   - <1, 11, 14>
   - <1, 2, 11>
   - <12, 16, 7>
   - <12, 16, 12>
   - <13, 19, 22>
   - <18, 25, 28>
   - <19, 13, 22>
   - <19, 13, 27>
   - <19, 15, 27>
   - <19, 22, 13>
   - <19, 22, 27>
   - <19, 27, 22>
   - <23, 20, 7>
   - <23, 20, 16>
   - <25, 3, 10>
   - <8, 1, 23>
   - <8, 1, 10>
   - <8, 1, 9>
   - <8, 10, 1>
   - <9, 25, 1>
   - <10, 15, 19>
   - <10, 26, 7>
   - <10, 26, 17>
   - <16, 7, 20> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [44].
