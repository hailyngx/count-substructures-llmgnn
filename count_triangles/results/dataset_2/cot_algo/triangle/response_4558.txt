Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort the vertices based on their number of connections. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their degrees:

- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 5: degree 4
- Vertex 9: degree 4
- Vertex 1: degree 5
- Vertex 6: degree 5
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 5
- Vertex 0: degree 5

Now, we will count the number of triangles by following the method described earlier. 

Count of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles found: 
<1, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 4>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 1, 4>
<8, 1, 4>
<2, 1, 6>
