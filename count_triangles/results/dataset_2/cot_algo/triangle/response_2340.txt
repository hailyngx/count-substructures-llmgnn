Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 5) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
The relabeled graph based on the degree-based ordering method is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 4, 8, 6, 9, 7, 2, 3, 1, 5

Edges: (0, 1), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 7), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 9), (8, 3), (8, 5), (9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 7>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <5, 8, 9>
