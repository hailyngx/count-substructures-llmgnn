Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 11) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 15) (7, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 18) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 8) (13, 17) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 14) (19, 8) (19, 1) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 9) (2, 12) (2, 6) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 15) (12, 1) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 0) (18, 10) (18, 12) (3, 6) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 3) (5, 14) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 15) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 16) (16, 4) (16, 1) (15, 4) (15, 12) (15, 5) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
(0, 10), 
(0, 13), 
(0, 9),
(1, 12),
(1, 16),
(1, 19),
(2, 6),
(2, 12),
(3, 6),
(4, 5),
(4, 15),
(4, 16),
(5, 8),
(5, 11),
(5, 14),
(5, 15),
(6, 2),
(6, 3),
(6, 13),
(7, 11),
(8, 5),
(8, 10),
(8, 11),
(8, 19),
(9, 0),
(9, 13),
(9, 14),
(10, 0),
(10, 18),
(10, 8),
(11, 5),
(11, 7),
(11, 8),
(11, 17),
(12, 1),
(12, 15),
(12, 18),
(13, 0),
(13, 6),
(13, 9),
(13, 17),
(14, 17),
(14, 19),
(14, 5),
(14, 9),
(15, 4),
(15, 5),
(15, 12),
(16, 1),
(16, 4),
(17, 11),
(17, 13),
(17, 14),
(18, 10),
(18, 12),
(19, 1),
(19, 8),
(19, 14)

Next, we will create a list of nodes sorted by their degree:

Nodes by degree: [(3, 2), (7, 2), (16, 2), (18, 2), (19, 2), (1, 3), (4, 3), (6, 3), (9, 3), (15, 3), (0, 4), (12, 4), (10, 4), (13, 4), (17, 4), (2, 5), (8, 5), (11, 5), (5, 6), (14, 6)]

Now, we will count the triangles formed by iterating through the edges:

Total number of triangles: [14]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 10, 13>
<1, 12, 16>
<1, 12, 19>
<2, 6, 13>
<4, 5, 15>
<4, 5, 16>
<4, 15, 12>
<5, 8, 11>
<5, 8, 15>
<5, 8, 19>
<5, 11, 8>
<5, 11, 17>
<5, 14, 9>
<5, 14, 17>
