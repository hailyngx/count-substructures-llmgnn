Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 8) (11, 15) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 13) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 2) (1, 15) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 12) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 16) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 16) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 12) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 6) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (3, 18) (3, 6) (3, 8) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (9, 17) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 12) (6, 3) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph. Let's start by sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices in ascending order of degrees: 
(11, 6, 7, 18, 19, 1, 10, 2, 12, 0, 3, 8, 5, 9, 13, 15, 16, 4, 17, 14)

Next, we will analyze the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

1. (0, 2) - vertices (0) and (2) share a common connection (4) forming a triangle <0, 2, 4>.
2. (0, 4) - vertices (0) and (4) share common connections (2) and (13) forming two triangles <0, 2, 4> and <0, 4, 13>.
3. (1, 2) - vertices (1) and (2) have a common connection (15) forming a triangle <1, 2, 15>.
4. (4, 0) - vertices (0) and (4) share a common connection (2) forming a triangle <0, 2, 4>.
5. (5, 4) - vertices (4) and (5) share common connections (19) and (16) forming two triangles <4, 5, 19> and <4, 5, 16>.
6. (13, 16) - vertices (13) and (16) have a common connection (9) forming a triangle <13, 16, 9>.

[Total number of triangles: 6]
