Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (4, 13) (4, 0) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 9) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 1) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (6, 13) (6, 14) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections, then relabeling them accordingly. 

Based on the given graph, the nodes with their connections count are as follows:
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3

After relabeling the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order, the new list of nodes becomes:
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 3

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The total number of triangles is [14].

Unique triangles found in the graph are:
- <0, 7, 10>
- <0, 7, 5>
- <0, 7, 1>
- <0, 5, 10>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 5, 1>
- <0, 5, 4>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <7, 1, 5>
- <2, 5, 11>
- <2, 5, 14>
- <2, 5, 1>
- <11, 14, 1>
