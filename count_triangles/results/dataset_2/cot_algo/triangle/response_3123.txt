Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 19) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 17) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 12) (12, 8) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 10) (17, 0) (1, 14) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 18) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 13) (18, 13) (18, 3) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 14) (5, 3) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves ordering the nodes by their degree. Here is the ordering of nodes from least to most connections:
Node 2: 0 connections
Node 16: 1 connection
Node 12: 1 connection
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 17: 1 connection
Node 18: 2 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 19: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 15: 5 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 11: 5 connections

Now, we will count the triangles:
1. Triangles involving Node 16 (1 connection):
   - No triangles as this node does not have enough connections.
   
2. Triangles involving Node 12, Node 1, and Node 17 (1 connection each):
   - No triangles formed as these nodes do not have enough connections.
   
3. Triangles involving Node 18 (2 connections):
   - No triangles as this node does not have enough connections.
   
4. Triangles involving Node 10 and Node 19 (3 connections each):
   - No triangles as these nodes do not have enough shared connections.

5. Triangles involving Node 8 (3 connections):
   - No triangles as this node does not have enough shared connections.

6. Triangles involving Node 7, Node 6, Node 13, Node 4, Node 3, Node 5, Node 9, and Node 14 (4 connections each):
   - No triangles found among these nodes.

7. Triangles involving Node 15, Node 0, and Node 11 (5 connections each):
   - There is one triangle: <0, 11, 15>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
