Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 4) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 2) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 14.

Here is the list of edges:
- 0: {10, 8, 12, 3, 1}
- 1: {11, 7, 0}
- 2: {9, 13, 5, 12, 14, 4}
- 3: {11, 7, 0}
- 4: {5, 2}
- 5: {6, 13, 2, 12, 4}
- 6: {9, 5, 8}
- 7: {9, 3, 14, 1}
- 8: {6, 10, 0}
- 9: {6, 2, 10, 7}
- 10: {9, 11, 0, 8, 13, 14}
- 11: {10, 3, 14, 1}
- 12: {13, 5, 2, 0}
- 13: {10, 5, 12, 2}
- 14: {10, 11, 7, 2}

Now, sorting the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes degree ordering: [4, 1, 3, 8, 12, 14, 7, 6, 0, 11, 5, 13, 9, 2, 10]

Now, we will use the degree-based ordering method to count the number of triangles and list the unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [17]

List of unique triangles found: 
<0, 8, 10>
<0, 12, 13>
<2, 5, 12>
<2, 5, 13>
<2, 12, 13>
<2, 8, 10>
<4, 2, 5>
<7, 9, 6>
<0, 10, 8>
<1, 0, 11>
<1, 7, 11>
<3, 0, 10>
<3, 0, 7>
<3, 10, 11>
<7, 14, 11>
<5, 12, 13>
<9, 10, 7>
