Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
0: 1, 2, 5, 9
1: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
2: 0, 5, 6, 9
3: 4, 6, 7
4: 1, 3, 5, 6
5: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
6: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
7: 3, 6, 9
8: 1, 5
9: 0, 1, 2, 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices are:

Nodes: 8, 3, 7, 8, 0, 4, 9, 1, 2, 6

Now, counting the triangles:

Triangles: [25]

Unique Triangles: <5, 6, 2>, <5, 4, 1>, <5, 9, 0>, <5, 0, 1>, <6, 2, 9>, <6, 2, 0>, <6, 2, 5>, <6, 4, 1>, <6, 4, 5>, <6, 7, 3>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 5, 0>, <6, 5, 2>, <6, 5, 8>, <2, 0, 5>, <2, 0, 9>, <2, 9, 7>, <2, 9, 1>, <2, 9, 0>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 4>, <4, 1, 5>, <4, 1, 9>, <1, 5, 9>
