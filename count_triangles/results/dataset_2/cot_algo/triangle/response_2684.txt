Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 15) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 13) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 15) (8, 0) (8, 15) (9, 14) (9, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (1, 18) (1, 6) (17, 3) (17, 12) (3, 19) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 14) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (13, 0) (13, 16) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and then relabeling them accordingly. Let's find the triangles in the given graph:

Vertices sorted by the number of connections:
0: 4 connections
8: 2 connections
13: 2 connections
9: 2 connections
19: 2 connections
16: 3 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 2 connections
1: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
17: 2 connections
11: 3 connections
18: 4 connections
5: 4 connections
7: 5 connections
12: 5 connections
10: 3 connections
15: 6 connections
14: 3 connections
2: 4 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start counting triangles by examining the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

Triangles found (in the format <vertex1, vertex2, vertex3>):
<0, 7, 18>
<0, 7, 15>
<12, 7, 5>
<10, 12, 5>
<10, 12, 3>
<10, 12, 11>
<10, 12, 17>
<10, 12, 5>
<10, 12, 11>
<10, 12, 4>
<10, 12, 3>
<13, 16, 5>
<13, 16, 2>
<14, 15, 7>
<14, 15, 10>

Total number of triangles: [14]
