Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 12) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by the number of connections each node has. Then, we will relabel the nodes accordingly.

The nodes with their respective degrees are as follows:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 6
Node 6: degree 5
Node 7: degree 7
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 2
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 6
Node 14: degree 4

Relabeling the nodes in increasing order of degree:
Node 9 -> Node 0
Node 4 -> Node 1
Node 8 -> Node 2
Node 11 -> Node 3
Node 12 -> Node 4
Node 0 -> Node 5
Node 1 -> Node 6
Node 2 -> Node 7
Node 14 -> Node 8
Node 10 -> Node 9
Node 13 -> Node 10
Node 3 -> Node 11
Node 5 -> Node 12
Node 6 -> Node 13
Node 7 -> Node 14

The edges to consider based on Degree-Based Ordering:
(1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2)
(2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3)
(3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 4)
(4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 1)
(0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8)
(7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8)
(12, 13)

Calculating the total number of triangles inside brackets []:
[6]

The unique triangles found inside <>:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 6, 7>
<3, 5, 11>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 13>
<3, 11, 13>
