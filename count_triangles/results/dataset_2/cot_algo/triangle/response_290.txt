Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 6), (4, 2), 
(7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 9), (7, 2), (7, 1),
(1, 7), (1, 9), 
(3, 7), (3, 9), (3, 5), 
(6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 0),
(9, 7), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 8),
(8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 9), (8, 2),
(5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 0),
(2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 5),
(0, 6), (0, 5)

Next, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 0: Degree 2
Vertex 1: Degree 2
Vertex 3: Degree 3
Vertex 5: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 4
Vertex 9: Degree 5
Vertex 2: Degree 5
Vertex 6: Degree 6
Vertex 7: Degree 7
Vertex 4: Degree 7

Now, we will count the triangles:

Triangles [13]
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 5, 3>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 7>
