Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
The graph constructed from the given edges and nodes is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 2), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 5), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 0), (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 8), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 2), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 8), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 2), (8, 0), (0, 4), (0, 1), (0, 8), (0, 9), (9, 1), (9, 0)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes sorted by degree: {9, 7, 6, 0, 8, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4}

Now, we will count the triangles:
Triangles: [8]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 8. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 6>.
