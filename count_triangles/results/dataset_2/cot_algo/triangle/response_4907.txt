Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 8), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Degree-Based Ordering:
Node 4 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 3
Node 3 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 5
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 0 has degree 4
Node 6 has degree 5
Node 5 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 5

Triangles:
[15]
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 8, 7>, <1, 6, 3>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 8, 7>, <1, 9, 4>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 7, 1>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <7, 8, 1>
