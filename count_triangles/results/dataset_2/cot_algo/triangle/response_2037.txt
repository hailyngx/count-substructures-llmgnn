Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 1) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 19) (4, 16) (4, 12) (4, 19) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 2) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 17) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 3) (0, 19) (12, 4) (12, 10) (14, 11) (14, 8) (18, 9) (18, 5) (17, 16) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (8, 7) (8, 14) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 10) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 0) (15, 5) (15, 17) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: (3, 6), (3, 17), (5, 13), (10, 12), (19, 0)
- 1: (1, 11), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 13)
- 2: (2, 9), (2, 10), (2, 13), (2, 17)
- 3: (3, 6), (3, 17)
- 4: (4, 12), (4, 16), (4, 19)
- 5: (5, 10), (5, 13), (5, 15), (5, 18)
- 6: (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 9)
- 7: (7, 1), (7, 8), (7, 19)
- 8: (8, 7), (8, 14)
- 9: (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 18)
- 10: (10, 2), (10, 5), (10, 12)
- 11: (11, 1), (11, 14), (11, 16)
- 12: (12, 4), (12, 10)
- 13: (13, 1), (13, 2), (13, 5)
- 14: (14, 11), (14, 8)
- 15: (15, 5), (15, 17)
- 16: (16, 11), (16, 4), (16, 17), (16, 19)
- 17: (17, 2), (17, 3), (17, 15), (17, 16)
- 18: (18, 5), (18, 9)
- 19: (19, 0), (19, 4), (19, 7), (19, 16)

After sorting vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels are:
0, 3, 8, 17, 14, 15, 1, 7, 19, 18, 10, 12, 2, 13, 6, 9, 16, 4, 11, 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the total number of triangles to be [20]:

<6, 9, 2>
<6, 9, 18>
<6, 9, 1>
<11, 16, 17>
<2, 9, 13>
<1, 13, 2>
<1, 13, 5>
<5, 13, 2>
<5, 10, 12>
<5, 18, 9>
<11, 16, 4>
<11, 1, 13>
<16, 19, 4>
<16, 17, 3>
<16, 17, 15>
<16, 19, 7>
<17, 2, 13>
<17, 2, 10>
<17, 2, 9>
<12, 10, 2>
