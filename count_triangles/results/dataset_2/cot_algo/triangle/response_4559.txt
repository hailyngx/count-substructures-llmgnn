Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 13) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 11) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 5) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 6) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their degree and relabeling them accordingly. 

Here is the list of vertices and their degrees in ascending order:
- Vertex 0: Degree 4
- Vertex 3: Degree 4
- Vertex 6: Degree 2
- Vertex 9: Degree 4
- Vertex 14: Degree 4
- Vertex 7: Degree 5
- Vertex 8: Degree 4
- Vertex 5: Degree 5
- Vertex 13: Degree 5
- Vertex 2: Degree 5
- Vertex 10: Degree 4
- Vertex 4: Degree 5
- Vertex 11: Degree 5
- Vertex 12: Degree 5
- Vertex 1: Degree 6

Following the degree-based ordering, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections to count triangles efficiently. 

Now, let's count the triangles using the given edges:

- Vertex 0: Connects with vertices 7, 8, 5, 4
    - (0, 7): Forms a triangle with shared connection 1
    - (0, 8): Forms a triangle with shared connection 1
    - (0, 5): No triangle
    - (0, 4): No triangle

- Vertex 3: Connects with vertex 13
    - (3, 13): Forms a triangle with shared connection 2, 5

- Vertex 6: Connects with vertices 14, 10
    - (6, 14): No triangle
    - (6, 10): No triangle

- Vertex 9: Connects with vertices 7, 2, 8, 4
    - (9, 7): Forms a triangle with shared connection 1
    - (9, 2): Forms a triangle with shared connection 13
    - (9, 8): Forms a triangle with shared connection 1
    - (9, 4): Forms a triangle with shared connection 12

- Vertex 14: Connects with vertices 1, 13, 6
    - (14, 1): No triangle
    - (14, 13): No triangle
    - (14, 6): No triangle

Hence, the total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [4].
The unique triangles found are <1, 7, 0>, <2, 9, 4>, <3, 13, 5>, <4, 9, 12>.
