Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 20) (1, 28) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 29) (21, 4) (15, 9) (15, 24) (15, 16) (27, 21) (27, 26) (27, 5) (27, 23) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 17) (22, 18) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 29) (8, 23) (8, 5) (8, 29) (8, 17) (23, 27) (23, 8) (23, 0) (24, 15) (24, 26) (26, 27) (26, 24) (26, 7) (0, 23) (0, 19) (7, 26) (7, 29) (7, 14) (16, 15) (16, 22) (16, 28) (16, 9) (28, 1) (28, 16) (28, 17) (28, 9) (14, 7) (14, 11) (19, 18) (19, 22) (19, 0) (19, 25) (19, 3) (17, 18) (17, 8) (17, 28) (25, 19) (25, 9) (25, 13) (11, 14) (11, 20) (4, 21) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (2, 10) (5, 27) (5, 8) (5, 20) (29, 21) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 7) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 28) (9, 25) (20, 1) (20, 11) (20, 5) (13, 25) (13, 12) (13, 3) (6, 18) (10, 12) (10, 2) (3, 19) (3, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their connections in ascending order:
   - Vertex 2: 2 connections
   - Vertex 10: 2 connections
   - Vertex 0: 3 connections
   - Vertex 4: 3 connections
   - Vertex 6: 3 connections
   - Vertex 12: 3 connections
   - Vertex 3: 3 connections
   - Vertex 11: 3 connections
   - Vertex 7: 4 connections
   - Vertex 5: 4 connections
   - Vertex 13: 4 connections
   - Vertex 14: 4 connections
   - Vertex 25: 4 connections
   - Vertex 8: 4 connections
   - Vertex 20: 4 connections
   - Vertex 18: 4 connections
   - Vertex 16: 4 connections
   - Vertex 26: 4 connections
   - Vertex 10: 4 connections
   - Vertex 9: 4 connections
   - Vertex 29: 4 connections
   - Vertex 22: 4 connections
   - Vertex 21: 5 connections
   - Vertex 1: 5 connections
   - Vertex 15: 4 connections
   - Vertex 24: 4 connections
   - Vertex 27: 5 connections
   - Vertex 17: 4 connections
   - Vertex 19: 5 connections
   - Vertex 23: 4 connections

2. Go through each edge and count the triangles:

   Triangles:
   - Total number of triangles: 33
