Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 5) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 17) (5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 7) (8, 15) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 16) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 17) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 19) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (19, 3) (19, 12) (13, 1) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (17, 18) (17, 7) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:  
Node 15 - degree 3  
Node 16 - degree 3  
Node 1 - degree 2  
Node 7 - degree 2  
Node 13 - degree 1  
Node 3 - degree 1  
Node 9 - degree 1  
Node 10 - degree 1  
Node 8 - degree 1  
Node 19 - degree 1  
Node 2 - degree 1   
Node 18 - degree 1  
Node 12 - degree 1  
Node 17 - degree 1  
Node 11 - degree 2  
Node 0 - degree 4  
Node 14 - degree 4  
Node 6 - degree 4  
Node 5 - degree 4  
Node 4 - degree 4  

So, the triangles in the graph are:  
[<0, 5, 14>, <0, 5, 18>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 14, 8>, <0, 14, 7>, <0, 14, 9>, <0, 14, 4>, <0, 7, 17>, <0, 7, 12>, <5, 6, 4>, <5, 6, 15>, <4, 6, 12>, <2, 6, 12>, <2, 6, 16>]  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
