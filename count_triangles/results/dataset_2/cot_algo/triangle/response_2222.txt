Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 0) (5, 0) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 1) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 1) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 1) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 10) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 5) 

Response:
Nodes sorted by the number of connections they have:

Node 5: 1 connection
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 11: 5 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles found in the graph.
