Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their connections:

Node 0: 4, 9, 2, 5  
Node 1: 3, 5, 9, 7  
Node 2: 3, 4, 6, 0  
Node 3: 1, 7, 6, 2  
Node 4: 8, 2, 9, 0  
Node 5: 1, 8, 7, 0  
Node 6: 3, 8, 7, 2  
Node 7: 1, 3, 6, 5  
Node 8: 4, 9, 5, 6  
Node 9: 1, 4, 8, 0  

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [6]

Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>
