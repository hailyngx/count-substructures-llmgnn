Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
- 0 connects to: 11, 25, 19, 9
- 1 connects to: 25, 11
- 2 connects to: 19, 9
- 3 connects to: 9, 17, 20, 19
- 4 connects to: 7, 15, 17
- 5 connects to: 18, 14, 21, 27
- 6 connects to: 22, 28, 21, 19
- 7 connects to: 4
- 8 connects to: 22, 29, 10
- 9 connects to: 2, 0, 3
- 10 connects to: 28, 24, 8
- 11 connects to: 0, 1
- 12 connects to: 23, 28, 13
- 13 connects to: 19, 12
- 14 connects to: 5, 21
- 15 connects to: 4, 22, 18, 26
- 16 connects to: 26
- 17 connects to: 4, 22, 3
- 18 connects to: 5, 15, 29
- 19 connects to: 0, 2, 6, 3, 13
- 20 connects to: 21, 24, 3
- 21 connects to: 6, 28, 14, 20, 5
- 22 connects to: 23, 6, 15, 17, 8
- 23 connects to: 22, 26, 12
- 24 connects to: 10, 20
- 25 connects to: 0, 1
- 26 connects to: 23, 27, 15, 16
- 27 connects to: 5, 26
- 28 connects to: 6, 21, 12, 10
- 29 connects to: 18, 8

Next, let's assign labels to the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Nodes with degree 1: 1, 7
- Nodes with degree 2: 14, 16, 24, 27
- Nodes with degree 3: 2, 3, 8, 11, 13, 17, 20, 25, 29
- Nodes with degree 4: 0, 5
- Nodes with degree 5: 4, 6, 18, 23
- Nodes with degree 6: 10, 12, 15, 22
- Nodes with degree 7: 21
- Nodes with degree 8: 9
- Nodes with degree 9: 19
- Nodes with degree 10: 28

Now we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- We will only consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.
- Count the number of triangles formed by shared connections.

The total number of triangles in this graph is [22].

The unique triangles found are:
- <3, 9, 19>
- <3, 19, 13>
- <3, 19, 0>
- <4, 7, 17>
- <4, 17, 22>
- <4, 15, 22>
- <6, 12, 28>
- <6, 19, 28>
- <6, 21, 28>
- <6, 19, 22>
- <6, 22, 15>
- <8, 22, 29>
- <10, 24, 20>
- <11, 0, 25>
- <12, 13, 19>
- <12, 23, 26>
- <12, 28, 6>
- <15, 18, 26>
- <15, 22, 4>
- <15, 26, 16>
- <18, 5, 27>
- <20, 21, 14>
