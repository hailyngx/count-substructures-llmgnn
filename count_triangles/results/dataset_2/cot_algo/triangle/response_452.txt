Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
Node 5 - 2 connections
Node 1 - 3 connections
Node 3 - 3 connections
Node 8 - 4 connections
Node 6 - 4 connections
Node 7 - 5 connections
Node 9 - 5 connections
Node 0 - 6 connections
Node 2 - 6 connections
Node 4 - 7 connections

2. Relabel the vertices:
Nodes are now: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

3. Count triangles:
- Triangle <0, 2, 3>
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle <0, 3, 4>
- Triangle <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle <0, 6, 8>
- Triangle <0, 6, 9>
- Triangle <0, 7, 9>
- Triangle <1, 2, 4>
- Triangle <1, 2, 7>
- Triangle <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle <2, 4, 9>
- Triangle <2, 6, 7>
- Triangle <2, 6, 8>
- Triangle <3, 4, 8>
- Triangle <4, 8, 9>
- Triangle <6, 7, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 18]
