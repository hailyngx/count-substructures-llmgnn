Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 8) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 6) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: <0, 13, 4, 12, 3, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 1, 11, 5, 2, 14>.

Calculating the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Triangle 1: (0, 13, 12)
- Triangle 2: (0, 13, 3)
- Triangle 3: (0, 12, 3)
- Triangle 4: (13, 12, 3)
- Triangle 5: (4, 12, 7)
- Triangle 6: (4, 12, 2)
- Triangle 7: (4, 7, 2)
- Triangle 8: (12, 7, 2)
- Triangle 9: (3, 10, 11)
- Triangle 10: (3, 10, 6)
- Triangle 11: (3, 11, 6)
- Triangle 12: (10, 11, 6)
- Triangle 13: (9, 1, 8)
- Triangle 14: (8, 1, 5)
- Triangle 15: (8, 5, 6)
- Triangle 16: (7, 6, 2)
- Triangle 17: (1, 14, 10)
- Triangle 18: (1, 14, 2)
- Triangle 19: (1, 10, 6)
- Triangle 20: (1, 14, 6)
- Triangle 21: (11, 5, 12)
- Triangle 22: (11, 12, 8)
- Triangle 23: (11, 8, 13)
- Triangle 24: (5, 14, 6)
- Triangle 25: (5, 6, 2)
- Triangle 26: (14, 6, 2)

The total number of triangles is [26].
