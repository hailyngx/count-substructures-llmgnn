Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 10) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 11) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 12) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 

Edges:
(0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 10), 
(1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 14), 
(2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 14), 
(3, 7), (3, 13), 
(4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 13), 
(5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 12), 
(6, 0), (6, 10), (6, 13), (6, 14), 
(7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 8), 
(8, 0), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 13), 
(9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 11), (9, 14), 
(10, 0), (10, 6), (10, 13), 
(11, 9), (11, 12), 
(12, 5), (12, 11), (12, 13), 
(13, 3), (13, 4), (13, 6), (13, 8), (13, 10), (13, 12), 
(14, 1), (14, 2), (14, 6), (14, 9)

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degrees:

Nodes by degree:
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 13: 6 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 4: 4 connections

Now, let's count the triangles: 

There are [12] triangles in the graph, and they are:
<0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 6, 13>, <0, 6, 10>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 13>, <2, 3, 14>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 12>, <4, 7, 8>, <6, 10, 13>
