Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees and relabeling them accordingly. 

The vertices are relabeled as follows:
- Vertex 7: Degree 2
- Vertex 4: Degree 4
- Vertex 1: Degree 3
- Vertex 3: Degree 4
- Vertex 6: Degree 4
- Vertex 9: Degree 4
- Vertex 5: Degree 4
- Vertex 2: Degree 5
- Vertex 8: Degree 5
- Vertex 0: Degree 5

Now, we can start counting the triangles by examining each edge in the graph. We will consider only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Count of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles:
<1, 8, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 5>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 0>
