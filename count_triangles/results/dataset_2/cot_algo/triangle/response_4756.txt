Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 12) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 8) (10, 3) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:
   
```
0: 9, 5, 2, 3, 1
1: 6, 11, 0, 14
2: 7, 13, 14, 0
3: 6, 5, 0, 10, 13
4: 6, 9, 7, 5
5: 6, 4, 0, 3, 14
6: 5, 1, 3, 4
7: 4, 2, 13
8: 9, 10, 12
9: 8, 4, 11, 13, 0
10: 8, 3
11: 9, 1, 12
12: 8, 11, 14
13: 9, 7, 2, 3, 14
14: 5, 2, 1, 12, 13
```

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices are:
```
0 ≤ 1 ≤ 2 ≤ 3 ≤ 4 ≤ 5 ≤ 6 ≤ 7 ≤ 8 ≤ 9 ≤ 10 ≤ 11 ≤ 12 ≤ 13 ≤ 14
```

Now, counting the triangles by checking for shared connections based on the sorted vertices:
- For edge (4, 6): <2, 5, 14>
- For edge (4, 9): <1, 2, 14>
- For edge (1, 6): <0, 5, 9>
- For edge (1, 0): <2, 5, 9>
- For edge (3, 0): <5, 9, 14>
- For edge (3, 10): <4, 6, 13>
- For edge (9, 8): no triangles
- For edge (9, 13): <7, 12, 14>
- For edge (5, 0): <2, 9, 14>
- For edge (5, 3): <0, 4, 14>
- For edge (2, 0): <5, 9, 14>
- For edge (2, 14): <5, 12, 13>
- For edge (7, 13): <2, 9, 12>

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [12].
