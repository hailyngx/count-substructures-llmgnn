Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in the given graph. 
First, we list the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:

Nodes: 
0 - degree 4
9 - degree 4
4 - degree 2
8 - degree 3
5 - degree 4
2 - degree 5
3 - degree 4
1 - degree 6
7 - degree 6
6 - degree 6

Now, we examine the edges by choosing edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:

(0, 9) - Shared connections: 1
(0, 3) - Shared connections: 1
(0, 2) - Shared connections: 1

(9, 2) - Shared connections: 1
(9, 1) - Shared connections: None

(4, 5) - Shared connections: None

(8, 0) - Shared connections: 1
(8, 1) - Shared connections: 1
(8, 6) - Shared connections: 1

(5, 1) - Shared connections: 1
(5, 2) - Shared connections: 1
(5, 6) - Shared connections: 1

(2, 6) - Shared connections: 2
(2, 3) - Shared connections: 1
(2, 0) - Shared connections: 1

(3, 7) - Shared connections: 1
(3, 0) - Shared connections: 1
(3, 1) - Shared connections: 1

(6, 1) - Shared connections: 2
(6, 5) - Shared connections: 1
(6, 2) - Shared connections: 2

(1, 7) - Shared connections: 2
(1, 6) - Shared connections: 2
(1, 9) - Shared connections: None

(7, 4) - Shared connections: None
(7, 3) - Shared connections: 1
(7, 1) - Shared connections: 2
(7, 6) - Shared connections: 2

This gives us a total of [28] triangles. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 3> 
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 9, 2> 
<2, 6, 1> 
<5, 6, 1> 
<5, 6, 2> 
<6, 1, 7>
<6, 1, 8>
<1, 7, 4>
<1, 7, 3> 
<1, 7, 6>
