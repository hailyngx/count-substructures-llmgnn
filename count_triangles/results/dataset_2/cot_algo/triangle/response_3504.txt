Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: <5, 1, 3, 7, 6, 2, 4, 8, 9, 0>.

The triangles found using Degree-Based Ordering method are:
<4, 8, 5>
<2, 8, 4>
<0, 9, 5>
<1, 6, 4>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 8, 2>
<0, 7, 9>
<7, 1, 0>
<9, 5, 2>
<9, 3, 6>

Total number of triangles: [12]
