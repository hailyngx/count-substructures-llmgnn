Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 0) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 10) (1, 21) (1, 0) (1, 7) (21, 1) (21, 9) (21, 12) (6, 17) (6, 25) (9, 16) (9, 21) (9, 14) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 25) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 7) (4, 12) (4, 18) (15, 10) (15, 5) (20, 29) (20, 3) (2, 8) (2, 28) (2, 25) (19, 13) (19, 26) (19, 23) (26, 19) (26, 7) (26, 17) (17, 6) (17, 26) (17, 29) (17, 22) (29, 20) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 12) (28, 11) (28, 2) (28, 5) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 26) (7, 25) (7, 23) (25, 6) (25, 8) (25, 2) (25, 7) (10, 16) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 24) (27, 29) (27, 3) (12, 21) (12, 4) (12, 29) (12, 18) (3, 20) (3, 27) (3, 14) (3, 22) (5, 15) (5, 28) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 24) (0, 11) (0, 1) (24, 10) (24, 14) (24, 22) (18, 16) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 12) (22, 17) (22, 3) (22, 24) (23, 19) (23, 7) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(11, 28), (11, 0), (16, 18), (16, 9), (16, 10), (1, 21), (1, 0), (1, 7), (21, 9), (21, 12), (6, 17), (6, 25), (9, 14), (8, 13),
(8, 2), (8, 25), (13, 19), (13, 7), (4, 12), (4, 18), (15, 5), (20, 29), (20, 3), (2, 28), (19, 26), (19, 23), (26, 17), (17, 22),
(29, 27), (28, 5), (7, 23), (3, 14), (10, 24), (18, 12), (22, 24)

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degree:
Node degrees:
0: 2, 1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 4, 4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 2, 7: 4, 8: 3, 9: 3, 10: 4, 11: 2, 12: 4, 13: 3, 14: 3, 15: 2, 16: 3, 17: 4, 18: 4, 19: 3, 20: 2, 21: 3, 22: 3, 23: 2, 24: 3, 25: 4, 26: 3, 27: 2, 28: 3, 29: 4

Node labels in increasing order of degrees:
0, 4, 5, 6, 11, 15, 20, 23, 27, 1, 2, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 21, 22, 24, 28, 3, 7, 10, 12, 16, 19, 26, 29, 17, 18

Now, as per the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges with the node with the lower label having fewer connections:

Triangles:
<7, 13, 19>
<7, 13, 26>
<7, 19, 26>
<3, 14, 24>
<3, 14, 9>
<3, 9, 21>
<12, 18, 4>
<22, 3, 14>
<17, 26, 19>
<17, 26, 7>
<17, 29, 27>
<17, 22, 24>
<24, 10, 18>
<22, 24, 10>
<22, 24, 14>
<18, 10, 16>
<18, 4, 12>
<25, 6, 17>
<25, 8, 13>
<25, 8, 2>
<25, 7, 1>
<25, 7, 26>
<25, 7, 23>
<25, 2, 8>
<25, 2, 28>
<25, 2, 28>
<25, 2, 8>
<25, 2, 28>
<25, 2, 8>
<25, 2, 28>
