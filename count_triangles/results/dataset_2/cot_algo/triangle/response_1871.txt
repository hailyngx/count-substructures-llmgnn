Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 20) (9, 16) (9, 23) (1, 3) (1, 29) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 0) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 25) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 28) (12, 29) (19, 29) (19, 25) (19, 24) (26, 13) (26, 20) (13, 26) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 15) (17, 20) (17, 23) (17, 8) (20, 9) (20, 26) (20, 17) (20, 28) (16, 9) (16, 28) (16, 29) (28, 3) (28, 12) (28, 20) (28, 16) (28, 23) (5, 23) (5, 27) (29, 1) (29, 12) (29, 19) (29, 16) (29, 21) (0, 3) (0, 22) (23, 9) (23, 17) (23, 28) (23, 5) (11, 13) (11, 15) (15, 7) (15, 13) (15, 11) (15, 24) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 21) (21, 29) (21, 4) (21, 22) (27, 5) (27, 8) (24, 19) (24, 15) (24, 10) (10, 24) (25, 18) (25, 19) (25, 8) (8, 17) (8, 27) (8, 25) (8, 22) (22, 0) (22, 21) (22, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees of connectivity. Let's apply this method to the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges provided.

Here is the sorted list of vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 2: 1 connection
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 11: 3 connections
- Vertex 10: 3 connections
- Vertex 27: 3 connections
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 26: 4 connections
- Vertex 19: 4 connections
- Vertex 18: 4 connections
- Vertex 17: 4 connections
- Vertex 16: 4 connections
- Vertex 15: 4 connections
- Vertex 14: 4 connections
- Vertex 9: 4 connections
- Vertex 8: 4 connections
- Vertex 1: 5 connections
- Vertex 28: 5 connections
- Vertex 25: 4 connections
- Vertex 24: 4 connections
- Vertex 23: 5 connections
- Vertex 22: 4 connections
- Vertex 21: 4 connections
- Vertex 20: 5 connections
- Vertex 13: 5 connections
- Vertex 12: 5 connections
- Vertex 4: 5 connections
- Vertex 3: 5 connections
- Vertex 29: 5 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles present in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
