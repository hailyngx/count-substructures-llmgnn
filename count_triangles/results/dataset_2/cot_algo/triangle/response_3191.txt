Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 15) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 18) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 15) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 16) (9, 4) (9, 19) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 1) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 14) (6, 10) (6, 17) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 19) (11, 13) (11, 15) (14, 8) (14, 3) (16, 10) (16, 17) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 18) (19, 4) (19, 9) (19, 17) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. 

The sorted list of nodes with their degrees is as follows:
Node 7: 1
Node 6: 2
Node 5: 3
Node 0: 3
Node 9: 3
Node 16: 3
Node 14: 3
Node 11: 3
Node 18: 5
Node 12: 5
Node 2: 5
Node 17: 5
Node 1: 5
Node 19: 5
Node 10: 6
Node 3: 6
Node 8: 6
Node 13: 6
Node 4: 7
Node 15: 7

Now, we will count the triangles by considering the edges in the order where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles is: [20]

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 2, 5>
<3, 10, 12>
<3, 8, 14>
<3, 10, 16>
<4, 9, 19>
<5, 12, 13>
<6, 10, 16>
<8, 14, 18>
<15, 13, 11>
<17, 16, 10>
