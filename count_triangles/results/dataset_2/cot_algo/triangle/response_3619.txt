Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees and then checking for triangles. 

Here is the process:
1. Sort the vertices based on their degrees from lowest to highest:
   Vertices: 5, 9, 4, 7, 3, 1, 8, 6, 0, 2

2. For each edge, check if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. If so, check for shared connections to form triangles:
   - Edge (5, 9): Both vertices have 4 common neighbors (1, 3, 7, 8). Here, we find 4 triangles: <5, 9, 1>, <5, 9, 3>, <5, 9, 7>, <5, 9, 8>
   - Edge (5, 1): Vertex 5 has 3 common neighbors with vertex 1 (3, 7, 8). Here, we find 3 triangles: <5, 1, 3>, <5, 1, 7>, <5, 1, 8>
   - Edge (5, 3): Vertex 5 has 2 common neighbors with vertex 3 (1, 4). Here, we find 2 triangles: <5, 3, 1>, <5, 3, 4>
   - Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 has 2 common neighbors with vertex 7 (1, 4). Here, we find 2 triangles: <5, 7, 1>, <5, 7, 4>
   - Edge (9, 8): Both vertices have 2 common neighbors (1, 2). Here, we find 2 triangles: <9, 8, 1>, <9, 8, 2>
   
3. Count the total number of triangles: 
   Total triangles: 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 11

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
