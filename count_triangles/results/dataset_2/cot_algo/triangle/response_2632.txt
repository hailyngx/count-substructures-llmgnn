Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degrees is: 4, 7, 6, 9, 1, 8, 5, 3, 2, 0.

Counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find:
- Edge (4, 7) forms triangles with nodes 1, 6, and 9. 
- Edge (4, 8) forms a triangle with nodes 3.
- Edge (4, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 6.
- Edge (4, 6) forms a triangle with node 9.
- Edge (7, 4) forms triangles with nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Edge (7, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 5.
- Edge (6, 4) forms a triangle with node 9.
- Edge (9, 7) forms a triangle with node 5.
- Edge (9, 6) forms a triangle with node 2.
- Edge (3, 9) forms a triangle with node 0.
- Edge (8, 3) forms a triangle with node 0.
- Edge (5, 8) forms a triangle with node 2.
- Edge (0, 8) forms a triangle with node 2.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].

Unique triangles found: <1, 4, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <0, 3, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <0, 2, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 6, 7>.
