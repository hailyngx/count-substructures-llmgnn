Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 4) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 7) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 12) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 10) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 10) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 11.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 2, 8, and 10.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 11, 1, and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 11, 14, 13.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 13, 2, and 10.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 2, and 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 14, 10, 11, 4, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 14, 1, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 12, and 4.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 14, 0, 12, and 2.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 11, 13, 1, and 10.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 12, and 4.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 11, 7.

Next, we will sort the nodes by their degree and relabel them, so that we can easily identify triangles. 

Sorted nodes by degree (least to most):
{0, 7, 9, 10, 8, 3, 4, 5, 2, 13, 12, 1, 14, 6, 11}

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

[Total number of triangles: 13]
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 11>
<0, 5, 13>
<1, 10, 12>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 14>
<2, 4, 10>
<2, 4, 13>
<2, 11, 12>
<3, 11, 14>
<4, 6, 10>
<6, 11, 14>
<6, 11, 3>
