Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 10) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 4) (14, 11) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 11) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges is as follows:

Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 8), (5, 11), (9, 2), (9, 10), (9, 1), (9, 7), (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 11), (1, 2), (1, 13), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 10), (3, 12), (3, 8), (10, 9), (10, 3), (10, 11), (10, 6), (10, 12), (10, 7), (11, 5), (11, 1), (11, 10), (11, 14), (11, 13), (11, 4), (7, 9), (7, 3), (7, 10), (12, 3), (12, 10), (12, 4), (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 4), (8, 5), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 0), (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 4), (14, 11), (6, 5), (6, 10), (6, 4), (13, 5), (13, 1), (13, 11), (4, 11), (4, 12), (4, 2), (4, 0), (4, 6)

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):
Nodes in increasing order of degree: 14, 0, 9, 7, 2, 6, 8, 13, 12, 4, 5, 1, 14, 11, 3

Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 8]
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<3, 7, 10>
<3, 10, 12>
<4, 6, 10>
<4, 6, 11>
<4, 11, 13>
<5, 8, 11>
