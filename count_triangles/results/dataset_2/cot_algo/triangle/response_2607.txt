Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:
```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 3), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 2), (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 6), (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 8), (6, 1), (6, 8), (0, 3), (0, 1), (1, 8), (3, 5), (2, 7)
```

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
```
Node 1 (degree 2): 3
Node 2 (degree 2): 4
Node 3 (degree 2): 8
Node 4 (degree 2): 0
Node 5 (degree 2): 1
Node 6 (degree 4): 2
Node 7 (degree 4): 5
Node 8 (degree 4): 6
Node 9 (degree 4): 7
Node 10 (degree 5): 9
```

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges:

- (3, 1): No triangles
- (3, 4): No triangles
- (3, 8): No triangles
- (0, 4): No triangles
- (1, 2): No triangles
- (5, 6): No triangles
- (6, 2): No triangles
- (6, 7): Triangle <2, 6, 7>
- (7, 5): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 1, and the unique triangle found is <2, 6, 7>. 

So, the output will be:
```
[1]
<2, 6, 7>
```
