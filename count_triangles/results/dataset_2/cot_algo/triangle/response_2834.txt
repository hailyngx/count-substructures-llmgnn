Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 12) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 10) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 10) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 10) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 1) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Vertices: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: [(4, 7), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 2), (7, 4), (7, 12), (7, 9), (7, 13), (7, 1), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 2), (6, 11), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10), (2, 14), (8, 2), (8, 12), (8, 3), (0, 11), (0, 9), (14, 2), (14, 1), (14, 9), (14, 12), (12, 7), (12, 8), (12, 14), (12, 13), (12, 10), (13, 7), (13, 5), (13, 12), (13, 11), (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 10), (1, 7), (1, 14), (1, 11), (1, 10), (11, 6), (11, 0), (11, 13), (11, 1), (9, 7), (9, 2), (9, 0), (9, 14), (10, 2), (10, 12), (10, 3), (10, 1)]

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices by degree:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 6
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 5
- Node 13: degree 4

Re-labeling vertices based on their degrees:
- Node 0: 0
- Node 1: 1
- Node 3: 2
- Node 8: 3
- Node 4: 4
- Node 6: 5
- Node 9: 6
- Node 5: 7
- Node 10: 8
- Node 2: 9
- Node 11: 10
- Node 14: 11
- Node 7: 12
- Node 12: 13
- Node 13: 14

Triangles and the total count:
