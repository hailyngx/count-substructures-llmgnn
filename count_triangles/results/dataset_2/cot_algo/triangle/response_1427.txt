Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Then we will proceed with counting the triangles based on the given edges. 

Let's label the vertices based on their connections from the least connected to the most connected:
Vertices: (connections)
0: 3
1: 4
8: 4
5: 4
7: 4
6: 4
3: 5
2: 5
4: 6
9: 9

Now, let's count the triangles formed by the edges in this graph:

Triangles:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 3>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 0>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 7, 0>
<1, 7, 3>
<2, 4, 1>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 4>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 7, 0>
<3, 7, 1>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 9, 6>
<5, 9, 2>
<6, 9, 4>
<7, 9, 0>

Total number of triangles: [28]
