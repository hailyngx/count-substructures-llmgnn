Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 1) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 13) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 3) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 2) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 12) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 14 for convenience. 

The Degree-Based Ordering:

Nodes sorted by the number of connections (degree):
0 (3) < 2 (3) < 3 (3) < 10 (3) < 8 (3) < 14 (6) < 5 (4) < 9 (4) < 1 (5) < 4 (5) < 6 (5) < 7 (5) < 11 (5) < 13 (5) < 12 (5)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering, we will go through the edges and count the number of triangles:

Triangles: [15]
Unique triangles: <0, 7, 11>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 5, 13>, <1, 11, 13>, <2, 0, 14>, <2, 3, 14>, <3, 11, 14>, <7, 5, 13>, <7, 11, 13>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 1, 4>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 9, 10>, <12, 4, 8>
