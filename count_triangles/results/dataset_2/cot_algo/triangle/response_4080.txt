Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 4) (13, 1) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 14) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph efficiently.

Here is the list of vertices sorted by the number of connections (degrees):
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 13: degree 2
Vertex 8: degree 3
Vertex 11: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 4
Vertex 14: degree 4
Vertex 0: degree 5
Vertex 2: degree 5
Vertex 12: degree 5
Vertex 9: degree 5
Vertex 1: degree 6
Vertex 4: degree 6
Vertex 10: degree 6
Vertex 7: degree 7
Vertex 5: degree 7

Based on the sorted vertices, we will count the number of triangles in the graph:

[Number of triangles: 10]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 14>
<1, 6, 13>
<2, 8, 1>
<2, 8, 3>
<2, 10, 7>
<4, 6, 1>
<7, 10, 11>
