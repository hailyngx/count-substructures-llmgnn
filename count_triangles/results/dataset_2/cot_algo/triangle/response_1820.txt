Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 21) (9, 12) (26, 19) (26, 15) (26, 3) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 15) (6, 19) (3, 26) (3, 25) (3, 0) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 0) (20, 25) (20, 11) (12, 9) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 1) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 2) (0, 3) (0, 25) (0, 4) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 29) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 21) (8, 7) (17, 29) (17, 7) (29, 4) (29, 17) (29, 23) (18, 27) (18, 4) (18, 24) (18, 13) (19, 26) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 23) (5, 12) (5, 24) (5, 15) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 23) (16, 1) (24, 6) (24, 18) (24, 5) (11, 20) (11, 7) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 14) (15, 26) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 23) (15, 2) (14, 7) (14, 21) (22, 10) (22, 21) (23, 29) (23, 19) (23, 1) (23, 15) (2, 27) (2, 11) (2, 15) (21, 9) (21, 8) (21, 14) (21, 22) (13, 18) (10, 22) 

Response:
The graph visualization described by the user is not available at the moment. However, I will proceed with counting the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method based on the provided edges.

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order from least to most, the labels for the nodes will be as follows:
Node 0 (Degree 3)
Node 1 (Degree 3)
Node 2 (Degree 3)
Node 5 (Degree 3)
Node 10 (Degree 1)
Node 13 (Degree 1)
Node 14 (Degree 2)
Node 16 (Degree 1)
Node 17 (2)
Node 18 (4)
Node 19 (4)
Node 20 (2)
Node 21 (4)
Node 22 (2)
Node 23 (4)
Node 24 (3)
Node 25 (2)
Node 26 (3)
Node 27 (3)
Node 29 (3)
Node 3 (4)
Node 4 (4)
Node 6 (4)
Node 7 (4)
Node 8 (5)
Node 9 (3)

Now, let's proceed with calculating the number of triangles in the graph using the provided edges and the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is: [19] 

The unique triangles found are:
<8, 21, 14>
<4, 8, 7>
<3, 8, 4>
<3, 8, 19>
<3, 19, 23>
<3, 0, 25>
<1, 12, 27>
<23, 29, 19>
<23, 29, 17>
<23, 19, 15>
<23, 19, 6>
<23, 19, 8>
<23, 19, 26>
<2, 27, 12>
<17, 7, 11>
<19, 26, 15>
<19, 8, 21>
<19, 8, 3>
<19, 8, 4>
<15, 5, 24>
