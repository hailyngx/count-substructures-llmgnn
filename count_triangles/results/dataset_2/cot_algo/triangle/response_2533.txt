Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: 2, 5, 6, 7
- 1: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- 2: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8
- 3: 1, 4, 5, 6
- 4: 3, 7, 8, 9
- 5: 0, 2, 3, 9
- 6: 0, 1, 2, 3
- 7: 0, 1, 2, 4
- 8: 2, 4
- 9: 1, 4, 5

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes in the order of degrees (from least to most):
0, 8, 9, 6, 8, 3, 5, 7, 1, 4

Using this order, the triangles can be found:
Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 5>
