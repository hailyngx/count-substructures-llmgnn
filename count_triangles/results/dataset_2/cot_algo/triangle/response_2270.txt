Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 22) (16, 8) (16, 9) (4, 11) (4, 5) (7, 16) (7, 21) (7, 10) (7, 27) (21, 7) (21, 13) (21, 9) (21, 12) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 3) (13, 21) (13, 8) (13, 29) (20, 25) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 14) (18, 15) (22, 16) (22, 28) (3, 8) (3, 26) (26, 3) (26, 28) (26, 10) (28, 8) (28, 22) (28, 26) (28, 0) (27, 7) (27, 25) (27, 24) (27, 10) (27, 6) (2, 12) (12, 21) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 17) (10, 7) (10, 26) (10, 27) (10, 12) (1, 11) (1, 29) (29, 13) (29, 1) (29, 0) (29, 14) (6, 27) (6, 14) (17, 11) (17, 12) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 24) (14, 25) (14, 29) (14, 6) (14, 15) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 24) (9, 16) (9, 21) (24, 27) (24, 0) (24, 15) (24, 5) (5, 4) (5, 25) (5, 24) (19, 20) (19, 25) 

Response:
The graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we need to sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. After relabeling the vertices, we can list the edges.

The sorted nodes with their degrees are as follows:

Node 2: degree 1
Node 18: degree 1
Node 6: degree 2
Node 16: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 22: degree 4
Node 20: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4
Node 21: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 26: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 24: degree 4
Node 25: degree 6
Node 10: degree 6
Node 0: degree 6
Node 27: degree 6
Node 15: degree 6
Node 29: degree 6
Node 11: degree 8
Node 28: degree 8

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:
