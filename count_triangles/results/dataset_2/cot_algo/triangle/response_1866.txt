Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: 4, 5
- 1: 4, 5, 6, 2, 8, 9
- 2: 4, 7, 5, 1
- 3: 6, 9
- 4: 7, 9, 0, 1, 6, 2
- 5: 6, 2, 8, 1, 0
- 6: 4, 5, 1, 3
- 7: 4, 9, 2, 8
- 8: 7, 5, 1
- 9: 4, 7, 1, 3

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Start from the node with the least connections:
Label the nodes as follows based on their connections: {3, 0}, {8, 6}, {7, 9}, {5, 1}, {2, 4}.
2. Proceed with each edge only if the lower labeled node has fewer connections.

Counting triangles with shared connections:
- Triangles: <4, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
