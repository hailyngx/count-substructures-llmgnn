Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 7),
(9, 8), (9, 1), (9, 0),
(4, 8), (4, 2),
(7, 3),
(1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 0),
(3, 6),
(8, 7),
(6, 0)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in increasing order:

Nodes based on degree:
3 (degree: 1)
6 (degree: 2)
8 (degree: 2)
7 (degree: 2)
1 (degree: 3)
9 (degree: 4)
4 (degree: 4)
2 (degree: 4)
0 (degree: 5)
5 (degree: 5)

Next, we will start counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 11]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 1>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
