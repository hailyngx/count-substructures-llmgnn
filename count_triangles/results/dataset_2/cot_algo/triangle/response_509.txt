Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 11) (0, 25) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 29) (27, 8) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 24) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 22) (3, 8) (15, 20) (15, 2) (15, 5) (15, 29) (20, 15) (20, 26) (20, 4) (20, 19) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 2) (28, 11) (28, 22) (28, 2) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 7) (26, 20) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 25) (26, 17) (6, 22) (21, 10) (21, 23) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 12) (10, 21) (10, 19) (25, 0) (25, 27) (25, 26) (25, 19) (16, 1) (16, 13) (24, 1) (29, 27) (29, 15) (29, 5) (2, 15) (2, 11) (2, 28) (2, 9) (7, 13) (7, 19) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 29) (19, 20) (19, 10) (19, 25) (19, 7) (17, 26) (17, 23) (17, 4) (22, 3) (22, 28) (22, 6) (22, 12) (23, 0) (23, 21) (23, 17) (12, 3) (12, 18) (12, 22) (4, 20) (4, 17) (8, 27) (8, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to first sort the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order. Then, we assign new labels to the nodes based on this sorting.

Nodes and their degrees:
(0: 4), (1: 3), (2: 5), (3: 5), (4: 3), (5: 5), (6: 1), (7: 3), (8: 2), (9: 2), (10: 2), (11: 3), (12: 3), (13: 3), (15: 4), (16: 2), (17: 3), (18: 3), (19: 4), (20: 4), (21: 2), (22: 4), (23: 3), (24: 1), (25: 4), (26: 5), (27: 4), (28: 3), (29: 3)

After relabeling according to degree-based ordering:
(6: 1), (8: 2), (9: 2), (10: 2), (24: 1), (1: 3), (4: 3), (7: 3), (16: 2), (17: 3), (18: 3), (21: 2), (28: 3), (0: 4), (15: 4), (19: 4), (20: 4), (23: 3), (11: 3), (13: 3), (2: 5), (5: 5), (26: 5), (27: 4), (29: 3), (12: 3), (22: 4), (25: 4), (3: 5)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by considering each edge. Since we are only processing edges that start from nodes with lower labels, we will not consider edges like (27, 0) because the node with label 27 has more connections than the node with label 0. 

The total number of triangles found is:
[42]
