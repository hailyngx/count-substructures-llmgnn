Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 23) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 28) (9, 16) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 29) (25, 3) (25, 13) (25, 18) (25, 10) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 27) (8, 6) (8, 20) (8, 17) (13, 25) (13, 4) (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 2) (27, 21) (27, 0) (27, 2) (22, 26) (22, 11) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 23) (24, 3) (24, 26) (24, 12) (24, 1) (1, 24) (1, 14) (1, 10) (17, 8) (17, 4) (18, 25) (18, 26) (11, 22) (11, 19) (11, 15) (23, 6) (23, 7) (23, 26) (16, 9) (16, 7) (5, 26) (5, 29) (15, 6) (15, 11) (15, 19) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 12) (29, 3) (29, 7) (29, 5) (28, 9) (28, 0) (12, 24) (12, 19) (12, 14) (20, 8) (20, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 2) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 10) (10, 25) (10, 1) (10, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 27) (2, 20) (2, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles involves first sorting the nodes by their number of connections from least to most. Let's relabel the nodes accordingly:

Nodes:
0 - 1 connection
5 - 1 connection
16 - 2 connections
19 - 2 connections
12 - 3 connections
20 - 3 connections
15 - 3 connections
27 - 3 connections
3 - 4 connections
28 - 4 connections
13 - 4 connections
17 - 4 connections
11 - 4 connections
18 - 5 connections
29 - 5 connections
7 - 5 connections
4 - 5 connections
21 - 5 connections
1 - 5 connections
14 - 5 connections
10 - 6 connections
26 - 6 connections
24 - 6 connections
25 - 6 connections
2 - 6 connections
23 - 6 connections
6 - 6 connections
8 - 6 connections
9 - 6 connections
22 - 6 connections

With this ordering, we can count the triangles in the graph:

1. Shared neighbor of (6, 9): No triangles
2. Shared neighbor of (6, 15): No triangles
3. Shared neighbor of (6, 2): No triangles
4. Shared neighbor of (6, 23): No triangles
5. Shared neighbor of (6, 8): No triangles
6. Shared neighbor of (9, 28): No triangles
7. Shared neighbor of (9, 16): No triangles
8. Shared neighbor of (3, 25): Triangle <3, 25, 13>
9. Shared neighbor of (3, 24): No triangles
10. Shared neighbor of (3, 29): No triangles
11. Shared neighbor of (25, 13): No triangles
12. Shared neighbor of (25, 18): No triangles
13. Shared neighbor of (25, 10): No triangles
14. Shared neighbor of (7, 21): No triangles
15. Shared neighbor of (7, 16): No triangles
16. Shared neighbor of (7, 29): Triangle <7, 29, 5>
17. Shared neighbor of (7, 23): No triangles
18. Shared neighbor of (21, 27): No triangles

24. Shared neighbor of (22, 26): No triangles
25. Shared neighbor of (26, 24): Triangle <26, 24, 12>
26. Shared neighbor of (26, 18): No triangles
27. Shared neighbor of (26, 5): No triangles
28. Shared neighbor of (24, 12): No triangles
29. Shared neighbor of (24, 1): Triangle <24, 1, 10>
30. Shared neighbor of (24, 1): No triangles
31. Shared neighbor of (17, 4): No triangles
32. Shared neighbor of (11, 19): No triangles
33. Shared neighbor of (11, 15): No triangles
34. Shared neighbor of (23, 26): No triangles
35. Shared neighbor of (16, 7): Triangle <16, 7, 29>
36. Shared neighbor of (5, 29): No triangles
