Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 3) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 13) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 13) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree. The sorted nodes are as follows:
Nodes: 3, 1, 12, 10, 7, 6, 0, 9, 14, 5, 2, 4, 11, 8, 13

Using the method mentioned earlier, we can determine the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles:
Total number of triangles: [23]
Unique triangles: <5, 4, 8>, <5, 11, 8>, <5, 3, 14>, <5, 4, 13>, <5, 8, 2>, <5, 8, 11>, <5, 8, 4>, <9, 0, 4>, <9, 13, 10>, <9, 13, 4>, <4, 13, 10>, <4, 2, 14>, <4, 2, 8>, <4, 0, 2>, <8, 2, 14>, <8, 2, 4>, <8, 11, 7>, <8, 11, 6>, <8, 11, 13>, <8, 11, 5>, <8, 12, 1>, <13, 6, 10>, <13, 11, 6>
