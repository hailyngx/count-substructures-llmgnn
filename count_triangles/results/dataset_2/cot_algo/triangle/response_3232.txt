Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 21) (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 28) (9, 12) (6, 11) (23, 22) (23, 25) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 29) (0, 2) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 18) (20, 2) (14, 0) (14, 25) (28, 9) (28, 29) (1, 17) (26, 3) (26, 7) (26, 4) (29, 0) (29, 28) (29, 15) (29, 4) (29, 10) (3, 26) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 16) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 21) (17, 1) (17, 24) (21, 22) (21, 11) (8, 20) (8, 24) (8, 12) (25, 23) (25, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 18) (16, 3) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 2) (24, 17) (24, 8) (24, 19) (2, 0) (2, 20) (2, 16) (2, 15) (19, 24) (19, 10) (7, 5) (7, 26) (7, 27) (15, 29) (15, 2) (15, 18) (10, 13) (10, 29) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 4) (27, 7) (18, 13) (18, 20) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 15) (4, 0) (4, 26) (4, 29) (4, 10) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Vertices: 1 (Degree: 0), 17 (Degree: 0), 6 (Degree: 1), 17 (Degree: 1), 27 (Degree: 1), 19 (Degree: 1), 1 (Degree: 1), 24 (Degree: 2), 26 (Degree: 3), 5 (Degree: 3), 7 (Degree: 3), 15 (Degree: 3), 4 (Degree: 4), 21 (Degree: 4), 8 (Degree: 4), 2 (Degree: 4), 16 (Degree: 4), 18 (Degree: 5), 12 (Degree: 5), 11 (Degree: 5), 10 (Degree: 5), 28 (Degree: 5), 23 (Degree: 6), 25 (Degree: 6), 29 (Degree: 6), 0 (Degree: 6), 20 (Degree: 6), 9 (Degree: 6), 22 (Degree: 6), and 13 (Degree: 6).

After relabeling the vertices, the edges to consider for counting triangles are: (1, 17), (6, 27), (1, 17), (6, 27), (6, 1), (17, 24), (26, 5), (5, 7), (5, 15), (7, 4), (4, 21), (4, 8), (21, 2), (8, 16), (8, 18), (2, 12), (16, 18), (16, 12), (16, 11), (18, 10), (18, 28), (18, 23), (12, 25), (12, 29), (12, 0), (11, 20), (11, 9), (11, 22), and (10, 13).

There are a total of [43] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<2, 4, 8>, <10, 13, 18>, <11, 12, 16>, <11, 12, 18>, <18, 20, 29>, <4, 8, 16>, <18, 12, 29>, <18, 12, 25>, <18, 12, 20>, <5, 7, 15>, <2, 12, 16>, <4, 7, 8>, <2, 21, 16>, <2, 8, 12>, <5, 7, 26>, <5, 7, 4>, <12, 11, 20>, <12, 11, 9>, <12, 11, 22>, <13, 10, 29>, <5, 7, 26>, <5, 7, 27>, <10, 18, 28>, <15, 18, 29>, <16, 12, 18>, <10, 18, 28>, <10, 18, 23>, <15, 4, 29>, <10, 18, 23>, <15, 2, 29>, <2, 21, 4>, <7, 4, 26>, <16, 12, 25>, <18, 12, 0>, <18, 12, 29>, <18, 12, 25>, <18, 12, 20>, <18, 12, 0>, <18, 11, 20>, <18, 11, 9>, <18, 11, 22>, <18, 20, 9>, <18, 20, 22>, and <18, 9, 20>.
