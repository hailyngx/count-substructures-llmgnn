Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: (1, 3, 4)
- 1: (0, 3, 5, 6, 9)
- 2: (3, 5, 9)
- 3: (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9)
- 4: (0, 3, 6, 7)
- 5: (1, 2, 7)
- 6: (1, 4, 8, 9)
- 7: (4, 5, 9)
- 8: (3, 6, 9)
- 9: (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8)

Now, let's count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [[count]]
