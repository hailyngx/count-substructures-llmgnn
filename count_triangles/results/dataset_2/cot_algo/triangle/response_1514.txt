Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 5) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 13) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 11), (6, 8), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 14), (9, 0), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 12), (3, 2), (8, 13), (8, 11), (13, 12), (13, 4), (13, 0), (0, 7), (0, 10), (7, 2), (7, 5), (12, 2), (12, 10), (10, 5), (5, 14)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles.

Degree-based ordering:
Nodes sorted by degree: 6, 7, 10, 11, 4, 0, 14, 5, 12, 3, 2, 1, 13, 8, 9

Triangles found: 
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 12>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 10, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 13>
<1, 12, 2>
<3, 2, 5>
<12, 2, 10>

Total number of triangles: [9]
