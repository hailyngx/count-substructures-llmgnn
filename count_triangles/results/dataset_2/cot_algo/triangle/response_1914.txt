Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: [{15, 27}, {15, 14}, {15, 17}, {15, 2}, {27, 16}, {14, 0}, {14, 11}, {17, 0}, {1, 3}, {1, 28}, {1, 19}, {3, 12}, {22, 23}, {22, 18}, {22, 4}, {22, 5}, {23, 0}, {23, 20}, {4, 9}, {4, 29}, {8, 6}, {5, 12}, {6, 28}, {0, 10}, {28, 24}, {24, 26}, {26, 24}, {21, 7}, {25, 19}, {10, 13}, {11, 21}, {2, 29}, {20, 21}, {13, 29}, {12, 16}]

Now, let's find the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method: 

1. Degree of each node:
   - Node 0: 4
   - Node 1: 4
   - Node 2: 2
   - Node 3: 2
   - Node 4: 4
   - Node 5: 3
   - Node 6: 3
   - Node 7: 1
   - Node 8: 1
   - Node 9: 3
   - Node 10: 4
   - Node 11: 4
   - Node 12: 3
   - Node 13: 4
   - Node 14: 3
   - Node 15: 4
   - Node 16: 2
   - Node 17: 2
   - Node 18: 3
   - Node 19: 4
   - Node 20: 3
   - Node 21: 3
   - Node 22: 5
   - Node 23: 3
   - Node 24: 3
   - Node 25: 1
   - Node 26: 3
   - Node 27: 2
   - Node 28: 4
   - Node 29: 4

2. Relabeling based on degree:
   - Node 7: 1
   - Node 8: 1
   - Node 2: 2
   - Node 3: 2
   - Node 16: 2
   - Node 17: 2
   - Node 27: 2
   - Node 25: 1
   - Node 4: 4
   - Node 5: 3
   - Node 6: 3
   - Node 1: 4
   - Node 12: 3
   - Node 18: 3
   - Node 20: 3
   - Node 23: 3
   - Node 24: 3
   - Node 26: 3
   - Node 9: 3
   - Node 11: 4
   - Node 13: 4
   - Node 14: 3
   - Node 15: 4
   - Node 0: 4
   - Node 10: 4
   - Node 19: 4
   - Node 21: 3
   - Node 22: 5
   - Node 28: 4
   - Node 29: 4

3. Triangles:
   - Triangles: 1
   - Unique triangles: <0, 10, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [1] as found in the unique triangle <0, 10, 13>.
