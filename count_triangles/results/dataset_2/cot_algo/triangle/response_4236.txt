Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 13) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 3) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 10) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 14) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 2) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we need to first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

Now, we will go through the edges and count the number of triangles formed by each edge. We will only consider cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
<0, 1, 14>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 14>
<1, 6, 14>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 11>
<7, 12, 14>
<7, 12, 13>
<8, 9, 11>
<8, 9, 3>
<8, 9, 4>
<2, 4, 13>
<2, 6, 11>
<2, 6, 14>

Total number of triangles: [15]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 14>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 14>
<1, 6, 14>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 11>
<7, 12, 14>
<7, 12, 13>
<8, 9, 11>
<8, 9, 3>
<8, 9, 4>
<2, 4, 13>
<2, 6, 11>
<2, 6, 14>
