Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the nodes from least to most connected is as follows: 

Node 2 < Node 7 < Node 4 < Node 5 < Node 8 < Node 0 < Node 1 < Node 3 < Node 9 < Node 6

Now, following the degree-based ordering method, we will check each edge to count the number of triangles. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, and we will count triangles based on shared connections.

After analyzing all the edges, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 8>
