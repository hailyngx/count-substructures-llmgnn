Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 18) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 7) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 3) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 16) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 15) (1, 15) (1, 18) (17, 8) (17, 13) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 12) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 19) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 10) (9, 18) (9, 10) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 12) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (19, 7) (11, 8) (11, 6) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 11) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 18) (10, 16) (10, 9) (4, 13) (4, 3) 

Response:
The graph given above has 20 nodes and 60 edges. To count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices by their degree (number of connections) from least to most and then follow the process mentioned earlier.

Here are the vertices sorted by degree:
Vertices: (1, 19, 0, 9, 10, 11, 7, 5, 4, 12, 17, 18, 16, 2, 3, 6, 15, 13, 8, 14)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This will help us count each triangle only once.

After checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we find the total number of triangles inside brackets [] to be [12]. 

Here are the unique triangles found inside <>:
<0, 8, 13>
<0, 13, 5>
<0, 14, 6>
<2, 7, 3>
<5, 12, 15>
<5, 13, 15>
<6, 11, 14>
<7, 3, 4>
<9, 10, 16>
<13, 17, 8>
<15, 12, 18>
<16, 10, 18>
