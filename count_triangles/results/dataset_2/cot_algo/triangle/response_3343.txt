Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 21) (26, 4) (4, 26) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 18) (0, 3) (0, 22) (0, 19) (27, 6) (22, 0) (22, 11) (22, 24) (23, 8) (23, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 24) (11, 22) (11, 17) (8, 23) (8, 29) (8, 15) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 29) (29, 8) (29, 17) (29, 20) (29, 14) (21, 26) (21, 25) (24, 22) (24, 10) (24, 15) (3, 0) (3, 28) (3, 16) (20, 29) (20, 13) (20, 19) (13, 4) (13, 20) (13, 2) (5, 26) (5, 23) (5, 18) (5, 28) (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 12) (6, 27) (6, 1) (6, 25) (14, 29) (14, 18) (14, 16) (28, 3) (28, 5) (28, 1) (28, 12) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 14) (19, 0) (19, 20) (19, 16) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 24) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 28) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 25) (25, 21) (25, 6) (25, 2) (25, 16) (16, 3) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 25) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: 
- 0: {3, 19, 22}
- 1: {6, 12, 28}
- 2: {10, 13, 25}
- 3: {0, 16, 28}
- 4: {7, 13, 17, 26}
- 5: {8, 18, 23, 26, 28}
- 6: {1, 25, 27}
- 7: {4, 15, 18, 26}
- 8: {5, 15, 23, 29}
- 9: {26}
- 10: {2, 12, 24}
- 11: {17, 22}
- 12: {1, 10, 28}
- 13: {2, 4, 20}
- 14: {16, 18, 29}
- 15: {7, 8, 24}
- 16: {3, 14, 19, 25}
- 17: {4, 11, 29}
- 18: {5, 7, 14}
- 19: {0, 16, 20}
- 20: {13, 19, 29}
- 21: {25, 26}
- 22: {0, 11, 24}
- 23: {5, 8}
- 24: {10, 15, 22}
- 25: {2, 16, 21}
- 26: {4, 5, 9, 21}
- 27: {6}
- 28: {1, 3, 12, 5}
- 29: {14, 17, 20}

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by degree in increasing order:
{9, 27}
{1, 7, 11, 23, 24}
{2, 3, 6, 10, 13, 15, 22, 23, 25, 28}
{0, 8, 16, 19}
{4, 5, 12, 26}
{14, 17, 20, 29}
{18, 21}

Triangles:
[18]

So, there are a total of 18 triangles in the given graph.
