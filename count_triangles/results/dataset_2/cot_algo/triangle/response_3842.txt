Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 20) (2, 11) (18, 19) (18, 20) (18, 1) (19, 18) (19, 29) (19, 27) (26, 7) (26, 0) (26, 4) (21, 24) (21, 13) (21, 25) (24, 21) (24, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (22, 6) (22, 29) (22, 1) (22, 8) (4, 26) (4, 27) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 3) (27, 19) (27, 4) (0, 26) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 8) (7, 26) (7, 0) (7, 25) (7, 10) (7, 5) (25, 21) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 6) (25, 15) (16, 0) (11, 2) (11, 24) (11, 8) (11, 17) (5, 7) (5, 23) (5, 17) (5, 10) (23, 5) (23, 29) (23, 20) (13, 21) (13, 9) (13, 10) (28, 10) (3, 4) (8, 22) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 15) (1, 18) (1, 22) (1, 4) (1, 25) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 12) (29, 19) (29, 22) (29, 23) (20, 2) (20, 18) (20, 23) (6, 22) (6, 25) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 28) (12, 9) (12, 17) (15, 25) (15, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count triangles in the graph efficiently. 

Here are the nodes sorted by their degrees:
- Node 16 has degree 1
- Nodes 12, 15, 28 have degree 2
- Nodes 6, 9, 18, 20 have degree 3
- Nodes 13, 14, 15, 17, 21, 24, 26, 28 have degree 4
- Nodes 5, 22, 23, 27 have degree 5
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 11, 19, 25, 29 have degree 6
- Nodes 3, 7 have degree 7

Let's count the triangles using the degree-based ordering method:

1. Consider the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
   - Triangle <0, 1, 4> formed by edges (0, 1), (1, 4), (0, 4)
   - Triangle <7, 25, 26> formed by edges (7, 25), (25, 26), (7, 26)
   - Triangle <4, 8, 25> formed by edges (4, 8), (8, 25), (4, 25)
   - Triangle <4, 14, 25> formed by edges (4, 14), (14, 25), (4, 25)
   - Triangle <5, 10, 23> formed by edges (5, 10), (10, 23), (5, 23)
   - Triangle <8, 11, 14> formed by edges (8, 11), (11, 14), (8, 14)
   - Triangle <1, 22, 25> formed by edges (1, 22), (22, 25), (1, 25)
   - Triangle <17, 5, 11> formed by edges (17, 5), (5, 11), (11, 17)
   - Triangle <13, 9, 10> formed by edges (13, 9), (9, 10), (10, 13)
   - Triangle <12, 9, 17> formed by edges (12, 9), (9, 17), (12, 17)

2. There are no more triangles to count, so the output is:
   Total number of triangles: [10]
