Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 7), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 0), (6, 3), (6, 2), (1, 4), (1, 8), (3, 4), (8, 2), (8, 0), (2, 7), (0, 0)

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes sorted by degree in ascending order: {4, 2, 0, 8, 6, 9, 1, 7, 3, 5}
