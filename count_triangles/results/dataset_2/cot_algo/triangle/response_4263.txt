Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct and sort the graph based on the degree of each node:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Degrees: 4, 4, 4, 5, 3, 7, 2, 4, 3, 4

Sorted Nodes based on degree: 6, 8, 5, 4, 0, 7, 1, 2, 9, 3

Now, we will check the edges according to the Degree-Based Ordering method:

<0, 3> - Forms a triangle with nodes 5, so one triangle <0, 3, 5>
<0, 7> - Forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 5, so one triangle <0, 3, 7> and <0, 5, 7>
<0, 8> - No triangles formed
<1, 2> - Forms a triangle with node 7, so one triangle <1, 2, 7>
<1, 3> - Forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 7, so one triangle <1, 3, 5> and <1, 3, 7>
<1, 7> - Forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 5, so one triangle <1, 3, 7> and <1, 5, 7>
<2, 7> - Forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 3, so one triangle <1, 2, 3> and <1, 2, 7>
<3, 4> - Forms a triangle with node 9, so one triangle <3, 4, 9>
<3, 5> - Forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 7, so one triangle <1, 3, 5> and <3, 5, 7>
<3, 7> - Forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 5, so one triangle <1, 3, 7> and <3, 5, 7>
<4, 9> - No triangles formed
<5, 6> - No triangles formed
<5, 8> - No triangles formed
<5, 9> - Forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 3, so one triangle <1, 3, 5> and <3, 5, 9>
<6, 8> - No triangles formed
<7, 9> - No triangles formed

Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
