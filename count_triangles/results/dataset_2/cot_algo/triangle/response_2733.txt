Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (14, 4) (17, 1) (17, 6) (10, 0) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 18) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 15) (1, 18) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 13) (19, 4) (19, 6) (0, 10) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 13) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 13) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 1) (18, 13) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 15) (6, 19) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort the 20 nodes based on their number of connections. Here is the sorted list:

Node 10: 1 connection
Node 11: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 17: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 16: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 12: 6 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 13: 6 connections
Node 18: 6 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the given edges, making sure to only consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:

Total number of triangles: [18]
