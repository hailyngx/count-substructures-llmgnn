Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 9) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 16) (25, 0) (8, 23) (23, 8) (23, 21) (0, 25) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 24) (14, 15) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 22) (17, 20) (17, 2) (17, 18) (4, 27) (4, 24) (4, 28) (27, 25) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 24) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 29) (7, 2) (20, 17) (20, 9) (20, 2) (20, 6) (9, 3) (9, 20) (10, 21) (10, 24) (21, 23) (21, 10) (21, 13) (16, 25) (16, 22) (6, 20) (6, 24) (6, 26) (24, 14) (24, 4) (24, 27) (24, 10) (24, 6) (19, 13) (28, 3) (28, 4) (28, 18) (28, 2) (28, 15) (18, 17) (18, 28) (18, 26) (26, 6) (26, 18) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (29, 27) (29, 7) (15, 14) (15, 28) (15, 13) (22, 1) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 12) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 7) (2, 20) (2, 28) (13, 21) (13, 19) (13, 15) (5, 22) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 22) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are as follows:

(5) 0, 5, 8, 18, 19, 23, 26, 29  
(4) 1, 6, 9, 10, 13, 16, 20, 21, 27, 28  
(6) 2, 14, 17, 22  
(5) 3, 4, 7, 11, 12, 15, 24, 25  

After checking the edges as per the given conditions of the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [26].  

The unique triangles found are:  
<2, 6, 24>  
<2, 6, 28>  
<2, 17, 28>  
<2, 22, 12>  
<2, 22, 16>
