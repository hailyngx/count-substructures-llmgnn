Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 13) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 5) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 11) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 5) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are as follows:
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 14 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 0 has degree 4
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 12 has degree 6
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 5
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 5
Node 11 has degree 4
Node 10 has degree 5
Node 5 has degree 5
Node 13 has degree 3
