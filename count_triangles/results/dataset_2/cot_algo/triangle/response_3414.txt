Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 6) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) 

Response:
[8, 1, 6, 10, 14, 4, 13, 12, 7, 0, 11, 3, 5, 9, 2]

Total number of triangles: [11]

Unique triangles: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 12>, <0, 6, 12>, <3, 6, 12>, <2, 3, 6>, <4, 6, 13>, <5, 7, 11>, <5, 7, 14>, <4, 10, 13>, <5, 8, 10>, <9, 10, 13>
