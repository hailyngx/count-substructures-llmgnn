Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 9) (13, 6) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 7) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 18) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 12) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 9) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 18) (10, 15) (15, 0) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 16) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 1) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 19) (16, 13) (16, 15) (6, 13) (6, 15) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 12) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the provided information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges:
- 0: {7, 15, 4, 18}
- 1: {14, 8, 12}
- 2: {17, 8, 19, 7}
- 3: {9}
- 4: {0, 12}
- 5: {11, 19, 18}
- 6: {13, 15}
- 7: {2, 0, 18, 9}
- 8: {17, 13, 2, 1}
- 9: {14, 13, 3, 7}
- 10: {15}
- 11: {5, 12}
- 12: {11, 4, 1}
- 13: {8, 16, 9, 6}
- 14: {17, 1, 9}
- 15: {0, 10, 6, 16}
- 16: {13, 15}
- 17: {14, 8, 2}
- 18: {0, 7, 5, 19}
- 19: {2, 5, 18}

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes by degree: [3, 10, 16, 4, 6, 7, 12, 0, 1, 11, 5, 14, 17, 9, 13, 15, 2, 8, 18, 19]

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Total number of triangles: [63]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 1, 12>
<0, 4, 12>
<0, 7, 18>
<0, 15, 16>
<1, 8, 12>
<5, 11, 19>
<15, 16, 6>
<7, 18, 19>
<13, 8, 17>
<13, 8, 2>
<13, 9, 14>
<13, 9, 7>
<15, 16, 13>
<18, 19, 2>
<18, 19, 5>
