Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (11, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 10) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be used to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, we will list the vertices and their corresponding degrees:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 5
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 5
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 6
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 2
Node 11: degree 1
Node 12: degree 6
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 3

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees (from the lowest degree to the highest):
Node 11 -> 0, Node 10 -> 1, Node 1 -> 2, Node 9 -> 3, Node 14 -> 4, Node 0 -> 5, Node 13 -> 6, Node 7 -> 7, Node 8 -> 8, Node 3 -> 9, Node 5 -> 10, Node 4 -> 11, Node 2 -> 12, Node 6 -> 13, Node 12 -> 14

Next, we will list the edges based on the new labeling:
(2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 5) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 11)

Now, we will count the triangles:
Triangles: 13

[13] 
Unique triangles: <5, 4, 7>, <2, 8, 7>, <4, 8, 7>, <5, 4, 0>, <6, 8, 7>, <2, 12, 8>, <5, 6, 0>, <5, 12, 4>, <5, 6, 12>, <6, 8, 5>, <6, 1, 2>, <5, 14, 4>, <4, 0, 7>
