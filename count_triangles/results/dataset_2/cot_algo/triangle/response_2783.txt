Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 17) (9, 5) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 0) (18, 6) (18, 17) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 8) (12, 15) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 17) (8, 7) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 15) (13, 10) (13, 6) (15, 12) (15, 13) (15, 11) (16, 1) (16, 2) (16, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 6) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 15) (11, 19) (11, 17) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 11) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 0) (17, 11) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their corresponding connections:
0: 2, 8, 17, 6
1: 3, 16, 19
2: 0, 11, 16
3: 1, 4, 10
4: 3, 8, 10, 6, 17
5: 9, 17
6: 0, 4, 18, 13
7: 8, 16, 19
8: 0, 4, 11, 7
9: 5
10: 3, 4, 13
11: 2, 8, 15, 17, 19
12: 15
13: 6, 10, 15
15: 12, 13, 11
16: 1, 2, 7
17: 0, 4, 11, 18, 5
18: 6, 17
19: 1, 7, 11

Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [6]

Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 17>, <3, 4, 10>, <4, 6, 17>, <4, 11, 17>, <11, 16, 19>
