Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 0) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows:
Node 0: 3 edges
Node 1: 2 edges
Node 8: 2 edges
Node 5: 3 edges
Node 10: 3 edges
Node 4: 4 edges
Node 7: 4 edges
Node 12: 4 edges
Node 9: 4 edges
Node 2: 5 edges
Node 11: 5 edges
Node 3: 6 edges
Node 6: 6 edges
Node 13: 6 edges
Node 14: 8 edges

Now, to count the triangles, let's consider the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

- (5, 3): Common neighbor 7, forms triangle <3, 5, 7>
- (5, 7): No new triangles
- (5, 14): No new triangles
- (9, 6): Common neighbors 13, 2, forms triangles <6, 9, 13> and <6, 9, 2>
- (6, 14): Common neighbor 2, forms triangle <6, 14, 2>
- (6, 2): Common neighbor 12, forms triangle <6, 2, 12>
- (6, 13): Common neighbors 9, 3, forms triangle <6, 13, 9>
- (1, 2): No new triangles
- (3, 13): Common neighbors 6, 7, 0, forms triangle <3, 13, 6>
- (10, 0): No new triangles
- (11, 8): No new triangles
- (11, 4): Common neighbor 14, forms triangle <4, 11, 14>
- (4, 3): Common neighbor 11, forms triangle <3, 4, 11>
- (8, 7): No new triangles
- (7, 12): Common neighbors 14, 3, forms triangle <7, 12, 14>

The total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles found: <3, 5, 7>, <6, 9, 13>, <6, 9, 2>, <6, 14, 2>, <6, 2, 12>, <6, 13, 9>, <3, 13, 6>, <4, 11, 14>, <3, 4, 11>
