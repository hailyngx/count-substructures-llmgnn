Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 7) (15, 17) (15, 16) (27, 4) (27, 9) (27, 5) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 20) (25, 3) (25, 19) (8, 23) (8, 28) (23, 8) (23, 21) (23, 19) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 29) (28, 14) (29, 28) (29, 26) (29, 12) (29, 14) (29, 21) (4, 27) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 20) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) (17, 15) (2, 19) (2, 7) (22, 11) (0, 13) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 24) (1, 18) (6, 13) (6, 26) (9, 27) (9, 18) (9, 21) (9, 7) (7, 15) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 24) (24, 16) (24, 7) (11, 22) (11, 19) (11, 5) (19, 25) (19, 23) (19, 2) (19, 11) (19, 10) (20, 3) (20, 4) (20, 14) (20, 10) (21, 23) (21, 29) (21, 9) (21, 26) (26, 29) (26, 6) (26, 21) (26, 12) (5, 27) (5, 11) (5, 12) (12, 29) (12, 18) (12, 26) (12, 5) (14, 28) (14, 29) (14, 20) (10, 19) (10, 20) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with 30 nodes and 90 edges as described by the user. 

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 5
Node 10: degree 2
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 2
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 3
Node 16: degree 3
Node 17: degree 1
Node 18: degree 4
Node 19: degree 5
Node 20: degree 4
Node 21: degree 4
Node 22: degree 1
Node 23: degree 3
Node 24: degree 2
Node 25: degree 2
Node 26: degree 4
Node 27: degree 4
Node 28: degree 5
Node 29: degree 5

Now, we will count the triangles:
