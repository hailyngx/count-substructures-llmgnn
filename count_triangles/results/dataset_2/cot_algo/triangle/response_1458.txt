Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0 -> 5, 1, 4, 6
- 1 -> 3, 0, 8, 7
- 2 -> 9, 3, 4, 7
- 3 -> 1, 6, 2, 4
- 4 -> 5, 9, 3, 8, 0, 2
- 5 -> 4, 0
- 6 -> 3, 7, 0
- 7 -> 9, 1, 8, 6, 2
- 8 -> 9, 1, 4, 7
- 9 -> 8, 4, 2, 7

Next, we rank the nodes by their degrees (number of connections):
Nodes in increasing order of degrees: 5, 6, 2, 0, 1, 8, 7, 3, 9, 4
