Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 4) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 14) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 4) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 4) (6, 11) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 2) (10, 9) (10, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles is as follows:

1. Relabel the vertices based on their degrees in non-decreasing order:
   - Node 5: degree 4
   - Node 9: degree 4
   - Node 3: degree 5
   - Node 11: degree 5
   - Node 0: degree 4
   - Node 7: degree 4
   - Node 13: degree 5
   - Node 8: degree 5
   - Node 4: degree 5
   - Node 12: degree 4
   - Node 1: degree 3
   - Node 6: degree 2
   - Node 2: degree 4
   - Node 14: degree 5
   - Node 10: degree 2

2. Process the edges in the order of sorted labels to count the triangles:
   - <4, 0, 8>
   - <1, 13, 14>
   - <2, 5, 13>
   - <4, 1, 11>
   - <0, 8, 14>
   - <2, 3, 5>
   - <0, 4, 11>
   - <7, 13, 1>
   - <8, 6, 11>
   - <4, 12, 13>
   - <0, 4, 14>
   - <3, 5, 13>
   - <2, 3, 14>
   - <7, 0, 4>
   - <3, 7, 0>
   - <2, 5, 12>
   - <6, 8, 11>
   - <4, 12, 5>
   - <0, 7, 3>
   - <2, 5, 12>
   - <3, 7, 13>
   - <0, 4, 1>
   - <3, 11, 4>
   - <0, 4, 12>
   - <2, 3, 14>
   - <3, 7, 13>
   - <2, 5, 12>
   - <0, 4, 1>
   - <2, 3, 14>
   - <2, 5, 3>
   - <2, 12, 5>
   - <0, 11, 4>
   - <4, 13, 14>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [33].
