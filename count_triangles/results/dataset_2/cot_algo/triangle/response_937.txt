Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 23) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 6) (22, 3) (12, 27) (12, 18) (12, 17) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 5) (8, 17) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 25) (5, 28) (6, 22) (6, 5) (6, 11) (2, 18) (2, 26) (13, 18) (13, 26) (26, 2) (26, 13) (26, 20) (26, 0) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 7) (10, 3) (10, 29) (16, 28) (28, 8) (28, 5) (28, 16) (28, 9) (28, 14) (3, 22) (3, 10) (3, 7) (3, 24) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (21, 19) (21, 17) (24, 1) (24, 3) (24, 29) (11, 6) (11, 19) (11, 25) (19, 21) (19, 11) (19, 17) (20, 26) (20, 23) (0, 18) (0, 26) (0, 23) (9, 28) (9, 7) (9, 14) (14, 28) (14, 9) (25, 15) (25, 5) (25, 11) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 21) (17, 19) (29, 15) (29, 10) (29, 24) (23, 27) (23, 20) (23, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph:
1. Sort the nodes by their degree:
   - Node 4: degree 1
   - Node 9: degree 1
   - Node 10: degree 1
   - Node 14: degree 2
   - Node 16: degree 1
   - Node 18: degree 5
   - Node 19: degree 3
   - Node 20: degree 2
   - Node 21: degree 2
   - Node 2: degree 2
   - Node 26: degree 4
   - Node 6: degree 3
   - Node 3: degree 4
   - Node 0: degree 3
   - Node 7: degree 3
   - Node 1: degree 3
   - Node 5: degree 4
   - Node 11: degree 3
   - Node 22: degree 4
   - Node 12: degree 3
   - Node 13: degree 2
   - Node 8: degree 4
   - Node 15: degree 5
   - Node 17: degree 4
   - Node 23: degree 3
   - Node 24: degree 3
   - Node 25: degree 3
   - Node 27: degree 3
   - Node 28: degree 5
   - Node 29: degree 3

2. Relabel the nodes based on degree:
   - Node 4: 0
   - Node 9: 1
   - Node 10: 2
   - Node 14: 3
   - Node 16: 4
   - Node 18: 5
   - Node 19: 6
   - Node 20: 7
   - Node 21: 8
   - Node 2: 9
   - Node 26: 10
   - Node 6: 11
   - Node 3: 12
   - Node 0: 13
   - Node 7: 14
   - Node 1: 15
   - Node 5: 16
   - Node 11: 17
   - Node 22: 18
   - Node 12: 19
   - Node 13: 20
   - Node 8: 21
   - Node 15: 22
   - Node 17: 23
   - Node 23: 24
   - Node 24: 25
   - Node 25: 26
   - Node 27: 27
   - Node 28: 28
   - Node 29: 29

3. Now, we count the triangles:
   - Triangles: 27
   - Unique triangles: <3, 14, 21>, <0, 12, 20>, <5, 8, 17>, <3, 7, 14>, <0, 13, 18>, <3, 24, 25>, <5, 6, 11>, <1, 24, 29>, <7, 9, 14>, <12, 18, 22>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 15, 25>, <3, 7, 24>, <17, 19, 21>, <6, 11, 25>, <5, 11, 25>, <20, 23, 26>, <1, 15, 27>, <8, 14, 28>, <5, 6, 22>, <6, 22, 25>, <3, 10, 29>, <2, 13, 26>, <2, 18, 26>, <8, 17, 21>, <9, 14, 28>, <2, 26, 28>
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [27].
