Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 14) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 13) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 9) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: (4, 10), (4, 1), (4, 11), (4, 6), (4, 2), (7, 0), (7, 11), (7, 1), (10, 4), (10, 3), (10, 1), (10, 13), (10, 14), (11, 4), (11, 7), (11, 14), (11, 9), (11, 13), (8, 13), (8, 2), (8, 0), (13, 10), (13, 11), (13, 8), (13, 14), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 0), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 9), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 6), (0, 12), (0, 1), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 10), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 0), (14, 10), (14, 11), (14, 13), (9, 11), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 12), (12, 0), (12, 9), (3, 10), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 9)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes sorted by degree: {12, 5, 7, 8, 2, 9, 14, 13, 3, 11, 6, 10, 0, 1, 4}

Next, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [15]

Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 8, 2>, <1, 10, 4>, <1, 6, 5>, <1, 6, 4>, <1, 7, 4>, <2, 8, 0>, <3, 10, 4>, <3, 9, 11>, <4, 11, 13>, <4, 10, 13>, <4, 13, 11>
