Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (0, 9) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 5) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently by focusing on nodes with fewer connections first. 

By sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections), the nodes can be relabeled as follows:
Node 0 - Degree 1
Node 13 - Degree 2
Node 2 - Degree 2
Node 10 - Degree 2
Node 12 - Degree 3
Node 14 - Degree 4
Node 7 - Degree 4
Node 4 - Degree 4
Node 3 - Degree 4
Node 5 - Degree 4
Node 8 - Degree 4
Node 1 - Degree 5
Node 9 - Degree 6
Node 11 - Degree 6
Node 6 - Degree 6

Checking the edges and triangles based on the relabeled nodes:

Triangles:
<4, 7, 12>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 11, 13>
<7, 11, 12>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 12>
<5, 6, 11>
<5, 6, 14>
<5, 11, 14>
<2, 5, 14>
<5, 11, 13>
<3, 8, 13>
<3, 8, 10>

Total number of triangles: [13]
