Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
Let's organize the given edges into a graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, 8

To apply the Degree-Based Ordering method, we'll sort the vertices based on their degree:

0: degree 3
2: degree 4
8: degree 3
7: degree 4
5: degree 4
6: degree 4
1: degree 5
4: degree 4
3: degree 4
9: degree 5

Next, let's identify and count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
