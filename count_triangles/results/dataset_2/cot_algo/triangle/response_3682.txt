Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 15) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 10) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 10) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 15) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 15) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 19) (10, 12) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 11) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The vertices by their number of connections from least to most are:  
Node 16 - degree 0  
Node 18 - degree 0  
Node 16 and 18 do not have any connections, so they will not partake in triangles.  

Node 20 - degree 1  
Node 13 - degree 1  
Node 13 and 20 do not participate in triangles as they don't share connections with other vertices.  

Node 18 - degree 2  
Node 16 - degree 3  
Node 18 and 16 do not form triangles together.  

Node 17 - degree 3  
Node 4 - degree 4  
Node 17 and 4 form a triangle with Node 14: <4, 14, 17>.  

Node 9 - degree 4  
Node 0 - degree 4  
Node 9 and 0 form a triangle with Node 2: <0, 2, 9>.  

Node 7 - degree 4  
Node 6 - degree 4  
Node 7 and 6 do not form a triangle together as they do not share connections with another vertex. 

Node 12 - degree 4  
Node 15 - degree 4  
Node 12 and 15 form a triangle with Node 10: <10, 12, 15>.  

Node 11 - degree 5  
Node 8 - degree 5  
Node 11 and 8 do not form a triangle together.  

Node 1 - degree 5  
Node 3 - degree 5  
Node 1 and 3 form a triangle with Node 5: <1, 3, 5>.  

Node 19 - degree 5  
Node 7 and 19 do not form a triangle together.  

Node 6 and 5 do not form triangles with any other vertices.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
