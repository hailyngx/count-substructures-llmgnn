Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph have the following connections:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 3: 5 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

Sorting the nodes based on their number of connections, the new labels are:
- Node 0 -> Node 8
- Node 1 -> Node 5
- Node 2 -> Node 8
- Node 3 -> Node 1
- Node 4 -> Node 8
- Node 5 -> Node 5
- Node 6 -> Node 1
- Node 7 -> Node 5
- Node 8 -> Node 3
- Node 9 -> Node 5

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Triangle <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle <1, 5, 7>
- Triangle <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle <3, 4, 6>

Total number of triangles: [5]
