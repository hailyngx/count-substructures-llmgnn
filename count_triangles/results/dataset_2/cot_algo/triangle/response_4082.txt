Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
Constructing the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges based on the provided information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
(5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 0),
(9, 6), (9, 7),
(4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0),
(7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 2),
(1, 3), (1, 0), (1, 8),
(3, 7), (3, 1),
(6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 8), (6, 0),
(8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 1), (8, 6), (8, 2),
(2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 8),
(0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 1), (0, 6)

Now, let's list the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes with degree 0: 3
Nodes with degree 1: 1, 9
Nodes with degree 2: 2
Nodes with degree 3: 8
Nodes with degree 4: 0
Nodes with degree 5: 5
Nodes with degree 6: 4, 6
Nodes with degree 7: 7

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections, we identify the triangles:

1. Triangle: <0, 1, 8>
2. Triangle: <7, 2, 6>
3. Triangle: <7, 6, 9>
4. Triangle: <0, 6, 5>
5. Triangle: <0, 7, 4>
6. Triangle: <0, 7, 6>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
