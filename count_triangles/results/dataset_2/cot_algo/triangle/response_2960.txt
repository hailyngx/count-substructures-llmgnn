Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
0: 1, 2, 8, 9
1: 0, 2, 6, 9
2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8
3: 2, 8, 9
4: 7
5: 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
6: 1, 5, 7, 8
7: 4, 5, 6, 9
8: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6
9: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7
```

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Sort the nodes by their degree in non-decreasing order:
```
Nodes by degree: 4, 0, 3, 7, 6, 8, 1, 5, 2, 9
```

2. Count the triangles formed by the edges:
- Triangle <2, 6, 8>
- Triangle <5, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [2]
