Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 14) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 7) (11, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 10) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 10) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 1) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly. Let's do that for this graph:

Node 6 has degree 3.
Node 9 has degree 6.
Node 4 has degree 4.
Node 7 has degree 5.
Node 8 has degree 4.
Node 13 has degree 4.
Node 3 has degree 3.
Node 11 has degree 3.
Node 5 has degree 6.
Node 0 has degree 3.
Node 2 has degree 5.
Node 12 has degree 3.
Node 14 has degree 3.
Node 1 has degree 4.
Node 10 has degree 4.

Based on the degree-based ordering, the vertices will be relabeled as follows:
Node 6 -> Node 0
Node 9 -> Node 1
Node 4 -> Node 2
Node 7 -> Node 3
Node 8 -> Node 4
Node 13 -> Node 5
Node 3 -> Node 6
Node 11 -> Node 7
Node 5 -> Node 8
Node 0 -> Node 9
Node 2 -> Node 10
Node 12 -> Node 11
Node 14 -> Node 12
Node 1 -> Node 13
Node 10 -> Node 14

Now, let's find the triangles in the graph:
- Triangles: <0, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <1, 9, 13>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 1>, <2, 7, 10>, <4, 5, 13>, <4, 1, 7>, <3, 2, 13>, <3, 2, 14>, <3, 2, 1>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <5, 8, 13>, <5, 13, 9>, <5, 13, 14>, <11, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 10>, <5, 1, 7>, <5, 10, 12>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 11>, <0, 7, 1>, <2, 13, 14>, <2, 1, 10>, <13, 14, 3>, <13, 3, 2>, <1, 10, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [30].
