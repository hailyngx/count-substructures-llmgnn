Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the graph.

1. Count the degree of each node:
Node 0: degree = 4
Node 1: degree = 4
Node 2: degree = 4
Node 3: degree = 4
Node 4: degree = 5
Node 5: degree = 4
Node 6: degree = 5
Node 7: degree = 5
Node 8: degree = 6
Node 9: degree = 4
Node 10: degree = 4
Node 11: degree = 3
Node 12: degree = 4
Node 13: degree = 3
Node 14: degree = 4

2. Sort the nodes in ascending order based on their degrees:
New labeling:
Node 11: degree = 3
Node 13: degree = 3
Node 14: degree = 4
Node 1: degree = 4
Node 2: degree = 4
Node 3: degree = 4
Node 10: degree = 4
Node 9: degree = 4
Node 0: degree = 4
Node 5: degree = 4
Node 12: degree = 4
Node 4: degree = 5
Node 6: degree = 5
Node 7: degree = 5
Node 8: degree = 6

3. Analyze each edge to count the triangles:

Triangles: [51]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 2, 1>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 5>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 12>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 12>, <2, 4, 10>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 3>, <2, 6, 14>, <2, 6, 3>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 6, 0>, <2, 12, 10>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 12>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 10>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 6, 3>, <4, 6, 14>, <4, 7, 5>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 7, 13>, <6, 7, 5>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 5>
