Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 6) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's first list the nodes' degree (number of connections):

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 5
- Node 13: degree 6
- Node 14: degree 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can label the nodes in increasing order of degrees:

- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 5
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 13: degree 6

Now, we will count the triangles using the given edges:

- Triangle <0, 1, 12>
- Triangle <0, 3, 6>
- Triangle <0, 4, 12>
- Triangle <0, 6, 14>
- Triangle <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle <1, 7, 12>
- Triangle <3, 4, 11>
- Triangle <4, 8, 11>
- Triangle <6, 7, 13>
- Triangle <6, 11, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
