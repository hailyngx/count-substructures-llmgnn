Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 14) (1, 22) (1, 7) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 12) (2, 29) (2, 26) (2, 9) (2, 20) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 20) (29, 24) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 12) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 16) (9, 2) (18, 20) (18, 3) (22, 1) (22, 4) (22, 17) (12, 21) (12, 0) (12, 27) (12, 28) (12, 3) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 3) (17, 29) (17, 22) (17, 23) (17, 15) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 23) (26, 2) (26, 6) (20, 21) (20, 2) (20, 29) (20, 18) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 24) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 25) (23, 19) (16, 21) (16, 27) (16, 8) (6, 26) (6, 24) (6, 14) (24, 29) (24, 10) (24, 6) (24, 28) (28, 12) (28, 24) (28, 25) (4, 22) (4, 11) (4, 14) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 19) (3, 18) (3, 12) (3, 8) (13, 10) (13, 25) (25, 23) (25, 28) (25, 13) (19, 23) (19, 14) 

Response:
The given graph with nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: (1, 14), (1, 22), (1, 7), (21, 16), (21, 20), (21, 12), (2, 29), (2, 26), (2, 9), (2, 20), (29, 17), (0, 27), (0, 12), (9, 18), (22, 4), (12, 28), (8, 15), (17, 23), (7, 23), (26, 6), (20, 18), (10, 13), (11, 4), (23, 25), (16, 27), (6, 14), (24, 28), (4, 19), (13, 25)

Next, using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Nodes sorted by degree: 10, 11, 13, 6, 24, 7, 8, 9, 19, 26, 0, 1, 3, 5, 12, 14, 16, 18, 2, 4, 17, 21, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28, 29

Triangles in the graph (total inside brackets []):
[37]
