Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 15) (16, 5) (5, 16) (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 11) (9, 5) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 17) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (1, 7) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 18) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 3) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 10) (19, 14) (19, 10) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 15) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 6) (12, 18) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 15) (13, 9) (13, 7) (18, 1) (18, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their degree and relabeling them accordingly. Here is the relabeled graph based on the degrees of the nodes:

Node 0 (Degree 4)
Node 1 (Degree 4)
Node 2 (Degree 4)
Node 3 (Degree 5)
Node 4 (Degree 5)
Node 5 (Degree 5)
Node 6 (Degree 2)
Node 7 (Degree 5)
Node 8 (Degree 4)
Node 9 (Degree 5)
Node 10 (Degree 4)
Node 11 (Degree 5)
Node 12 (Degree 2)
Node 13 (Degree 3)
Node 14 (Degree 5)
Node 15 (Degree 4)
Node 16 (Degree 2)
Node 17 (Degree 5)
Node 18 (Degree 3)
Node 19 (Degree 2)

Next, we will check each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Checking the edges in the relabeled graph, we can find the triangles formed by shared connections. Calculating the total number of triangles, we get the result inside brackets [].

Total number of triangles: [15]
