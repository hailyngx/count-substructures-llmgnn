Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (9, 15) (9, 12) (4, 18) (4, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 15) (1, 15) (1, 12) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 1) (19, 18) (19, 7) (19, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 0) (10, 16) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 16) (6, 19) (6, 17) (3, 8) (3, 7) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 13) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 17) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges based on the provided information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges:
- 0: {2, 10}
- 1: {15, 12}
- 2: {0, 13, 10, 15}
- 3: {8, 7}
- 4: {18, 13}
- 5: {8}
- 6: {19, 17}
- 7: {8, 19, 14, 3, 13}
- 8: {5, 11, 7, 3}
- 9: {15, 12}
- 10: {2, 18, 0, 16}
- 11: {8, 14, 12}
- 12: {9, 1, 11, 14}
- 13: {4, 2, 7}
- 14: {11, 7, 12, 16}
- 15: {9, 2, 18, 1}
- 16: {10, 14, 17}
- 17: {6, 16}
- 18: {4, 19, 10, 15}
- 19: {18, 7, 6}

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes by degree:
- Node 5 (degree 1): {8}
- Node 1 (degree 2): {15, 12}
- Node 9 (degree 2): {15, 12}
- Node 6 (degree 2): {19, 17}
- Node 3 (degree 2): {8, 7}
- Node 4 (degree 2): {18, 13}
- Node 0 (degree 2): {2, 10}
- Node 11 (degree 3): {8, 14, 12}
- Node 16 (degree 3): {10, 14, 17}
- Node 13 (degree 3): {4, 2, 7}
- Node 2 (degree 4): {0, 13, 10, 15}
- Node 14 (degree 4): {11, 7, 12, 16}
- Node 19 (degree 3): {18, 7, 6}
- Node 7 (degree 5): {8, 19, 14, 3, 13}
- Node 18 (degree 4): {4, 19, 10, 15}
- Node 10 (degree 4): {2, 18, 0, 16}
- Node 15 (degree 5): {9, 2, 18, 1}
- Node 8 (degree 5): {5, 11, 7, 3}

Now, let's count the triangles ([ ] indicate the output):
