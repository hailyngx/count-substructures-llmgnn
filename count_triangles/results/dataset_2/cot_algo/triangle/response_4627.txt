Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 24) (15, 16) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 21) (9, 7) (9, 23) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 29) (14, 25) (21, 9) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 11) (28, 4) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 13) (11, 20) (26, 18) (26, 23) (26, 29) (26, 17) (1, 15) (1, 25) (18, 26) (18, 12) (18, 8) (2, 14) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 10) (22, 2) (24, 15) (23, 9) (23, 26) (23, 20) (10, 2) (10, 27) (10, 29) (17, 26) (17, 25) (17, 12) (25, 14) (25, 1) (25, 17) (25, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (13, 11) (13, 20) (13, 19) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (8, 5) (27, 10) (27, 19) (29, 14) (29, 26) (29, 10) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 27) (20, 11) (20, 23) (20, 13) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 17) (12, 5) (4, 0) (4, 28) (4, 25) (4, 5) (16, 15) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the nodes is as follows:
Node 27: degree 2
Node 16: degree 1
Node 5: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 1: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 4
Node 22: degree 2
Node 29: degree 4
Node 23: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 3: degree 2
Node 17: degree 3
Node 19: degree 3
Node 21: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 18: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 26: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 20: degree 3
Node 11: degree 5
Node 25: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 9: degree 5
Node 24: degree 2
Node 4: degree 5
Node 28: degree 3

Based on degree-based ordering, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
