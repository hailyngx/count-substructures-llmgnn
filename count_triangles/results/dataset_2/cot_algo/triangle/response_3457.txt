Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 9) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 14) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, let's first construct the graph with its nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: [(1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 13), (1, 9), (3, 7), (3, 12), (10, 11), (10, 6), (10, 8), (10, 2), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 13), (4, 0), (8, 14), (8, 7), (7, 12), (7, 0), (7, 5), (12, 2), (12, 14), (2, 5), (5, 6), (6, 11)]

Now, we will determine the degrees of each node:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 3
Node 12: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 5

Based on their degrees, the vertices can be sorted and relabeled as follows:
Node 0 -> 0 (Degree 2)
Node 2 -> 1 (Degree 3)
Node 6 -> 2 (Degree 3)
Node 12 -> 3 (Degree 3)
Node 11 -> 4 (Degree 3)
Node 13 -> 5 (Degree 3)
Node 9 -> 6 (Degree 3)
Node 5 -> 7 (Degree 4)
Node 7 -> 8 (Degree 4)
Node 10 -> 9 (Degree 4)
Node 8 -> 10 (Degree 4)
Node 3 -> 11 (Degree 4)
Node 1 -> 12 (Degree 4)
Node 4 -> 13 (Degree 5)
Node 14 -> 14 (Degree 5)

Now, we will go through each edge to count the number of triangles. We only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

After counting all the triangles, the total number of triangles in this graph is: [18]
 
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 7, 12>
<0, 7, 3>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 14>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 12>
<1, 9, 13>
<2, 6, 10>
<2, 6, 5>
<3, 12, 14>
<3, 7, 12>
<4, 9, 14>
<4, 9, 13>
<5, 6, 11>
<7, 8, 10>
<8, 10, 14>
