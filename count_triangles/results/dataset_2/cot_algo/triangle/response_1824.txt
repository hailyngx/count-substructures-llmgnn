Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (9), (4), (7)
- 1: (3), (2)
- 2: (5), (6), (1), (3), (8)
- 3: (1), (7), (2), (8)
- 4: (5), (9), (6), (8), (0)
- 5: (9), (2), (4), (7)
- 6: (9), (2), (4)
- 7: (5), (9), (3), (0)
- 8: (9), (3), (4), (2)
- 9: (5), (6), (8), (4), (7), (0)

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes: 1, 0, 6, 7, 8, 3, 2, 5, 4, 9

After relabeling, the graph can be represented as follows:

Edges:
- 1: (3), (2)
- 0: (9), (4), (7)
- 6: (9), (2), (4)
- 7: (5), (9), (3), (0)
- 8: (9), (3), (4), (2)
- 3: (1), (7), (2), (8)
- 2: (5), (6), (1), (3), (8)
- 5: (9), (2), (4), (7)
- 4: (5), (9), (6), (8), (0)
- 9: (5), (6), (8), (4), (7), (0)

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

There are 9 triangles in the graph:
[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 5, 9>]
