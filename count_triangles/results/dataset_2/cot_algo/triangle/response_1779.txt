Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 8) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is used to count the number of triangles in the given graph efficiently. 

After sorting the nodes based on their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are as follows: 
Nodes: [3, 8, 2, 9, 14, 6, 13, 0, 7, 4, 1, 5, 10, 11, 12]

Based on the given edges and the node labels, the triangles found are: 
<2, 4, 14>
<0, 4, 7>
<7, 12, 13>
<4, 10, 11>
<0, 6, 12>
<1, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
