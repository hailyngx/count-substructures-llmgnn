Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 21) (29, 2) (29, 27) (29, 11) (1, 3) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (22, 26) (22, 15) (22, 24) (26, 22) (26, 13) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 15) (13, 9) (17, 20) (17, 5) (17, 18) (20, 17) (20, 8) (20, 4) (20, 6) (8, 20) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 23) (9, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 19) (7, 5) (16, 13) (16, 19) (12, 3) (12, 18) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 0) (28, 4) (28, 15) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 6) (10, 6) (10, 24) (10, 25) (5, 17) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 20) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 11) (24, 22) (24, 13) (24, 10) (27, 29) (27, 21) (14, 3) (14, 5) (23, 9) (23, 4) (21, 2) (21, 27) (4, 20) (4, 28) (4, 23) (4, 25) (15, 22) (15, 13) (15, 28) (11, 29) (11, 6) (25, 10) (25, 4) 

Response:
Based on the provided graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, the Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied to count the number of triangles efficiently. 

Here is the process of counting triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most:
   Nodes with their degrees:
   ```
   (1: 2), (2: 2), (28: 2), (30: 2), (3: 4), (4: 4), (6: 4), (8: 4), (12: 4), (17: 4), 
   (23: 4), (25: 4), (29: 4), (7: 5), (9: 5), (13: 5), (15: 5), (18: 5), (20: 5), (24: 5), 
   (5: 6), (10: 6), (11: 6), (14: 6), (26: 6), (19: 7), (27: 7), (16: 8), (21: 8), (22: 8), (0: 9)
   ```

2. Relabel the vertices from 0 to 29 based on their degrees:
   ```
   (0: 1), (1: 2), (2: 3), (3: 4), (4: 5), (5: 6), (6: 7), (7: 8), (8: 9), (9: 10),
   (10: 11), (11: 12), (12: 13), (13: 14), (14: 15), (15: 16), (16: 17), (17: 18), (18: 19),
   (19: 20), (20: 21), (21: 22), (22: 23), (23: 24), (24: 25), (25: 26), (26: 27), (27: 28),
   (28: 29), (29: 30)
   ```

3. Identify the triangles in the graph by checking shared connections between vertices of each edge.

After going through the edges considering the conditions mentioned earlier, the total number of triangles found in the given graph is 41. 

Therefore, the output is:  
\[41\]

And the unique triangles found are:  
<2, 9, 20>  
<2, 13, 20>  
<2, 13, 26>  
<2, 20, 24>  
<4, 12, 18>  
<6, 10, 24>  
<6, 11, 29>  
<6, 11, 30>  
<6, 24, 29>  
<6, 24, 30>  
<7, 9, 19>  
<7, 13, 16>  
<7, 13, 19>  
<7, 14, 19>  
<8, 9, 13>  
<8, 9, 20>  
<8, 13, 15>  
<8, 13, 16>  
<9, 13, 20>  
<10, 24, 25>  
<13, 15, 22>  
<13, 19, 20>  
<13, 19, 22>  
<13, 24, 25>

<23, 24, 25>  
<24, 25, 29>  
<24, 26, 29>  
<24, 26, 30>
