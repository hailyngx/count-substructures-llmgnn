Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 12) (6, 3) (6, 17) (9, 8) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (7, 16) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 8) (5, 7) (5, 1) (13, 17) (13, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 18) (16, 7) (16, 19) (14, 15) (14, 11) (14, 19) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 19) (19, 16) (19, 14) (19, 18) (19, 2) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 19) (4, 17) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Nodes:  
0 (Degree 4)  
1 (Degree 2)  
2 (Degree 4)  
3 (Degree 5)  
4 (Degree 2)  
5 (Degree 3)  
6 (Degree 3)  
7 (Degree 3)  
8 (Degree 4)  
9 (Degree 2)  
10 (Degree 4)  
11 (Degree 3)  
12 (Degree 4)  
13 (Degree 2)  
14 (Degree 4)  
15 (Degree 4)  
16 (Degree 2)  
17 (Degree 3)  
18 (Degree 5)  
19 (Degree 4)  

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees and proceed with checking for triangles by examining the shared connections between edges. After counting all the triangles, we find that there are a total of [**24**] triangles in the graph. 

The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 10, 11>  
<0, 10, 12>  
<0, 10, 18>  
<0, 10, 19>  
<0, 11, 14>  
<0, 12, 10>  
<0, 12, 15>  
<0, 18, 15>  
<0, 18, 19>  
<1, 5, 7>  
<1, 5, 17>  
<2, 13, 17>  
<3, 6, 17>  
<3, 8, 12>  
<3, 8, 15>  
<4, 17, 6>  
<5, 7, 16>  
<5, 7, 19>  
<9, 0, 10>  
<10, 11, 14>  
<10, 12, 15>  
<10, 18, 19>  
<11, 14, 19>  
<15, 14, 19>
