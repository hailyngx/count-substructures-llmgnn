Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 26) (9, 14) (0, 3) (0, 24) (27, 15) (27, 24) (27, 10) (6, 16) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 21) (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 29) (15, 12) (15, 28) (23, 26) (23, 21) (2, 22) (2, 12) (2, 25) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 21) (11, 25) (4, 22) (4, 20) (4, 17) (18, 3) (18, 26) (18, 1) (18, 29) (26, 5) (26, 23) (26, 18) (20, 4) (20, 29) (20, 19) (29, 15) (29, 18) (29, 20) (29, 16) (29, 10) (19, 20) (19, 28) (19, 1) (10, 27) (10, 29) (10, 21) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 11) (21, 10) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 12) (22, 25) (12, 15) (12, 2) (12, 22) (12, 24) (12, 28) (7, 17) (24, 0) (24, 27) (24, 12) (24, 17) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 16) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 24) (17, 28) (28, 15) (28, 19) (28, 12) (28, 17) (25, 2) (25, 11) (25, 22) (16, 6) (16, 29) (16, 14) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 19) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps in efficiently counting the triangles in the given graph. 

After relabeling the nodes based on their connections count, the new labels of the nodes are as follows:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 1
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 3
Node 12: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 2
Node 14: Degree 3
Node 15: Degree 6
Node 16: Degree 3
Node 17: Degree 4
Node 18: Degree 4
Node 19: Degree 3
Node 20: Degree 3
Node 21: Degree 4
Node 22: Degree 4
Node 23: Degree 2
Node 24: Degree 4
Node 25: Degree 3
Node 26: Degree 4
Node 27: Degree 4
Node 28: Degree 4
Node 29: Degree 6

Based on the degree-based ordering method, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
Total number of triangles: [36]
