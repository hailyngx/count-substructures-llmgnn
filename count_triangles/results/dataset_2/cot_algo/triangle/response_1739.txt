Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are:  
Node 5: 4 connections  
Node 9: 4 connections  
Node 4: 4 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 1: 6 connections  
Node 3: 4 connections  
Node 8: 3 connections  
Node 0: 4 connections  
Node 2: 3 connections  
Node 6: 4 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges according to the sorting above. 

We will count the triangles formed by shared connections between vertices.   

The total number of triangles is [12].
The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 3, 5>  
<0, 3, 1>  
<0, 3, 4>  
<0, 5, 6>  
<0, 9, 4>  
<1, 7, 9>  
<1, 7, 4>  
<1, 7, 6>  
<1, 7, 8>  
<1, 9, 4>  
<3, 5, 4>  
<4, 7, 6>
