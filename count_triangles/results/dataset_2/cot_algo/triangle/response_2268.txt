Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 3) (16, 4) (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 17) (9, 11) (9, 5) (9, 12) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 16) (3, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 17) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 15) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 8) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 2) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 10) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 13) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 2) (8, 15) (8, 14) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 14) (18, 7) (18, 14) (18, 10) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 18) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 7) (17, 0) (13, 3) (13, 19) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections), relabeling the nodes accordingly, and then counting the triangles based on the edges provided. 

After sorting the nodes based on their degree, we have the following relabeled nodes:
Node 0 -> Degree 3
Node 1 -> Degree 3
Node 2 -> Degree 4
Node 3 -> Degree 2
Node 4 -> Degree 4
Node 5 -> Degree 3
Node 6 -> Degree 3
Node 7 -> Degree 4
Node 8 -> Degree 2
Node 9 -> Degree 4
Node 10 -> Degree 3
Node 11 -> Degree 3
Node 12 -> Degree 4
Node 13 -> Degree 2
Node 14 -> Degree 3
Node 15 -> Degree 4
Node 16 -> Degree 2
Node 17 -> Degree 4
Node 18 -> Degree 3
Node 19 -> Degree 3

Now, we will analyze each edge based on the relabeled nodes to count the number of triangles.

Count of triangles: [15]

Unique triangles: 
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 15>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 10>
<1, 6, 11>
<1, 7, 15>
<2, 14, 18>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 11>
<4, 7, 15>
<4, 16, 3>
<4, 16, 5>
<5, 9, 12>
<7, 12, 9>
<7, 12, 15>
