Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 13) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 15) (17, 18) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (8, 14) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 0) (6, 5) (6, 15) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 19) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 16) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (2, 8) (2, 19) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 10) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 16) (19, 0) (19, 2) (12, 18) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 7) (7, 1) (7, 18) (7, 11) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method steps can be summarized as follows:
1. Sort the vertices by their degree (number of connections).
2. Relabel the vertices from 0 to 19 based on their degree, starting from the one with the lowest degree.
3. Check each edge starting from the vertex with the lower label to count triangles.

After relabeling according to their degree, the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0: Degree 4
Vertex 1: Degree 3
Vertex 2: Degree 2
Vertex 3: Degree 2
Vertex 4: Degree 4
Vertex 5: Degree 3
Vertex 6: Degree 2
Vertex 7: Degree 3
Vertex 8: Degree 2
Vertex 9: Degree 4
Vertex 10: Degree 4
Vertex 11: Degree 3
Vertex 12: Degree 1
Vertex 13: Degree 3
Vertex 14: Degree 4
Vertex 15: Degree 4
Vertex 16: Degree 3
Vertex 17: Degree 3
Vertex 18: Degree 4
Vertex 19: Degree 2

Based on the given edges and the degree-based ordering, the total number of triangles is [157]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 14>
<0, 4, 18>
<0, 10, 16>
<0, 11, 14>
<0, 13, 14>
<1, 4, 18>
<1, 7, 11>
<2, 8, 19>
<3, 4, 13>
<4, 14, 18>
<4, 16, 10>
<5, 6, 15>
<6, 15, 17>
<7, 11, 18>
<8, 14, 17>
<9, 13, 16>
<9, 14, 16>
<13, 14, 16>
<14, 17, 18>
<15, 17, 18>
