Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 3) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 3) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 9) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Let's label the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices with their degrees:
0: 5
1: 4
2: 3
3: 5
4: 4
5: 4
6: 5
7: 4
8: 3
9: 4
10: 3
11: 4
12: 4
13: 5
14: 4

Now, we will consider each edge in the order of the labels and count the triangles:
- (4, 7): No triangle
- (4, 8): No triangle
- (4, 9): No triangle
- (4, 11): Triangle <4, 11, 1>
- (7, 3): No triangle
- (7, 6): Triangle <7, 6, 0>
- (7, 13): No triangle
- (8, 13): Triangle <8, 13, 5>
- (13, 5): No triangle
- (5, 6): Triangle <5, 6, 0>
- (6, 2): No triangle
- (2, 8): No triangle
- (2, 1): No triangle
- (1, 3): No triangle
- (3, 0): No triangle
- (0, 14): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles:
<4, 11, 1>
<7, 6, 0>
<8, 13, 5>
