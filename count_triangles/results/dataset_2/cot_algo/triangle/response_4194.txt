Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 9) (27, 13) (27, 16) (1, 6) (1, 18) (3, 25) (3, 26) (3, 5) (3, 8) (7, 21) (7, 24) (21, 7) (21, 17) (25, 3) (25, 6) (25, 11) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 9) (11, 25) (11, 10) (11, 29) (11, 20) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 1) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 26) (28, 9) (29, 11) (29, 20) (29, 14) (13, 27) (13, 26) (13, 24) (13, 19) (26, 3) (26, 18) (26, 13) (20, 11) (20, 29) (20, 19) (20, 23) (4, 22) (4, 23) (4, 14) (12, 17) (6, 1) (6, 25) (6, 23) (22, 4) (22, 5) (5, 3) (5, 22) (5, 16) (14, 29) (14, 4) (14, 8) (8, 3) (8, 14) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 20) (19, 17) (19, 16) (23, 15) (23, 20) (23, 4) (23, 6) (23, 16) (24, 7) (24, 13) (9, 27) (9, 10) (9, 28) (9, 17) (17, 21) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 9) (16, 27) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 23) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph with the 30 nodes and their corresponding connections:

Nodes: 0 to 29

Edges: 
- 0: {2}
- 1: {6, 18}
- 2: {15, 18, 19}
- 3: {5, 8, 25, 26}
- 4: {14, 22, 23}
- 5: {3, 16, 22}
- 6: {1, 23, 25}
- 7: {17, 21, 24}
- 8: {3, 14}
- 9: {10, 17, 27, 28}
- 10: {9, 11, 18}
- 11: {10, 20, 25, 29}
- 12: {17}
- 13: {19, 24, 26, 27}
- 14: {4, 8, 29}
- 15: {2, 23, 27}
- 16: {5, 19, 23}
- 17: {7, 9, 12, 19, 21}
- 18: {1, 2, 10, 26}
- 19: {2, 13, 16, 17, 20}
- 20: {11, 19, 23, 29}
- 21: {7, 17}
- 22: {4, 5}
- 23: {4, 6, 15, 16, 20}
- 24: {7, 13}
- 25: {3, 6, 11}
- 26: {3, 13, 18}
- 27: {9, 13, 15, 16}
- 28: {9}
- 29: {11, 14, 20}

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering by sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:

Vertices in Degree-Based Ordering: 
0: 1
12: 1
28: 1
7: 3
4: 3
22: 3
5: 3
14: 3
8: 3
24: 3
6: 3
10: 3
18: 4
26: 4
20: 4
2: 4
15: 4
3: 4
25: 4
1: 4
13: 4
16: 4
19: 5
17: 5
9: 5
11: 5
29: 3
21: 3
23: 5

Now, let's count the number of triangles by checking the shared connections between the vertices of each edge:

Number of triangles: [32]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 2, 18>
<0, 2, 19>
<0, 2, 26>
<0, 18, 26>
<1, 6, 25>
<1, 6, 18>
<2, 15, 27>
<2, 18, 26>
<3, 5, 22>
<3, 8, 14>
<3, 8, 25>
<3, 16, 19>
<4, 14, 29>
<5, 16, 19>
<7, 17, 21>
<8, 14, 29>
<9, 17, 27>
<9, 17, 28>
<9, 17, 21>
