Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, and 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 6, and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 1, 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, 2, and 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 1, 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 0, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 3, and 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 2, 0, and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 1, and 7.

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degrees in non-decreasing order and assign labels accordingly:

Nodes in degree-based order: 
0 (degree 4), 2 (degree 3), 7 (degree 3), 4 (degree 3), 8 (degree 5), 3 (degree 5), 6 (degree 4), 1 (degree 5), 9 (degree 4), 5 (degree 4)

Now, we will check the edges and count the number of triangles formed:

Triangles:
- Triangle <0, 3, 8>
- Triangle <1, 2, 8>
- Triangle <1, 4, 8>
- Triangle <1, 6, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 4]
