Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. Let's relabel the vertices accordingly:

Node 6 has degree 3.
Node 9 has degree 3.
Node 1 has degree 5.
Node 3 has degree 4.
Node 5 has degree 4.
Node 0 has degree 4.
Node 2 has degree 5.
Node 8 has degree 4.
Node 7 has degree 3.
Node 4 has degree 6.

Now we will go through the edges while ensuring that we only count triangles using the vertex with the lower label. Shared connections between the two vertices of each edge will form triangles.

The total number of triangles is: [12]
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 1>, <2, 6, 4>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 8>.
