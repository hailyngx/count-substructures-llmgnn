Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 11) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 10) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 10) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 2) (12, 3) (12, 11) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 7) (7, 1) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 11) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 11) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 2), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 11), (6, 11), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 0), (1, 8), (1, 7), (3, 14), (3, 12), (4, 8), (4, 13), (8, 10), (0, 14), (14, 7), (14, 2), (14, 13), (14, 10), (13, 2), (12, 11), (10, 7)

Degree of each node:
0: 2
1: 5
2: 4
3: 3
4: 3
5: 4
6: 3
7: 3
8: 3
9: 4
10: 2
11: 4
12: 1
13: 3
14: 5

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes in order: 0, 10, 12, 6, 7, 8, 3, 4, 13, 2, 11, 5, 9, 1, 14

Triangles:
[24]
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 10, 14>, <0, 14, 2>, <0, 14, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 7, 14>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 13>, <2, 5, 14>, <2, 11, 13>, <3, 9, 11>, <3, 9, 14>, <4, 8, 10>, <4, 8, 13>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 9, 13>, <6, 11, 9>, <7, 10, 14>, <7, 11, 14>, <11, 7, 14>
