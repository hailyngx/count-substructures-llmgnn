Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 25) (5, 22) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 27) (6, 9) (6, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 24) (0, 5) (0, 20) (0, 11) (0, 26) (0, 13) (20, 9) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 7) (20, 23) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 10) (24, 8) (24, 1) (24, 29) (26, 0) (26, 14) (26, 11) (26, 3) (17, 20) (17, 28) (17, 27) (17, 18) (16, 28) (16, 14) (28, 17) (28, 16) (28, 15) (10, 2) (10, 18) (21, 12) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 16) (3, 26) (3, 13) (7, 6) (7, 20) (7, 13) (1, 2) (1, 24) (1, 29) (1, 11) (1, 13) (29, 24) (29, 1) (29, 25) (29, 23) (11, 0) (11, 26) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 2) (19, 11) (19, 23) (22, 5) (22, 12) (27, 9) (27, 17) (18, 17) (18, 10) (18, 15) (25, 5) (25, 29) (25, 15) (12, 21) (12, 22) (15, 28) (15, 18) (15, 25) (23, 20) (23, 29) (23, 19) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees in increasing order. Let's relabel the vertices based on their degree:

Node 5 has degree 3
Node 9 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 20 has degree 5
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 24 has degree 3
Node 0 has degree 6
Node 14 has degree 4
Node 26 has degree 4
Node 17 has degree 4
Node 16 has degree 2
Node 28 has degree 3
Node 10 has degree 2
Node 21 has degree 1
Node 3 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 29 has degree 4
Node 11 has degree 4
Node 19 has degree 3
Node 22 has degree 2
Node 27 has degree 2
Node 18 has degree 3
Node 25 has degree 3
Node 12 has degree 2
Node 15 has degree 3
Node 23 has degree 3
Node 13 has degree 4  

Next, we check the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [60].
