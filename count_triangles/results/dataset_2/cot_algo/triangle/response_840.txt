Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 14) (1, 4) (21, 1) (21, 0) (21, 9) (21, 15) (2, 29) (2, 12) (29, 1) (29, 2) (29, 14) (29, 3) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 26) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (22, 11) (22, 5) (23, 0) (23, 20) (23, 9) (0, 21) (0, 7) (0, 23) (20, 23) (20, 3) (20, 11) (26, 4) (26, 13) (18, 16) (18, 12) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 27) (3, 29) (3, 20) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 22) (11, 20) (11, 3) (11, 19) (5, 22) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 11) (19, 5) (25, 24) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 16) (12, 24) (12, 14) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 10) (10, 16) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 14) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 15) (9, 21) (9, 23) (14, 1) (14, 29) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 7) (8, 17) (8, 14) (8, 24) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 8) (15, 21) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 28) (28, 15) (27, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. 
In this case, the sorted list of nodes based on the number of connections is as follows:
(1: 4 connections), (21: 4 connections), (29: 4 connections), (4: 4 connections), (7: 3 connections), (20: 3 connections), (0: 3 connections), (3: 4 connections), (11: 4 connections), (5: 3 connections), (19: 2 connections), (26: 2 connections), (18: 2 connections), (13: 2 connections), (16: 5 connections), (12: 5 connections), (6: 3 connections), (17: 3 connections), (14: 5 connections), (8: 4 connections), (24: 3 connections), (15: 4 connections), (28: 1 connection), (27: 1 connection), (25: 1 connection), (10: 1 connection), (23: 3 connections), (22: 2 connections), (9: 2 connections).

Now, for each edge, we only consider the connections if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
