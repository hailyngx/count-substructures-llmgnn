Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 2), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 7), (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 8), (7, 6), (7, 9), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 2), (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 4), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 0), (0, 7), (0, 5), (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 3), (2, 7)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees from least to most connections: 

Node 0: degree 2 
Node 4: degree 3 
Node 8: degree 3 
Node 5: degree 4 
Node 1: degree 4 
Node 8: degree 4 
Node 3: degree 6 
Node 7: degree 6 
Node 2: degree 6 
Node 6: degree 6 
Node 9: degree 7 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will proceed to count the number of triangles:

The shared connections for each edge are as follows:
- Shared connections for edge (6, 9) are: 2, 7
- Shared connections for edge (6, 5) are: 
- Shared connections for edge (6, 7) are: 2
- Shared connections for edge (6, 2) are: 9, 7
- Shared connections for edge (9, 8) are: 
- Shared connections for edge (9, 1) are: 
- Shared connections for edge (1, 3) are: 
- Shared connections for edge (1, 5) are: 
- Shared connections for edge (3, 4) are: 
- Shared connections for edge (4, 8) are: 
- Shared connections for edge (7, 0) are: 
- Shared connections for edge (7, 2) are: 9
- Shared connections for edge (5, 0) are: 
- Shared connections for edge (0, 2) are: 

Calculating the total number of triangles: 
Total triangles: [6]

Unique triangles: 
<6, 2, 9>
