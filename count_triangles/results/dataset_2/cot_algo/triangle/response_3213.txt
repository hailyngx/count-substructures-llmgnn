Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 25) (9, 24) (9, 1) (9, 12) (26, 14) (26, 10) (26, 15) (26, 7) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 23) (13, 27) (2, 16) (2, 3) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 28) (4, 5) (4, 29) (17, 16) (17, 28) (17, 27) (29, 4) (29, 19) (1, 9) (1, 22) (1, 27) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 24) (3, 10) (21, 14) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 11) (19, 18) (19, 29) (19, 5) (19, 22) (14, 26) (14, 21) (22, 1) (22, 19) (22, 6) (22, 28) (22, 7) (10, 26) (10, 3) (10, 27) (10, 23) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 24) (24, 9) (24, 3) (24, 11) (0, 3) (0, 15) (25, 9) (25, 16) (25, 12) (15, 26) (15, 0) (28, 18) (28, 17) (28, 22) (16, 2) (16, 17) (16, 25) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 25) (12, 20) (20, 12) (6, 22) (6, 23) (6, 27) (27, 13) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 10) (27, 6) (7, 26) (7, 22) (23, 13) (23, 10) (23, 6) 

Response:
The given graph consists of 30 nodes and 90 edges. 

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 0: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 20: degree 1
Node 4: degree 4
Node 21: degree 1
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3
Node 17: degree 4
Node 2: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 22: degree 5
Node 1: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 26: degree 4
Node 18: degree 3
Node 23: degree 3
Node 10: degree 4
Node 27: degree 5
Node 24: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 28: degree 4
Node 25: degree 3
Node 11: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 29: degree 3
Node 15: degree 2
Node 19: degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Check each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Count triangles if there are shared connections:
