Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 4), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (7, 8), (7, 0), (1, 3), (1, 6), (3, 6), (6, 0), (2, 9), (8, 0)

Now, let's find the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node Degrees:  
0 -> 5, 1 -> 3, 2 -> 2, 3 -> 2, 4 -> 3, 5 -> 5, 6 -> 3, 7 -> 2, 8 -> 3, 9 -> 5

Sorted by degrees: 2, 3, 7, 8, 6, 4, 1, 0, 9, 5

Triangles:  
Total number of triangles: [18]
Unique triangles: <<0, 2, 5>>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 8, 7>, <0, 2, 5>
