Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 6
Node 3: Degree 6
Node 9: Degree 6
Node 0: Degree 6

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now proceed with counting the triangles:

Triangle <0, 1, 3>
Triangle <0, 1, 6>
Triangle <0, 1, 9>
Triangle <0, 3, 6>
Triangle <0, 3, 9>
Triangle <1, 3, 9>
Triangle <3, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
