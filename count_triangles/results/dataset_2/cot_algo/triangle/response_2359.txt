Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 14) (2, 8) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 1) (18, 3) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 14) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 19) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 17) (3, 18) (1, 18) (1, 10) (19, 0) (19, 17) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 7) (17, 19) (4, 10) (4, 15) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (14, 9) (14, 18) (14, 13) (14, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles efficiently. 

Here are the nodes sorted by their degree (number of connections):
0: 4 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 1 connection
3: 1 connection
4: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 5 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 5 connections
9: 5 connections
10: 4 connections
11: 1 connection
12: 3 connections
13: 4 connections
14: 4 connections
15: 4 connections
16: 4 connections
17: 6 connections
18: 4 connections
19: 2 connections

Based on the degree-based ordering, we first consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles found:
1. <0, 8, 9>
2. <0, 8, 19>
3. <0, 7, 17>
4. <0, 19, 17>
5. <1, 10, 18>
6. <4, 10, 15>
7. <4, 14, 12>
8. <4, 14, 13>
9. <5, 7, 17>
10. <5, 13, 15>
11. <5, 13, 14>
12. <6, 9, 15>
13. <6, 9, 14>
14. <6, 9, 15>
15. <6, 9, 15>
16. <8, 9, 15>
17. <8, 9, 14>
18. <8, 0, 19>
19. <12, 13, 14>
