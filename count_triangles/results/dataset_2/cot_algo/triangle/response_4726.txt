Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 9) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 4) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 10) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method focuses on nodes with the least number of connections first. Let's label the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:

Nodes: 
0 (degree 3)
4 (degree 2)
13 (degree 2)
1 (degree 2)
12 (degree 3)
14 (degree 2)
10 (degree 4)
6 (degree 4)
8 (degree 5)
5 (degree 6)
7 (degree 6)
2 (degree 5)
9 (degree 4)
3 (degree 4)
11 (degree 5)

Now, let's find the triangles based on the given graph:

Triangles: 
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 11>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 7, 11>
<2, 9, 14>
<2, 12, 6>
<3, 6, 11>
<3, 6, 14>
<3, 10, 4>
<3, 10, 9>
<4, 10, 9>
<5, 7, 13>
<5, 11, 7>
<6, 11, 14>
<9, 10, 4>
<9, 10, 3>
<11, 5, 7>
