Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:
- Node 1 (degree 3)
- Node 3 (degree 3)
- Node 8 (degree 4)
- Node 5 (degree 4)
- Node 0 (degree 5)
- Node 9 (degree 5)
- Node 7 (degree 4)
- Node 2 (degree 4)
- Node 6 (degree 4)
- Node 4 (degree 5)

Next, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Consider the edge (1, 0) since node 1 has fewer connections than node 0. This edge forms a triangle with node 2.
- Consider the edge (1, 9) since node 1 has fewer connections than node 9. This edge forms a triangle with node 7.
- Consider the edge (3, 0) since node 3 has fewer connections than node 0. This edge forms a triangle with node 7.
- Consider the edge (8, 3) since node 8 has fewer connections than node 3. This edge forms a triangle with node 7.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4], and the unique triangles found are <1, 0, 2>, <1, 9, 7>, <3, 0, 7>, <8, 3, 7>.
