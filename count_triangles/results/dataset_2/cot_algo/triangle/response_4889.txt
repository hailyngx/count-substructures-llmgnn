Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 15) (4, 2) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 19) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 8) (17, 8) (17, 11) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 15) (9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 12) (16, 7) (16, 18) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 6) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 9) (19, 18) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (5, 8) (5, 10) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (11, 1) (11, 17) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 13) (12, 9) (12, 3) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 5) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 18) (13, 3) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
(0, 14), (0, 3), 
(1, 4), (1, 14), (1, 11), (1, 8), 
(2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 10), 
(3, 0), (3, 6), (3, 13), (3, 12), 
(4, 19), (4, 1), (4, 15), (4, 2), 
(5, 8), (5, 10), 
(6, 7), (6, 18), (6, 3), (6, 13), 
(7, 16), (7, 6), (7, 2), 
(8, 1), (8, 17), (8, 5), (8, 15), 
(9, 10), (9, 19), (9, 12), 
(10, 9), (10, 2), (10, 5), 
(11, 1), (11, 17), 
(12, 9), (12, 3), 
(13, 3), (13, 6), 
(14, 0), (14, 1), (14, 19), 
(15, 4), (15, 8), (15, 18), 
(16, 7), (16, 18), 
(17, 8), (17, 11), 
(18, 16), (18, 19), (18, 15), (18, 6), 
(19, 4), (19, 14), (19, 9), (19, 18)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices: 
5, 11, 12, 13, 0, 16, 17, 10, 7, 15, 6, 3, 2, 1, 9, 8, 18, 14, 4, 19

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles.

[Total number of triangles: 4]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 4, 14>, <4, 15, 18>, <3, 6, 12>, <9, 10, 19>
