Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 10) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 7) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 12) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their respective degrees:

Vertex 5: Degree 5
Vertex 9: Degree 4
Vertex 6: Degree 5
Vertex 0: Degree 5
Vertex 14: Degree 3
Vertex 3: Degree 5
Vertex 11: Degree 3
Vertex 13: Degree 3
Vertex 4: Degree 4
Vertex 12: Degree 4
Vertex 7: Degree 4
Vertex 1: Degree 4
Vertex 2: Degree 5
Vertex 8: Degree 1
Vertex 10: Degree 4

Now, we will count the triangles:
