Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by constructing the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0: 9, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5, 7, 6, 8, 2
- Node 2: 5, 9, 8, 1
- Node 3: 7, 6
- Node 4: 5, 7, 8, 6
- Node 5: 2, 8, 1, 4
- Node 6: 9, 4, 1, 3
- Node 7: 9, 4, 0, 3, 1
- Node 8: 5, 4, 2, 0, 1
- Node 9: 6, 2, 7, 0

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degree in increasing order:
Nodes by degree: 3, 0, 9, 6, 2, 1, 8, 4, 7, 5

After relabeling the nodes, the graph edges are:
- (1, 3), (3, 0), (4, 9), (6, 3), (6, 2), (7, 1), (8, 4), (7, 4), (9, 5), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (8, 7), (7, 0), (7, 9), (8, 6), (6, 4), (8, 5), (9, 6), (6, 1)

Now let's count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 13]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 3>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 1>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 8, 4>
