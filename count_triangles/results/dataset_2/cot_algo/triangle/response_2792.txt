Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 18) (8, 7) (8, 18) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 18) (9, 2) (15, 17) (19, 4) (19, 6) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 3) (4, 17) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (16, 5) (16, 17) (18, 13) (18, 8) (18, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (14, 5) (14, 1) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 16) (17, 2) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 17) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and then relabeling them. 

The degree of each vertex is as follows:
Vertex 16: degree 2
Vertex 12: degree 2
Vertex 18: degree 3
Vertex 15: degree 1
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 19: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 3
Vertex 8: degree 2
Vertex 9: degree 4
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 5: degree 4
Vertex 13: degree 4
Vertex 14: degree 2
Vertex 17: degree 4
Vertex 10: degree 2
Vertex 11: degree 4
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 0: degree 4
Vertex 3: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 4

Now, relabeling the vertices from 0 to 19 based on their degree from least to most connected:
Vertex 15: 0
Vertex 12: 1
Vertex 16: 2
Vertex 14: 3
Vertex 8: 4
Vertex 1: 5
Vertex 18: 6
Vertex 19: 7
Vertex 0: 8
Vertex 10: 9
Vertex 2: 10
Vertex 12: 11
Vertex 17: 12
Vertex 5: 13
Vertex 6: 14
Vertex 18: 15
Vertex 13: 16
Vertex 4: 17
Vertex 7: 18
Vertex 3: 19
Vertex 9: 20

Using these relabeled vertices, considering only edges where one endpoint is labeled lower than the other, and looking for shared connections to form unique triangles, we find the following triangles:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 11, 2>
<0, 11, 6>
<0, 11, 8>
<0, 11, 9>
<0, 1, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 14>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 9, 10>
<2, 9, 11>
<2, 10, 17>
<2, 11, 18>
<3, 4, 13>
<3, 4, 17>
<3, 7, 13>
<3, 13, 18>
<4, 5, 13>
<4, 5, 16>
<4, 5, 17>
<4, 5, 19>
<4, 13, 18>
<4, 17, 18>
<5, 13, 16>
<5, 13, 17>
<5, 13, 18>
<6, 11, 18>
<7, 13, 18>
<7, 18, 19>
<8, 13, 18>
<9, 11, 13>
<9, 11, 18>
<9, 13, 18>
<11, 13, 18>

Therefore, there are 34 triangles in the given graph. 
The total number of triangles is [34].
