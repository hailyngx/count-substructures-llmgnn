Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 14) (3, 13) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 6) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 10) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 11) 

Response:
The graph based on the provided information is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(5, 9)  (5, 13)  (5, 2)  (5, 4)  (5, 0)  
(9, 5)  (9, 8)  (9, 11)  (9, 14)  (9, 1)  (9, 7)  
(1, 9)  (1, 14)  (1, 12)  
(3, 14)  (3, 13)  
(4, 5)  (4, 8)  (4, 10)  (4, 11)  (4, 2)  
(8, 9)  (8, 4)  (8, 2)  
(7, 9)  (7, 11)  (7, 13)  
(12, 1)  (12, 14)  (12, 6)  (12, 11)  
(2, 5)  (2, 4)  (2, 8)  (2, 11)  
(0, 5)  (0, 10)  (0, 6)  
(13, 5)  (13, 3)  (13, 7)  (13, 10)  
(10, 4)  (10, 0)  (10, 13)  (10, 14)  
(11, 9)  (11, 4)  (11, 7)  (11, 12)  (11, 2)  (11, 6)  
(14, 9)  (14, 1)  (14, 3)  (14, 12)  (14, 10)  
(6, 12)  (6, 0)  (6, 11)

Now, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

0 (3 connections)
3 (2 connections)
6 (3 connections)
7 (3 connections)
8 (4 connections)
10 (4 connections)
1 (5 connections)
13 (5 connections)
2 (5 connections)
12 (5 connections)
14 (5 connections)
9 (6 connections)
4 (6 connections)
11 (6 connections)
5 (6 connections)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles and list them:

Total number of triangles: [32]

Unique triangles:
<2, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 12>
<0, 6, 11>
<11, 12, 14>
<4, 8, 2>
<0, 10, 6>
<3, 13, 10>
<1, 12, 6>
<1, 9, 7>
<2, 4, 11>
<10, 0, 6>
<1, 9, 14>
<3, 13, 7>
<3, 14, 10>
<1, 12, 14>
<0, 6, 11>
<9, 5, 13>
<11, 12, 6>
<0, 6, 12>
<4, 8, 9>
<11, 6, 12>
<4, 10, 0>
<13, 3, 14>
<14, 10, 13>
<5, 9, 7>
<2, 8, 4>
<4, 11, 2>
<9, 1, 14>
<9, 7, 11>
<7, 11, 13>
<5, 13, 3>
