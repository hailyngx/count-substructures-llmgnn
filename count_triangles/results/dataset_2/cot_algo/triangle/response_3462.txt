Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 27) (11, 12) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 20) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 14) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 13) (1, 18) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 10) (23, 18) (23, 7) (23, 6) (23, 19) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 25) (4, 26) (28, 4) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 9) (29, 14) (17, 2) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 29) (25, 11) (25, 4) (25, 13) (27, 11) (27, 22) (27, 7) (7, 23) (7, 27) (7, 26) (14, 15) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 5) (26, 4) (26, 7) (26, 14) (26, 10) (26, 6) (10, 8) (10, 26) (19, 23) (19, 6) (22, 27) (22, 0) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 5) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 23) (6, 26) (6, 19) (6, 18) (20, 16) (20, 1) (18, 1) (18, 23) (18, 6) (18, 24) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 24) (24, 8) (24, 18) (24, 12) (0, 22) (0, 21) (21, 0) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 25) 

Response:
The graph has the following structure after relabeling the vertices based on their degrees:  
- Node 0: degree 2  
- Node 1: degree 3  
- Node 2: degree 3  
- Node 3: degree 3  
- Node 4: degree 5  
- Node 5: degree 3  
- Node 6: degree 4  
- Node 7: degree 3  
- Node 8: degree 3  
- Node 9: degree 4  
- Node 10: degree 2  
- Node 11: degree 4  
- Node 12: degree 3  
- Node 13: degree 3  
- Node 14: degree 4  
- Node 15: degree 3  
- Node 16: degree 3  
- Node 17: degree 1  
- Node 18: degree 4  
- Node 19: degree 2  
- Node 20: degree 2  
- Node 21: degree 1  
- Node 22: degree 2  
- Node 23: degree 4  
- Node 24: degree 3  
- Node 25: degree 3  
- Node 26: degree 5  
- Node 27: degree 3  
- Node 28: degree 3  
- Node 29: degree 3  

After sorting the vertices by degree, we can count the triangles and list them:
- Triangle <1, 4, 13>
- Triangle <1, 4, 25>
- Triangle <1, 13, 25>
- Triangle <4, 9, 29>
- Triangle <4, 10, 26>
- Triangle <4, 14, 26>
- Triangle <9, 14, 29>
- Triangle <13, 25, 27>

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in total in the given graph.
