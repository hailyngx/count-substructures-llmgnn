Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 19) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 2) (1, 17) (1, 13) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 5) (5, 17) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 18) (18, 13) (18, 9) (19, 0) (19, 7) (6, 17) (9, 18) (9, 7) (9, 12) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 15) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 3) (16, 10) (16, 4) (16, 17) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 7) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, relabel the vertices accordingly to create a new list.
Upon sorting, the new labels for the vertices are:  
0:  5 connections  
1:  3 connections  
2:  4 connections  
3:  5 connections  
4:  4 connections  
5:  1 connection  
6:  1 connection  
7:  4 connections  
8:  3 connections  
9:  3 connections  
10: 2 connections  
11: 2 connections  
12: 4 connections  
13: 4 connections  
14: 2 connections  
15: 3 connections  
16: 4 connections  
17: 5 connections  
18: 2 connections  
19: 2 connections  

Now, we will go through the edges and count the number of triangles formed:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 13>
<0, 3, 15>
<0, 7, 15>
<2, 3, 4>
<3, 7, 15>
<3, 7, 13>
<3, 10, 16>
<4, 8, 15>
<4, 16, 17>
<8, 15, 7>
<12, 13, 17>

Total number of triangles: [13]
