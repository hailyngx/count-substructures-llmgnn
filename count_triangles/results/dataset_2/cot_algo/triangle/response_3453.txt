Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 10) (27, 7) (1, 7) (21, 15) (21, 16) (8, 15) (8, 13) (8, 26) (8, 22) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 28) (13, 14) (20, 15) (20, 22) (4, 23) (4, 5) (4, 29) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 25) (11, 28) (11, 22) (11, 17) (28, 13) (28, 11) (28, 24) (29, 4) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 0) (9, 29) (9, 14) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 26) (10, 7) (0, 29) (0, 16) (0, 3) (16, 21) (16, 0) (16, 24) (16, 14) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 24) (17, 22) (25, 18) (26, 8) (26, 29) (26, 10) (26, 2) (6, 17) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 23) (23, 4) (23, 5) (23, 3) (3, 0) (3, 23) (24, 28) (24, 16) (24, 17) (2, 13) (2, 26) (2, 19) (19, 2) (19, 7) (12, 14) (7, 27) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 19) (22, 8) (22, 20) (22, 11) (22, 17) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 16) (14, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections and relabeling them accordingly:

Node 5: 2 connections
Node 19: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 20: 5 connections
Node 21: 5 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 12: 6 connections
Node 8: 7 connections
Node 24: 7 connections
Node 25: 7 connections
Node 22: 8 connections
Node 26: 8 connections
Node 13: 9 connections
Node 14: 9 connections
Node 23: 9 connections
Node 11: 10 connections
Node 17: 10 connections
Node 10: 11 connections
Node 15: 11 connections
Node 16: 11 connections
Node 18: 11 connections
Node 28: 11 connections
Node 29: 11 connections
Node 27: 13 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
