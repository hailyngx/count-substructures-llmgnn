Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 10) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 18) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 18) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 9) (15, 1) (15, 4) (2, 13) (2, 9) (12, 10) (12, 19) (14, 6) (14, 8) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 3) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 9) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (19, 7) (19, 12) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 12) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 7) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges has the following adjacency list representation:

0: 7, 4, 18
1: 5, 15, 10, 9
2: 13, 9
3: 13, 4, 8
4: 0, 15, 3, 9
5: 13, 1, 10
6: 16, 14, 17
7: 0, 19, 18, 8
8: 7, 14, 17, 3
9: 16, 1, 2, 4
10: 12, 5, 1
11: 16, 17
12: 10, 19
13: 5, 2, 3
14: 6, 8
15: 1, 4
16: 11, 18, 9, 6
17: 11, 6, 8
18: 16, 0, 7
19: 7, 12

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices sorted by degree:
2 < 12, 3, 5, 15, 19 < 0, 1, 4, 8, 14 < 11, 13, 16, 17, 6 < 7, 9, 10, 18

Now, we will count the triangles formed in this graph.

Triangles: 16

Triangle vertices:
<3, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 10, 15>, <4, 9, 16>, <7, 12, 19>, <7, 18, 19>, <0, 4, 18>, <0, 7, 18>, <0, 7, 19>, <1, 5, 15>, <1, 9, 16>, <5, 9, 13>, <8, 14, 17>, <13, 2, 9>, <16, 6, 17> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [16].
