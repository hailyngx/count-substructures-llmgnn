Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the provided edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- 0: (5), (4)
- 1: (5), (9), (7), (8), (6)
- 2: (5), (8), (6)
- 3: (4), (7), (8)
- 4: (9), (0), (6), (3)
- 5: (9), (2), (8), (1), (0)
- 6: (4), (2), (8), (1)
- 7: (9), (3), (8), (1)
- 8: (5), (7), (2), (6), (3), (1)
- 9: (5), (9), (4), (7), (1)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree in non-increasing order:
Degree: 
- 0: 2
- 1: 5
- 2: 3
- 3: 3
- 4: 4
- 5: 5
- 6: 4
- 7: 4
- 8: 6
- 9: 5

Sorted nodes: 8 > 1 > 5 > 6 > 7 > 4 > 9 > 0 > 2 > 3

Next, we will analyze each edge accordingly:
- (5, 9): Both 5 and 9 have higher degrees than 2, so no triangle is formed.
- (5, 2): Both 5 and 2 have higher degrees than 3, so no triangle is formed.
- (5, 8): 5 has a lower degree than 8, forming a triangle <5, 8, 1>.
- (5, 1): Both 5 and 1 have higher degrees than 5, so no triangle is formed.
- (5, 0): 5 has a lower degree than 2, forming a triangle <5, 0, 4>.
- (9, 4): Both 9 and 4 have higher degrees than 4, so no triangle is formed.
- (9, 1): 9 has a higher degree than 1, forming a triangle <9, 1, 7>.
- (9, 7): Both 9 and 7 have higher degrees than 4, so no triangle is formed.
- (4, 9): Both 9 and 4 have higher degrees than 4, so no triangle is formed.
- (4, 0): 4 has a higher degree than 2, forming a triangle <4, 0, 5>.
- (4, 6): Both 4 and 6 have higher degrees than 4, so no triangle is formed.
- (4, 3): Both 4 and 3 have higher degrees than 3, so no triangle is formed.
- (7, 9): Both 7 and 9 have higher degrees than 4, so no triangle is formed.
- (7, 3): Both 7 and 3 have higher degrees than 3, so no triangle is formed.
- (7, 8): 7 has a lower degree than 8, forming a triangle <7, 8, 1>.
- (7, 1): 7 has a lower degree than 1, forming a triangle <7, 1, 9>.
- (2, 5): Both 2 and 5 have higher degrees than 3, so no triangle is formed.
- (2, 8): Both 2 and 8 have higher degrees than 3, so no triangle is formed.
- (2, 6): Both 2 and 6 have higher degrees than 3, so no triangle is formed.
- (8, 5): 8 has a lower degree than 5, forming a triangle <8, 5, 1>.
- (8, 7): 8 has a lower degree than 7, forming a triangle <8, 7, 1>.
- (8, 2): 8 has a lower degree than 2, forming a triangle <8, 2, 5>.
- (8, 6): 8 has a lower degree than 6, forming a triangle <8, 6, 4>.
- (8, 3): 8 has a lower degree than 3, forming a triangle <8, 3, 4>.

The total number of triangles is [7].

The unique triangles found are:
- <5, 8, 1>
- <5, 0, 4>
- <9, 1, 7>
- <4, 0, 5>
- <7, 8, 1>
- <7, 1, 9>
- <8, 5, 1>
- <8, 7, 1>
- <8, 2, 5>
- <8, 6, 4>
- <8, 3, 4>
