Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (2, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now let's construct the graph with the given edges. 

The graph looks like this:
Nodes:
0--1
|  |\
|  | 4
|  |/
3--5--8
| /|/
|/ |/
2--4--9
|  |
7--6

Now, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees from least to most:
Nodes: <2, 7, 9, 0, 7, 1, 6, 3, 8, 5>

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Triangles: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <3, 4, 5>

Total number of triangles: [4]
