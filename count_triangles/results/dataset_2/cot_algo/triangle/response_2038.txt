This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 27) (3, 12) (15, 21) (15, 11) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 18) (20, 0) (20, 22) (20, 14) (28, 29) (28, 27) (28, 13) (29, 28) (29, 27) (29, 6) (29, 23) (5, 23) (5, 8) (5, 25) (5, 11) (6, 29) (4, 18) (4, 21) (4, 25) (18, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 9) (21, 15) (21, 4) (21, 11) (13, 28) (13, 17) (13, 24) (17, 13) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 22) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 25) (16, 8) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 24) (19, 27) (25, 5) (25, 4) (25, 16) (10, 3) (10, 14) (12, 3) (12, 16) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 22) (23, 29) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 2) (8, 5) (8, 16) (27, 3) (27, 28) (27, 29) (27, 19) (2, 23) (2, 7) (7, 2) (7, 14) (11, 15) (11, 5) (11, 21) (11, 22) (22, 20) (22, 17) (22, 1) (22, 11) (22, 24) (14, 20) (14, 10) (14, 7) (24, 13) (24, 19) (24, 22) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges. 

The sorted list of nodes based on their degrees is as follows:
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 12: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 6
Node 14: Degree 3
Node 15: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 28: Degree 4
Node 29: Degree 5
Node 23: Degree 4
Node 20: Degree 4
Node 17: Degree 4
Node 25: Degree 3
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 22: Degree 5
Node 21: Degree 4
Node 24: Degree 3
Node 16: Degree 4
Node 19: Degree 4
Node 27: Degree 5
Node 18: Degree 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method and the provided edges, the total number of triangles in the graph is [72].

Here are some unique triangles found in the graph:

<11, 21, 15>
<0, 20, 16>
<0, 9, 18>
<0, 18, 4>
<0, 18, 19>
<14, 20, 7>
<13, 28, 29>
<13, 28, 27>
