Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 17) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 15) (2, 8) (8, 16) (8, 2) (8, 19) (1, 17) (1, 14) (17, 9) (17, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (15, 16) (15, 4) (15, 12) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 13) (18, 11) (18, 9) (18, 14) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 13) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (14, 1) (14, 18) (13, 0) (13, 19) (13, 3) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on the number of connections are as follows:
Vertices: 2, 1, 17, 14, 6, 13, 19, 8, 7, 18, 5, 11, 4, 15, 10, 9, 12, 0, 3, 16

Based on the sorted vertices, we will now list the unique triangles:
Triangles: <0, 7, 12>, <0, 11, 18>, <0, 5, 9>, <3, 10, 12>, <3, 10, 6>, <3, 13, 19>, <4, 12, 15>, <5, 9, 18>, <8, 2, 16>, <11, 16, 19>, <13, 19, 0>

Total number of triangles: [11]
