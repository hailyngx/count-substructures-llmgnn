Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 14) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 13) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 2) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 10), (4, 14), (4, 6), (7, 12), (7, 14), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 1), (1, 3), (1, 6), (3, 9), (3, 5), (3, 8), (10, 11), (10, 12), (11, 9), (11, 5), (8, 9), (8, 14), (12, 13), (0, 13), (0, 2), (14, 2), (5, 13), (13, 9), (6, 1), (6, 11)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the nodes sorted by the number of connections (degree) from least to most are:
0, 2, 12, 10, 14, 9, 8, 13, 5, 6, 1, 3, 11, 7, 4

Now, we will count the triangles by checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge:

[Total number of triangles: 4]
<4, 7, 14>, <6, 10, 11>, <6, 1, 4>, <1, 3, 5>
