Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 4) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 3) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 10) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 10) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 10) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree of connectivity.

The vertices with their corresponding degrees are as follows:
Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 3
Vertex 2: degree 3
Vertex 3: degree 4
Vertex 4: degree 5
Vertex 5: degree 4
Vertex 6: degree 4
Vertex 7: degree 2
Vertex 8: degree 5
Vertex 9: degree 4
Vertex 10: degree 6
Vertex 11: degree 4
Vertex 12: degree 5
Vertex 13: degree 4
Vertex 14: degree 5

Based on the degree-based ordering, the vertices are relabeled from 0 to 14 as follows:
Vertex 0: 9
Vertex 1: 7
Vertex 2: 11
Vertex 3: 0
Vertex 4: 5
Vertex 5: 1
Vertex 6: 2
Vertex 7: 6
Vertex 8: 12
Vertex 9: 3
Vertex 10: 8
Vertex 11: 13
Vertex 12: 4
Vertex 13: 10
Vertex 14: 14

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the edges based on this relabeling:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 11>
<0, 2, 12>
<0, 8, 12>
<0, 10, 12>
<1, 5, 4>
<1, 5, 13>
<2, 6, 12>
<4, 5, 13>
<4, 5, 10>
<4, 9, 11>
<4, 10, 12>
<8, 10, 12>
<10, 12, 14>

Total number of triangles: [13]
