Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 12) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 15) (17, 4) (6, 7) (6, 12) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 19) (8, 10) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 18) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 3) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 3) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 16) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 16) (7, 10) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 18) (1, 9) (1, 4) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 18) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 10) (15, 5) (15, 17) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the vertices is as follows:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 2
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 2
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 5
Node 14: degree 2
Node 15: degree 2
Node 16: degree 3
Node 17: degree 2
Node 18: degree 3
Node 19: degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.
