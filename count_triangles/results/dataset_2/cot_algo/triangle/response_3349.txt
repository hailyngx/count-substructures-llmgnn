Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 18) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 11) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 14) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 18) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 19) (5, 17) (5, 8) (5, 11) (6, 15) (6, 16) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 16) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 0) (13, 16) (13, 11) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 2) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 13) (15, 6) (15, 9) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 16) (16, 6) (16, 18) (16, 13) (16, 9) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 3), (0, 14), (0, 18)
(1, 2), (1, 10), (1, 12)
(2, 3), (2, 19)
(3, 4), (3, 14)
(4, 10), (4, 19)
(5, 8), (5, 11), (5, 17)
(6, 15), (6, 16)
(7, 11), (7, 18)
(8, 14), (8, 17), (8, 19)
(9, 12), (9, 15), (9, 16)
(10, 17)
(11, 13)
(13, 16)
(16, 18)

Next, let's calculate the number of connections for each node:
0: 3 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 3 connections
3: 5 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 3 connections
10: 2 connections
11: 4 connections
12: 2 connections
13: 2 connections
14: 3 connections
15: 2 connections
16: 4 connections
17: 3 connections
18: 3 connections
19: 3 connections

We will now sort the nodes based on the number of connections in ascending order and relabel them accordingly: 
Nodes: 6, 7, 12, 13, 10, 19, 2, 5, 9, 0, 1, 4, 8, 18, 3, 14, 17, 11, 15, 16

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 14]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 14>
<3, 4, 10>
<3, 4, 19>
<3, 8, 14>
<3, 5, 17>
<5, 8, 17>
<5, 11, 13>
<6, 16, 18>
<7, 11, 17>
<9, 12, 15>
<9, 15, 16>
<11, 13, 16>
