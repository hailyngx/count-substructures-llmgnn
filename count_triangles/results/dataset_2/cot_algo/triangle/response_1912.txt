Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, and then relabeling the vertices accordingly.

The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is: 8, 7, 2, 5, 3, 1, 0, 4, 6, 9.

Now, we will examine each edge and count the triangles by checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

Calculating the total number of triangles... 

There are 13 triangles found: <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 1, 4>, <2, 1, 6>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 0, 6>, <3, 2, 4>, <3, 2, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [13].
