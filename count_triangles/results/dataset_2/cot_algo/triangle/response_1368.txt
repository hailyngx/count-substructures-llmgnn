Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 16) (6, 14) (9, 18) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 18) (0, 16) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 7) (7, 16) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 19) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 19) (19, 12) (19, 4) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 18) (17, 7) (17, 12) 

Response:
The given graph G with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges:
(3, 15), (3, 10), (3, 13), 
(15, 16), 
(6, 14), 
(9, 18), 
(5, 8), (5, 12), (5, 10), 
(2, 8), (2, 12), (2, 1), 
(8, 14), (8, 11), 
(1, 11), (1, 16), (1, 18), 
(0, 16), 
(16, 7), 
(7, 13), (7, 17), 
(12, 13), (12, 17), (12, 19), 
(11, 4), 
(14, 6), (14, 4), 
(18, 9), (18, 10), 
(4, 19), 
(13, 11), 
(10, 18), 
(17, 12)

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degrees from least connected to most connected:
Node degrees: 
0: 1, 1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 1, 7: 3, 8: 4, 9: 1, 10: 3, 11: 4, 12: 4, 13: 4, 14: 3, 15: 2, 16: 4, 17: 2, 18: 3, 19: 2

After relabeling, the new ordering of nodes is:
Nodes: {0, 15, 9, 6, 17, 19, 2, 5, 10, 7, 1, 18, 3, 14, 12, 13, 8, 4, 11, 16}

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 23]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 11, 13>, <1, 11, 14>, <1, 11, 4>, <1, 11, 8>, <1, 13, 11>, <1, 13, 12>, <1, 14, 11>, <1, 16, 15>, <1, 16, 7>, <1, 16, 0>, <1, 18, 9>, <1, 18, 10>, <2, 8, 5>, <2, 8, 12>, <2, 12, 5>, <5, 8, 14>, <5, 8, 12>, <5, 10, 3>, <8, 11, 1>, <8, 11, 14>, <8, 11, 4>, <11, 13, 12>, <13, 11, 4>
