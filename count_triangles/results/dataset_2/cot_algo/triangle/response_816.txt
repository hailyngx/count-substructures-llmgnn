Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
The given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 7)
(9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 0)
(6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 8)
(1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 0), (1, 8), (1, 7)
(3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 4), (3, 2)
(4, 5), (4, 3), (4, 0)
(8, 9), (8, 6), (8, 1)
(0, 9), (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 2), (0, 7)
(2, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 0)
(7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 0)

Now, we will label the vertices based on their degrees from least to most:

Node 4 (Degree: 3)
Node 9 (Degree: 3)
Node 8 (Degree: 4)
Node 2 (Degree: 4)
Node 7 (Degree: 5)
Node 0 (Degree: 5)
Node 6 (Degree: 5)
Node 1 (Degree: 5)
Node 3 (Degree: 5)
Node 5 (Degree: 6)

Now, we will count the triangles by checking shared connections between vertices with lower labels. The triangles found are:

<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 2>
<3, 4, 0>
<3, 4, 5>
<7, 9, 0>
<7, 9, 8>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
