Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on the number of connections each node has. 

Here is the construction of the graph with the nodes and edges sorted based on the number of connections:
Nodes: 5, 9, 4, 7, 3, 2, 6, 0, 1, 8

Edges: 
(1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles in the graph:
Triangles: [<1, 3, 7>, <7, 2, 6>]

[Total number of triangles: 2]
