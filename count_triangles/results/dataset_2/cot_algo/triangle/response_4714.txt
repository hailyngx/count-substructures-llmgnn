Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 10, Edges: 40
  
0: 9, 6, 7  
1: 5, 9, 6, 4  
2: 4, 7, 8, 3  
3: 5, 4, 7, 2  
4: 5, 9, 3, 1, 2  
5: 9, 1, 4, 3  
6: 9, 6, 1, 0  
7: 9, 0, 3, 2, 8  
8: 7, 2  
9: 5, 9, 6, 4, 7, 0, 1  

Let's identify the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles []: [[<1, 4, 5>, <7, 8, 9>]]  
Total number of triangles []: [2]
