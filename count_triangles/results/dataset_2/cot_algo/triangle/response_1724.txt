Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 29) (13, 20) (13, 19) (22, 14) (22, 16) (22, 10) (3, 15) (3, 23) (3, 9) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 16) (15, 19) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 20) (2, 7) (29, 13) (29, 2) (29, 16) (25, 27) (25, 17) (25, 16) (25, 12) (7, 2) (7, 0) (21, 6) (21, 26) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 18) (18, 2) (18, 8) (18, 10) (18, 11) (0, 7) (0, 20) (20, 13) (20, 2) (20, 0) (20, 12) (28, 17) (28, 9) (28, 24) (9, 3) (9, 28) (6, 21) (6, 12) (5, 24) (5, 16) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 4) (19, 1) (16, 22) (16, 15) (16, 29) (16, 25) (16, 5) (1, 19) (1, 24) (27, 25) (27, 17) (17, 25) (17, 28) (17, 27) (26, 21) (24, 8) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 1) (10, 22) (10, 18) (10, 23) (10, 14) (11, 18) (11, 12) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 10) (12, 25) (12, 20) (12, 6) (12, 11) (23, 3) (23, 10) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, ..., 29}
- Edges:
  - 0: {7, 20}
  - 1: {19, 24}
  - 2: {7, 18, 20, 29}
  - 3: {4, 9, 15, 19, 23}
  - 4: {3, 8, 14, 19}
  - 5: {16, 24}
  - 6: {12, 21}
  - 7: {0, 2}
  - 8: {4, 8, 18, 24}
  - 9: {3, 28}
  - 10: {14, 18, 22, 23}
  - 11: {12, 18}
  - 12: {6, 11, 20, 25}
  - 13: {19, 20, 29}
  - 14: {4, 10, 22}
  - 15: {3, 16, 19}
  - 16: {5, 15, 22, 25, 29}
  - 17: {25, 27, 28}
  - 18: {2, 8, 10, 11}
  - 19: {1, 3, 4, 13, 15}
  - 20: {0, 2, 12, 13}
  - 21: {6, 26}
  - 22: {10, 14, 16}
  - 23: {3, 10}
  - 24: {1, 5, 8, 24}
  - 25: {12, 16, 17}
  - 26: {21}
  - 27: {17, 25}
  - 28: {9, 17, 24}
  - 29: {2, 13, 16}

By sorting the nodes by their degrees in increasing order, we have the following order of nodes: [21, 26, 0, 1, 5, 7, 11, 6, 9, 10, 14, 23, 27, 4, 8, 12, 3, 15, 19, 22, 29, 2, 16, 17, 18, 24, 13, 20, 25, 28]

Now, let's count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Number of triangles: [13]  
Unique triangles found: <3, 4, 19>
