Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 6) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 19) (10, 17) (10, 6) (17, 10) (17, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 19) (18, 4) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 14) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 7) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 1) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 7) (14, 6) (2, 17) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order. The sorted vertices are then relabeled accordingly from 0 to 19.

The sorted vertices with their corresponding degrees are:
Vertex 0: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 1: degree 2
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 5: degree 4
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 6: degree 5
Vertex 8: degree 4
Vertex 12: degree 4
Vertex 9: degree 2
Vertex 13: degree 3
Vertex 10: degree 2
Vertex 14: degree 2
Vertex 11: degree 3
Vertex 15: degree 2
Vertex 17: degree 2
Vertex 18: degree 4
Vertex 16: degree 5
Vertex 19: degree 3

Now, we will proceed to count the triangles in the graph.

Total number of triangles: [20]
