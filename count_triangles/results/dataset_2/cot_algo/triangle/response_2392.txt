Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted vertices are: 

Vertex 3 - 2 connections
Vertex 6 - 2 connections
Vertex 9 - 3 connections
Vertex 5 - 4 connections
Vertex 7 - 4 connections
Vertex 0 - 5 connections
Vertex 1 - 5 connections
Vertex 8 - 5 connections
Vertex 4 - 6 connections
Vertex 2 - 6 connections

Now, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles:

1. Edge (4, 7): Both vertices have 4 common neighbors (5, 8, 1, 2) forming 4 triangles <4, 5, 8>, <4, 1, 2>, <7, 5, 8>, <7, 1, 2>.
2. Edge (4, 8): Both vertices have 4 common neighbors (1, 2, 7, 5) forming 3 triangles <4, 1, 2>, <4, 7, 5>, <8, 1, 2>.
3. Edge (4, 5): Both vertices have 4 common neighbors (7, 8, 2, 1) forming 3 triangles <4, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 2>, <4, 5, 7>.
4. Edge (4, 1): Both vertices have 4 common neighbors (2, 8, 7, 5) forming 3 triangles <4, 2, 8>, <4, 7, 5>, <4, 5, 8>.
5. Edge (4, 2): Both vertices have 4 common neighbors (1, 8, 7, 5) forming 3 triangles <4, 1, 8>, <4, 7, 5>, <4, 5, 8>.
6. Edge (7, 2): Both vertices have 4 common neighbors (1, 4, 8, 5) forming 2 triangles <7, 1, 4>, <7, 4, 8>.
7. Edge (7, 5): Both vertices have 3 common neighbors (4, 8, 2) forming 2 triangles <7, 4, 8>, <7, 4, 2>.
8. Edge (7, 8): Both vertices have 3 common neighbors (4, 1, 2) forming 2 triangles <7, 4, 1>, <7, 4, 2>.
9. Edge (1, 2): Both vertices have 3 common neighbors (4, 8, 7) forming 2 triangles <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 7>.
10. Edge (1, 9): Both vertices have 2 common neighbors (8, 0) forming 1 triangle <1, 8, 9>.
11. Edge (1, 0): Both vertices have 2 common neighbors (8, 9) forming 1 triangle <1, 8, 9>.
12. Edge (8, 9): Both vertices have 2 common neighbors (1, 0) forming 1 triangle <8, 1, 0>.
13. Edge (0, 9): Both vertices have 2 common neighbors (8, 1) forming 1 triangle <0, 8, 1>.
14. Edge (0, 5): Both vertices have 2 common neighbors (4, 2) forming 1 triangle <0, 4, 2>.

After considering all the edges, the total number of triangles is [22].
