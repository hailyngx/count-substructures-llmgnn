Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is constructed as follows:
```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 8), (9, 7), (6, 4), (1, 0), (3, 0),
       (4, 2), (7, 9), (8, 2)
       (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 8), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 8),
       (4, 0), (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 0), (2, 4), (2, 0),
       (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 2)
```

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in this graph. 

Vertices by their number of connections (degree):
```
0: 6 connections
2: 4 connections
9: 4 connections
5: 5 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 4 connections
1: 5 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 6 connections
8: 6 connections
```
Relabeling the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices: 2, 3, 9, 6, 7, 0, 4, 1, 8, 5

Triangles found by checking shared connections between vertices based on lower label having fewer connections:
```
[Total number of triangles: 5]
<2, 0, 4>, <2, 0, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 0>, <4, 0, 8>
``` 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 5.
