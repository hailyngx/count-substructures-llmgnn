Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (9, 5) (9, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 15) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 13) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 15) (18, 16) (18, 11) (3, 0) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 11) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 2) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 16) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 4) (1, 19) (1, 0) (1, 8) (14, 4) (14, 13) (4, 16) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 13) (4, 2) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 4) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 11) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 4) 

Response:
The graph based on the provided information:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

Edges:
- 0: [3, 11, 1, 8]
- 1: [0, 19, 8, 13]
- 2: [7, 17, 4]
- 3: [0]
- 4: [16, 10, 14, 13, 2]
- 5: [9, 19]
- 6: [17, 10, 11]
- 7: [12, 2]
- 8: [0, 1, 11]
- 9: [5, 13]
- 10: [16, 6, 4]
- 11: [0, 18, 6, 8]
- 12: [7, 17, 15]
- 13: [9, 19, 14, 4]
- 14: [4, 13]
- 15: [12, 19, 16]
- 16: [18, 4, 15, 10]
- 17: [12, 6, 2]
- 18: [16, 11]
- 19: [5, 15, 1, 13]

The Degree-Based Ordering is as follows:
Vertices sorted based on their degrees (from lowest to highest):
[3, 18, 5, 7, 14, 8, 2, 17, 6, 9, 10, 12, 11, 1, 4, 19, 15, 0, 13, 16]

After relabeling, the edges to be considered become:
(3, 0), (18, 11), (18, 16), (5, 9), (7, 2), (14, 4), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 11), (2, 4), (17, 6), (6, 10), (9, 13), (10, 6), (13, 19), (16, 15)

The total number of triangles formed in this graph is [7].

Unique triangles:
<1, 4, 13>
<4, 13, 14>
<8, 11, 18>
<0, 8, 11>
<9, 13, 19>
<6, 10, 16>
<2, 4, 17>
