Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (13, 2) (22, 19) (22, 27) (22, 15) (22, 29) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 23) (21, 5) (10, 3) (10, 4) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 7) (15, 22) (15, 14) (20, 27) (6, 16) (6, 11) (0, 25) (0, 26) (14, 15) (14, 27) (14, 9) (14, 12) (24, 7) (24, 4) (24, 5) (26, 0) (26, 2) (26, 16) (29, 22) (29, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (19, 22) (19, 4) (19, 7) (16, 6) (16, 26) (16, 5) (23, 21) (23, 18) (23, 9) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 8) (5, 21) (5, 24) (5, 8) (5, 16) (2, 13) (2, 26) (2, 4) (18, 23) (18, 27) (18, 25) (4, 10) (4, 24) (4, 19) (4, 2) (4, 25) (27, 22) (27, 21) (27, 20) (27, 14) (27, 18) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 11) (7, 17) (7, 24) (7, 19) (7, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 25) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 23) (9, 7) (25, 0) (25, 18) (25, 4) (25, 11) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their corresponding degrees:
0: 2
1: 3
2: 3
3: 4
4: 5
5: 5
6: 2
7: 4
8: 3
9: 4
10: 3
11: 3
12: 3
13: 2
14: 4
15: 2
16: 3
17: 3
18: 3
19: 3
20: 1
21: 4
22: 5
23: 3
24: 4
25: 4
26: 4
27: 5
29: 3

Now, we will examine each edge, considering only pairs where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Analyzing the graph for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find:
[Total number of triangles: 8]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 25>
<2, 4, 26>
<3, 4, 25>
<3, 4, 24>
<3, 4, 19>
<4, 7, 24>
<4, 9, 14>
<4, 9, 23>
