Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 9) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 20) (22, 29) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 21) (9, 13) (9, 5) (9, 28) (9, 17) (9, 16) (15, 14) (27, 12) (27, 8) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 10) (21, 5) (21, 7) (21, 19) (21, 11) (21, 14) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 12) (10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 6) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 23) (17, 10) (17, 1) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 0) (8, 27) (8, 4) (8, 29) (8, 25) (12, 27) (12, 23) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 26) (14, 13) (14, 15) (14, 21) (14, 18) (18, 4) (18, 14) (1, 17) (1, 24) (24, 1) (24, 26) (26, 5) (26, 0) (26, 24) (26, 29) (26, 25) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 25) (6, 10) (6, 2) (11, 7) (11, 21) (11, 2) (3, 20) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 26) (28, 9) (28, 19) (20, 22) (20, 3) (25, 23) (25, 8) (25, 26) (25, 2) (19, 7) (19, 21) (19, 28) (16, 9) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
- 0: (13, 22), (13, 17), (13, 9), (13, 14)
- 1: (22, 13), (22, 20), (22, 29)
- 2: (5, 9), (5, 26), (5, 21)
- 3: (9, 13), (9, 5), (9, 28), (9, 17), (9, 16)
- 4: (15, 14)
- 5: (27, 12), (27, 8)
- 6: (7, 21), (7, 11), (7, 19), (7, 10)
- 7: (21, 5), (21, 7), (21, 19), (21, 11), (21, 14)
- 8: (23, 17), (23, 25), (23, 12)
- 9: (10, 7), (10, 17), (10, 6)
- 10: (17, 13), (17, 9), (17, 23), (17, 10), (17, 1)
- 11: (4, 8), (4, 18), (4, 0)
- 12: (8, 27), (8, 4), (8, 29), (8, 25)
- 13: (12, 27), (12, 23), (12, 0)
- 14: (0, 4), (0, 12), (0, 26)
- 15: (14, 13), (14, 15), (14, 21), (14, 18)
- 16: (18, 4), (18, 14)
- 17: (1, 17), (1, 24), (24, 1), (24, 26)
- 18: (26, 5), (26, 0), (26, 24), (26, 29), (26, 25)
- 19: (2, 6), (2, 11), (2, 25)
- 20: (6, 10), (6, 2)
- 21: (11, 7), (11, 21), (11, 2)
- 22: (3, 20), (29, 22), (29, 8), (29, 26)
- 23: (28, 9), (28, 19)
- 24: (20, 22), (20, 3)
- 25: (25, 23), (25, 8), (25, 26), (25, 2)
- 26: (19, 7), (19, 21), (19, 28)
- 27: (16, 9)

Next, we will sort the vertices by their degrees and assign new labels as well. 

New Labels:
0 - Node 24
1 - Node 27
2 - Node 19
3 - Node 12
4 - Node 4
5 - Node 18
6 - Node 9
7 - Node 25
8 - Node 8
9 - Node 11
10 - Node 10
11 - Node 14
12 - Node 21
13 - Node 26
14 - Node 22
15 - Node 15
16 - Node 0
17 - Node 23
18 - Node 17
19 - Node 2
20 - Node 1
21 - Node 20
22 - Node 13
23 - Node 6
24 - Node 3
25 - Node 5
26 - Node 16
27 - Node 7
28 - Node 29

After relabeling, we will check the edges to count the number of triangles by considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles is [16].

Unique triangles found:
<14, 18, 25>
<4, 8, 29>
<6, 10, 17>
<2, 11, 21>
<7, 21, 25>
<9, 10, 17>
<6, 10, 11>
<5, 9, 26>
<4, 8, 25>
<9, 16, 17>
<7, 11, 21>
<12, 23, 27>
<0, 4, 18>
<8, 12, 25>
<7, 11, 19>
<9, 13, 22>
