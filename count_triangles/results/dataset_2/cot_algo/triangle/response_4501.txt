Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 24) (13, 27) (22, 14) (22, 29) (22, 25) (1, 21) (1, 5) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 2) (21, 15) (14, 22) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 25) (9, 14) (9, 5) (9, 24) (10, 23) (10, 28) (11, 27) (11, 12) (3, 14) (8, 17) (8, 23) (8, 19) (23, 10) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 15) (12, 11) (12, 24) (12, 0) (12, 26) (27, 13) (27, 11) (27, 19) (27, 6) (4, 28) (4, 25) (4, 6) (18, 0) (19, 8) (19, 27) (19, 26) (26, 23) (26, 12) (26, 19) (26, 15) (28, 10) (28, 4) (28, 24) (0, 12) (0, 18) (0, 2) (0, 15) (2, 21) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 25) (7, 20) (25, 22) (25, 5) (25, 4) (25, 7) (16, 21) (16, 29) (16, 6) (6, 17) (6, 27) (6, 4) (6, 16) (15, 21) (15, 23) (15, 26) (15, 0) (20, 7) (29, 22) (29, 16) (24, 13) (24, 9) (24, 12) (24, 28) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
- 0: [12, 18, 2, 15]
- 1: [5, 21]
- 2: [0, 5, 21]
- 3: [14]
- 4: [6, 25, 28]
- 5: [1, 2, 9, 25]
- 6: [4, 16, 17, 27]
- 7: [20, 25]
- 8: [17, 19, 23]
- 9: [5, 14, 24]
- 10: [23, 28]
- 11: [12, 27]
- 12: [0, 11, 24, 26]
- 13: [24, 27]
- 14: [3, 9, 17, 22]
- 15: [0, 23, 26, 21]
- 16: [6, 29, 21]
- 17: [8, 14, 6]
- 18: [0]
- 19: [8, 26, 27]
- 20: [7]
- 21: [1, 2, 15, 16]
- 22: [14, 25, 29]
- 23: [8, 10, 15, 26]
- 24: [9, 12, 13, 28]
- 25: [4, 5, 7, 22]
- 26: [12, 15, 19, 23]
- 27: [6, 11, 13, 19]
- 28: [4, 10, 24]
- 29: [16, 22]

Next, we will calculate the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
