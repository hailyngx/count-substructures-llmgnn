Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 10) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 0) (7, 0) (7, 11) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 10) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 12) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the vertices by the number of connections each vertex has. Then, the vertices should be relabeled accordingly. 

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the relabeled vertices are as follows:
- Node 7, 13, 2 have 1 connection each.
- Node 0, 6, 11, 12, 5, 14 have 2 connections each.
- Node 3, 9 have 4 connections each.
- Node 1, 8, 10, 4 have 5 connections each.

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we proceed through the edges considering the condition that the vertex with the lower label must have fewer connections.

The triangles found in the graph are as follows:
