Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Nodes:
0 - 4 connections
3 - 4 connections
9 - 4 connections
1 - 5 connections
2 - 5 connections
6 - 5 connections
5 - 6 connections
7 - 6 connections
8 - 7 connections
4 - 7 connections
