Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 17) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 5) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 17) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 0) (4, 19) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (14, 12) (14, 18) (7, 1) (7, 10) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 16) (17, 9) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 6) (16, 17) (16, 13) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 6) (13, 3) (13, 16) (13, 10) (18, 14) (18, 10) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 2) (2, 3) (2, 10) 

Response:
Edges sorted based on their lowest labeled vertex:
(1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 15) (3, 2) (3, 13) (6, 0) (6, 16) (6, 17) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 15) (0, 19) (2, 3) (2, 10) (4, 12) (4, 19) (5, 8) (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 19) (7, 1) (7, 10) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 17) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 18) (11, 1) (11, 9) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 16) (14, 12) (14, 18) (15, 0) (15, 1) (15, 5) (15, 17) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 17) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 15) (17, 16) (18, 10) (18, 14) (19, 0) (19, 4)
