Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes can be represented as follows based on their number of connections:  
Node 7 (degree 2): 0  
Node 5 (degree 4): 1  
Node 4 (degree 2): 2  
Node 5 (degree 5): 3  
Node 6 (degree 4): 4  
Node 3 (degree 4): 5  
Node 4 (degree 2): 6  
Node 5 (degree 4): 7  
Node 5 (degree 5): 8  
Node 2 (degree 4): 9  

With the nodes relabeled, we can now count the triangles:  

[Total number of triangles: 6]  
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 6>
