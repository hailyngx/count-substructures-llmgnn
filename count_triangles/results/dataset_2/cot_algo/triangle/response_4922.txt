Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph. Let's start by sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices by degree:
0 - 1
9 - 2
7 - 3
2 - 4
6 - 4
5 - 5
4 - 5
8 - 6
3 - 6
1 - 6

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

Triangles:
[16]

In the graph, there are 16 triangles as shown below:
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 4>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 3, 7>
<4, 3, 8>
<5, 6, 2>
<5, 6, 8>
<7, 3, 8>
