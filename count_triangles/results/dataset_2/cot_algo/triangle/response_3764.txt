Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 28) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 18) (27, 20) (10, 15) (17, 20) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 3) (23, 8) (23, 3) (23, 13) (23, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 25) (2, 4) (22, 26) (22, 11) (22, 21) (26, 22) (26, 5) (28, 15) (20, 27) (20, 17) (20, 18) (20, 9) (16, 12) (16, 18) (5, 26) (19, 6) (9, 23) (9, 20) (9, 21) (29, 6) (29, 14) (29, 11) (24, 0) (24, 7) (24, 21) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 19) (6, 29) (6, 1) (18, 15) (18, 27) (18, 20) (18, 16) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 14) (0, 15) (0, 24) (3, 8) (3, 23) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 24) (7, 3) (7, 13) (14, 8) (14, 29) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 25) (21, 27) (21, 22) (21, 9) (21, 24) (21, 25) (11, 22) (11, 29) (13, 23) (13, 7) (13, 14) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (25, 2) (25, 14) (25, 21) 

Response:
The graph has 30 nodes with 90 edges. Let's find the total number of triangles using Degree-Based Ordering.

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections:
   - Node 16 has 1 connection.
   - Nodes 0, 5, 10, 17, 19, 26, 28 have 2 connections each.
   - Nodes 7, 11, 12, 13, 18, 20, 22, 24, 27, 29 have 3 connections each.
   - Nodes 1, 4, 6, 14, 25 have 4 connections each.
   - Nodes 2, 3, 9, 15 have 5 connections each.
   - Nodes 8, 21 have 6 connections each.

2. Relabel the nodes according to their degree from least to most connections:
   - Node 16 → Node 0 (1 connection)
   - Nodes 0, 5, 10, 17, 19, 26, 28 → Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (2 connections each)
   - Nodes 7, 11, 12, 13, 18, 20, 22, 24, 27, 29 → Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 (3 connections each)
   - Nodes 1, 4, 6, 14, 25 → Nodes 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 (4 connections each)
   - Nodes 2, 3, 9, 15 → Nodes 23, 24, 25, 26 (5 connections each)
   - Nodes 8, 21 → Nodes 27, 28 (6 connections each)

3. Count the triangles:
   - Triangle <0, 15, 18>
   - Triangle <0, 15, 24>
   - Triangle <1, 2, 3>
   - Triangle <1, 2, 4>
   - Triangle <1, 3, 4>
   - Triangle <1, 6, 29>
   - Triangle <1, 14, 25>
   - Triangle <2, 3, 4>
   - Triangle <2, 6, 1>
   - Triangle <2, 25, 14>
   - Triangle <3, 4, 7>
   - Triangle <3, 7, 13>
   - Triangle <3, 8, 23>
   - Triangle <4, 2, 1>
   - Triangle <4, 3, 7>
   - Triangle <4, 14, 25>
   - Triangle <5, 26, 22>
   - Triangle <6, 1, 29>
   - Triangle <6, 19, 29>
   - Triangle <8, 12, 16>
   - Triangle <8, 12, 14>
   - Triangle <8, 12, 16>
   - Triangle <8, 14, 13>
   - Triangle <9, 20, 18>
   - Triangle <9, 13, 7>
   - Triangle <9, 21, 24>
   - Triangle <11, 22, 29>
   - Triangle <13, 7, 14>
   - Triangle <14, 25, 21>
   - Triangle <15, 18, 27>
   - Triangle <18, 15, 27>
   - Triangle <18, 20, 27>
   - Triangle <18, 20, 9>
   - Triangle <20, 27, 18>
