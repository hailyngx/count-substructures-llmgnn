Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 11) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph:

Vertices in order of their connections:
0: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
10: 2 connections
12: 2 connections
13: 2 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 5 connections
5: 5 connections
11: 5 connections
14: 5 connections

Triangles found by checking shared connections:
[56]  (total number of triangles)

Unique triangles:
