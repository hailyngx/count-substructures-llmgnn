Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 12) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 14) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 10) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 11) (13, 10) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees (from least to most) is: 8, 13, 11, 9, 4, 7, 0, 10, 14, 1, 12, 3, 5, 2, 6.

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

For each edge, we will check if the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. If so, we will look for shared connections to form triangles. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are: 
<5, 6, 12>
<0, 2, 11>
<0, 3, 14>
<0, 7, 14>
<2, 6, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
