Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (6, 7) (6, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 2) 

Response:
The vertices with their number of connections are as follows:
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 6 connections
- Vertex 3: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 5 connections
- Vertex 8: 6 connections
- Vertex 9: 4 connections
- Vertex 10: 4 connections
- Vertex 11: 4 connections
- Vertex 12: 5 connections
- Vertex 13: 4 connections
- Vertex 14: 4 connections

By sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we get the following order:
1 -> 3 -> 6 -> 2 -> 13 -> 4 -> 5 -> 9 -> 10 -> 11 -> 14 -> 7 -> 12 -> 0 -> 8

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

1. For edge (1, 3):
   - Vertex 1 (degree 2) is lower labeled, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections between 1 and 3: None

2. For edge (1, 2):
   - Vertex 1 (degree 2) is lower labeled, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections between 1 and 2: None

3. For edge (3, 13):
   - Vertex 3 (degree 3) is lower labeled, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections between 3 and 13: None

4. For edge (3, 8):
   - Vertex 3 (degree 3) is lower labeled, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections between 3 and 8: 13

5. For edge (8, 13):
   - Vertex 8 (degree 6) is not lower labeled, we skip.

6. For edge (8, 9):
   - Vertex 8 (degree 6) is not lower labeled, we skip.

7. For edge (8, 5):
   - Vertex 8 (degree 6) is not lower labeled, we skip.

8. For edge (8, 10):
   - Vertex 8 (degree 6) is not lower labeled, we skip.

9. For edge (8, 11):
   - Vertex 8 (degree 6) is not lower labeled, we skip.

10. For edge (13, 8):
    - Vertex 13 (degree 4) is lower labeled, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between 13 and 8: None

11. For edge (13, 5):
    - Vertex 13 (degree 4) is lower labeled, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between 13 and 5: None

12. For edge (13, 14):
    - Vertex 13 (degree 4) is lower labeled, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between 13 and 14: None
