Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 12) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 3) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 11) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 12) 

Response:
The nodes from 0 to 14 with their corresponding degrees are:
Node 0: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 6
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 2
Node 9: degree 5
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 5
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 2
Node 14: degree 4

Sorting the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order gives us:
Node 8, Node 13, Node 2, Node 7, Node 10, Node 4, Node 6, Node 14, Node 12, Node 0, Node 1, Node 5, Node 9, Node 3, Node 11

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Node 8 (degree 2) is connected to Node 10 (degree 3), forming a triangle with Node 0.
2. Node 13 (degree 2) is connected to Node 0 (degree 5), forming a triangle with Node 3.
3. Node 2 (degree 3) is connected to Node 5 (degree 5), forming a triangle with Node 12.
4. Node 7 (degree 3) is connected to Node 9 (degree 5), forming a triangle with Node 4.
5. Node 10 (degree 3) is connected to Node 0 (degree 5), forming a triangle with Node 3.
6. Node 4 (degree 4) is connected to Node 0 (degree 5), forming a triangle with Node 1.
7. Node 6 (degree 4) is connected to Node 1 (degree 5), forming a triangle with Node 11.
8. Node 14 (degree 4) is connected to Node 5 (degree 5), forming a triangle with Node 12.
9. Node 12 (degree 4) is connected to Node 2 (degree 3), forming a triangle with Node 11.
10. Node 0 (degree 5) and Node 1 (degree 5) cannot form a triangle due to the way the vertices are processed.
11. Node 5 (degree 5) and Node 12 (degree 4) cannot form a triangle due to the way the vertices are processed.
12. Node 9 (degree 5) and Node 4 (degree 4) cannot form a triangle due to the way the vertices are processed.
13. Node 3 (degree 6) is connected to Node 0 (degree 5), forming a triangle with Node 13.
14. Node 11 (degree 5) is connected to Node 1 (degree 5), forming a triangle with Node 6.
