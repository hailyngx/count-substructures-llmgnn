Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 10) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 8), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 1), (6, 14), (6, 2), (6, 11), (6, 4), (1, 3), (1, 10), (3, 13), (11, 7), (0, 12), (7, 2), (12, 10)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes by degree: 5, 8, 13, 7, 0, 10, 12, 6, 1, 3, 14, 4, 11, 9, 2

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through the edges considering the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections:

Triangles found:  
<1, 3, 13>  
<1, 3, 11>  
<1, 10, 13>  
<0, 4, 12>  
<2, 6, 14>  

[Total number of triangles: 5]
