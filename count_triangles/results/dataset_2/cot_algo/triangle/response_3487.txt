Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 12) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 10) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 2) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 0) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: [(4, 7), (4, 13), (4, 11), (4, 3), (7, 4), (7, 10), (7, 8), (7, 5), (1, 3), (1, 14), (3, 4), (3, 1), (3, 9), (3, 12), (8, 7), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 0), (8, 12), (13, 4), (13, 2), (13, 10), (6, 9), (6, 11), (6, 12), (9, 3), (9, 8), (9, 6), (9, 11), (9, 14), (12, 3), (12, 8), (12, 6), (12, 11), (0, 8), (0, 14), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 5), (0, 2), (14, 1), (14, 9), (14, 0), (14, 2), (5, 7), (5, 0), (5, 10), (10, 7), (10, 8), (10, 13), (10, 0), (10, 5), (11, 4), (11, 6), (11, 9), (11, 12), (11, 0), (2, 13), (2, 0), (2, 14)]

Next, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The sorted vertices by their degree are as follows:
Vertices by degree: {1: [2, 5], 2: [1, 13, 14], 3: [4, 9, 12], 4: [3, 7, 11, 13], 5: [0, 7, 10], 6: [9, 11, 12], 7: [4, 5, 8, 10], 8: [0, 7, 9, 10, 12], 9: [3, 6, 8, 11, 14], 10: [0, 7, 8, 10, 13], 11: [0, 4, 6, 9, 12], 12: [3, 6, 8, 11], 13: [2, 4, 10], 14: [1, 9, 0, 2]}

Now, let's count the number of triangles and list them:
Triangles: [25]

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is 25. The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 8, 12>, <0, 8, 10>, <0, 8, 14>, <0, 10, 13>, <0, 11, 12>, <0, 14, 2>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 14>, <3, 9, 14>, <4, 7, 10>, <4, 7, 13>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 11, 6>, <5, 7, 10>, <6, 9, 11>, <6, 9, 12>, <8, 9, 10>, <8, 9, 11>, <8, 9, 14>, <10, 7, 8>, <10, 7, 13>, <10, 0, 5>, <11, 6, 12>, <11, 0, 4>, <14, 0, 2>
