Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 13) (12, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 4) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 14) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) 
(3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 
(10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 9) 
(11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) 
(8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) 
(13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) 
(5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 7) (5, 14) 
(6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) 
(7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) 
(12, 13) (12, 5) 
(0, 6) (0, 9) 
(14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 4) 
(9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) 
(4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 14) 
(2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) 

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Node 12 has degree 2
Node 0 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 4
Node 11 has degree 3
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 5
Node 4 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 4
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 14 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 13 has degree 5
Node 10 has degree 5
Node 3 has degree 6
Node 1 has degree 4

Next, we find the triangles and count them:
Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles:
<1, 3, 14>
<1, 3, 10>
<1, 4, 13>
<1, 10, 3>
<1, 10, 11>
<1, 4, 13>
<3, 11, 14>
<3, 10, 11>
<3, 6, 5>
<3, 8, 13>
<10, 11, 14>
<8, 13, 1>
