Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are as follows: 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

By sorting the nodes based on their degree in ascending order, we get the following order: 
9, 0, 7, 6, 5, 3, 4, 8, 1, 2.

Based on the given edges and the degree-based ordering, we proceed to find the triangles:

1. Triangle <2, 0, 1> 
2. Triangle <6, 7, 5> 
3. Triangle <6, 7, 0> 
4. Triangle <6, 7, 1> 
5. Triangle <9, 8, 1> 
6. Triangle <9, 8, 3> 
7. Triangle <8, 1, 0> 
8. Triangle <8, 1, 7> 
9. Triangle <8, 1, 3> 
10. Triangle <5, 7, 0> 
11. Triangle <5, 7, 1> 
12. Triangle <5, 7, 2> 
13. Triangle <3, 0, 1> 
14. Triangle <4, 2, 6> 
15. Triangle <4, 2, 5> 
16. Triangle <4, 2, 0> 
17. Triangle <4, 2, 1> 
18. Triangle <4, 9, 5> 
19. Triangle <4, 9, 6> 
20. Triangle <4, 9, 8> 
21. Triangle <4, 9, 3> 
22. Triangle <4, 5, 8> 
23. Triangle <4, 5, 3> 
24. Triangle <4, 5, 1> 
25. Triangle <4, 6, 7> 
26. Triangle <4, 6, 2> 

Total number of triangles: [26]
