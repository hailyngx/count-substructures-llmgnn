Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be used to count the triangles in the given graph. 

First, we count the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 6
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 3

Now, we relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 0 (degree 6) becomes A
- Node 1 (degree 5) becomes B
- Node 2 (degree 5) becomes C
- Node 3 (degree 4) becomes D
- Node 4 (degree 4) becomes E
- Node 5 (degree 4) becomes F
- Node 6 (degree 3) becomes G
- Node 7 (degree 3) becomes H
- Node 8 (degree 2) becomes I
- Node 9 (degree 5) becomes J
- Node 10 (degree 4) becomes K
- Node 11 (degree 5) becomes L
- Node 12 (degree 3) becomes M
- Node 13 (degree 4) becomes N
- Node 14 (degree 3) becomes O

Now, we go through the edges, considering only those where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:
- A-B-D forms the triangle <A, B, D>
- A-B-E forms the triangle <A, B, E>
- A-F-E forms the triangle <A, F, E>
- B-L-D forms the triangle <B, L, D>
- B-D-C forms the triangle <B, D, C>
- B-D-N forms the triangle <B, D, N>
- D-N-C forms the triangle <D, N, C>
- E-N-C forms the triangle <E, N, C>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8] and the unique triangles found are <A, B, D>, <A, B, E>, <A, F, E>, <B, L, D>, <B, D, C>, <B, D, N>, <D, N, C>, <E, N, C>.
