Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (19, 12) (19, 9) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 2) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 12) (12, 19) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 1) (18, 10) (0, 10) (0, 9) (0, 6) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 14) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 9) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 9) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 11) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 14) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 6), 
(1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 14), 
(2, 13), (2, 10), (2, 17), (2, 14), 
(3, 15), (3, 13), 
(4, 12), 
(5, 8), (5, 11), 
(6, 15), (6, 12), (6, 0), 
(7, 17), (7, 16), (7, 14), 
(8, 13), (8, 5), (8, 16), (8, 11), 
(9, 19), (9, 0), (9, 16), (9, 11), 
(10, 15), (10, 0), (10, 18), (10, 2), 
(11, 8), (11, 5), (11, 1), (11, 9), 
(12, 19), (12, 4), (12, 6), (12, 1), 
(13, 3), (13, 8), (13, 17), (13, 2), 
(14, 7), (14, 1), (14, 2), 
(15, 3), (15, 10), (15, 6), 
(16, 8), (16, 7), (16, 9), 
(17, 13), (17, 2), (17, 7), 
(18, 10), 
(19, 12), (19, 9)

Now, we will calculate the number of triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method.

Sorted nodes by their degrees:
Nodes ordered by degree (ascending): 4, 18
Nodes ordered by degree (descending): 0, 1, 3, 7, 5, 6, 9, 11, 17, 19, 2, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 15

Count of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 6, 15>
<1, 11, 14>
<2, 10, 13>
<2, 10, 17>
<2, 13, 17>
<6, 12, 15>
<7, 14, 17>
<0, 9, 16>
<1, 11, 9>
<2, 13, 14>
<2, 13, 17>
<8, 11, 13>
