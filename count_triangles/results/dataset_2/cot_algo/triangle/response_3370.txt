Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 7)
(9, 5), (9, 3), (9, 7)
(6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 0)
(4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 2)
(7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 6), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 1)
(1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 2)
(3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 2)
(8, 4), (8, 2)
(2, 6), (2, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 8)
(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 3)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes: 
1 (degree 3), 8 (degree 2), 0 (degree 3), 9 (degree 3), 2 (degree 5), 8 (degree 2), 6 (degree 4), 4 (degree 5), 3 (degree 5), 7 (degree 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

Triangles: [7]

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <0, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 7>
