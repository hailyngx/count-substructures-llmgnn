Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (14, 4) (14, 1) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their degrees are as follows:
Node 0: 4
Node 1: 4
Node 2: 4
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 5
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 5
Node 7: 3
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 4
Node 10: 4
Node 11: 3
Node 12: 5
Node 13: 4
Node 14: 2

Sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order:
Nodes [14, 7, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 10, 8, 9, 5, 13, 6, 4, 12]

Calculating the triangles:
- For edge (6, 9): Node 6 is connected to 5, 2, 4, 13 / Node 9 is connected to 8, 4, 3
  The shared connections are 4. Therefore, triangle <4, 6, 9> exists.
- For edge (6, 5): Node 6 is connected to 9, 2, 4, 13 / Node 5 is connected to 8, 12, 1
  The shared connections are none.
- For edge (6, 2): Node 6 is connected to 9, 5, 4, 13 / Node 2 is connected to 7, 13, 3
  The shared connections are 13. Therefore, triangle <6, 2, 13> exists.
- For edge (6, 4): Node 6 is connected to 9, 5, 2, 13 / Node 4 is connected to 9, 12, 14, 1
  The shared connections are 9. Therefore, triangle <6, 4, 9> exists.
  
Total number of triangles: [2]
