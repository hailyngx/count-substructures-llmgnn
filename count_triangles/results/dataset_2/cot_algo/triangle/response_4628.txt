Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 9) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 3) (14, 6) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 9) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- Node 0: (4, 0), (3, 0), (6, 0), (12, 0)
- Node 1: (3, 1), (5, 1), (10, 1), (13, 1)
- Node 2: (7, 2), (1, 2), (3, 2), (11, 2), (8, 2), (6, 2)
- Node 3: (1, 3), (14, 3), (0, 3), (2, 3), (12, 3), (11, 3)
- Node 4: (7, 4), (13, 4), (0, 4), (11, 4), (2, 4)
- Node 5: (1, 5), (10, 5), (6, 5)
- Node 6: (5, 6), (2, 6), (12, 6), (0, 6), (14, 6)
- Node 7: (4, 7), (2, 7)
- Node 8: (13, 8), (2, 8)
- Node 9: (13, 9), (10, 9), (12, 9)
- Node 10: (1, 10), (12, 10), (13, 10), (5, 10), (9, 10)
- Node 11: (4, 11), (3, 11), (2, 11)
- Node 12: (3, 12), (10, 12), (6, 12), (0, 12), (12, 12)
- Node 13: (8, 13), (4, 13), (1, 13), (10, 13), (9, 13)
- Node 14: (3, 14), (6, 14)

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Vertices sorted by degree: (7, 8, 14), (5, 6, 11), (0, 1, 9, 12), (13, 3), (2, 4, 10)

Triangles found: [<2, 8, 13>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
