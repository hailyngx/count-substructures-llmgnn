Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 15) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (4, 8) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (5, 15) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 10) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 9) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 10) (15, 17) (7, 16) (7, 5) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 17) (18, 14) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 9) (17, 15) (17, 7) (17, 2) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 9) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 0) (12, 13) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 9) (9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 13) 

Response:
The degree of each node in the graph is as follows:
Node 0: 2
Node 1: 3
Node 2: 3
Node 3: 3
Node 4: 3
Node 5: 3
Node 6: 3
Node 7: 5
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 5
Node 10: 5
Node 11: 2
Node 12: 4
Node 13: 4
Node 14: 5
Node 15: 5
Node 16: 5
Node 17: 3
Node 18: 1
Node 19: 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will reorder the nodes as follows:
Node 18 (degree 1)
Node 0 (degree 2)
Node 11 (degree 2)
Node 1 (degree 3)
Node 2 (degree 3)
Node 3 (degree 3)
Node 4 (degree 3)
Node 5 (degree 3)
Node 6 (degree 3)
Node 17 (degree 3)
Node 12 (degree 4)
Node 13 (degree 4)
Node 8 (degree 4)
Node 19 (degree 4)
Node 7 (degree 5)
Node 14 (degree 5)
Node 15 (degree 5)
Node 16 (degree 5)
Node 9 (degree 5)
Node 10 (degree 5)

Now, based on the given edges and the node ordering, we will count the number of triangles:

Triangles: [27]
Unique Triangles: <1, 3, 14>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 4, 14>, <1, 14, 18>, <3, 12, 19>, <3, 14, 4>, <3, 14, 18>, <4, 8, 6>, <4, 8, 14>, <4, 14, 18>, <8, 10, 6>, <8, 10, 9>, <9, 10, 19>, <9, 13, 14>, <9, 13, 19>, <10, 15, 16>, <10, 15, 17>, <10, 15, 5>, <10, 15, 7>, <10, 16, 15>, <12, 13, 9>, <12, 13, 19>, <14, 2, 13>, <14, 4, 18>, <15, 7, 5>, <15, 7, 17>, <15, 7, 19>
