Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (16, 7) (16, 22) (16, 25) (16, 4) (3, 10) (3, 27) (3, 19) (25, 16) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 2) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 29) (13, 20) (15, 20) (15, 22) (15, 17) (15, 2) (20, 13) (20, 15) (20, 6) (4, 16) (4, 18) (4, 28) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 5) (28, 4) (28, 22) (28, 12) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 0) (6, 20) (6, 21) (6, 17) (21, 13) (21, 6) (21, 26) (21, 14) (9, 8) (9, 22) (9, 29) (22, 16) (22, 15) (22, 28) (22, 9) (22, 24) (17, 15) (17, 5) (17, 6) (29, 13) (29, 9) (29, 1) (29, 27) (26, 18) (26, 21) (26, 23) (7, 16) (7, 23) (7, 14) (7, 27) (24, 22) (23, 26) (23, 7) (23, 12) (2, 25) (2, 15) (12, 28) (12, 23) (10, 3) (1, 25) (1, 29) (27, 3) (27, 29) (27, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 19) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 0) (14, 21) (14, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's first sort the vertices by their degree:

Vertices along with their degree:
0: 3
1: 2
2: 2
3: 4
4: 4
5: 4
6: 3
7: 4
8: 3
9: 4
10: 1
12: 3
13: 5
14: 2
15: 4
16: 4
17: 3
18: 3
19: 3
20: 3
21: 4
22: 5
23: 3
24: 1
25: 4
26: 3
27: 3
28: 3
29: 4

Based on the degree-based ordering, let's relabel the vertices as follows:
0 -> 0 , 1 -> 5 , 2 -> 5 , 3 -> 4 , 4 -> 4 , 5 -> 4 , 6 -> 3 , 7 -> 6 , 8 -> 3 , 9 -> 6 , 10 -> 1 , 12 -> 3 , 13 -> 7 , 14 -> 2 , 15 -> 6 , 16 -> 6 , 17 -> 3 , 18 -> 3 , 19 -> 3 , 20 -> 3 , 21 -> 6 , 22 -> 7 , 23 -> 3 , 24 -> 1 , 25 -> 6 , 26 -> 3 , 27 -> 3 , 28 -> 3 , 29 -> 6

Now, let's check the shared connections between the vertices to count the triangles:

Triangles:
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 21, 29>
<3, 4, 13>
<3, 5, 17>
<3, 6, 20>
<3, 18, 26>
<10, 3, 27>
<12, 23, 28>

Total number of triangles: [8]
