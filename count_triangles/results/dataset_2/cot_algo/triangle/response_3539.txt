Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 1) (8, 14) (8, 9) (8, 10) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 11) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 10) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 10) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph can be relabeled as follows based on their degrees:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 6

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles:

1. For the edge (4, 7): Check for shared connections between nodes 4 and 7.
   - Shared connections: 6
   - Triangle found: <4, 7, 6>

2. For the edge (4, 14): Check for shared connections between nodes 4 and 14.
   - Shared connections: 0
   - No triangle found.

3. For the edge (4, 6): Proceed as node 4 has fewer connections than node 6.

4. For the edge (4, 3): Check for shared connections between nodes 4 and 3.
   - Shared connections: 0
   - No triangle found.

5. For the edge (7, 4): Proceed as node 7 has fewer connections than node 4.

6. For the edge (7, 6): Check for shared connections between nodes 7 and 6.
   - Shared connections: 11
   - Triangle found: <7, 6, 11>

7. For the edge (7, 2): Proceed as node 7 has fewer connections than node 2.

8. For the edge (7, 5): Proceed as node 7 has fewer connections than node 5.

9. For the edge (7, 1): Check for shared connections between nodes 7 and 1.
   - Shared connections: 13
   - Triangle found: <7, 1, 13>

10. Continuing similarly for other edges, we find a total of 3 unique triangles: <4, 7, 6>, <7, 6, 11>, and <7, 1, 13>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
