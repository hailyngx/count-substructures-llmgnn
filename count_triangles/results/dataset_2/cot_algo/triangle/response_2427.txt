Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) 

Response:
The graph constructed with the provided information is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 8), (9, 2), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 2), (7, 1), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 0), (1, 8), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 2), (3, 8), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 6), (2, 9), (2, 7), (2, 3), (2, 0), (2, 6), (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 6), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 8)}

To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by the number of connections:
0 (Degree: 3)
9 (Degree: 3)
5 (Degree: 5)
3 (Degree: 4)
1 (Degree: 4)
8 (Degree: 4)
7 (Degree: 4)
2 (Degree: 5)
6 (Degree: 5)
4 (Degree: 5)

Triangles found: 
[6]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 7>.
