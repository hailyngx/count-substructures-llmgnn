Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 3) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 12) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
   Nodes: [7, 8, 11, 9, 4, 1, 5, 14, 2, 6, 0, 13, 12, 10, 3]

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]

3. Count the triangles by checking shared connections between vertices:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 5>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 3, 5>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 14, 1>
   - Triangle 4: <0, 11, 2>
   - Triangle 5: <1, 2, 12>
   - Triangle 6: <1, 2, 14>
   - Triangle 7: <1, 12, 5>
   - Triangle 8: <2, 11, 12>
   - Triangle 9: <2, 10, 12>
   - Triangle 10: <3, 0, 5>
   - Triangle 11: <3, 10, 6>
   - Triangle 12: <3, 13, 6>
   - Triangle 13: <4, 6, 10>
   - Triangle 14: <6, 13, 5>
   - Triangle 15: <10, 12, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
