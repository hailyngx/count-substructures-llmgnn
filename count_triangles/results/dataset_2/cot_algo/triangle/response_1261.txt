Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and the given 40 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (4, 9), (1, 4), (3, 4)
- 1: (0, 4), (3, 9), (5, 8), (0, 5), (6, 9)
- 2: (3, 4), (8, 9), (2, 3), (2, 8)
- 3: (1, 4), (1, 9), (2, 4), (0, 3), (2, 0)
- 4: (0, 9), (1, 3), (2, 3), (6, 7)
- 5: (1, 8), (8, 9), (1, 0)
- 6: (1, 9), (4, 7), (7, 8), (1, 0), (8, 1)
- 7: (4, 6), (6, 8), (8, 9)
- 8: (2, 9), (6, 7), (5, 1), (2, 1), (7, 6)
- 9: (4, 7), (5, 8), (8, 2), (8, 6), (5, 1)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree from least to most connected:
Nodes by degree: 0, 5, 2, 7, 3, 6, 1, 8, 4, 9

Next, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

After counting, we find that there are [8] triangles in the graph. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 4, 9>, <0, 1, 4>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 4>.
