Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 15) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 5) (10, 17) (10, 15) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 13) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (18, 15) (18, 12) (8, 7) (8, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (5, 7) (5, 17) (19, 6) (19, 3) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 16) (13, 11) (13, 2) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 1) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 18) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degrees is as follows:
Nodes: 8, 13, 18, 10, 5, 18, 16, 0, 1, 6, 9, 3, 15, 19, 14, 11, 2, 4, 17, 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

Number of triangles: [40]

Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 16>, <0, 4, 15>, <0, 4, 16>, <0, 16, 15>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 13, 3>, <4, 15, 16>, <4, 15, 18>, <5, 7, 17>, <6, 9, 12>, <6, 12, 18>, <7, 8, 9>, <10, 15, 17>, <11, 14, 16>, <11, 14, 17>, <11, 16, 15>, <13, 2, 11>, <13, 11, 3>
