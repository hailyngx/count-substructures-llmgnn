Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 5) (16, 12) (16, 6) (16, 9) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 2) (4, 13) (4, 2) (18, 10) (18, 13) (17, 9) (17, 19) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 2) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 15) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 14) (14, 19) (14, 6) (12, 16) (12, 15) (12, 9) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 15) (6, 16) (6, 14) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 8) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 18) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8)
(1, 0) (1, 13)
(2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10)
(3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11)
(4, 2) (4, 13)
(5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 15)
(6, 14) (6, 16)
(7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 19)
(8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 15)
(9, 12) (9, 16) (9, 17)
(10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 19)
(11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 10)
(12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 16)
(13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 18)
(14, 6) (14, 19)
(15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 12)
(16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 12)
(17, 9) (17, 19)
(18, 10) (18, 13)
(19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 17)

Now, let's identify the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes by degree (least to most):
1: 16, 4, 14, 8
2: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 12, 15, 17
3: 2, 11, 18, 5, 9, 10, 13, 19

Triangles found:
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 7, 10>
<5, 8, 15>
<9, 12, 16>
<9, 16, 17>
<10, 11, 3>
<10, 11, 5>
<10, 11, 7>
<10, 11, 19>
<10, 18, 13>
<11, 3, 7>
<13, 1, 4>
<14, 6, 16>
<14, 19, 17>

Total number of triangles: [16]
