Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 15) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 11) (9, 7) (9, 27) (9, 12) (26, 27) (18, 22) (18, 23) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 8) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 20) (15, 24) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 19) (0, 2) (0, 24) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 25) (6, 28) (6, 11) (6, 16) (28, 6) (21, 3) (3, 21) (3, 11) (11, 22) (11, 6) (11, 3) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 4) (1, 7) (17, 13) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 27) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 25) (25, 2) (25, 7) (25, 4) (25, 14) (25, 10) (8, 18) (19, 20) (19, 17) (14, 25) (29, 1) (29, 5) (29, 12) (16, 13) (16, 6) (16, 24) (24, 15) (24, 0) (24, 16) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 25) (4, 23) (4, 10) (23, 18) (23, 4) (23, 27) (12, 9) (12, 29) (12, 10) (10, 25) (10, 4) (10, 12) (5, 18) (5, 29) (27, 9) (27, 26) (27, 20) (27, 17) (27, 23) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with 30 nodes and 90 edges. 
Now, let's count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will sort the vertices according to their number of connections:

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 21: 2 connections
Vertex 28: 2 connections
Vertex 29: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 19: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 12: 3 connections
Vertex 14: 3 connections
Vertex 10: 3 connections
Vertex 26: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 16: 3 connections
Vertex 24: 3 connections
Vertex 20: 3 connections
Vertex 18: 5 connections
Vertex 15: 4 connections
Vertex 11: 4 connections
Vertex 25: 5 connections
Vertex 23: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 17: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 22: 4 connections
Vertex 13: 6 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph:
[63]

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 4, 25>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 2>
<6, 11, 3>
<7, 1, 4>
<7, 1, 25>
<9, 12, 29>
<9, 12, 10>
<9, 12, 29>
<13, 16, 6>
<13, 15, 18>
<13, 15, 20>
