Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (9), (3), (2), (7), (4)
- 1: (5), (4), (8)
- 2: (9), (6), (8), (0), (4)
- 3: (5), (0), (6), (8)
- 4: (9), (1), (2), (0)
- 5: (6), (1), (3)
- 6: (5), (3), (7), (2)
- 7: (6), (8), (0)
- 8: (9), (1), (3), (2), (7)
- 9: (8), (4), (2), (0)

Sorting nodes based on their degrees:
Node degrees: [5, 3, 5, 4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 5, 4]
Sorted nodes: [7, 5, 6, 3, 4, 9, 2, 8, 1, 0]

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we look at the edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:
- Checking edge (5, 6): Both nodes 5 and 6 have 3 connections
- Checking edge (5, 1): Node 5 has 3 connections, and node 1 has 3 connections
- Checking edge (5, 3): Node 5 has 3 connections, and node 3 has 4 connections
- Checking edge (9, 8): Node 8 has 5 connections, but node 9 has 4 connections
- Checking edge (1, 4): Node 4 has 4 connections, but node 1 has 3 connections
- Checking edge (3, 6): Node 6 has 4 connections, but node 3 has 4 connections
- Checking edge (6, 7): Node 7 has 3 connections, and node 6 has 4 connections
- Checking edge (2, 9): Node 9 has 4 connections, but node 2 has 5 connections
- Checking edge (8, 7): Node 7 has 3 connections, and node 8 has 5 connections

There are no triangles found using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [0].
