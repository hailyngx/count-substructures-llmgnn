Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 15) (5, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 18) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (14, 12) (14, 16) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 17) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 18) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 6) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 6) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 16) (15, 13) (3, 5) (3, 7) (1, 10) (1, 11) (4, 0) (4, 17) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 16) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 15) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 8) (17, 4) (18, 11) (18, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first construct the degree-based ordering as follows:

Nodes sorted by their degree (least to most connections):
Node 5 (degree 4)
Node 4 (degree 2)
Node 8 (degree 3)
Node 18 (degree 2)
Node 0 (degree 2)
Node 16 (degree 3)
Node 19 (degree 3)
Node 9 (degree 0)
Node 10 (degree 4)
Node 1 (degree 2)
Node 14 (degree 2)
Node 6 (degree 4)
Node 17 (degree 4)
Node 11 (degree 3)
Node 2 (degree 3)
Node 7 (degree 4)
Node 12 (degree 5)
Node 3 (degree 2)
Node 13 (degree 4)

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph and count the number of triangles. Since the vertices are sorted by degree, we only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
