Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 19) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 13) (1, 27) (3, 10) (3, 12) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 14) (22, 25) (23, 15) (23, 21) (23, 10) (12, 3) (12, 27) (12, 18) (27, 1) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 26) (4, 22) (4, 14) (4, 26) (8, 16) (8, 25) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 13) (28, 2) (29, 28) (29, 17) (29, 20) (29, 11) (6, 5) (6, 0) (17, 29) (17, 20) (17, 21) (26, 22) (26, 27) (26, 4) (11, 28) (11, 29) (11, 25) (11, 2) (24, 1) (24, 20) (20, 29) (20, 17) (20, 24) (15, 1) (15, 23) (21, 23) (21, 17) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 19) (7, 18) (14, 22) (14, 4) (2, 28) (2, 11) (2, 0) (13, 1) (13, 28) (13, 25) (13, 19) (25, 22) (25, 8) (25, 11) (25, 13) (10, 3) (10, 23) (18, 12) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 16) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 13) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 18) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the nodes based on their degrees. Here is the list of nodes sorted by their degrees in ascending order:

Nodes:
1: 2 connections
2: 3 connections
3: 3 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 3 connections
9: 4 connections
10: 2 connections
11: 4 connections
12: 3 connections
13: 4 connections
14: 2 connections
15: 2 connections
16: 3 connections
17: 3 connections
18: 3 connections
19: 3 connections
20: 3 connections
21: 2 connections
22: 4 connections
23: 3 connections
24: 2 connections
25: 4 connections
26: 4 connections
27: 4 connections
28: 4 connections
29: 4 connections

Using the degree-based ordering method with the given edges, we count the total number of triangles inside brackets []:
[15]

And the list of unique triangles found inside <> each only once:
<19, 13, 28>
<11, 2, 29>
<4, 22, 26>
<13, 1, 28>
<22, 26, 27>
<27, 12, 18>
<11, 28, 29>
<9, 0, 5>
<11, 25, 29>
<11, 28, 13>
<23, 15, 21>
<10, 3, 12>
<25, 11, 13>
<18, 12, 27>
<17, 20, 29>
<21, 17, 23>
