Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 13) (16, 8) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 16) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (18, 7) (18, 17) (18, 13) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 18) (7, 14) (7, 2) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 14) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (6, 8) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 18) (17, 6) (17, 12) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 14) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 12) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 12) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 9) (12, 5) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 19) (13, 16) (13, 18) (13, 10) (19, 14) 

Response:
The graph given can be represented as:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: 11, 9, 17, 5, 2
- 1: 15, 2, 14
- 2: 1, 4, 0, 7, 14
- 3: 5
- 4: 8, 2
- 5: 3, 0, 12
- 6: 8, 17
- 7: 18, 14, 2
- 8: 16, 4, 10, 6
- 9: 11, 15, 12
- 10: 8, 12, 13
- 11: 0, 9, 17
- 12: 10, 17, 9, 5
- 13: 16, 18, 10
- 14: 1, 7, 15, 2, 19
- 15: 1, 9, 14
- 16: 13, 8
- 17: 11, 18, 6, 12
- 18: 7, 17, 13
- 19: 14

Using degree-based ordering method, we label the nodes from least connected to most connected:
Nodes by degree: 3, 16, 19, 13, 6, 5, 7, 4, 15, 1, 10, 9, 0, 12, 14, 8, 2, 18, 11, 17

Calculating the number of triangles:
- <0, 2, 14>
- <0, 5, 12>
- <0, 11, 17>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <1, 2, 14>
- <1, 9, 15>
- <2, 7, 14>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <4, 8, 10>
- <8, 10, 12>
- <10, 12, 17>
- <12, 14, 15>

Total number of triangles: [12]
