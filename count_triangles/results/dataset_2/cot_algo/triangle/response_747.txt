Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 11) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 14) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 6) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0 -> [1, 2, 11, 13, 14]
- 1 -> [0, 4, 7]
- 2 -> [0, 4, 6, 8, 13, 14]
- 3 -> [8, 9, 10]
- 4 -> [1, 2, 7, 8, 9]
- 5 -> [9, 11, 12, 13]
- 6 -> [2, 8, 12, 14]
- 7 -> [1, 4, 12, 13]
- 8 -> [2, 3, 4, 6, 14]
- 9 -> [3, 4, 5, 10, 11]
- 10 -> [3, 9, 11]
- 11 -> [0, 5, 9, 10]
- 12 -> [5, 6, 7]
- 13 -> [0, 2, 5, 7, 13]
- 14 -> [0, 2, 6, 8]

Now, let's count the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering:

Triangles: [<0, 2, 13>, <0, 2, 14>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 13, 2>, <0, 13, 7>, <0, 13, 5>, <0, 14, 2>, <0, 14, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 13, 5>, <2, 13, 7>, <2, 14, 6>, <2, 14, 8>, <3, 8, 4>, <3, 8, 6>, <3, 9, 10>, <4, 7, 12>, <4, 7, 13>, <4, 8, 2>, <5, 9, 11>, <5, 12, 6>, <5, 13, 7>, <6, 12, 7>, <6, 14, 8>]

Total number of triangles: [24]
