Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 14) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 0) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 9) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (11, 6, 12, 1)
- 1: (10, 11, 6, 12, 9, 0)
- 2: (4, 7, 8, 14)
- 3: (7, 13, 10, 5, 9)
- 4: (7, 12, 14, 2)
- 5: (6, 3)
- 6: (7, 8, 5, 1, 0)
- 7: (4, 3, 6, 2)
- 8: (2, 6)
- 9: (11, 12, 1, 3)
- 10: (11, 3, 12, 1, 14)
- 11: (10, 1, 0, 9)
- 12: (13, 10, 4, 0, 1, 9)
- 13: (12, 3)
- 14: (10, 2, 4)

Next, let's sort the nodes by their degrees in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:

Nodes by degree: 5, 8, 13, 0, 14, 9, 3, 1, 11, 6, 12, 7, 4, 10, 2

New labels:  
0 -> 0  
1 -> 1  
2 -> 2  
3 -> 3  
4 -> 4  
5 -> 5  
6 -> 6  
7 -> 7  
8 -> 8  
9 -> 9  
10 -> 10  
11 -> 11  
12 -> 12  
13 -> 13  
14 -> 14  

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [78]

Unique triangles:  
<0, 1, 11>  
<0, 1, 9>  
<0, 3, 9>  
<2, 4, 14>  
<2, 6, 7>  
<4, 7, 12>  
<4, 10, 12>  
<5, 6, 7>  
<6, 7, 12>  
<1, 10, 12>
