Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 11) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 10) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized with the following edges:

- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
- Edges: (5, 12), (5, 1), (5, 11), (9, 6), (9, 11), (9, 10), (9, 13), (9, 0), (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 4), (1, 5), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 0), (1, 7), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 10), (3, 4), (8, 13), (8, 4), (8, 7), (13, 9), (13, 8), (13, 11), (13, 14), (4, 6), (4, 3), (4, 8), (4, 11), (4, 2), (7, 6), (7, 1), (7, 8), (7, 11), (12, 5), (12, 2), (12, 10), (12, 14), (0, 9), (0, 1), (0, 14), (14, 13), (14, 12), (14, 0), (14, 10), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 12), (11, 5), (11, 9), (11, 13), (11, 4), (11, 7), (10, 9), (10, 3), (10, 12), (10, 14)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 6
- Node 11: degree 6

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles and list them:

Total number of triangles: [14]

Unique triangles:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 9, 13>
- <0, 9, 6>
- <0, 13, 14>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 7, 8>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <3, 6, 4>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <4, 8, 7>
- <9, 6, 3>
- <12, 10, 14>
