Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 8) (15, 10) (15, 16) (10, 15) (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (2, 9) (2, 14) (18, 9) (18, 12) (0, 17) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 7) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 19) (1, 4) (1, 9) (13, 9) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 5) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 16) (6, 4) (6, 19) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 19) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. 
Let's first sort the vertices by their degree:  

- Vertex 18 has 2 connections.  
- Vertices 13, 2, 1, 6, 13, and 10 have 2 connections each.  
- Vertices 3, 15, and 0 have 3 connections each.  
- Vertices 5 and 9 have 4 connections each.  
- Vertex 8 has 5 connections.  
- Vertices 16, 4, and 17 have 6 connections each.  
- Vertices 19, 12, 14, and 7 have 7 connections each.  
- Vertex 11 has 8 connections.  

Now, we will relabel the vertices from 0 to 19 based on their degrees accordingly.  

Let's count the triangles based on the relabeled vertices:

[Total number of triangles: 48]
