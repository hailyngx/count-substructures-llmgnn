Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 10) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 2) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 0)
