Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (4, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 2) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 13) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 6) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges can be illustrated as follows:
```
0: [1, 3, 10, 11, 14]
1: [0, 3, 6, 11, 13]
2: [6, 7, 8, 14]
3: [0, 1, 6, 12]
4: [5]
5: [4, 7, 8, 11]
6: [1, 2, 3, 13]
7: [2, 5, 8, 9, 11]
8: [2, 5, 6, 7, 9]
9: [7, 8, 10, 11]
10: [0, 9, 14]
11: [0, 1, 5, 7, 9]
12: [3, 13, 14]
13: [1, 6, 12]
14: [0, 2, 10, 12]
```

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Sort the vertices by their degrees in ascending order:
```
4 < 2 < 13 < 10 < 12 < 0 < 9 < 14 < 3 < 1 < 6 < 5 < 7 < 8 < 11
```
2. Calculate the number of triangles:
- Looking at the edges, since the vertices are sorted by degree, we only consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

Triangles: 
<3, 0, 1> <3, 0, 6> <3, 1, 6> <0, 1, 6> <2, 6, 13> <7, 2, 6> <7, 2, 8> <2, 8, 6> <7, 8, 6> <5, 7, 8> <5, 7, 11> <5, 8, 11> <4, 5, 8> <9, 7, 8> <9, 7, 11> <9, 8, 11> <10, 9, 11> <10, 9, 14> <10, 11, 14> <0, 10, 14> <13, 1, 6> <12, 13, 6> <12, 13, 14> 

Total number of triangles: [21]
