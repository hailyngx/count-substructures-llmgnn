Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their respective degrees:

0: 2  
1: 3  
3: 4  
8: 4  
10: 4  
13: 2  
15: 2  
16: 2  
20: 4  
23: 2  
24: 2  
25: 2  
2: 4  
5: 4  
6: 4  
7: 4  
9: 4  
4: 3  
11: 3  
14: 4  
17: 2  
18: 5  
19: 4  
21: 4  
26: 4  
27: 4  
12: 3  
22: 4  
28: 3  
29: 2
