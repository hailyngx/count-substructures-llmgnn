Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 12) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 12) (0, 10) (0, 9) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 12) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 9) (12, 14) (1, 4) (1, 10) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently in the given graph. Let's start by relabeling the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order.

The degree of each node is as follows:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 5
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 5
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 12: degree 6
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 4

Now, we will identify the triangles formed by checking shared connections between vertices and count them as follows:

[Total number of triangles: 13]
<0, 9, 10>
<0, 10, 1>
<0, 10, 2>
<0, 10, 6>
<1, 4, 10>
<2, 3, 10>
<2, 9, 10>
<3, 7, 4>
<3, 8, 11>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 8, 12>
<5, 11, 12>
<6, 10, 12>
