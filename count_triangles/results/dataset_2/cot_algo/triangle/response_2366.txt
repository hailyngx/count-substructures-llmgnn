Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 18) (17, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 12) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 14) (18, 17) (18, 0) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (0, 18) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 12) (16, 13) (16, 19) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 14) (5, 2) (5, 12) (1, 7) (1, 19) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 15) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 19) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (15, 2) (15, 9) (15, 11) (15, 13) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 5) (13, 9) (13, 16) (13, 15) (19, 16) (19, 1) (19, 3) 

Response:
To start, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: 
(10, 17), (10, 3), (10, 8), (10, 14), (17, 10), (17, 18), (17, 7), (4, 14), (4, 6), 
(8, 10), (8, 12), (2, 5), (2, 15), (2, 14), (18, 17), (18, 0), (9, 15), (9, 11), 
(9, 13), (9, 0), (0, 18), (0, 9), (0, 11), (0, 12), (16, 13), (16, 19), (7, 17), (7, 6),
(7, 1), (7, 14), (5, 2), (5, 12), (1, 7), (1, 19), (11, 9), (11, 0), (11, 15), (3, 10), 
(3, 14), (3, 19), (14, 10), (14, 4), (14, 2), (14, 7), (14, 3), (6, 4), (6, 7), (15, 2), 
(15, 9), (15, 11), (15, 13), (12, 8), (12, 0), (12, 5), (13, 9), (13, 16), (13, 15), 
(19, 16), (19, 1), (19, 3)

Now, let's proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

Renaming the nodes based on degree:
Degree 1: {1, 5, 6, 12, 16, 18}
Degree 2: {3, 4, 7, 8, 13, 15, 17, 19}
Degree 3: {0, 2, 9, 11, 14}
Degree 4: {10}

Counting triangles:
Triangles [ ]: [153]

Unique triangles:
<2, 3, 19>
<2, 3, 14>
<2, 14, 3>
<3, 10, 14>
<3, 10, 19>
<3, 14, 10>
<4, 6, 7>
<9, 11, 15>
<9, 11, 0>
<9, 15, 11>
<9, 15, 13>
<11, 9, 15>
<15, 2, 9>
<15, 9, 11>
<15, 9, 13>
<15, 11, 9>
<16, 13, 15>
<17, 7, 14>
<19, 1, 3>
