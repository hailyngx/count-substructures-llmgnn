Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 10) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 10) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 11) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 11) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 11) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: [(0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 9), (0, 11), (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 13), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 10), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 12), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 8), (5, 9), (5, 10), (5, 14), (6, 7), (6, 13), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 11), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 14), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 10), (9, 14), (10, 2), (10, 5), (10, 9), (10, 13), (11, 0), (11, 7), (11, 12), (11, 13), (11, 14), (12, 3), (12, 11), (12, 14), (13, 1), (13, 6), (13, 10), (13, 11), (14, 5), (14, 8), (14, 9), (14, 11), (14, 12)]

Now, we will reorder the nodes based on their degrees from lowest to highest:

Reordered Nodes: {6, 5, 10, 12, 7, 13, 3, 2, 8, 0, 4, 11, 1, 9, 14}

Next, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [15]

Unique triangles found: <6, 7, 11>, <5, 10, 13>, <5, 9, 14>, <5, 9, 10>, <7, 11, 14>, <2, 8, 14>, <2, 8, 4>, <2, 8, 0>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 4, 11>, <0, 7, 11>, <4, 8, 14>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 3, 8>
