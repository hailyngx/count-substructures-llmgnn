Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 8) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 4) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 2) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 14) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 4) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 7) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 14) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(6, 7), (9, 8), (9, 12), (8, 9), (8, 14), (8, 0), (13, 5), (13, 12), (13, 11), (3, 11), (3, 0), (3, 10), (3, 12), (3, 4), (11, 13), (11, 3), (11, 14), (11, 7), (11, 2), (5, 13), (5, 2), (5, 12), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 14), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 12), (4, 0), (4, 1), (12, 9), (12, 13), (12, 3), (12, 5), (12, 4), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 2), (1, 0), (0, 8), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 1), (0, 10), (0, 2), (10, 3), (10, 0), (10, 14), (14, 8), (14, 11), (14, 5), (14, 10), (14, 7), (7, 6), (7, 11), (7, 14), (2, 11), (2, 5), (2, 1), (2, 0)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes: 6, 9, 2, 1, 10, 4, 7, 12, 13, 8, 11, 3, 5, 0, 14

Now, we will count the triangles formed by these edges:

Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles:
<6, 7, 11>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 14>
<1, 0, 2>
<10, 3, 11>
<10, 3, 12>
<10, 0, 3>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 12>
<3, 5, 12>
