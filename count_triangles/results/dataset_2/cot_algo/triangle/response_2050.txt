Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 6) (4, 8) (4, 10) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph can be relabeled based on their degrees as follows:

Node 0: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 6
Node 14: degree 3

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Considering the edges: (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 8), (8, 4), (6, 13), (0, 9), (0, 10), (1, 2), (2, 6), (7, 11), (11, 7).

After examining these edges, we find the following triangles: 

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <1, 2, 6>
3. <7, 11, 13>
4. <8, 4, 10>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
