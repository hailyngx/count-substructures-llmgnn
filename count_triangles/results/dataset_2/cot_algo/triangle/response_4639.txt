Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 13) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 7) (14, 9) (14, 7) 

Response:
The vertices with their respective number of connections are:
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 6 connections
Vertex 10: 3 connections
Vertex 11: 4 connections
Vertex 12: 3 connections
Vertex 13: 5 connections
Vertex 14: 2 connections

Now, relabeling the vertices based on the number of connections:
Vertex 14: 0
Vertex 6: 1
Vertex 8: 2
Vertex 10: 3
Vertex 12: 4
Vertex 2: 5
Vertex 0: 6
Vertex 1: 7
Vertex 3: 8
Vertex 4: 9
Vertex 7: 10
Vertex 5: 11
Vertex 11: 12
Vertex 13: 13
Vertex 9: 14

Now, sorting the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
(7, 10), (6, 1), (10, 3), (12, 4), (2, 5), (0, 6), (1, 7), (3, 8), (4, 9), (0, 6), (1, 7), (3, 8), (4, 9), (4, 9), (6, 1), (5, 11), (4, 9), (7, 10), (7, 10), (13, 5), (13, 5), (13, 5), (13, 5), (6, 1), (1, 7), (7, 10), (1, 7), (3, 8), (3, 8), (8, 2), (2, 5), (0, 6), (0, 6), (1, 7), (1, 7), (1, 7), (1, 7), (5, 11), (5, 11), (5, 11), (5, 11), (0, 6), (0, 6), (0, 6), (0, 6), (6, 1), (1, 7), (13, 5), (13, 5)

Finding the triangles:
- From the sorted edges, we find 10 triangles:  
<0, 6, 1>, <1, 7, 10>, <6, 1, 7>, <5, 11, 13>, <4, 9, 13>, <4, 9, 13>, <1, 7, 13>, <1, 7, 13>, <1, 7, 13>, <0, 6, 7>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
