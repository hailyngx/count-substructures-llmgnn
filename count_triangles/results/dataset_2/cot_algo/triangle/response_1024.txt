Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
The graph you provided has the following structure:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 0), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 7), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 0), (1, 8), (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (7, 6), (7, 9), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 8), (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 7), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 0), (0, 6), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (2, 9), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 5)

To count the number of triangles using Degree-Based Ordering, let's sort the nodes by their degrees (number of connections):

0: 5 connections
4: 2 connections
5: 3 connections
8: 3 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 5 connections
7: 5 connections
3: 5 connections
6: 5 connections
9: 5 connections

With the sorted nodes and their respective degrees, we can now count the number of triangles. 

The total number of triangles is [8].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 1>
<5, 6, 7>
