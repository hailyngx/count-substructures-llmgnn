Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 4) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 12) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 1) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 7) (1, 10) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 11, 15, 15, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, 38, 40, 42, 45.

The number of triangles in the given graph is [27].

The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 12>, <0, 5, 12>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 12>, <1, 7, 10>, <1, 9, 14>, <2, 7, 12>, <2, 7, 14>, <2, 12, 14>, <3, 7, 10>, <4, 0, 5>, <4, 0, 13>, <4, 6, 13>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 13>, <6, 4, 13>, <6, 10, 13>, <6, 4, 14>, <7, 1, 9>, <7, 1, 12>, <8, 5, 12>, <8, 12, 14>, <10, 3, 13>, <12, 0, 1>.
