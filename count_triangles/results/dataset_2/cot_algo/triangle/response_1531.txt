Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Then, you account for triangles formed by sharing connections between vertices. 

1. The degrees of the vertices are as follows:  
   - Node 0: degree 3  
   - Node 1: degree 5  
   - Node 2: degree 3  
   - Node 3: degree 3  
   - Node 4: degree 6  
   - Node 5: degree 2  
   - Node 6: degree 5  
   - Node 7: degree 5  
   - Node 8: degree 3  
   - Node 9: degree 5  

2. Relabeling the vertices based on degree (ascending order):  
   - Node 5: 0  
   - Node 2: 1  
   - Node 8: 2  
   - Node 3: 3  
   - Node 0: 4  
   - Node 1: 5  
   - Node 9: 6  
   - Node 7: 7  
   - Node 6: 8  
   - Node 4: 9  

3. Counting the triangles based on the degree-based ordering:  
   - Number of triangles [15]  

4. Unique triangles found:  
   - <0, 4, 5>  
   - <0, 4, 7>  
   - <0, 4, 9>  
   - <0, 5, 1>  
   - <0, 5, 3>  
   - <2, 6, 1>  
   - <2, 6, 4>  
   - <3, 5, 1>  
   - <3, 5, 4>  
   - <4, 5, 1>  
   - <4, 5, 6>  
   - <4, 5, 7>  
   - <4, 5, 9>  
   - <4, 6, 1>  
   - <4, 6, 7>
