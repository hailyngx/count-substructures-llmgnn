Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly.

The sorted vertices are:  
0 (degree 2), 8 (degree 4), 6 (degree 4), 12 (degree 4), 10 (degree 4), 14 (degree 4), 7 (degree 5), 4 (degree 5), 1 (degree 5), 3 (degree 5), 11 (degree 5), 9 (degree 5), 2 (degree 5), 5 (degree 5), 13 (degree 5).

Using the DB Ordering method, we count the triangles formed by the edges and their shared connections:

- Triangle 1: <0, 6, 5>
- Triangle 2: <0, 6, 11>
- Triangle 3: <0, 12, 11>
- Triangle 4: <0, 12, 3>
- Triangle 5: <0, 12, 13>
- Triangle 6: <0, 12, 1>
- Triangle 7: <0, 12, 7>
- Triangle 8: <8, 6, 5>
- Triangle 9: <8, 6, 11>
- Triangle 10: <8, 10, 14>
- Triangle 11: <8, 10, 2>
- Triangle 12: <6, 11, 5>
- Triangle 13: <6, 11, 7>
- Triangle 14: <6, 11, 13>
- Triangle 15: <6, 11, 12>
- Triangle 16: <10, 14, 2>
- Triangle 17: <12, 11, 7>
- Triangle 18: <12, 11, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [18].
