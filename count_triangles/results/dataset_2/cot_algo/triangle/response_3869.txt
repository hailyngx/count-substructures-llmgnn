Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (15, 26) (15, 9) (15, 8) (1, 21) (1, 28) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 22) (21, 1) (21, 12) (21, 23) (21, 18) (21, 17) (8, 15) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 26) (22, 1) (22, 23) (23, 21) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 17) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 18) (2, 3) (2, 26) (2, 28) (19, 1) (19, 26) (19, 0) (26, 15) (26, 13) (26, 2) (26, 19) (9, 15) (9, 20) (9, 27) (29, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 4) (14, 25) (7, 10) (7, 11) (6, 14) (6, 4) (18, 21) (18, 23) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 20) (4, 14) (4, 6) (12, 21) (12, 25) (12, 0) (24, 27) (24, 17) (27, 9) (27, 24) (27, 17) (27, 5) (20, 9) (20, 18) (5, 27) (5, 25) (25, 14) (25, 12) (25, 5) (25, 28) (17, 21) (17, 23) (17, 24) (17, 27) (0, 19) (0, 29) (0, 12) (28, 1) (28, 2) (28, 25) (16, 10) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: 
(3, 2), (15, 26), (15, 9), (15, 8), (1, 21), (1, 28), (1, 10), (1, 19), (1, 22), (21, 12), (21, 23), (21, 18), (21, 17), (8, 13), (26, 13), (22, 23), (23, 18), (23, 17), (10, 11), (10, 7), (11, 14), (11, 7), (11, 18), (19, 0), (29, 0), (14, 6), (14, 4), (7, 11), (6, 4), (12, 25), (24, 27), (5, 25), (5, 27), (0, 29), (16, 10)

Now, let's list the nodes based on the number of connections they have in ascending order:
Nodes by connections: {16, 29, 5, 3, 6, 8, 9, 4, 12, 7, 2, 26, 13, 10, 14, 15, 1, 28, 0, 25, 11, 18, 20, 22, 23, 17, 24, 27, 19, 21}

With this ordering, we can now count the number of triangles. 

The total number of triangles is [7] and the unique triangles found are: 
<1, 21, 23>, <1, 21, 18>, <1, 19, 26>, <1, 19, 0>, <15, 9, 8>, <15, 21, 23>, <10, 7, 11>.
