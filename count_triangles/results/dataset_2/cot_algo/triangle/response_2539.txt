Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows:
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 6
Node 5: Degree 7

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. (3, 8) - Forms triangle with (8, 9) and (9, 3)
2. (3, 0) - Forms triangle with (0, 5) and (5, 3)
3. (0, 1) - Forms triangle with (1, 5) and (5, 0)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are:
<3, 8, 9>
<3, 0, 5>
<0, 1, 5>
