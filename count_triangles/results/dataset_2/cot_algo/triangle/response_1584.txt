Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 29) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 6) (27, 13) (27, 0) (18, 1) (1, 18) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 20) (3, 6) (3, 19) (6, 0) (6, 3) (9, 29) (9, 20) (9, 16) (12, 21) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 29) (23, 8) (23, 25) (23, 10) (23, 19) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 20) (14, 2) (21, 3) (21, 12) (21, 17) (28, 17) (26, 22) (26, 10) (11, 14) (11, 15) (11, 17) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 4) (29, 22) (29, 9) (29, 8) (7, 15) (25, 23) (25, 5) (25, 10) (24, 4) (24, 20) (10, 23) (10, 26) (10, 25) (5, 2) (5, 25) (5, 16) (15, 1) (15, 11) (15, 7) (16, 9) (16, 5) (16, 17) (17, 21) (17, 28) (17, 11) (17, 16) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 24) (19, 3) (19, 23) (19, 14) (20, 3) (20, 9) (20, 8) (20, 14) (20, 24) 

Response:
The graph given has 30 nodes and 90 edges.

By using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph:

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Nodes: 18 < 7 < 24 < 12 < 28 < 6 < 9 < 5 < 11 < 15 < 16 < 25 < 26 < 0 < 27 < 2 < 4 < 1 < 3 < 19 < 29 < 10 < 17 < 8 < 23 < 14 < 20 < 21 < 22 < 13

The number of triangles in the graph is: [8]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 6, 14>
<0, 14, 19>
<0, 14, 20>
<0, 14, 2>
<1, 15, 11>
<1, 15, 7>
<2, 14, 4>
<3, 19, 14>
