Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly for ease of reference. 

After sorting the vertices according to their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 4: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 6: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 5: degree 6
Node 2: degree 6

Now, examining the edges while following the rule that for each edge, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles:

1. (5, 9): No triangle
2. (5, 2): Triangle formed with 2, 3, 5
3. (5, 8): No triangle
4. (5, 1): Triangle formed with 1, 3, 5
5. (5, 7): Triangle formed with 5, 6, 7
6. (9, 5): No triangle
7. (9, 1): No triangle
8. (9, 7): No triangle
9. (4, 0): No triangle
10. (4, 2): Triangle formed with 0, 2, 3
11. (7, 5): Triangle formed with 5, 6, 7
12. (7, 9): No triangle
13. (7, 3): Triangle formed with 3, 5, 7
14. (7, 6): Triangle formed with 5, 6, 7
15. (1, 5): Triangle formed with 1, 3, 5
16. (1, 9): No triangle
17. (1, 3): No triangle
18. (1, 2): Triangle formed with 1, 2, 3
19. (1, 8): No triangle
20. (3, 7): Triangle formed with 3, 5, 7
21. (3, 1): No triangle
22. (3, 0): No triangle
23. (3, 2): Triangle formed with 1, 2, 3
24. (8, 5): No triangle
25. (8, 1): No triangle
26. (8, 6): No triangle
27. (6, 7): Triangle formed with 5, 6, 7
28. (6, 8): No triangle
29. (6, 2): Triangle formed with 2, 3, 6
30. (6, 0): No triangle
31. (0, 4): No triangle
32. (0, 3): No triangle
33. (0, 6): No triangle
34. (0, 2): Triangle formed with 0, 2, 3
35. (2, 5): Triangle formed with 2, 3, 5
36. (2, 4): Triangle formed with 0, 2, 3
37. (2, 1): Triangle formed with 1, 2, 3
38. (2, 3): Triangle formed with 1, 2, 3
39. (2, 6): Triangle formed with 2, 3, 6
40. (2, 0): Triangle formed with 0, 2, 3

After evaluating all the edges, the total number of triangles is [10]. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 0>, <5, 6, 7>.
