Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 2) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (8, 12) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 14) (14, 9) (14, 5) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 10) (11, 12) (11, 9) (11, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has nodes labelled from 0 to 14 with the following connections:

Node 0: 4, 7, 12, 13, 6

Node 1: 3, 6, 2, 5, 10, 12

Node 2: 1, 3

Node 3: 1, 10, 13, 9, 2

Node 4: 7, 9, 0

Node 5: 1, 8, 14

Node 6: 1, 0, 10, 11

Node 7: 4, 0, 13

Node 8: 12, 9, 5, 10

Node 9: 4, 3, 8, 11, 14, 10

Node 10: 1, 3, 8, 9, 6, 13

Node 11: 12, 9, 6

Node 12: 1, 0, 11, 8

Node 13: 7, 3, 0, 10

Node 14: 5, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Ordering the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes by degree:
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 10: 6 connections

2. Proceed with each edge only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Checking for shared connections for each edge:

Triangles:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 4, 13>
<0, 7, 13>
<1, 3, 10>
<1, 3, 12>
<1, 6, 10>
<1, 6, 12>
<1, 10, 13>
<1, 12, 8>
<3, 9, 10>
<3, 9, 13>
<3, 10, 13>
<8, 9, 10>
<9, 10, 13>

[Total number of triangles: 15]
