Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 14) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 13) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 8) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(4, 9), (4, 13), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 3), (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 13), (7, 5), (7, 1), 
(1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 12), (1, 8), (3, 4), (3, 14), (10, 9), (10, 5), (10, 14), 
(11, 14), (11, 9), (11, 13), (11, 2), (2, 7), (2, 11), (2, 8), (2, 12), (2, 14), 
(8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 9), (8, 0), (8, 12), (0, 8), (0, 14), (14, 3), (14, 10), 
(14, 11), (14, 2), (14, 0), (14, 9), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 10), (13, 4), (13, 7), 
(13, 11), (13, 6), (9, 4), (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 8), (9, 14), (6, 4), (6, 7), 
(6, 1), (6, 13), (12, 1), (12, 2), (12, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph using the degree-based ordering method: 

Vertices sorted by degree: [0, 12, 5, 10, 3, 8, 2, 1, 6, 13, 11, 7, 9, 14, 4]

Number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 7, 6>, <1, 8, 12>, <2, 7, 13>, <2, 7, 14>
