Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 12) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 11) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges:
- 0: (3, 5, 7, 10)
- 1: (3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13)
- 2: (9, 10, 13)
- 3: (0, 1, 6, 7, 8)
- 4: (1, 9, 12, 14)
- 5: (0, 7, 12, 14)
- 6: (1, 3, 10, 14)
- 7: (0, 1, 3, 5, 14)
- 8: (3, 9, 12)
- 9: (1, 2, 4, 8)
- 10: (0, 6, 12, 2)
- 11: (12, 13)
- 12: (4, 5, 8, 10, 11)
- 13: (1, 2, 11)
- 14: (4, 5, 6, 7)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) from least to most:
Nodes: 11, 2, 0, 5, 4, 8, 10, 13, 14, 6, 9, 7, 1, 3, 12

Now, we will count the number of triangles by checking shared connections between vertices with lower labels:
Triangles: [42]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 7, 14>, <0, 10, 12>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 9, 13>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 14>, <4, 5, 12>, <4, 9, 1>, <4, 9, 8>, <5, 7, 14>, <6, 10, 13>, <8, 9, 12>, <10, 0, 12>, <10, 2, 9>, <10, 6, 14>, <13, 1, 2>, <13, 11, 12>
