Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
(0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 9),
(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 9),
(2, 0), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9),
(3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6),
(4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 8), (4, 9),
(5, 3), (5, 6),
(6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 8),
(7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 8),
(8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 7),
(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4)

Now, we'll apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph.

Nodes sorted by degree (least to most):
Nodes with degree 1: 5, 7
Nodes with degree 2: 0
Nodes with degree 3: 5, 7
Nodes with degree 4: 9
Nodes with degree 5: 3
Nodes with degree 6: 2, 8
Nodes with degree 7: 1, 6
Nodes with degree 8: 4

Now, counting the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 7, 2>
4. Triangle <0, 7, 8>
5. Triangle <1, 4, 9>
6. Triangle <1, 6, 3>
7. Triangle <2, 7, 8>
8. Triangle <3, 4, 1>
9. Triangle <3, 4, 8>
10. Triangle <4, 8, 2>
11. Triangle <6, 1, 3>
12. Triangle <8, 4, 9>

Total number of triangles: [12]
