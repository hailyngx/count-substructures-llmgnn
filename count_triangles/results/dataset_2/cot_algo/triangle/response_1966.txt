Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 12) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 13) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (10, 12) (10, 9) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 11) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are:
Node 3 - degree 5
Node 9 - degree 4
Node 11 - degree 4
Node 12 - degree 4
Node 0 - degree 5
Node 2 - degree 4
Node 7 - degree 4
Node 8 - degree 4
Node 4 - degree 4
Node 6 - degree 5
Node 10 - degree 3
Node 14 - degree 4
Node 1 - degree 5
Node 5 - degree 5
Node 13 - degree 4

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [17]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 14>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 14>, <1, 5, 14>, <3, 5, 13>, <3, 6, 11>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 14>, <5, 7, 2>, <5, 7, 12>, <6, 7, 14>, <8, 9, 2>, <9, 10, 12>
