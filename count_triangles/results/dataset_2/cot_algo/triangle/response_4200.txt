Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method first requires us to count the degree (number of connections) of each vertex in the graph.

Node 0: degree = 5
Node 1: degree = 4
Node 2: degree = 4
Node 3: degree = 4
Node 4: degree = 5
Node 5: degree = 4
Node 6: degree = 4
Node 7: degree = 3
Node 8: degree = 4
Node 9: degree = 3

Now, we will assign new labels based on the degree of each node. We will start with the node with the lowest degree.

Label 0: Node 7
Label 1: Node 9
Label 2: Node 2
Label 3: Node 1
Label 4: Node 6
Label 5: Node 3
Label 6: Node 8
Label 7: Node 5
Label 8: Node 0
Label 9: Node 4

Now, we will list the edges according to the new labels, showing only the edges where the lower labeled node has a lower degree.

New edges:
(2, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the shared connections.

The total number of triangles is [1].

The unique triangles found are <2, 5, 7>.
