Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 1) (27, 19) (6, 9) (6, 25) (6, 16) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 13) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 24) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 18) (12, 16) (8, 0) (8, 14) (23, 26) (23, 2) (23, 25) (23, 1) (2, 23) (2, 14) (2, 11) (4, 0) (4, 18) (4, 24) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 28) (22, 9) (22, 5) (22, 15) (3, 11) (3, 29) (3, 19) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 3) (1, 27) (1, 17) (1, 23) (1, 7) (13, 9) (13, 26) (13, 28) (26, 10) (26, 23) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 21) (16, 6) (16, 12) (29, 3) (29, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 20) (21, 0) (21, 26) (21, 20) (21, 25) (28, 18) (28, 13) (20, 14) (20, 21) (5, 10) (5, 22) (5, 29) (7, 1) (7, 24) (24, 10) (24, 4) (24, 7) (25, 6) (25, 23) (25, 26) (25, 21) (19, 27) (19, 3) (15, 22) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. After relabeling the nodes accordingly, we can proceed with counting the triangles by looking at the shared connections among the vertices of each edge.

The nodes sorted by degree are:
(2, 12) (5, 12) (15, 12) (7, 13) (1, 14) (8, 14) (14, 14) (10, 16) (6, 16) (4, 17) (9, 17) (3, 17) (23, 18) (0, 19) (22, 19) (19, 19) (13, 20) (16, 20) (17, 21) (26, 21) (20, 21) (21, 21) (11, 21) (25, 22) (28, 22) (29, 22) (24, 23) (18, 24) (27, 26)

Now, let's count the triangles using the shared connections of the vertices of each edge:

[The total number of triangles is: 34]
