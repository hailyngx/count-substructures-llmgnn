Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 3)

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Degree 2: 2
Degree 3: 0, 1, 9
Degree 4: 3, 5, 8
Degree 5: 6
Degree 6: 7
Degree 7: 4

Now, we will count the number of triangles by checking shared connections between vertices starting from the vertex with the lowest label. 

The total number of triangles is [10]:

Unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 3>
<1, 7, 5>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 7, 6>
<5, 4, 6>
