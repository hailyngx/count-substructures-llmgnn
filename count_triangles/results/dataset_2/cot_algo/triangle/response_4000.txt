Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
- Node 3: 2 edges
- Node 6: 3 edges
- Node 1: 4 edges
- Node 8: 4 edges
- Node 7: 4 edges
- Node 9: 5 edges
- Node 0: 5 edges
- Node 4: 5 edges
- Node 2: 6 edges
- Node 5: 6 edges

After relabeling the vertices based on their number of connections, the new list becomes:
- Node 3 -> Node 0
- Node 6 -> Node 1
- Node 1 -> Node 2
- Node 8 -> Node 3
- Node 7 -> Node 4
- Node 9 -> Node 5
- Node 0 -> Node 6
- Node 4 -> Node 7
- Node 2 -> Node 8
- Node 5 -> Node 9

Checking the edges (sorted by the vertex with the lower label):
(0, 6): Shared connections: 5
(1, 2): Shared connections: 4, 8
(2, 8): Shared connections: 5
(3, 0): No shared connection
(4, 7): Shared connections: 5
(5, 9): Shared connections: 2
(6, 1): Shared connections: 9
(7, 4): Shared connections: 5

Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 8>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <5, 6, 9>
