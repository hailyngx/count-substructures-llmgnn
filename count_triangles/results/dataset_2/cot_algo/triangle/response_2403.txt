Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 4) (4, 0) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 7) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the triangles in the provided graph. 

First, sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:  
Vertex 11: degree 1  
Vertex 5: degree 2  
Vertex 10: degree 3  
Vertex 0: degree 4  
Vertex 14: degree 4  
Vertex 9: degree 6  
Vertex 13: degree 6  
Vertex 7: degree 4  
Vertex 8: degree 3  
Vertex 2: degree 3  
Vertex 12: degree 6  
Vertex 1: degree 3  
Vertex 6: degree 5  
Vertex 3: degree 5  
Vertex 4: degree 4  

Next, relabel the vertices based on their degrees:  
Vertex 11: degree 1 -> relabeled as 0  
Vertex 5: degree 2 -> relabeled as 1  
Vertex 10: degree 3 -> relabeled as 2  
Vertex 0: degree 4 -> relabeled as 3  
Vertex 14: degree 4 -> relabeled as 4  
Vertex 9: degree 6 -> relabeled as 5  
Vertex 13: degree 6 -> relabeled as 6  
Vertex 7: degree 4 -> relabeled as 7  
Vertex 8: degree 3 -> relabeled as 8  
Vertex 2: degree 3 -> relabeled as 9  
Vertex 12: degree 6 -> relabeled as 10  
Vertex 1: degree 3 -> relabeled as 11  
Vertex 6: degree 5 -> relabeled as 12  
Vertex 3: degree 5 -> relabeled as 13  
Vertex 4: degree 4 -> relabeled as 14  

Now, we will count the triangles:  
Triangles:  
<0, 1, 3>  
<0, 6, 1>  
<0, 6, 3>  
<0, 7, 3>  
<1, 6, 7>  
<1, 7, 3>  
<1, 9, 2>  
<1, 9, 14>  
<1, 12, 6>  
<1, 12, 14>  
<3, 7, 12>  
<3, 7, 8>  
<3, 12, 6>  
<3, 13, 12>  
<4, 2, 14>  
<4, 2, 11>  
<4, 12, 14>  
<6, 7, 12>  
<6, 12, 14>  
<6, 12, 1>  
<7, 8, 12>  
<7, 8, 3>  
<12, 8, 3>  
<12, 8, 7>  

Total number of triangles: [24]
