Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 4) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 4) (13, 9) (13, 12) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first construct the list of edges as mentioned:

Edges:
(6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) 
(9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) 
(1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) 
(3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) 
(7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 2) 
(12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 8) 
(2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) 
(8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 0) 
(0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 4) 
(10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 5) 
(11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 5) 
(14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) 
(5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 4)
(13, 9) (13, 12) 
(4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 5)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The nodes sorted by degree are:
Node 5 (Degree 4)
Node 13 (Degree 2)
Node 2 (Degree 3)
Node 11 (Degree 3)
Node 9 (Degree 3)
Node 7 (Degree 3)
Node 1 (Degree 4)
Node 3 (Degree 4)
Node 0 (Degree 4)
Node 12 (Degree 5)
Node 10 (Degree 6)
Node 8 (Degree 6)
Node 14 (Degree 5)
Node 6 (Degree 4)
Node 4 (Degree 5)

We will consider the edges with the lower labeled vertices having fewer connections. 

Counting the triangles formed by these edges, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 8, 14>
<0, 10, 4>
<3, 7, 12>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 10>
<2, 5, 10>
<5, 11, 14>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
