Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently in the given graph. Let's start by sorting the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices with their degrees:
- 0: 3
- 1: 5
- 2: 5
- 3: 2
- 4: 4
- 5: 4
- 6: 5
- 7: 3
- 8: 3
- 9: 4

Based on the sorted order, the labeled vertices will be:
- 0: 0
- 3: 1
- 7: 2
- 8: 3
- 9: 4
- 4: 5
- 5: 6
- 6: 7
- 2: 8
- 1: 9

Now, let's count the triangles:
- For edge (6, 9): No triangle as 9 has fewer connections than 6.
- For edge (6, 1): No triangle as 1 has fewer connections than 6.
- For edge (6, 7): No triangle as 6 and 7 have the same number of connections.
- For edge (6, 8): Triangle <6, 7, 8>.
- For edge (6, 4): No triangle as 4 has fewer connections than 6.
- For edge (9, 8): No triangle as 8 has fewer connections than 9.
- For edge (9, 4): Triangle <9, 4, 5>.
- For edge (9, 2): No triangle as 2 has fewer connections than 9.
- For edge (1, 3): No triangle as 1 has more connections than 3.
- For edge (1, 2): Triangle <1, 2, 5>.
- For edge (1, 5): Triangle <1, 4, 5>.
- For edge (1, 4): Triangle <1, 4, 6>.
- For edge (1, 0): No triangle as 1 has more connections than 0.
- For edge (3, 2): No triangle as 3 has fewer connections than 2.
- For edge (4, 5): No triangle as 5 has fewer connections than 4.
- For edge (5, 0): Triangle <5, 0, 7>.
- For edge (0, 7): No triangle as 0 has more connections than 7.
- For edge (7, 2): No triangle as 2 has fewer connections than 7.

Count of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <6, 7, 8>, <9, 4, 5>, <1, 2, 5>.
