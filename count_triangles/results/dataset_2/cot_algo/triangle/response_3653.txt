Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 11) (3, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 10) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to efficiently count the triangles in the given graph.

First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

Nodes with degree 1: 3
Nodes with degree 2: 0, 5
Nodes with degree 3: 7, 13
Nodes with degree 4: 1, 2, 10, 12, 14
Nodes with degree 5: 8
Nodes with degree 6: 6, 9
Nodes with degree 7: 4
Nodes with degree 8: 11

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly based on their degrees and proceed to count the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 2>
4. Triangle <1, 6, 2>
5. Triangle <4, 7, 8>
6. Triangle <4, 8, 10>
7. Triangle <4, 8, 12>
8. Triangle <4, 8, 14>
9. Triangle <4, 8, 7>
10. Triangle <4, 10, 12>
11. Triangle <4, 10, 8>
12. Triangle <6, 9, 5>
13. Triangle <6, 9, 11>
14. Triangle <6, 9, 13>
15. Triangle <8, 10, 2>
16. Triangle <8, 10, 4>
17. Triangle <8, 10, 12>
18. Triangle <11, 13, 12>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [18].
