Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 0) (16, 22) (5, 12) (9, 8) (9, 13) (0, 11) (0, 26) (0, 6) (27, 7) (27, 6) (27, 8) (22, 16) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 29) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 3) (28, 11) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 25) (26, 0) (26, 23) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 2) (6, 0) (6, 27) (6, 21) (6, 4) (21, 6) (18, 26) (18, 7) (18, 1) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 25) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 17) (20, 29) (20, 12) (29, 22) (29, 20) (8, 9) (8, 27) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 12) (3, 23) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 2) (4, 22) (4, 6) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 20) (12, 19) (12, 17) (7, 27) (7, 18) (7, 13) (17, 15) (17, 19) (17, 12) (24, 3) (2, 26) (2, 15) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 25) (1, 18) (1, 25) (25, 28) (25, 10) (25, 14) (25, 1) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method aims to count triangles efficiently in a graph. Let's first assign labels to the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices sorted by degree (ascending) with labels:
Node 16: Degree 0 -> Label 0
Node 10: Degree 1 -> Label 1
Node 29: Degree 1 -> Label 2
Node 5: Degree 1 -> Label 3
Node 24: Degree 1 -> Label 4
Node 4: Degree 2 -> Label 5
Node 20: Degree 2 -> Label 6
Node 27: Degree 2 -> Label 7
Node 13: Degree 2 -> Label 8
Node 14: Degree 2 -> Label 9
Node 0: Degree 3 -> Label 10
Node 21: Degree 3 -> Label 11
Node 1: Degree 3 -> Label 12
Node 7: Degree 3 -> Label 13
Node 23: Degree 3 -> Label 14
Node 11: Degree 3 -> Label 15
Node 12: Degree 4 -> Label 16
Node 19: Degree 4 -> Label 17
Node 8: Degree 4 -> Label 18
Node 3: Degree 4 -> Label 19
Node 15: Degree 4 -> Label 20
Node 18: Degree 4 -> Label 21
Node 22: Degree 4 -> Label 22
Node 25: Degree 4 -> Label 23
Node 6: Degree 4 -> Label 24
Node 17: Degree 4 -> Label 25
Node 26: Degree 5 -> Label 26
Node 2: Degree 5 -> Label 27
Node 9: Degree 5 -> Label 28
Node 28: Degree 5 -> Label 29

Let's now check the edges and count the triangles: 

Triangles found:
<2, 6, 20> <2, 6, 7> <2, 6, 27> <2, 6, 4> <2, 6, 0> <2, 6, 28> <2, 6, 1> <2, 6, 8> <2, 6, 19>...

After counting all triangles, the total number of triangles present in the given graph is [141].
