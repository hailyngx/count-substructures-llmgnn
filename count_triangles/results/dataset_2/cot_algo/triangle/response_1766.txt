Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree. Vertices with lower degrees will be relabeled with smaller numbers. 

Here is the list of vertices in the order of degree:  
Node 7: 2 connections  
Node 0: 3 connections  
Node 2: 3 connections  
Node 8: 3 connections  
Node 1: 4 connections  
Node 5: 4 connections  
Node 4: 6 connections  
Node 3: 6 connections  
Node 6: 7 connections  
Node 9: 7 connections  

Using the approach where we only consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has a smaller degree, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.

After counting, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [10]

The unique triangles found in the graph are:  
<0, 1, 2>  
<0, 1, 7>  
<0, 1, 9>  
<0, 2, 4>  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 2, 1>  
<0, 4, 6>  
<0, 4, 8>  
<0, 4, 2>  
<0, 4, 5>
