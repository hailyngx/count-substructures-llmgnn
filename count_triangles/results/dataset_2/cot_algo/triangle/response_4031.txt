Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 11) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 12) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 0) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 12) (2, 11) (2, 10) 

Response:
The given graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 14), 
(9, 7), (9, 0), 
(4, 10), (4, 11), (4, 6), 
(7, 10), (7, 8), 
(8, 12), (8, 1), 
(13, 12), (13, 10), 
(1, 11), (1, 14), (1, 0), 
(6, 14), (6, 10), (6, 3), 
(11, 14), (11, 2), 
(3, 12), 
(10, 2)

First, let's order the nodes based on the degree:
Nodes with their degrees: 
0(6), 1(3), 2(2), 3(3), 4(3), 5(5), 6(3), 7(3), 8(3), 9(3), 10(5), 11(4), 12(4), 13(3), 14(4)

Now, we will consider each edge and count triangles:

Triangles:
[29]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 5, 13>, <0, 11, 1>, <0, 12, 8>, <0, 12, 3>, <1, 14, 11>, <3, 6, 10>, <3, 12, 8>, <4, 10, 6>, <5, 13, 10>, <5, 9, 0>, <6, 4, 10>, <6, 14, 11>, <7, 10, 4>, <7, 10, 9>, <8, 0, 12>, <11, 1, 14>, <12, 0, 8>, <13, 5, 10>, <13, 12, 8>, <14, 1, 11>
