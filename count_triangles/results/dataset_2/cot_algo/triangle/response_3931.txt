Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
Following the instructions for the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the nodes by their degree:

Node 0: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Relabeled nodes according to degree:
Node 2 (Degree 4)
Node 3 (Degree 4)
Node 4 (Degree 4)
Node 8 (Degree 4)
Node 9 (Degree 4)
Node 5 (Degree 4)
Node 0 (Degree 5)
Node 1 (Degree 5)
Node 7 (Degree 5)
Node 6 (Degree 6)

Now, we will analyze the edges, ensuring we only count triangles once:
