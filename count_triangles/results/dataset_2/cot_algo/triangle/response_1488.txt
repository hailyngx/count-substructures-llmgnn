Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 16) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 19) (7, 25) (7, 15) (7, 5) (21, 10) (21, 12) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 20) (22, 26) (22, 20) (22, 3) (1, 25) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 22) (3, 13) (10, 21) (10, 17) (10, 27) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 11) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 29) (8, 25) (26, 22) (26, 16) (27, 10) (27, 11) (27, 23) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 8) (25, 12) (25, 28) (2, 14) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 29) (19, 12) (0, 29) (16, 6) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 20) (24, 16) (24, 28) (24, 14) (15, 9) (15, 7) (23, 27) (23, 28) (29, 8) (29, 19) (29, 0) (29, 13) (14, 2) (14, 24) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 27) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 29) (20, 18) (20, 22) (20, 16) (20, 28) (12, 21) (12, 1) (12, 25) (12, 19) (5, 7) (5, 17) (5, 4) (28, 25) (28, 24) (28, 23) (28, 20) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, the Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles. 

The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are as follows:
- Node 0: 1 edge
- Node 2: 1 edge
- Node 6: 3 edges
- Node 14: 2 edges
- Node 7: 3 edges
- Node 13: 3 edges
- Node 18: 3 edges
- Node 21: 2 edges
- Node 23: 2 edges
- Node 27: 3 edges
- Node 5: 3 edges
- Node 3: 2 edges
- Node 24: 3 edges
- Node 10: 3 edges
- Node 20: 4 edges
- Node 16: 4 edges
- Node 11: 3 edges
- Node 17: 3 edges
- Node 26: 3 edges
- Node 8: 4 edges
- Node 4: 4 edges
- Node 12: 4 edges
- Node 1: 4 edges
- Node 9: 4 edges
- Node 15: 2 edges
- Node 19: 4 edges
- Node 29: 4 edges
- Node 25: 5 edges
- Node 28: 4 edges

The total number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method is [13].

The unique triangles found are:
1. <8, 6, 4>
2. <8, 6, 16>
3. <8, 6, 25>
4. <8, 12, 1>
5. <8, 12, 25>
6. <8, 25, 1>
7. <4, 6, 16>
8. <4, 6, 1>
9. <4, 8, 6>
10. <4, 8, 25>
11. <4, 12, 1>
12. <4, 25, 1>
13. <25, 8, 12>
