After sorting the vertices by their degrees from least to most, the order is as follows:
[1, 3, 14, 23, 9, 6, 19, 4, 20, 13, 16, 24, 0, 2, 26, 8, 28, 10, 12, 5, 11, 18, 29, 21, 22, 7, 17, 27, 15, 25]

By counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles is [8].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 5, 15>, <2, 7, 21>, <2, 9, 29>, <2, 14, 24>, <5, 7, 15>, <5, 10, 25>, <11, 17, 26>, <16, 20, 21>
