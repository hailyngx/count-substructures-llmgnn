Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 17) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 15) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 13) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 19) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 17) (0, 16) (0, 2) (8, 19) (8, 18) (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 14) (16, 0) (16, 1) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 18) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 15) (17, 5) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 12) (14, 19) (14, 15) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 16) (1, 2) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 2) (15, 14) (10, 2) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 12) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 3) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Sorted by degree:
Nodes: {10, 14, 16, 20, 11, 12, 8, 0, 5, 17, 18, 6, 1, 9, 13, 19, 2, 3, 4, 7}

After relabeling the nodes, the edges become:
Edges: (10, 2), (14, 15), (16, 0), (16, 1), (20, 11), (20, 17), (11, 12), (11, 4), (11, 17), (11, 3), (12, 17), (12, 18), (8, 19), (8, 18), (0, 2), (5, 6), (5, 17), (17, 18), (17, 4), (6, 5), (6, 13), (6, 15), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 16), (9, 7), (9, 13), (13, 3), (14, 19), (15, 14), (19, 3), (2, 10), (2, 15)

Based on the sorted order and the edge criteria, we have:
Triangles: [32]

Unique triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 16>, <0, 2, 10>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 17>, <0, 16, 1>, <0, 16, 2>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 4, 17>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 16>, <1, 16, 0>, <1, 16, 2>, <2, 10, 15>, <3, 11, 12>, <3, 11, 17>, <3, 11, 4>, <3, 13, 6>, <3, 13, 9>, <3, 13, 19>, <4, 11, 17>, <4, 11, 3>, <5, 6, 17>, <5, 6, 13>, <5, 6, 15>, <6, 13, 9>, <6, 13, 3>, <6, 15, 14>, <7, 9, 13>, <8, 18, 12>, <14, 19, 3>
