Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 10) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 2) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 3) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their number of connections is as follows:
Node 12: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 10: 6 connections
Node 11: 6 connections
Node 9: 7 connections
Node 14: 7 connections
Node 6: 8 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles in the graph.

Calculating the triangles:
For edge (6, 1) - Shared connections: 11
For edge (6, 14) - Shared connections: None
For edge (6, 10) - Shared connections: 11, 7
For edge (6, 11) - Shared connections: 1
For edge (9, 4) - Shared connections: None
For edge (9, 11) - Shared connections: 1
For edge (9, 1) - Shared connections: 11
For edge (9, 7) - Shared connections: 4, 8
For edge (9, 0) - Shared connections: None
For edge (4, 8) - Shared connections: 5
For edge (4, 5) - Shared connections: 9
For edge (8, 5) - Shared connections: 4
For edge (8, 1) - Shared connections: 6
For edge (5, 13) - Shared connections: None
For edge (5, 0) - Shared connections: None
For edge (5, 3) - Shared connections: 11
For edge (7, 12) - Shared connections: None
For edge (7, 13) - Shared connections: 5
For edge (7, 8) - Shared connections: 4
For edge (7, 10) - Shared connections: 6
For edge (12, 10) - Shared connections: 7
For edge (13, 2) - Shared connections: None
For edge (0, 2) - Shared connections: None
For edge (3, 14) - Shared connections: None
For edge (3, 10) - Shared connections: 7
For edge (1, 8) - Shared connections: 4
For edge (2, 14) - Shared connections: None

Total number of triangles: [10]

List of unique triangles found:
<4, 8, 5>, <1, 8, 6>, <1, 6, 11>, <1, 9, 11>, <7, 8, 4>, <7, 10, 6>, <5, 3, 11>, <13, 5, 4>, <7, 13, 5>, <6, 11, 1>
