Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 19) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 3) (26, 17) (15, 23) (15, 2) (15, 25) (27, 29) (27, 21) (27, 5) (2, 15) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 7) (29, 27) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 24) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (23, 15) (23, 2) (23, 1) (0, 22) (0, 18) (20, 19) (20, 28) (28, 29) (28, 20) (4, 18) (4, 13) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 4) (18, 1) (3, 26) (11, 26) (11, 13) (11, 12) (17, 26) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 5) (1, 23) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 6) (10, 26) (10, 12) (10, 14) (21, 27) (21, 25) (21, 24) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 22) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 24) (16, 13) (16, 22) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 19) (22, 0) (22, 6) (22, 16) (14, 10) (14, 24) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 16) (24, 29) (24, 21) (24, 12) (24, 14) (19, 9) (19, 20) (19, 7) (19, 25) (25, 15) (25, 21) (25, 19) (5, 27) (5, 17) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently in the graph you provided. 

After sorting the nodes based on their degrees and relabeling them accordingly, the new list of edges that will be considered are: 
(0, 22) (6, 22) (13, 16) (16, 22) (11, 13) (11, 12) (10, 12) (12, 14) (21, 24) (21, 25) (13, 16) (17, 12) (17, 26) (17, 5) (19, 7) (19, 25) (20, 28) (24, 29) (23, 1) (23, 7) (27, 5)

Now, calculating the triangles in the graph, we find the following unique triangles: 
<12, 14, 24>
<12, 14, 10>
<25, 19, 7>
<17, 5, 27>
<17, 26, 5>
<11, 12, 14>
<21, 24, 25>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
