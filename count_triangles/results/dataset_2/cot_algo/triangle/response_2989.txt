Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 10) (12, 7) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 13) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 18) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 0) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 11) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 11) (3, 5) (3, 2) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 18) (11, 13) (14, 7) (14, 18) (0, 5) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 17) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 3) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 19) (1, 10) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 11) (18, 14) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 1) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 11) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves first sorting the vertices based on their degrees. Here is the sorted list of nodes and their degrees:

Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 16: degree 3
Node 18: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 15: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 0: degree 5
Node 13: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4
Node 3: degree 2
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 4

Now, we will iterate over each edge and count the number of triangles formed. We will only consider an edge if the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

After counting the triangles, we find that the total number of triangles is [11]. The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 5, 15>
<0, 5, 19>
<0, 15, 17>
<0, 17, 2>
<5, 10, 1>
<7, 12, 15>
<7, 12, 14>
<12, 14, 18>
<6, 11, 17>
<13, 15, 11>
<8, 10, 1>
