Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Node 0 is connected to nodes: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2
Node 1 is connected to nodes: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6
Node 2 is connected to nodes: 3, 7, 0, 6
Node 3 is connected to nodes: 1, 0, 2
Node 4 is connected to nodes: 9, 1, 7, 8, 0
Node 5 is connected to nodes: 6, 1, 0
Node 6 is connected to nodes: 9, 5, 1, 2, 0
Node 7 is connected to nodes: 9, 4, 2, 8
Node 8 is connected to nodes: 4, 7
Node 9 is connected to nodes: 6, 4, 7

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 8: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 3: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 9: degree 3
Node 1: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 0: degree 6
Node 6: degree 5

Now, we will count the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Node 8 - Node 7: Shared connection with Node 4. Triangle <4, 7, 8>
2. Node 8 - Node 4: Shared connection with Node 7. No triangle.
3. Node 5 - Node 6: Shared connection with Node 1. Triangle <1, 5, 6>
4. Node 5 - Node 1: Shared connection with Node 6. No triangle.
5. Node 7 - Node 9: Shared connection with Node 4. Triangle <4, 7, 9>
6. Node 7 - Node 4: Shared connection with Node 9. No triangle.
7. Node 3 - Node 2: Shared connection with Node 0. Triangle <0, 2, 3>
8. Node 3 - Node 0: Shared connection with Node 2. No triangle.
9. Node 2 - Node 6: Shared connection with Node 0. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
10. Node 2 - Node 0: Shared connection with Node 6. No triangle.
11. Node 9 - Node 6: Shared connection with Node 4. Triangle <4, 6, 9>
12. Node 9 - Node 4: Shared connection with Node 6. No triangle.
13. Node 1 - Node 5: Shared connection with Node 6. Triangle <1, 5, 6>
14. Node 1 - Node 6: Shared connection with Node 5. No triangle.
15. Node 4 - Node 6: Shared connection with Node 0. Triangle <0, 4, 6>

Total number of triangles: [6]
Triangles found: <4, 7, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, <4, 7, 9>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 6>
