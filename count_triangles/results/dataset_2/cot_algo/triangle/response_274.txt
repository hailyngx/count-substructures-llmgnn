Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes sorted by degree: [3, 1, 7, 9, 2, 5, 4, 8, 6]
Relabeling according to degree: {3: 0, 1: 1, 7: 2, 9: 3, 2: 4, 5: 5, 4: 6, 8: 7, 6: 8}

Edges processed in Degree-Based Ordering:
(3, 0) - Skip, already processed from (0, 3)
(1, 6) - Skip, (1) is greater labeled than (6)
(7, 6) - Skip, (7) is greater labeled than (6)
