Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 14) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 0) (15, 1) (15, 17) (15, 12) (8, 0) (8, 3) (19, 11) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 9) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 18) (16, 13) (16, 1) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 17) (17, 15) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 7) (11, 19) (11, 6) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 9) (7, 2) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 2) (18, 10) (9, 0) (9, 17) (9, 7) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (6, 12) (6, 11) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Here is the sorted list of vertices:

Vertices: 16, 19, 5, 6, 8, 11, 18, 3, 7, 9, 0, 4, 12, 1, 14, 2, 10, 13, 15, 17

Now, we'll examine the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Vertex 5 connects with vertices 13, 4, 10, and 7. Among these, vertex 13 has more connections.
- Vertex 13 connects with vertices 16, 2, and 14. Among these, only vertex 2 has fewer connections.
- Vertex 1 connects with vertices 15, 16, and 14. Among these, only vertex 15 has fewer connections.
- Vertex 8 connects with vertices 0 and 3. Among these, both have the same degree.
- Vertex 19 connects with vertex 11. Since 11 has fewer connections, we count the edge (19, 11) as a triangle.

Thus, we find the following unique triangles:
<5, 13, 2>, <1, 15, 17>, <8, 0, 3>, and <19, 11, 6>.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
