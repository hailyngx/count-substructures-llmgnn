Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 1) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 4) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 1) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 9) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 2) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 9) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 5) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 19) (16, 14) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 12) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 14) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 7) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 12) (2, 1) (2, 16) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
(3, 12), (3, 8), (15, 1), (10, 11), (10, 18), (10, 5), (11, 10), (11, 18), (11, 6), (8, 3), 
(8, 13), (8, 5), (8, 7), (13, 8), (13, 17), (13, 4), (4, 13), (4, 0), (4, 1), (18, 10), 
(18, 11), (18, 19), (18, 9), (1, 15), (1, 4), (1, 2), (17, 13), (17, 6), (17, 9), (0, 4), 
(0, 16), (0, 5), (16, 0), (16, 2), (16, 19), (16, 14), (19, 18), (19, 16), (19, 12), (9, 18),
(9, 17), (9, 14), (6, 11), (6, 17), (6, 7), (5, 10), (5, 8), (5, 0), (5, 12), (2, 1), (2, 16),
(14, 16), (14, 9), (14, 7), (7, 8), (7, 6), (7, 14), (12, 3), (12, 19), (12, 5)

Now, let's find the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes sorted by their respective degrees (from least to most):
15, 16, 2, 10, 15, 9, 6, 7, 13, 14, 3, 12, 18, 8, 1, 17, 11, 4, 0, 5

Triangles:
Total number of triangles: [32]
Unique triangles found:
<7, 14, 9>, <5, 0, 4>, <6, 17, 9>, <5, 8, 13>, <4, 1, 15>, <9, 14, 16>, <5, 10, 11>, <5, 12, 3>, <5, 12, 19>, <10, 11, 18>, <12, 19, 16>, <3, 8, 13>, <3, 8, 5>, <10, 11, 6>, <8, 7, 14>, <7, 6, 11>, <7, 6, 17>, <6, 11, 18>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 16, 14>, <0, 16, 2>, <16, 19, 12>, <17, 13, 8>, <17, 13, 4>, <17, 6, 11>, <17, 6, 7>, <18, 11, 10>, <18, 11, 6>, <18, 19, 12>, <16, 19, 18>
