Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 15) (16, 3) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 18) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 18) (2, 14) (2, 12) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 18) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 19) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 19) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 9) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 15) (10, 0) (10, 9) (6, 11) (9, 1) (9, 10) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph can be sorted based on their degrees as follows:
Nodes: 16, 2, 6, 4, 5, 3, 16, 1, 0, 10, 9, 7, 14, 12, 17, 8, 18, 11, 13, 15

After sorting, we can count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Considering the edge (11, 3):
Node 3 (degree 4) is less than Node 11 (degree 3), so proceed.
Shared connections: 16
Triangle found: <3, 11, 16>.

2. Considering the edge (11, 13):
Node 13 (degree 4) is less than Node 11 (degree 3), so proceed.
Shared connections: 12, 5
Triangles found: <11, 13, 12>, <11, 13, 5>.

3. Considering the edge (11, 6):
Node 6 (degree 2) is less than Node 11 (degree 3), so proceed.
No shared connections, no triangle formed.

... (similarly for all edges)

Finally, the total number of triangles found in the graph is [13] with the unique triangles being:
<3, 11, 16>, <11, 13, 12>, <11, 13, 5>, <3, 13, 1>, <18, 0, 19>, <18, 0, 7>, <18, 0, 12>, <18, 0, 14>, <18, 0, 2>, <18, 7, 12>, <18, 7, 14>, <18, 7, 2>, <18, 14, 7>.
