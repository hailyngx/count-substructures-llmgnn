Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 2) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 4) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 1) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 5) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 5) (13, 17) (13, 1) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (19, 14) (19, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 6) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 3) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 0) (5, 12) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 6) (14, 4) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 4) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
- 0: 5, 6
- 1: 13, 4, 18
- 2: 4, 7, 11
- 3: 6, 7, 9, 16
- 4: 1, 2, 14, 16, 17
- 5: 0, 12, 15, 16
- 6: 0, 3, 12, 14
- 7: 2, 3, 18
- 9: 3, 11, 14
- 10: 11, 17
- 11: 2, 9, 10
- 12: 5, 6, 19
- 13: 1, 17
- 14: 4, 6, 9, 19
- 15: 5, 17, 18
- 16: 3, 4, 5
- 17: 10, 13, 15, 4
- 18: 1, 7, 15
- 19: 12, 14

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes by degree: 
- 0 (degree 2): 5, 6
- 1 (degree 3): 13, 4, 18
- 3 (degree 4): 6, 7, 9, 16
- 7 (degree 3): 2, 3, 18
- 9 (degree 3): 3, 11, 14
- 10 (degree 2): 11, 17
- 2 (degree 3): 4, 7, 11
- 4 (degree 5): 1, 2, 14, 16, 17
- 5 (degree 4): 0, 12, 15, 16
- 6 (degree 4): 0, 3, 12, 14
- 11 (degree 3): 2, 9, 10
- 12 (degree 3): 5, 6, 19
- 13 (degree 2): 1, 17
- 14 (degree 4): 4, 6, 9, 19
- 15 (degree 3): 5, 17, 18
- 16 (degree 3): 3, 4, 5
- 17 (degree 4): 10, 13, 15, 4
- 18 (degree 3): 1, 7, 15
- 19 (degree 2): 12, 14

Now, we will list the triangles:

Triangles: <4, 14, 18>, <4, 14, 19>, <4, 16, 5>, <5, 6, 14>, <5, 12, 6>, <11, 2, 4>, <15, 5, 17>

Finally, the total number of triangles is [7].
