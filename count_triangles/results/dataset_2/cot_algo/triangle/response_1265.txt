Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 8) (15, 27) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 15) (27, 16) (27, 23) (25, 3) (25, 15) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 16) (26, 19) (26, 8) (26, 7) (19, 26) (19, 24) (19, 6) (19, 9) (24, 19) (24, 14) (24, 2) (7, 26) (7, 20) (7, 23) (7, 2) (13, 4) (13, 29) (13, 0) (17, 0) (17, 12) (4, 13) (4, 22) (4, 5) (12, 17) (12, 20) (6, 1) (6, 19) (6, 11) (22, 4) (22, 16) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 24) (14, 11) (14, 20) (21, 0) (21, 9) (21, 5) (21, 29) (2, 1) (2, 24) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 28) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 14) (0, 13) (0, 17) (0, 21) (9, 19) (9, 21) (9, 2) (9, 10) (16, 27) (16, 1) (16, 22) (16, 29) (18, 10) (18, 29) (5, 4) (5, 21) (5, 10) (29, 15) (29, 13) (29, 21) (29, 16) (29, 18) (10, 9) (10, 18) (10, 5) (10, 28) (8, 3) (8, 26) (28, 2) (28, 10) (23, 27) (23, 7) 

Response:
After constructing the graph with the provided nodes and edges, we sort the vertices based on their degree:

Sorted vertices:
(3) - degree: 2
(5) - degree: 3
(8) - degree: 2
(17) - degree: 2
(20) - degree: 4
(21) - degree: 4
(23) - degree: 2
(28) - degree: 2
(10) - degree: 4
(18) - degree: 2
(0) - degree: 3
(13) - degree: 3
(4) - degree: 3
(22) - degree: 2
(11) - degree: 3
(14) - degree: 3
(6) - degree: 3
(1) - degree: 3
(16) - degree: 4
(29) - degree: 5
(12) - degree: 2
(9) - degree: 4
(2) - degree: 5
(7) - degree: 3
(24) - degree: 3
(19) - degree: 4
(26) - degree: 3
(15) - degree: 4
(27) - degree: 3
(25) - degree: 2

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
