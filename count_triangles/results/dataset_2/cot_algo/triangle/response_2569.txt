Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (1, 0) (1, 18) (3, 16) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 17) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 15) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 17) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 17) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 15) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 18) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 15) (14, 7) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 13) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 16) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 19) (17, 11) (18, 6) (18, 1) (18, 7) (18, 16) (18, 15) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections and relabeling them accordingly. 

The vertices and their respective degrees in the given graph are as follows:

(0: 2), (1: 2), (2: 4), (3: 1), (5: 4), (6: 4), (7: 4), (8: 3), (9: 2), (10: 4), (11: 4), (12: 3), (13: 4), (14: 1), (15: 5), (16: 3), (17: 4), (18: 5), (19: 3)

Now we can list the edges in increasing order of vertex labels, considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. These edges can potentially form triangles:

(0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 18), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 13), (2, 5), (6, 7), (6, 18), (6, 9), (7, 10), (7, 14), (7, 18), (8, 10), (8, 17), (8, 19), (10, 16), (11, 12), (11, 13), (11, 15)

Now, by checking for shared connections between the vertices of these edges, we find the triangles:

<[2, 5, 13]>, <[6, 7, 18]>, <[6, 9, 18]>, <[6, 7, 10]>

Thus, there are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph [4].
