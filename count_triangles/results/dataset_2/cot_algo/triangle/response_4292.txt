Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 10) (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 13) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 7) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 1) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 6) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 17) (18, 19) (18, 8) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 13) (8, 16) (8, 18) (2, 9) (2, 13) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 4) (17, 11) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 4) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 2) (13, 6) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: (7, 5), (14, 0), (17, 0), (1, 0)
- 1: (4, 1), (10, 1), (0, 1)
- 2: (9, 2), (13, 2)
- 3: (4, 3), (12, 3), (13, 3)
- 4: (3, 4), (1, 4), (17, 4)
- 5: (9, 5), (7, 5)
- 6: (12, 6), (13, 6)
- 7: (5, 7), (15, 7), (0, 7)
- 8: (16, 8), (18, 8)
- 9: (17, 9), (2, 9), (13, 9), (5, 9)
- 10: (16, 10), (1, 10), (11, 10)
- 11: (12, 11), (17, 11), (14, 11), (16, 11), (10, 11)
- 12: (6, 12), (3, 12), (11, 12)
- 13: (9, 13), (3, 13), (19, 13), (2, 13), (6, 13)
- 14: (11, 14), (0, 14)
- 15: (7, 15)
- 16: (19, 16), (11, 16), (8, 16), (10, 16)
- 17: (4, 17), (0, 17), (13, 17), (11, 17)
- 18: (19, 18), (8, 18)
- 19: (16, 19), (13, 19), (18, 19)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):
5, 6, 15, 18, 2, 12, 19, 8, 16, 10, 1, 14, 4, 3, 7, 0, 17, 9, 11, 13

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles: [Total number of triangles: 8]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 7, 17>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 10>
<1, 10, 16>
<4, 13, 17>
<4, 1, 10>
<9, 13, 17>
<13, 9, 17>
