Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: [(0, 17), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 12), (1, 22), (1, 18), (1, 24), (1, 19), (2, 18), (3, 25), (3, 7), (4, 8), (4, 11), (5, 8), (5, 29), (5, 11), (5, 0), (6, 7), (6, 16), (6, 14), (7, 25), (7, 29), (7, 6), (8, 23), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 21), (8, 27), (9, 23), (9, 0), (10, 29), (10, 27), (10, 19), (11, 23), (11, 4), (11, 5), (12, 22), (12, 17), (12, 24), (12, 26), (12, 0), (13, 22), (14, 23), (14, 21), (14, 6), (15, 18), (15, 16), (15, 26), (16, 23), (16, 6), (16, 15), (17, 29), (17, 0), (17, 12), (18, 2), (18, 15), (18, 1), (19, 10), (19, 1), (19, 20), (20, 28), (20, 19), (21, 8), (21, 28), (21, 14), (22, 13), (22, 12), (22, 25), (22, 1), (23, 8), (23, 11), (23, 14), (23, 16), (23, 9), (24, 12), (24, 1), (25, 22), (25, 3), (25, 7), (25, 27), (26, 15), (26, 12), (27, 25), (27, 8), (27, 10), (28, 21), (28, 20), (29, 17), (29, 7), (29, 5), (29, 10)]

Next, we will calculate the degree of each node:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 5
Node 9: degree 2
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 5
Node 13: degree 1
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 3
Node 16: degree 3
Node 17: degree 3
Node 18: degree 4
Node 19: degree 3
Node 20: degree 2
Node 21: degree 3
Node 22: degree 4
Node 23: degree 5
Node 24: degree 2
Node 25: degree 4
Node 26: degree 2
Node 27: degree 3
Node 28: degree 2
Node 29: degree 4

Now we will count the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method. After counting, the total number of triangles is [44].
