Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The vertices based on the Degree-Based Ordering method are:
Vertices: 8, 6, 1, 9, 7, 3, 2, 4, 0, 5

The total number of triangles is [7].
Unique triangles found are: 
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 2, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 7>
