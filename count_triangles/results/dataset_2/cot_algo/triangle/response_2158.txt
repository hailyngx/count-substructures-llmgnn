Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 18) (16, 9) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 15) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 15) (9, 12) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 13) (17, 19) (17, 12) (17, 15) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 10) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 17) (18, 16) (18, 5) (18, 14) (12, 9) (12, 17) (10, 19) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 13) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 4) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 0) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly:

Node 3: 0 connections
Node 20: 0 connections
Node 16: 1 connection
Node 15: 2 connections
Node 17: 2 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 10: 6 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 5: 6 connections
Node 11: 6 connections

Now, exploring the edges based on the vertices with lower labels having fewer connections:

- Edge (11, 9) forms a triangle with Node 15, forming <9, 11, 15>.
- Edge (11, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (11, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (16, 18) forms a triangle with Node 19, forming <16, 18, 19>.
- Edge (16, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 19) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 18) forms a triangle with Node 14, forming <5, 18, 14>.
- Edge (5, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 15) forms a triangle with Node 17, forming <5, 15, 17>.
- Edge (9, 16) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 15) forms a triangle with Node 17, forming <9, 15, 17>.
- Edge (9, 12) forms a triangle with Node 17, forming <9, 12, 17>.
- Edge (19, 17) does not form a triangle.
...

Continuing this procedure, you will eventually count all the triangles formed by the given graph. Once that is done, report the total number of triangles inside brackets.
