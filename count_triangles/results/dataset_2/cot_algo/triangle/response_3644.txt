Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 18) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 7) (18, 8) (0, 17) (0, 9) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 19) (5, 3) (5, 10) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 15) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 7) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 9) (7, 2) (7, 15) (7, 16) (16, 12) (16, 7) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 12) (19, 1) (19, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their degree, from least to most connections:
```
Vertex 11: 0 connections
Vertex 5: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 19: 2 connections
Vertex 16: 2 connections
Vertex 18: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 17: 3 connections
Vertex 14: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 13: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 15: 4 connections
Vertex 10: 5 connections
Vertex 12: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
```

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly: Starting from 0 to 19 in increasing order of degree.

3. Check each edge to count triangles:
- (14, 17): Check connections among 14 and 17, we find a triangle <14, 17, 6>.
- (14, 6): No triangles.
- (14, 9): No triangles.
- (17, 1): Check connections among 17 and 1, we find a triangle <17, 1, 4>.
- (17, 6): No triangles.
- (17, 0): No triangles.
- (4, 8): Check connections among 4 and 8, we find a triangle <4, 8, 2>.
- (4, 12): No triangles.
- (8, 2): Check connections among 8 and 2, we find a triangle <8, 2, 10>.
- (8, 10): No new triangles (already counted above).
- (2, 10): No new triangles (already counted above).
- (2, 3): Check connections among 2 and 3, we find a triangle <2, 3, 5>.
- (18, 8): No triangles.
- (0, 17): No triangles.
- (0, 9): No triangles.
- (1, 4): No new triangles (already counted above).
- (1, 6): No triangles.
- (1, 19): No triangles.
- (5, 3): No triangles.
- (5, 10): No new triangles (already counted above).
- (13, 12): No triangles.
- (13, 15): No triangles.
- (15, 7): No triangles.
- (12, 16): No triangles.
- (7, 16): No triangles.
- (6, 19): No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [4]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 4.
