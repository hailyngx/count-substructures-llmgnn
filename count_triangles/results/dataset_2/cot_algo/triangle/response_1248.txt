Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 15) (22, 13) (22, 10) (22, 21) (22, 8) (5, 13) (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 21) (4, 23) (4, 0) (4, 24) (7, 18) (7, 1) (3, 13) (3, 25) (3, 23) (25, 3) (25, 16) (25, 29) (21, 22) (21, 9) (0, 4) (0, 27) (0, 18) (0, 26) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 6) (6, 27) (6, 29) (26, 13) (26, 0) (26, 18) (26, 2) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 27) (18, 26) (8, 22) (8, 9) (8, 28) (8, 15) (20, 29) (29, 25) (29, 6) (29, 20) (29, 24) (10, 22) (10, 1) (10, 14) (15, 13) (15, 8) (15, 23) (15, 28) (16, 25) (16, 2) (16, 14) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 12) (28, 8) (28, 15) (11, 19) (11, 2) (24, 4) (24, 29) (24, 2) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 17) (14, 10) (14, 16) (2, 26) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 24) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 15) (12, 1) (12, 17) (17, 19) (17, 12) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their connections are:
Vertex 29 has 4 connections.
Vertices 12, 13, 20, 21, 22, 28 have 2 connections each.
Vertices 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11 have 3 connections each.
Vertices 2, 3, 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 have 4 connections each.
Vertices 5, 18 have 5 connections each.
Vertex 17 has 2 connections.

Based on these connections, the triangles in the graph can be counted as follows:
[96]
<0, 4, 26>, <0, 18, 26>, <1, 10, 14>, <2, 11, 16>, <2, 16, 24>, <2, 24, 29>, <3, 15, 23>, <3, 25, 29>, <4, 23, 24>, <7, 18, 27>, <8, 9, 21>, <13, 15, 28>, <13, 22, 21>, <18, 26, 27>, <19, 11, 17>, <25, 3, 16>
