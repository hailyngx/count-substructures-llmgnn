Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 5) (0, 16) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 9) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 5) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 18) (2, 16) (2, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 17) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 6) (13, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 1) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 18) (18, 1) (18, 12) (19, 10) (19, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
(0, 16), (1, 5), (1, 13), (1, 18), (2, 6), (2, 16), (3, 7), (3, 9), (3, 14), (4, 7), 
(4, 10), (4, 14), (5, 10), (5, 11), (5, 14), (6, 8), (6, 13), (6, 17), (7, 9), (7, 10), 
(7, 14), (8, 10), (8, 6), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 17), (10, 4), (10, 5), (10, 8), (10, 19), 
(11, 5), (11, 10), (11, 17), (12, 15), (12, 17), (12, 18), (13, 1), (13, 6), (14, 3), 
(14, 4), (14, 5), (14, 16), (15, 3), (15, 12), (16, 0), (16, 2), (16, 14), (17, 6), 
(17, 9), (17, 11), (17, 12), (18, 1), (18, 12), (19, 1), (19, 10)

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degree:

Degree 1: {0, 13, 15, 18, 19}
Degree 2: {2, 4, 8, 16}
Degree 3: {1, 7, 9, 12}
Degree 4: {3, 6, 17}
Degree 5: {5, 14}
Degree 6: {10}
Degree 7: {11}

Now, let's count the triangles:
- (4, 10) shares node 4 with (4, 7) and shares node 10 with (5, 10) forming triangle <4, 10, 5>.
- (7, 10) shares node 7 with (3, 7) and shares node 10 with (4, 10) forming triangle <7, 10, 4>.
- (7, 4) shares node 7 with (7, 3) and shares node 4 with (4, 7) forming triangle <7, 4, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [3].
