Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 1) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 10) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 2) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices arranged in ascending order of degree:
```
1: 3 connections
10: 3 connections
5: 3 connections
7: 3 connections
0: 4 connections
12: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
4: 4 connections
11: 4 connections
14: 6 connections
13: 5 connections
6: 5 connections
8: 6 connections
9: 6 connections
3: 5 connections
```

Now, we will list the unique triangles found:

1. <3, 12, 14>
2. <2, 7, 10>
3. <3, 9, 14>
4. <1, 2, 7>
5. <1, 12, 14>
6. <0, 11, 8>
7. <4, 8, 13>
8. <5, 6, 9>
9. <5, 8, 14>
10. <6, 9, 13>
11. <6, 8, 11>
12. <7, 10, 2>
13. <9, 13, 6>
14. <9, 13, 8>
15. <10, 14, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
