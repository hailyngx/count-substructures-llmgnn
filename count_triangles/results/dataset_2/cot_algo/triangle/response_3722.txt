Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 27) (26, 16) (15, 27) (15, 4) (27, 9) (27, 15) (27, 19) (2, 22) (2, 1) (29, 17) (29, 8) (29, 14) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 25) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 21) (23, 14) (17, 29) (17, 10) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 29) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 12) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 19) (20, 0) (20, 14) (20, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 24) (6, 4) (6, 20) (6, 5) (6, 18) (25, 11) (25, 24) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 3) (24, 5) (24, 25) (24, 19) (7, 16) (7, 28) (16, 26) (16, 7) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 18) (19, 27) (19, 22) (19, 0) (19, 24) (19, 1) (14, 29) (14, 11) (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 3) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 7) (28, 1) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 18) (1, 2) (1, 19) (1, 28) (21, 22) (21, 18) (18, 6) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 21) 

Response:
The graph described has 30 nodes and 90 edges. 

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

Nodes in decreasing order of degrees: {27, 14, 4, 8, 10, 11, 19, 28, 6, 29, 12, 16, 1, 24, 5, 18, 2, 22, 0, 20, 13, 15, 3, 17, 26, 7, 23, 21, 9, 25}

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the edges in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [82]
