Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- 0: {9, 3}
- 1: {5, 6, 3, 4, 7}
- 2: {4}
- 3: {5, 6, 1, 0}
- 4: {6, 1, 7, 8, 2}
- 5: {9, 6, 8, 1, 3, 7}
- 6: {5, 1, 3, 4, 8}
- 7: {5, 9, 1, 4}
- 8: {5, 9, 6, 4}
- 9: {5, 8, 7, 0}

To find the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we need to sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes sorted by degree (ascending order): {2, 0, 7, 9, 8, 4, 3, 6, 1, 5}

Using the sorted order, we will count the number of triangles:

- Triangles: [12]
- Unique triangles: <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 6, 5>, <1, 6, 3>, <1, 6, 4>, <3, 9, 5>, <3, 9, 6>, <3, 1, 5>, <4, 9, 8>, <4, 9, 5>, <4, 6, 8>
