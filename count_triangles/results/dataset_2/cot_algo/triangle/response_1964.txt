Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Vertices: 2, 1, 9, 6, 8, 3, 4, 7, 0, 5

Now, let's relabel the vertices:  
Vertex 2 -> 0 connections -> relabel as 0  
Vertex 1 -> 1 connection -> relabel as 1  
Vertex 9 -> 2 connections -> relabel as 2  
Vertex 6 -> 3 connections -> relabel as 3  
Vertex 8 -> 4 connections -> relabel as 4  
Vertex 3 -> 4 connections -> relabel as 5  
Vertex 4 -> 5 connections -> relabel as 6  
Vertex 7 -> 5 connections -> relabel as 7  
Vertex 0 -> 6 connections -> relabel as 8  
Vertex 5 -> 7 connections -> relabel as 9  

Now, we will analyze the edges based on the relabeled vertices, only taking into consideration cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
