Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 13) (9, 18) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 24) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 8) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 15) (22, 17) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 1) (23, 27) (0, 8) (0, 13) (27, 23) (27, 29) (27, 3) (27, 20) (17, 22) (17, 29) (29, 27) (29, 17) (29, 5) (29, 21) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 12) (26, 19) (26, 14) (26, 11) (26, 16) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 10) (21, 29) (21, 3) (14, 9) (14, 22) (14, 26) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 23) (1, 8) (2, 12) (2, 20) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 25) (18, 9) (18, 15) (15, 22) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 28) (25, 23) (25, 12) (25, 16) (11, 19) (11, 26) (11, 15) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (24, 4) (24, 7) (24, 12) (16, 26) (16, 25) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 20) (20, 27) (20, 2) (20, 8) (20, 5) (28, 15) (28, 5) (5, 29) (5, 20) (5, 28) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the given nodes and edges. Let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted based on connections from least to most:
Vertices: [0, 2, 18, 10, 7, 26, 5, 4, 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 1, 3, 6, 11, 12, 13, 20, 21, 23, 25, 27, 28, 29, 22, 24]

Count of triangles: [22]

Unique triangles found:
