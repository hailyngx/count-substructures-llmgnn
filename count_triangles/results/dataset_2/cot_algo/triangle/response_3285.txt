Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 7) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 2) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 1) (14, 11) (14, 7) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 14) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 8, 5, 4, 7, 6, 14, 9, 10, 1, 12, 3, 2, 11, 13

Calculating the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Triangles: [38]
Unique triangles: <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 13>, <0, 8, 13>, <0, 13, 9>, <1, 9, 13>, <1, 9, 12>, <1, 9, 10>, <1, 13, 12>, <1, 12, 9>, <2, 10, 1>, <2, 10, 4>, <2, 10, 5>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 11>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 0>, <3, 11, 13>, <3, 11, 12>, <3, 11, 14>, <3, 11, 5>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 14>, <3, 7, 2>, <4, 6, 10>, <4, 6, 5>, <4, 5, 11>, <5, 11, 14>, <5, 11, 1>, <5, 11, 12>, <6, 9, 13>, <7, 8, 14>, <7, 8, 3>, <7, 8, 2>, <9, 12, 11>, <9, 12, 2>, <10, 1, 12>, <11, 13, 1>
