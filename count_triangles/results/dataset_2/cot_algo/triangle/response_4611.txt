Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (17, 8) (17, 7) (5, 15) (5, 0) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 1) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 4) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (19, 8) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 12) (8, 1) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 16) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 15) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 1) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 13) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (13, 16) (13, 7) (13, 14) (15, 5) (15, 2) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 13) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices from least connections to most connections is as follows:
Vertices: 19, 5, 6, 18, 9, 17, 4, 15, 2, 3, 16, 11, 1, 12, 0, 7, 14, 8, 10, 13

Based on the given edges and the degree-based ordering, we can count the triangles and list them below:
Total number of triangles: [14]
Unique triangles: <1, 8, 11>, <2, 3, 7>, <4, 8, 12>, <4, 8, 1>, <5, 15, 0>, <7, 13, 14>, <7, 13, 16>, <7, 10, 14>, <9, 6, 18>, <9, 18, 4>, <9, 18, 6>, <11, 3, 1>, <11, 3, 7>, <12, 4, 8>
