Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Edges:
- 0: [1, 8]
- 1: [0, 3, 4, 9]
- 2: [3, 4, 5, 7, 9]
- 3: [1, 2, 6, 7, 8]
- 4: [1, 2, 5, 8, 9]
- 5: [2, 4, 6, 9]
- 6: [3, 5, 7]
- 7: [2, 3, 6, 8]
- 8: [0, 3, 4, 7, 9]
- 9: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]

Now, let's count the number of triangles and list them as unique triangles:

Triangles: [0]

[3, 4, 8]
[2, 4, 9]
[3, 7, 8]

Total number of triangles: [4]
