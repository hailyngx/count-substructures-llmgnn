Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 10) (17, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 15) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 13) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 12) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (1, 2) (1, 11) (6, 8) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 14) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 16) (19, 10) (19, 15) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 9) (3, 17) (3, 13) (5, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 16) (16, 15) (16, 9) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections and relabeling them accordingly.

The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is as follows:
Vertex 5 has 0 connections
Vertex 6 has 0 connections
Vertices 1, 7, 17, and 2 have 1 connection each
Vertices 3, 16, and 18 have 2 connections each
Vertices 0, 8, 12, and 14 have 4 connections each
Vertices 11 and 13 have 5 connections each
Vertices 4 and 19 have 6 connections each
Vertices 9 and 10 have 7 connections each
Vertex 15 has 8 connections

Now, we will check for triangles formed by the edges:

<0, 7, 12>
<0, 7, 18>
<0, 12, 15>
<0, 15, 18>
<4, 8, 14>
<4, 8, 11>
<4, 8, 15>
<4, 11, 15>
<8, 11, 15>
<9, 10, 16>

[Number of triangles: 10]
