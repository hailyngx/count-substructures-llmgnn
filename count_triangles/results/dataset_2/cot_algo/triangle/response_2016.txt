Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 29) (5, 27) (9, 0) (9, 19) (0, 9) (0, 23) (27, 5) (27, 24) (1, 21) (1, 6) (1, 29) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 3) (21, 18) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 28) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 22) (7, 17) (22, 7) (22, 14) (23, 0) (23, 8) (23, 6) (8, 4) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 26) (15, 13) (15, 17) (20, 18) (20, 2) (12, 5) (12, 28) (28, 21) (28, 4) (28, 12) (28, 26) (28, 2) (24, 27) (24, 6) (26, 8) (26, 28) (26, 10) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 15) (17, 3) (25, 2) (3, 21) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 14) (16, 13) (6, 1) (6, 23) (6, 24) (19, 9) (19, 13) (10, 8) (10, 26) (10, 2) (10, 14) (29, 5) (29, 1) (29, 8) (29, 13) (29, 11) (11, 29) (14, 22) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 2) (18, 21) (18, 20) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 19) (13, 29) (2, 20) (2, 28) (2, 25) (2, 10) (2, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order to relabel them for counting triangles. Let's rearrange the node labels and count the triangles in the graph.

After relabeling the vertices based on their degree:
Nodes: 
0 (degree 2)
1 (degree 3)
2 (degree 5)
3 (degree 4)
4 (degree 4)
5 (degree 3)
6 (degree 3)
7 (degree 4)
8 (degree 5)
9 (degree 2)
10 (degree 4)
11 (degree 1)
12 (degree 2)
13 (degree 4)
14 (degree 4)
15 (degree 2)
