Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 24) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 14) (26, 18) (26, 7) (26, 12) (5, 9) (5, 17) (13, 25) (13, 16) (13, 29) (13, 6) (22, 23) (22, 25) (22, 1) (23, 22) (23, 4) (23, 16) (4, 23) (4, 8) (4, 27) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 12) (21, 28) (21, 11) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 7) (28, 2) (3, 11) (11, 21) (11, 3) (11, 17) (0, 28) (0, 29) (7, 26) (7, 28) (1, 22) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 19) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 29) (20, 29) (20, 18) (20, 10) (29, 13) (29, 0) (29, 15) (29, 20) (29, 18) (10, 20) (27, 9) (27, 4) (12, 26) (12, 8) (12, 6) (14, 26) (6, 13) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 24) (24, 9) (24, 6) (24, 19) (18, 26) (18, 20) (18, 29) (2, 4) (2, 28) (2, 16) (2, 17) (25, 13) (25, 22) (16, 13) (16, 23) (16, 1) (16, 2) (16, 17) (17, 5) (17, 11) (17, 2) (17, 16) (19, 1) (19, 24) 

Response:
The given graph has been constructed with 30 nodes and 90 edges. 

Now let's count the total number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort vertices by their degrees from least to most:
```
Nodes: 18 20 10 0 3 21 8 1 15 2 5 22 23 14 19 13 16 25 4 6 7 12 26 27 29 11 17 24 28 9
Degrees: 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 7
```

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
```
Nodes: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29
Degrees: 2 4 4 2 4 4 4 4 2 4 1 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 5 2 1 2 4 4 4 5 2 4 2 4
```

3. Count the triangles:
```
Total number of triangles: [28]
