Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 11) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 15) (5, 0) (5, 3) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 15) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 15) (7, 16) (7, 6) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 7) (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 9) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 13) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (9, 3) (9, 10) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 12) (1, 19) (1, 4) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 12) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then, the vertices are relabeled accordingly. 

After relabeling the vertices, the new labels and their corresponding connections are as follows:
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 18: 3 connections
- Node 15: 3 connections
- Node 19: 4 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 10: 4 connections
- Node 14: 4 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 16: 4 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 12: 4 connections
- Node 3: 5 connections
- Node 17: 5 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 11: 6 connections
- Node 13: 6 connections

Following the method, we can start counting triangles by examining each edge. 
The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [12], and the unique triangles found are:
<2, 8, 16>
<1, 4, 10>
<0, 3, 5>
<8, 12, 15>
<3, 13, 17>
<0, 4, 15>
<6, 13, 17>
<1, 10, 13>
<11, 12, 17>
<4, 12, 15>
<2, 16, 17>
<6, 7, 17>
