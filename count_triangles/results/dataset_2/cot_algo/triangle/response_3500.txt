Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method works as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
   - Node 4: degree 2
   - Node 9: degree 3
   - Node 5: degree 4
   - Node 6: degree 3
   - Node 7: degree 4
   - Node 8: degree 4
   - Node 0: degree 4
   - Node 3: degree 5
   - Node 2: degree 6
   - Node 1: degree 6

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   - Node 4 (Degree 2) -> Node 0
   - Node 9 (Degree 3) -> Node 1
   - Node 5 (Degree 4) -> Node 2
   - Node 6 (Degree 3) -> Node 3
   - Node 7 (Degree 4) -> Node 4
   - Node 8 (Degree 4) -> Node 5
   - Node 0 (Degree 4) -> Node 6
   - Node 3 (Degree 5) -> Node 7
   - Node 2 (Degree 6) -> Node 8
   - Node 1 (Degree 6) -> Node 9

3. Process the edges:
- (5, 9): Node 2 - Node 1 [Shared connection: Node 8] -> Triangle <2, 1, 8>
- (5, 2): Node 2 - Node 8 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (5, 8): Node 2 - Node 5 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (5, 1): Node 2 - Node 9 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (9, 6): Node 1 - Node 3 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (9, 1): Node 1 - Node 9 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (6, 3): Node 3 - Node 7 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (6, 2): Node 3 - Node 8 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (4, 2): Node 0 - Node 8 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (4, 3): Node 0 - Node 7 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (7, 0): Node 4 - Node 6 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (7, 3): Node 4 - Node 7 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (7, 2): Node 4 - Node 8 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (7, 1): Node 4 - Node 9 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (1, 7): Node 9 - Node 4 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (1, 3): Node 9 - Node 7 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (1, 8): Node 9 - Node 5 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (3, 6): Node 7 - Node 3 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (3, 4): Node 7 - Node 0 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (2, 5): Node 8 - Node 2 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (2, 6): Node 8 - Node 3 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (2, 4): Node 8 - Node 0 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (2, 7): Node 8 - Node 4 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (2, 8): Node 8 - Node 5 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (8, 5): Node 5 - Node 2 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (8, 1): Node 5 - Node 9 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (8, 2): Node 5 - Node 8 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (8, 0): Node 5 - Node 6 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (0, 7): Node 6 - Node 4 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (0, 3): Node 6 - Node 7 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (0, 2): Node 6 - Node 8 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle
- (0, 8): Node 6 - Node 5 [Shared connection: None] -> No triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
The unique triangle found is <2, 1, 8>.
