Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 1: 4 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections

The edges sorted by the lowest labeled vertex with fewer connections are as follows:
(1, 4), (0, 2), (0, 5), (4, 7), (7, 4), (8, 1), (1, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (2, 0), (7, 5), (9, 8), (3, 1), (3, 7), (6, 3), (6, 9), (9, 6), (9, 8), (8, 5), (8, 2), (3, 1), (3, 7), (7, 4), (7, 6), (6, 3), (6, 7), (7, 3), (7, 5), (6, 3), (6, 2), (0, 5), (0, 6), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 9), (9, 3), (9, 6)

By checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge, we find the total number of triangles to be [6]. 

The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 7>.
