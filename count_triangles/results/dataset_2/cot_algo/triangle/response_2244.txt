Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 1) (1, 16) (1, 7) (1, 10) (3, 11) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 15) (13, 19) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 18) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 9) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 15) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 9) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 19) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 5) (2, 14) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 9) (5, 16) (5, 3) (5, 14) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 6) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
- Node 0: 4, 6, 8, 9, 19
- Node 1: 7, 10, 16
- Node 2: 14
- Node 3: 5, 11
- Node 4: 0, 6, 8
- Node 5: 3, 5, 14, 16
- Node 6: 4, 10, 14, 19
- Node 7: 1, 7, 12, 19
- Node 8: 4, 8, 14, 15
- Node 9: 0, 9, 15, 18
- Node 10: 1, 6, 10, 17, 19
- Node 11: 3, 11, 15, 16
- Node 12: 7, 12, 17, 18
- Node 13: 19
- Node 14: 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 15: 8, 9, 11, 15
- Node 16: 1, 5, 11, 16
- Node 17: 10, 12, 17, 18
- Node 18: 9, 12, 17, 18
- Node 19: 0, 6, 7, 10, 13, 19

Now, let's count the number of triangles by applying the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by degree:
- Vertex 2 (Degree 1)
- Vertex 13 (Degree 1)
- Vertex 0 (Degree 5)
- Vertex 2 (Degree 1)
- Vertex 3 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 13 (Degree 1)
- Vertex 1 (Degree 3)
- Vertex 4 (Degree 3)
- Vertex 5 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 9 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 7 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 14 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 6 (Degree 5)
- Vertex 8 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 10 (Degree 5)
- Vertex 12 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 16 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 17 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 18 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 19 (Degree 6)

Now, we count the triangles and find the total number of triangles: [<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 19>, <0, 8, 15>, <4, 6, 19>, <4, 8, 15>, <6, 7, 19>, <6, 10, 19>, <6, 14, 19>, <7, 10, 19>, <8, 14, 15>, <10, 12, 17>, <10, 12, 18>, <10, 17, 18>, <12, 17, 18>, <14, 5, 16>, <14, 5, 3>, <15, 9, 0>, <15, 9, 18>, <16, 5, 3>, <17, 12, 18>] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [21].
