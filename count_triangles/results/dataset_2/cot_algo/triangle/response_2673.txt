Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is as follows:
Vertices: 3, 6, 2, 1, 9, 7, 8, 0, 5, 4

Now, calculating the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- For edge (1, 3): No triangles formed.
- For edge (1, 9): No triangles formed.
- For edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
- For edge (3, 5): No triangles formed.
- For edge (4, 8): No triangles formed.
- For edge (4, 9): Triangle formed: <4, 9, 8>.
- For edge (4, 0): Triangle formed: <4, 0, 6>.
- For edge (4, 5): Triangle formed: <4, 5, 0>.
- For edge (4, 6): Triangle formed: <4, 6, 0>.
- For edge (4, 2): Triangle formed: <4, 2, 5>.
- For edge (8, 0): Triangle formed: <8, 0, 7>.
- For edge (8, 7): No triangles formed.
- For edge (5, 3): No triangles formed.
- For edge (5, 6): No triangles formed.
- For edge (5, 2): Triangle formed: <5, 2, 4>.
- For edge (5, 0): Triangle formed: <5, 0, 6>.
- For edge (5, 7): No triangles formed.
- For edge (6, 0): No triangles formed.
- For edge (7, 1): No triangles formed.
- For edge (7, 8): No triangles formed.
- For edge (7, 2): Triangle formed: <7, 2, 5>.
- For edge (7, 9): No triangles formed.
- For edge (2, 9): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [7]
Triangles found: <4, 9, 8>, <4, 0, 6>, <4, 5, 0>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 2, 5>, <8, 0, 7>, <5, 2, 4>
