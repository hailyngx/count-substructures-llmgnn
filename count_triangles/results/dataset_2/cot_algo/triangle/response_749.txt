Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Vertices sorted by number of connections:
Node 5 -> Degree 3
Node 9 -> Degree 3
Node 6 -> Degree 3
Node 7 -> Degree 2
Node 12 -> Degree 3
Node 1 -> Degree 3
Node 17 -> Degree 1
Node 0 -> Degree 4
Node 10 -> Degree 2
Node 15 -> Degree 3
Node 16 -> Degree 2
Node 2 -> Degree 5
Node 19 -> Degree 5
Node 3 -> Degree 3
Node 14 -> Degree 4
Node 8 -> Degree 2
Node 18 -> Degree 3
Node 11 -> Degree 4
Node 4 -> Degree 2
Node 13 -> Degree 4

Calculating the triangles:
