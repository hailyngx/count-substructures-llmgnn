Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 8) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 7) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 7) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 5) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order. The vertices are then relabeled accordingly. 

After relabeling the vertices, the new edge list and connections are as follows:
1. Node 0 has degree 3 and is relabeled as vertex 0.
2. Node 4 has degree 4 and is relabeled as vertex 1.
3. Node 13 has degree 4 and is relabeled as vertex 2.
4. Node 12 has degree 3 and is relabeled as vertex 3.
5. Node 7 has degree 4 and is relabeled as vertex 4.
6. Node 5 has degree 4 and is relabeled as vertex 5.
7. Node 2 has degree 4 and is relabeled as vertex 6.
8. Node 10 has degree 4 and is relabeled as vertex 7.
9. Node 1 has degree 4 and is relabeled as vertex 8.
10. Node 11 has degree 3 and is relabeled as vertex 9.
11. Node 8 has degree 6 and is relabeled as vertex 10.
12. Node 3 has degree 5 and is relabeled as vertex 11.
13. Node 9 has degree 6 and is relabeled as vertex 12.
14. Node 6 has degree 5 and is relabeled as vertex 13.
15. Node 14 has degree 4 and is relabeled as vertex 14.

Triangles are then counted using the mentioned method. The total number of triangles found in the graph is [15]. The unique triangles found are <1, 8, 10>, <1, 2, 5>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 8, 10>, <5, 7, 13>, <8, 10, 11>, <8, 10, 1>, <8, 10, 2>, <8, 11, 1>, <8, 11, 2>, <8, 4, 5>, <8, 4, 2>, <8, 5, 7>, <9, 6, 14>.
