Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:  

Node 7 (Degree 2)  
Node 2 (Degree 3)  
Node 0 (Degree 3)  
Node 6 (Degree 4)  
Node 1 (Degree 4)  
Node 3 (Degree 4)  
Node 5 (Degree 4)  
Node 8 (Degree 6)  
Node 4 (Degree 6)  
Node 9 (Degree 7)  

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles and find the unique triangles: 

[Total number of triangles: 8] 
Unique triangles: 
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
