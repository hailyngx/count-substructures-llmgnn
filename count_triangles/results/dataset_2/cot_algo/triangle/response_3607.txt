Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 16) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 5) (7, 17) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 5) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 13) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 18) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 17) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 17) (9, 13) (18, 1) (18, 13) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 17) (17, 7) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 8) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 17) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the graph. Let's go through the steps:

1. Count the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 1
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 5
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 19: degree 4

2. Sort the nodes by degree:
- Node 14: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 17: degree 5

3. Check each edge for triangle formation:
- For each edge, consider the vertex with the lower label to have fewer connections.
- Count the triangles formed by the shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

Calculating the triangles based on the shared connections results in a total of 14 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14], and the unique triangles found are:
<1, 15, 16>
<0, 8, 17>
<0, 9, 13>
<0, 9, 18>
<1, 15, 16>
<1, 16, 17>
<1, 9, 13>
<2, 3, 12>
<2, 5, 12>
<2, 5, 19>
<8, 11, 4>
<8, 17, 4>
<13, 9, 18>
<17, 16, 1>
