Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 3), (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 3), (6, 2), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 0), (1, 7), (3, 9), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 7), (4, 9), (4, 0), (8, 5), (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 7), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 2), (0, 7), (7, 5), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 0)

By sorting the vertices by their degrees, we have the following labels:
Node 4: degree 2
Node 9: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 0: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5
Node 2: degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following:
- Triangle <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle <0, 2, 1>
- Triangle <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle <0, 2, 7>
- Triangle <0, 7, 1>
- Triangle <0, 7, 3>
- Triangle <0, 7, 5>
- Triangle <1, 2, 5>
- Triangle <1, 2, 6>
- Triangle <1, 2, 7>
- Triangle <2, 5, 6>
- Triangle <2, 5, 7>
- Triangle <5, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [14]
