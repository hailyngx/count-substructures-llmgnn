Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 13) (16, 4) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 17) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 2) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 8) (13, 16) (13, 1) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 0) (8, 15) (8, 18) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 12) (19, 9) (1, 13) (1, 14) (6, 15) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (10, 7) (0, 17) (0, 5) (9, 19) (9, 12) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 14) (12, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0)
