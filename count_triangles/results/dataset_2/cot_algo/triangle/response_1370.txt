Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections in order to efficiently count the number of triangles. 

Let's construct the graph with 15 nodes and the given 60 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 12), (5, 7), (9, 1), (9, 0), (9, 12), (6, 11), (6, 12), (1, 3), (1, 11), (1, 4), (3, 11), (3, 0), (10, 11), (10, 8), (11, 7), (11, 4), (4, 13), (4, 14), (4, 2), (8, 10), (8, 2), (2, 13), (2, 14), (2, 7), (7, 11), (12, 0), (13, 14)

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):
Degree(0) = 3
Degree(1) = 6
Degree(2) = 5
Degree(3) = 3
Degree(4) = 6
Degree(5) = 5
Degree(6) = 3
Degree(7) = 3
Degree(8) = 5
Degree(9) = 4
Degree(10) = 2
Degree(11) = 6
Degree(12) = 3
Degree(13) = 3
Degree(14) = 3

Reorder the nodes: 
Nodes: 10, 0, 3, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 2, 5, 8, 9, 1, 4, 11

Now, let's find the triangles:
Triangles: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 11>, <2, 4, 8>

Total number of triangles: [3]
