Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 14) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 10) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 10), (2, 12), (2, 13), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 11), (4, 0), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 11), (5, 12), (6, 1), (6, 11), (6, 14), (7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 11), (7, 12), (8, 11), (8, 13), (9, 1), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 2), (10, 9), (10, 14), (11, 3), (11, 5), (11, 6), (11, 7), (11, 8), (12, 0), (12, 2), (12, 5), (12, 7), (12, 13), (12, 14), (13, 2), (13, 5), (13, 8), (13, 12), (14, 6), (14, 10), (14, 12)

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices sorted by degree:
0(6), 1(4), 2(4), 3(3), 4(3), 5(4), 6(3), 7(4), 8(2), 9(3), 10(3), 11(6), 12(6), 13(4), 14(3)

Since we have already listed all the edges, we will go through each edge and list the triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles (in no particular order):
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 0, 3>, <2, 0, 4>, <2, 0, 7>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 0, 7>, <3, 5, 11>, <4, 7, 12>, <5, 1, 6>, <5, 1, 9>, <5, 3, 11>, <5, 11, 6>, <6, 1, 9>, <7, 0, 4>, <7, 0, 12>, <7, 4, 12>, <11, 3, 5>, <11, 5, 6>, <11, 5, 9>, <11, 6, 14>

Total number of triangles: [31]
