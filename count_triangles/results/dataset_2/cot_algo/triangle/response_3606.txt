Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 10) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 1) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 1) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 1) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 12) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 4) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles involves the following steps:

1. Sort the vertices by their degrees (number of connections).
2. Relabel the vertices from 0 to 14 based on their degrees in ascending order.
3. For each edge, if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, proceed to check for shared connections between the two vertices of the edge to identify triangles.

Here is the list of vertices and their degrees:

- Vertex 0: degree 4
- Vertex 1: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 4
- Vertex 4: degree 4
- Vertex 5: degree 5
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 5
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 4
- Vertex 10: degree 5
- Vertex 11: degree 5
- Vertex 12: degree 3
- Vertex 13: degree 4
- Vertex 14: degree 4

Based on the above vertex relabeling and sorting, the unique triangles are as follows:

- <1, 4, 1>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <1, 5, 1>
- <1, 5, 4>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 1>
- <7, 10, 1>
- <7, 10, 5>
- <7, 10, 4>
- <7, 10, 0>
- <7, 10, 14>
- <7, 10, 7>
- <7, 10, 9>
- <7, 10, 2>
- <7, 10, 3>
- <10, 5, 1>
- <10, 5, 8>
- <10, 5, 4>
- <10, 7, 4>
- <10, 7, 0>
- <10, 7, 14>
- <10, 7, 7>
- <10, 7, 9>
- <10, 7, 2>
- <10, 7, 3>
- <11, 13, 11>
- <11, 13, 8>
- <11, 13, 5>
- <11, 13, 12>
- <11, 5, 8>
- <11, 5, 1>
- <11, 5, 4>
- <13, 6, 6>
- <13, 6, 9>
- <13, 6, 13>
- <13, 6, 12>
- <13, 6, 11>
- <13, 11, 8>
- <13, 11, 5>
- <13, 11, 12>

The total number of triangles is [37].
