Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 12) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 0) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 8) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by degree (number of connections):
(5, 6) (9, 7) (4, 3) (7, 3) (1, 4) (3, 4) (8, 4) (13, 3) (10, 4) (11, 3) (6, 3) (12, 5) (0, 4) (2, 5) (14, 3)
