Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 25) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 24) (3, 13) (3, 8) (26, 1) (26, 6) (9, 22) (9, 28) (9, 10) (22, 9) (22, 19) (22, 5) (22, 12) (5, 22) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 18) (13, 6) (19, 22) (19, 5) (19, 23) (29, 21) (29, 10) (25, 1) (25, 16) (25, 0) (27, 21) (7, 16) (7, 23) (7, 17) (16, 25) (16, 7) (16, 4) (20, 1) (20, 23) (20, 11) (0, 25) (0, 28) (0, 24) (28, 9) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 4) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 8) (24, 14) (8, 3) (8, 24) (8, 12) (4, 16) (4, 28) (4, 17) (21, 29) (21, 27) (21, 17) (12, 22) (12, 5) (12, 28) (12, 8) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 24) (14, 18) (14, 15) (18, 13) (18, 14) (10, 9) (10, 29) (15, 14) (2, 11) (23, 19) (23, 7) (23, 20) (6, 26) (6, 13) (11, 20) (11, 2) (11, 17) (17, 7) (17, 4) (17, 21) (17, 11) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the nodes is as follows:  
Node 27: Degree 1  
Node 2: Degree 1  
Node 15: Degree 1  
Node 29: Degree 2  
Node 16: Degree 3  
Node 3: Degree 4  
Node 26: Degree 4  
Node 0: Degree 4  
Node 9: Degree 4  
Node 5: Degree 4  
Node 6: Degree 4  
Node 18: Degree 4  
Node 10: Degree 4  
Node 8: Degree 4  
Node 4: Degree 4  
Node 22: Degree 4  
Node 24: Degree 4  
Node 14: Degree 5  
Node 21: Degree 5  
Node 19: Degree 5  
Node 7: Degree 5  
Node 20: Degree 5  
Node 12: Degree 5  
Node 13: Degree 5  
Node 11: Degree 5  
Node 1: Degree 6  
Node 25: Degree 6  
Node 28: Degree 6  
Node 17: Degree 6  

After processing the edges based on the degree-based ordering method, we count the total number of triangles, which is [72].  

Here are some of the unique triangles found in the graph:  
<3, 1, 14>  
<3, 14, 5>  
<1, 14, 5>  
<22, 12, 28>  
<22, 12, 5>  
<22, 12, 8>  
<22, 5, 19>  
<21, 27, 17>  
<9, 22, 5>  
<9, 22, 12>  
<9, 22, 28>
