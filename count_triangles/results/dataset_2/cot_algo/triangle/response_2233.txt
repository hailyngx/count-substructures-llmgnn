Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 14) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 4) (16, 20) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 20) (13, 22) (13, 2) (22, 13) (22, 14) (22, 15) (22, 12) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 27) (26, 29) (26, 21) (26, 3) (26, 27) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 17) (17, 1) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 18) (7, 0) (7, 20) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 28) (23, 11) (23, 5) (25, 11) (25, 21) (25, 15) (14, 11) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 29) (28, 8) (18, 9) (18, 0) (3, 26) (3, 0) (3, 27) (24, 2) (24, 29) (19, 4) (20, 16) (20, 9) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 10) (12, 22) (12, 20) (12, 15) (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 12) (4, 16) (4, 21) (4, 19) (4, 10) (29, 26) (29, 14) (29, 24) (10, 20) (10, 4) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 24) (2, 27) (27, 6) (27, 26) (27, 3) (27, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections, and then we will proceed to find the triangles.

The sorted list of vertices based on the number of connections is as follows:
(11) - 4 connections
(16) - 4 connections
(5) - 4 connections
(9) - 4 connections
(22) - 4 connections
(6) - 3 connections
(26) - 3 connections
(1) - 3 connections
(21) - 3 connections
(0) - 3 connections
(7) - 3 connections
(14) - 3 connections
(20) - 5 connections
(12) - 3 connections
(15) - 3 connections
(4) - 4 connections
(29) - 3 connections
(2) - 4 connections
(27) - 4 connections
(3) - 3 connections
(17) - 1 connection
(18) - 2 connections
(13) - 2 connections
(25) - 3 connections
(28) - 2 connections
(8) - 2 connections
(23) - 2 connections
(24) - 2 connections
(19) - 1 connection
(10) - 2 connections

Now, we will iterate through each edge and count the triangles:
1. (11, 16)
2. (11, 23)
3. (11, 14)
4. (11, 25)
5. (16, 1)
6. (16, 4)
7. (16, 20)
8. (5, 9)
9. (5, 6)
10. (5, 23)
11. (9, 18)
12. (13, 22)
13. (22, 14)
14. (22, 15)
15. (6, 27)
16. (26, 29)
17. (26, 21)
18. (1, 17)
19. (21, 25)
20. (0, 7)
21. (7, 8)
22. (23, 5)
23. (14, 29)
24. (18, 0)
25. (3, 27)
26. (3, 0)
27. (4, 19)
28. (2, 24)
29. (20, 12)
30. (15, 25)

After counting, we find that there are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are:
<4, 16, 20>
<5, 9, 5>
<5, 9, 20>
<5, 9, 18>
<14, 22, 15>
<20, 16, 4>
<20, 12, 15>
<21, 25, 15>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
