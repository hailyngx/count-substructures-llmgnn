Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 8) (27, 0) (27, 18) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (21, 0) (21, 7) (21, 15) (22, 23) (22, 24) (22, 1) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 1) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 6) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 26) (3, 22) (3, 10) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 2) (18, 27) (18, 26) (18, 12) (26, 17) (26, 18) (26, 25) (26, 16) (20, 12) (20, 2) (29, 9) (29, 13) (9, 7) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 24) (9, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 24) (28, 8) (15, 21) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 4) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 24) (19, 12) (25, 26) (25, 9) (25, 6) (24, 22) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 19) (14, 8) (14, 19) (12, 18) (12, 20) (12, 19) (6, 10) (6, 25) (1, 22) (1, 23) (1, 5) (1, 16) (16, 26) (16, 1) (16, 4) (4, 15) (4, 16) (13, 29) (13, 9) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 20) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. The vertices in this graph with their degrees are as follows:

(30) 0: 3
(28) 1: 4
(27) 2: 3
(25) 3: 4
(24) 4: 3
(23) 5: 2
(29) 6: 3
(29) 7: 4
(24) 8: 4
(25) 9: 5
(23) 10: 3
(25) 11: 3
(24) 12: 4
(25) 13: 2
(30) 14: 3
(23) 15: 4
(26) 16: 3
(26) 17: 3
(29) 18: 3
(31) 19: 3
(22) 20: 2
(28) 21: 4
(23) 22: 4
(24) 23: 3
(22) 24: 4
(25) 25: 4
(24) 26: 4
(26) 27: 2
(26) 28: 1
(28) 29: 2

Now, let's count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 2]
<7, 10, 3>
<9, 13, 29>
