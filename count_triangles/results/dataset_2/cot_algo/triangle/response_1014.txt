Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 3) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are as follows:
Node 4 - Degree: 4
Node 5 - Degree: 4
Node 8 - Degree: 4
Node 9 - Degree: 4
Node 1 - Degree: 3
Node 10 - Degree: 3
Node 11 - Degree: 3
Node 12 - Degree: 3
Node 2 - Degree: 3
Node 3 - Degree: 3
Node 0 - Degree: 3
Node 6 - Degree: 6
Node 7 - Degree: 5
Node 13 - Degree: 5
Node 14 - Degree: 7
