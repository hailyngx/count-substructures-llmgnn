Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given edges and count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges:
- 0: (5, 0), (9, 0), (1, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0)
- 1: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3)
- 2: (5, 2), (1, 2), (4, 2), (8, 2)
- 3: (1, 3), (7, 3), (3, 8)
- 4: (8, 4), (4, 6), (4, 2)
- 5: (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 7), (5, 9)
- 6: (4, 6), (6, 0), (6, 8)
- 7: (5, 7), (9, 7), (3, 7), (7, 0), (7, 8)
- 8: (9, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (8, 2), (8, 6), (8, 7)
- 9: (5, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 0)

After sorting the vertices by their degrees, we get the following order: [3, 4, 6, 1, 7, 9, 2, 0, 8, 5]

Triangles found: [10]
Unique triangles: <0, 9, 5> <0, 9, 7> <0, 6, 4> <0, 6, 8> <0, 7, 5> <2, 1, 0> <2, 8, 4> <2, 8, 6> <2, 8, 7> <8, 7, 3>
