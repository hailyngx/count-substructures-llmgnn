Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their number of connections from least to most. 

Here is the sorted list of nodes with their corresponding connections:

Node 8: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 13: 2 connections
Node 20: 3 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 19: 3 connections
Node 21: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 16: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 22: 5 connections
Node 26: 5 connections
Node 28: 5 connections
Node 29: 5 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 12: 6 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 15: 6 connections
Node 25: 6 connections
Node 27: 6 connections
Node 5: 6 connections
Node 14: 6 connections
Node 17: 6 connections
Node 24: 7 connections
Node 2: 7 connections
Node 11: 8 connections
