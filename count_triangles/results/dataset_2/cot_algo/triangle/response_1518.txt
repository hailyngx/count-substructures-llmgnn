Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 

Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 3 connections.
Node 0 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 5 connections.
Node 5 has 5 connections.
Node 7 has 5 connections.
Node 2 has 6 connections.
Node 4 has 6 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in this graph, we find the following triangles: 

- Triangle 1: <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle 3: <0, 5, 7>
- Triangle 4: <1, 4, 5>
- Triangle 5: <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle 6: <2, 4, 5>
- Triangle 7: <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle 8: <2, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
