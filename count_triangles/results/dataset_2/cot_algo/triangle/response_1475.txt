Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 19) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 5) (17, 2) (17, 15) (18, 4) (18, 9) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 15) (2, 0) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 19) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 6) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 12) (9, 8) (9, 18) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 19) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 1) (12, 10) (12, 19) (12, 3) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. 
Let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges:
- 0: {7, 2, 6}
- 1: {6}
- 2: {8, 17, 15, 0}
- 3: {8, 12, 14}
- 4: {18, 13, 14}
- 5: {11, 10, 19}
- 6: {11, 0, 1}
- 7: {0, 10}
- 8: {13, 2, 9, 14, 3}
- 9: {8, 18}
- 10: {7, 12, 5}
- 11: {16, 5, 6, 15}
- 12: {10, 19, 3}
- 13: {4, 8, 19}
- 14: {4, 8, 19, 3}
- 15: {11, 17, 2, 19}
- 16: {11}
- 17: {2, 15}
- 18: {4, 9}
- 19: {13, 5, 15, 14, 12}

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
1. Node 1: degree = 1
2. Node 9: degree = 1
3. Node 7: degree = 2
4. Node 6: degree = 2
5. Node 16: degree = 1
6. Node 18: degree = 2
7. Node 10: degree = 3
8. Node 17: degree = 2
9. Node 12: degree = 3
10. Node 4: degree = 3
11. Node 0: degree = 3
12. Node 3: degree = 3
13. Node 14: degree = 4
14. Node 13: degree = 3
15. Node 19: degree = 5
16. Node 5: degree = 3
17. Node 2: degree = 4
18. Node 8: degree = 5
19. Node 11: degree = 4

Next, we will count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 
The total number of triangles is [***]. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 17>
<0, 2, 15>
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 8, 14>
<2, 8, 15>
<3, 8, 14>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 8, 14>
<4, 13, 19>
<5, 10, 19>
<6, 10, 12>
<8, 13, 19>
<10, 12, 19>
<11, 15, 17>
<13, 14, 19>
