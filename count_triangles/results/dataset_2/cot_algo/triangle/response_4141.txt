Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 8) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 1) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 14) (18, 2) (18, 12) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 0) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 19) (5, 17) (5, 16) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 3) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 4) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 15) (15, 7) (15, 4) (9, 13) (9, 19) (12, 18) (12, 6) (12, 8) (13, 9) (13, 3) (19, 0) (19, 9) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 15) (3, 8) (3, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method applied to the given graph yields the following sorted list of vertices:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 15: Degree 2
Node 19: Degree 2
Node 18: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 16: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 10: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 14: Degree 6
Node 17: Degree 6

Now, we will count the triangles using the sorted vertices and given edges:
