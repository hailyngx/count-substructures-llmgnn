Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 19) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 18) (6, 12) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 8) (2, 17) (8, 1) (8, 2) (15, 10) (15, 19) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 13) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 4) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 17) (7, 3) (17, 2) (17, 16) (17, 18) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 9) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 18) (13, 10) (13, 16) 

Response:
To start, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes in decreasing order of degrees: (node: degree)
(11: 4), (2: 4), (5: 3), (18: 3), (10: 3), (19: 3), (14: 3), (9: 4), (6: 3), (1: 4), (8: 2), (0: 2), (4: 4), (3: 3), (16: 4), (12: 3), (15: 2), (17: 3), (7: 1), (13: 2)

Now, we will list down the triangles found by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
[Total number of triangles: 22]
<1, 9, 18>, <1, 9, 4>, <1, 9, 0>, <1, 3, 19>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 16>, <1, 8, 2>, <1, 8, 16>, <2, 14, 4>, <2, 14, 0>, <2, 14, 12>, <2, 11, 12>, <2, 11, 5>, <5, 6, 18>, <5, 6, 12>, <5, 11, 12>, <9, 4, 19>, <9, 4, 14>, <9, 0, 14>, <10, 16, 17>, <10, 16, 13>, <18, 17, 4>
