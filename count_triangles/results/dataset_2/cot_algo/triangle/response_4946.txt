Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 4) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (1, 19) (1, 18) (1, 7) (17, 6) (17, 13) (15, 16) (15, 10) (16, 6) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 14) (13, 17) (13, 0) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 4) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 13) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 16) (14, 11) (14, 18) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 3) (3, 8) (3, 19) (3, 7) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 3) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 10) (12, 5) (12, 18) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. 

Below is the list of vertices sorted by their number of connections (degree):
Vertices: 11, 15, 19, 2, 3, 12, 17, 5, 1, 11, 13, 9, 10, 7, 18, 4, 14, 16, 6, 0

Now, we will go through each edge while ensuring that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Calculating triangles:
1. Edge (6, 9): Shared connections = {0}
2. Edge (6, 17): Shared connections = {}
3. Edge (6, 14): Shared connections = {0, 16}
4. Edge (6, 16): Shared connections = {0}
5. Edge (9, 4): Shared connections = {}
6. Edge (5, 8): Shared connections = {0}
7. Edge (5, 12): Shared connections = {}
8. Edge (5, 18): Shared connections = {1}
9. Edge (2, 8): Shared connections = {}
10. Edge (8, 5): Shared connections = {0}
11. Edge (8, 2): Shared connections = {}
12. Edge (8, 0): Shared connections = {}
13. Edge (8, 3): Shared connections = {}
14. Edge (1, 19): Shared connections = {}
15. Edge (1, 18): Shared connections = {5}
16. Edge (17, 13): Shared connections = {}
17. Edge (15, 16): Shared connections = {}
18. Edge (15, 10): Shared connections = {}
19. Edge (16, 15): Shared connections = {}
20. Edge (16, 0): Shared connections = {}
21. Edge (13, 0): Shared connections = {}
22. Edge (10, 15): Shared connections = {}
23. Edge (10, 7): Shared connections = {}
24. Edge (0, 13): Shared connections = {}
25. Edge (11, 14): Shared connections = {}
26. Edge (14, 11): Shared connections = {}
27. Edge (14, 18): Shared connections = {0}
28. Edge (19, 2): Shared connections = {}
29. Edge (19, 1): Shared connections = {}
30. Edge (3, 19): Shared connections = {}
31. Edge (3, 7): Shared connections = {}
32. Edge (7, 1): Shared connections = {}
33. Edge (7, 10): Shared connections = {}
34. Edge (7, 3): Shared connections = {}
35. Edge (4, 9): Shared connections = {}
36. Edge (4, 5): Shared connections = {1}
37. Edge (4, 10): Shared connections = {}
38. Edge (12, 5): Shared connections = {}
39. Edge (12, 18): Shared connections = {1}
