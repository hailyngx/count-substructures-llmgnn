Edges: (1, 26), (1, 20), (1, 16), (21, 10), (21, 9), (21, 15), (14, 6), (17, 9), (17, 18), (3, 25), (3, 11), (3, 24), (25, 3), (25, 23), (8, 13), (8, 19), (8, 24), (8, 18), (8, 7), (13, 8), (13, 29), (12, 27), (12, 7), (12, 0), (27, 12), (27, 23), (26, 1), (26, 10), (26, 15), (26, 6), (4, 23), (4, 6), (4, 2), (18, 17), (18, 8), (18, 5), (18, 24), (7, 8), (7, 12), (7, 10), (9, 21), (9, 17), (9, 22), (9, 28), (22, 9), (22, 2), (22, 5), (11, 3), (11, 19), (11, 15), (5, 18), (5, 22), (5, 19), (5, 16), (19, 8), (19, 11), (19, 5), (19, 28), (10, 21), (10, 26), (10, 7), (10, 29), (2, 4), (2, 22), (28, 9), (28, 19), (28, 0), (16, 1), (16, 5), (16, 24), (15, 21), (15, 26), (15, 11), (24, 3), (24, 8), (24, 18), (24, 16), (24, 0), (20, 1), (6, 14), (6, 26), (6, 4), (0, 12), (0, 28), (0, 24), (23, 25), (23, 27), (23, 4), (29, 13), (29, 10)

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Vertices sorted by degree: (0, 2, 14, 16, 10, 11, 12, 15, 5, 6, 13, 17, 18, 20, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 21, 9, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29)

Number of triangles in the graph: [114]

Unique triangles in the graph: <8, 12, 0>, <2, 12, 0>, <26, 12, 0>, <7, 10, 26>, <15, 26, 6>, <15, 10, 21>, <10, 26, 15>, <10, 26, 6>, <10, 29, 13>, <10, 26, 1>, <6, 14, 4>, <6, 14, 26>, <25, 3, 24>, <25, 3, 11>, <4, 23, 27>, <4, 23, 25>, <4, 23, 6>, <4, 6, 2>, <16, 5, 18>, <16, 5, 19>, <16, 5, 1>, <8, 24, 16>, <8, 24, 0>, <8, 7, 12>, <21, 9, 17>, <21, 9, 15>, <21, 9, 10>, <18, 17, 9>, <1, 26, 6>, <1, 26, 16>, <1, 20, 16>, <18, 24, 0>, <18, 24, 3>, <19, 28, 9>, <19, 28, 5>
