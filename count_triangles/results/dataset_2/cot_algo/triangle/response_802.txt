Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 4) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 14) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 3) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 2) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (6, 0), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 13), (10, 8), (10, 1), (10, 13), (10, 5), (11, 7), (11, 8), (11, 12), (11, 4), (11, 2), (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 0), (8, 12), (13, 9), (13, 10), (13, 5), (13, 1), (5, 10), (5, 13), (5, 0), (5, 7), (5, 14), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 12), (7, 9), (7, 11), (7, 5), (7, 0), (7, 14), (1, 10), (1, 13), (1, 4), (1, 12), (2, 11), (2, 12), (2, 3), (2, 4), (12, 11), (12, 8), (12, 0), (12, 1), (12, 2), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 14), (14, 5), (14, 7), (14, 3), (4, 9), (4, 11), (4, 1), (4, 2)

After relabeling the nodes based on their degree of connections from least to most, we get:
Nodes in ascending order of degree: 6, 3, 9, 14, 13, 2, 4, 1, 10, 12, 7, 5, 0, 8, 11

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles in the graph.

The total number of triangles is: [15]

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 12>, <0, 3, 14>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 4, 12>, <1, 10, 13>, <2, 4, 11>, <2, 4, 12>, <3, 7, 14>, <4, 9, 13>, <5, 7, 14>, <5, 10, 13>, <7, 11, 14>, <8, 10, 13>
