Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 18) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 0) (17, 5) (17, 3) (17, 4) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 15) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 2) (16, 0) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 4) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 4) (6, 18) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 0) (14, 8) (14, 10) (9, 12) (9, 1) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting nodes by their degree (number of connections) in increasing order. The sorted nodes are then labeled accordingly from 0 to 19. 

The sorted nodes with their degrees are as follows:
Node 8 - Degree 3
Node 13 - Degree 2
Node 10 - Degree 4
Node 11 - Degree 3
Node 7 - Degree 3
Node 12 - Degree 3
Node 5 - Degree 5
Node 17 - Degree 3
Node 19 - Degree 4
Node 0 - Degree 5
Node 16 - Degree 1
Node 18 - Degree 3
Node 15 - Degree 3
Node 3 - Degree 3
Node 6 - Degree 1
Node 2 - Degree 4
Node 14 - Degree 2
Node 9 - Degree 2
Node 1 - Degree 3
Node 4 - Degree 3
