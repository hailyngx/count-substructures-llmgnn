Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 6) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 12) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 9) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 12) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 13) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 6) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges:
- 0: 1, 8, 7, 9
- 1: 3, 5, 10, 0
- 2: 3, 11, 13, 6
- 3: 1, 9, 2, 5, 4
- 4: 11, 9, 3
- 5: 1, 3, 12
- 6: 11, 2, 8, 7, 13
- 7: 0, 6
- 8: 11, 9, 0, 12, 6
- 9: 3, 8, 0, 4, 12
- 10: 1, 13, 14
- 11: 14, 6, 8, 4, 2
- 12: 8, 9, 13, 5, 14
- 13: 10, 2, 12, 6
- 14: 10, 11, 12

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:
Nodes by degree: 7, 5, 10, 4, 14, 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 3, 11, 12, 13

Based on the sorted order, we will relabel the nodes as follows:
Nodes: 
7(0), 5(1), 10(2), 4(3), 14(4), 0(5), 1(6), 2(7), 6(8), 8(9), 9(10), 3(11), 11(12), 12(13), 13(14)

Now, let's find the triangles:
Triangles []: [22]
Unique triangles <>: <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 11>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 10>, <13, 6, 11>, <13, 6, 14>, <13, 6, 12>, <13, 6, 2>, <13, 6, 8>, <13, 6, 7>, <13, 6, 3>, <13, 6, 9>, <7, 0, 6>, <7, 0, 8>, <7, 6, 11>, <7, 6, 2>, <7, 6, 13>, <7, 6, 8>, <7, 6, 1>, <7, 0, 8>, <12, 5, 14>, <12, 5, 4>
