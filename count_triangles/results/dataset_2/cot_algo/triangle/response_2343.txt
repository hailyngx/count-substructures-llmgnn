Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most. 
After relabeling the vertices accordingly, we get the following list of vertices and their connections:

Node  | Connections 
----- | ------------
5     | 4 
6     | 2 
0     | 4 
7     | 4 
2     | 4 
9     | 4 
1     | 5 
3     | 4 
4     | 4 
8     | 5 

Next, we will count the triangles using the degree-based ordering method:

Triangles: 
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 8, 5>
- <0, 8, 3>
- <1, 2, 3>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <1, 7, 5>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <4, 5, 6>

Total number of triangles: [14]
