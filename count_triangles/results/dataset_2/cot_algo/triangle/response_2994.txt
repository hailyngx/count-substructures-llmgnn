Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is applied as follows:

Nodes sorted by the number of connections (degree):
Node 5 < Node 9 < Node 1 < Node 6 < Node 4 < Node 8 < Node 0 < Node 7 < Node 2 < Node 3

Triangles found: <1, 3, 9> <0, 2, 8> <0, 3, 4>

Total number of triangles: [3]
