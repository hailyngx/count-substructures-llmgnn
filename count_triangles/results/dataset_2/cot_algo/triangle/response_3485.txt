Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 21) (3, 26) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 5) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 27) (18, 23) (18, 10) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 1) (8, 14) (8, 29) (8, 25) (8, 11) (13, 2) (13, 7) (10, 18) (10, 17) (10, 28) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 23) (0, 17) (0, 20) (20, 15) (20, 0) (20, 19) (20, 11) (28, 10) (28, 11) (28, 24) (5, 15) (5, 22) (5, 26) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 7) (14, 25) (11, 8) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 4) (21, 3) (21, 2) (29, 9) (29, 8) (29, 23) (29, 12) (26, 3) (26, 5) (26, 14) (26, 7) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 26) (7, 16) (16, 22) (16, 7) (1, 6) (1, 22) (1, 24) (2, 13) (2, 21) (12, 29) (19, 15) (19, 20) (19, 24) (19, 27) (25, 8) (25, 14) (25, 27) (27, 9) (27, 19) (27, 25) (27, 24) (23, 18) (23, 17) (23, 29) (24, 28) (24, 1) (24, 19) (24, 27) (4, 15) (4, 11) 

Response:
Let's first build the graph using the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29
Edges: (3, 21), (3, 26), (15, 20), (15, 19), (15, 5), (15, 4), (6, 9), (6, 1), (9, 6), (9, 29), (9, 27), (18, 23), (18, 10), (22, 16), (22, 5), (22, 1), (8, 14), (8, 29), (8, 25), (8, 11), (13, 2), (13, 7), (10, 18), (10, 17), (10, 28), (17, 10), (17, 0), (17, 23), (0, 17), (0, 20), (20, 15), (20, 0), (20, 19), (20, 11), (28, 10), (28, 11), (28, 24), (5, 15), (5, 22), (5, 26), (14, 8), (14, 26), (14, 7), (14, 25), (11, 8), (11, 20), (11, 28), (11, 4), (21, 3), (21, 2), (29, 9), (29, 8), (29, 23), (29, 12), (26, 3), (26, 5), (26, 14), (26, 7), (7, 13), (7, 14), (7, 26), (7, 16), (16, 22), (16, 7), (1, 6), (1, 22), (1, 24), (2, 13), (2, 21), (12, 29), (19, 15), (19, 20), (19, 24), (19, 27), (25, 8), (25, 14), (25, 27), (27, 9), (27, 19), (27, 25), (27, 24), (23, 18), (23, 17), (23, 29), (24, 28), (24, 1), (24, 19), (24, 27), (4, 15), (4, 11)

In the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections):

Nodes by degree: 12, 16, 18, 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 13, 16, 23, 24, 1, 10, 12, 19, 21, 25, 28, 15, 10, 13, 15, 18, 1, 4, 6, 9, 15, 18

Now, we will count the number of triangles by following the method described.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 20, 11>
<0, 20, 15>
<2, 13, 7>
<2, 13, 14>
<9, 27, 25>
<4, 11, 8>
<4, 15, 20>
<5, 22, 1>
<6, 9, 29>
<7, 14, 25>
<10, 18, 23>
<10, 18, 17>
