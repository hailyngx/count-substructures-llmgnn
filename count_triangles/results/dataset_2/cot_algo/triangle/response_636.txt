Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 13) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 18) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 19) (7, 9) (15, 17) (15, 16) (13, 14) (13, 17) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 6) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 4) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 6) (6, 14) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 4) (18, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Node 7 has degree 1
Node 18 has degree 1
Node 1 has degree 2
Node 10 has degree 2
Node 19 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 13 has degree 4
Node 15 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 5
Node 4 has degree 5
Node 6 has degree 5
Node 14 has degree 6
Node 0 has degree 6
Node 12 has degree 6
Node 11 has degree 7
Node 9 has degree 7
Node 16 has degree 7
Node 17 has degree 7
