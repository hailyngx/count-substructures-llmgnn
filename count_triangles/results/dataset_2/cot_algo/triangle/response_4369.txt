Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 7), (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 1), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 8),
(3, 4), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 0), (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 0), (8, 9), (8, 3), (8, 7), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 2),
(0, 7), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 8), (7, 0), (4, 5), (4, 3), (4, 6)

Next, let's sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:
Nodes by degree: 0, 4, 6, 8, 7, 3, 1, 9, 2, 5

Now, let's label the nodes from 0 to 9 according to their degree:
Node labels: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

We will now check each edge to count the number of triangles formed:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [12]
