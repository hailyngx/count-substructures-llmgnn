Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 29) (15, 14) (27, 15) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 13) (20, 9) (25, 20) (25, 18) (25, 11) (10, 16) (10, 14) (11, 25) (11, 21) (8, 20) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 0) (23, 13) (23, 28) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 25) (18, 21) (2, 8) (2, 5) (22, 3) (26, 24) (26, 16) (28, 23) (28, 14) (28, 19) (28, 13) (1, 12) (17, 4) (17, 24) (17, 19) (24, 26) (24, 17) (24, 7) (24, 9) (24, 5) (0, 8) (0, 23) (7, 24) (7, 3) (9, 20) (9, 8) (9, 24) (9, 21) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (16, 10) (16, 26) (16, 29) (16, 3) (3, 22) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 16) (3, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 24) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 28) (19, 28) (19, 17) (6, 3) (6, 29) (29, 15) (29, 16) (29, 6) (29, 21) (21, 11) (21, 18) (21, 9) (21, 29) (13, 20) (13, 23) (13, 4) (13, 28) 

Response:
Firstly, here is the graph constructed with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 29
Edges: (15, 27), (15, 29), (15, 14), (27, 15), (20, 25), (20, 8), (20, 13), ..., (13, 28)

Now, we will calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Sort vertices by their number of connections:
0: 2 connections
1: 1 connection
2: 2 connections
3: 6 connections
4: 5 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
8: 5 connections
9: 4 connections
10: 2 connections
11: 2 connections
12: 4 connections
13: 5 connections
14: 3 connections
15: 2 connections
16: 4 connections
17: 3 connections
18: 3 connections
19: 3 connections
20: 4 connections
21: 4 connections
22: 1 connection
23: 4 connections
24: 5 connections
25: 4 connections
26: 2 connections
27: 1 connection
28: 5 connections
29: 4 connections

- Relabel the vertices in increasing order of connections:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

- Count the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [17]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 8, 23>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 23, 8>
<0, 23, 13>
<4, 5, 24>
<4, 12, 13>
<4, 13, 28>
<5, 24, 17>
<8, 20, 9>
<8, 23, 0>
<8, 23, 13>
<9, 20, 8>
<9, 24, 5>
<12, 3, 16>
<13, 20, 23>
<13, 23, 28>
