Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 8) (14, 17) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 19) (5, 14) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (8, 15) (8, 19) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 12) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 11) (10, 14) (10, 0) (10, 1) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 4) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 7) (2, 16) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 11) (13, 19) (13, 1) (13, 4) (11, 6) (11, 18) (11, 4) 

Response:
The graph has been analyzed using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 5, 14>
<0, 5, 10>
<0, 4, 13>
<0, 9, 19>
<1, 10, 14>
<2, 7, 16>
<4, 11, 16>
<6, 9, 11>
<6, 9, 7>
<6, 11, 18>
<7, 9, 2>
<12, 3, 19>
<15, 6, 9>
<15, 6, 11>
<15, 8, 19>
<15, 18, 19>
<16, 2, 7>
<16, 4, 13>
<16, 4, 11>
<19, 9, 8>
<19, 9, 13>
<19, 12, 3>
<18, 11, 6>
<18, 15, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [24].
