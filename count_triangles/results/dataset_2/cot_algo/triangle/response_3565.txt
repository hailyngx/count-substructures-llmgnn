To count the triangles, we will look at each edge and check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

There are 24 unique triangles in this graph:

[<0, 12, 14>, <1, 4, 27>, <1, 5, 28>, <2, 9, 11>, <3, 11, 23>, <3, 11, 28>, <3, 23, 28>, <4, 15, 19>, <4, 20, 27>, <7, 17, 25>, <7, 17, 24>, <7, 24, 25>, <8, 13, 26>, <8, 18, 26>, <10, 16, 24>, <10, 16, 19>, <13, 26, 18>, <14, 17, 23>, <14, 17, 7>, <16, 22, 24>, <16, 22, 0>, <22, 16, 0>, <23, 17, 14>, <26, 13, 28>]
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [24].
