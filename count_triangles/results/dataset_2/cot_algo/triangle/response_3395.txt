Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 18) (7, 18) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 19) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 18) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 17) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 16) (16, 0) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 17) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 2) (19, 3) (19, 15) (6, 17) (6, 2) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 8) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 13) (14, 3) (14, 10) (8, 15) (8, 17) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with nodes and edges. Now let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The nodes and their corresponding connections are sorted as follows:
0: 3 connections
11: 3 connections
14: 3 connections
16: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
10: 2 connections
15: 2 connections
19: 2 connections
4: 1 connection
7: 1 connection
18: 1 connection
12: 1 connection
17: 1 connection
2: 1 connection
13: 1 connection
5: 1 connection
9: 1 connection
3: 1 connection
1: 1 connection

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This will help count each triangle only once.

The triangles found in the graph are:
- <1, 3, 13>
- <1, 3, 12>
- <1, 5, 12>
- <3, 9, 1>
- <3, 9, 19>
- <5, 9, 12>
- <10, 11, 18>
- <15, 17, 19>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
