Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the provided edges:

Node 0 is connected to nodes: 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 1 is connected to nodes: 4, 6
Node 2 is connected to nodes: 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 3 is connected to nodes: 0, 4, 6, 7
Node 4 is connected to nodes: 1, 3, 5, 8
Node 5 is connected to nodes: 0, 2, 4, 7
Node 6 is connected to nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3
Node 7 is connected to nodes: 2, 3, 5, 8, 9
Node 8 is connected to nodes: 0, 4, 7, 9
Node 9 is connected to nodes: 0, 2, 7, 8

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

1. Node 1: degree = 2
2. Node 2: degree = 4
3. Node 4: degree = 4
4. Node 5: degree = 4
5. Node 6: degree = 4
6. Node 8: degree = 4
7. Node 3: degree = 4
8. Node 9: degree = 4
9. Node 0: degree = 5
10. Node 7: degree = 5

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- There are 15 triangles in total.
