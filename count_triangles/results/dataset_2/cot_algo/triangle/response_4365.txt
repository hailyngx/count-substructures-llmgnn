Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 1) (3, 28) (3, 29) (3, 19) (15, 4) (28, 3) (28, 29) (28, 0) (29, 3) (29, 28) (29, 17) (17, 9) (17, 29) (24, 26) (24, 16) (24, 4) (24, 22) (26, 24) (26, 10) (26, 0) (6, 21) (6, 13) (21, 6) (21, 13) (21, 23) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 27) (7, 25) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 8) (25, 7) (25, 13) (25, 0) (25, 18) (25, 2) (4, 15) (4, 24) (4, 12) (4, 16) (12, 4) (12, 20) (12, 11) (22, 24) (22, 8) (10, 26) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 19) (11, 8) (16, 24) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 23) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 20) (13, 6) (13, 21) (13, 25) (13, 0) (0, 28) (0, 26) (0, 25) (0, 13) (0, 23) (20, 12) (20, 19) (27, 1) (18, 5) (18, 25) (2, 7) (2, 25) (2, 16) (2, 23) (23, 21) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 2) (14, 7) (14, 19) (8, 7) (8, 22) (8, 11) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 18), (9, 17), (9, 1), (3, 28), (3, 29), (3, 19), (15, 4), (28, 0), (29, 17), (24, 26), (24, 16), (24, 4), (24, 22), (26, 10), (6, 21), (6, 13), (21, 13), (21, 23), (1, 11), (1, 27), (7, 25), (7, 14), (7, 2), (7, 8), (25, 18), (25, 2), (12, 20), (12, 11), (22, 8), (16, 23), (19, 14), (13, 0)

Now, let's list the nodes by their degree in ascending order:
Nodes by degree: 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14

Now, we will count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 4]

<0, 13, 23>
<0, 23, 25>
<4, 16, 24>
<7, 14, 19>
