Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts with sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order.

The sorted vertices are: 
Node 0: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5

Now, we iterate through each edge and count the triangles formed by shared connections between the two vertices of the edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles found: [7]
The unique triangles found: <1, 3, 7>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 8>, <6, 7, 8>
