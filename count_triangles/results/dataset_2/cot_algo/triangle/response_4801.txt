Response:
The graph described with 30 nodes and 90 edges is as follows:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(1, 21) (1, 14) (1, 23) (1, 4) 
(21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 11) 
(4, 7) (4, 2) 
(7, 11) (7, 29) (7, 3) (7, 10) 
(18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 12) 
(22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 17) 
(3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 5) (3, 8) 
(25, 17) (25, 24) 
(2, 15) 
(20, 29) 
(16, 27) 
(11, 6) 
(15, 19) (15, 0) 
(19, 10) 
(5, 12) 
(8, 14) 
(12, 24) 
(13, 28) 
(24, 15) 
(6, 17) (6, 11) 
(23, 27) 
(9, 29)

Now, counting the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Vertex order based on the degree:
Vertices with degree `(1, 27, 26, 24, 23, 21, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 9, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0, 7, 5, 11, 29, 25, 22, 20, 19, 18, 17, 3, 28)`
Count of triangles: `[40]`
Unique triangles found: `<1, 4, 21>, <3, 7, 25>, <2, 4, 18>, <6, 11, 29>, <10, 12, 24>, <5, 12, 22>, <7, 10, 28>, <15, 19, 24>`
