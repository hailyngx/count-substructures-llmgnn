Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 16) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 18) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 16) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 18) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 7) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 7) (0, 16) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 13) (13, 2) (13, 14) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 6) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 0) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 7) (12, 3) (12, 5) (19, 14) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
- Node 0: (0, 7), (0, 16)
- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 7)
- Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 15), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 13)
- Node 3: (3, 15), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 12)
- Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 14), (4, 16)
- Node 5: (5, 12), (5, 4), (5, 16)
- Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 10), (6, 11), (6, 7)
- Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 11), (7, 18), (7, 0), (7, 6)
- Node 8: (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 18)
- Node 10: (10, 17), (10, 6), (10, 18)
- Node 11: (11, 7), (11, 6), (11, 17)
- Node 12: (12, 3), (12, 5)
- Node 13: (13, 2), (13, 14)
- Node 14: (14, 4), (14, 19), (14, 13)
- Node 15: (15, 3), (15, 2)
- Node 16: (16, 5), (16, 17), (16, 4), (16, 0)
- Node 17: (17, 10), (17, 11), (17, 16)
- Node 18: (18, 10), (18, 8), (18, 7)
- Node 19: (19, 14)

Now let's proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.
