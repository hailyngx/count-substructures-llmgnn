Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 13) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order.

The sorted list of vertices with their connections counts are as follows:
(4: 2), (1: 4), (3: 3), (10: 4), (11: 5), (0: 4), (12: 3), (6: 3), (5: 4), (9: 5), (7: 4), (14: 4), (2: 4), (13: 6), (8: 5)

Now, we will go through the edges in the order specified, identifying triangles by looking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

The total number of triangles found in the graph is [15]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<2, 3, 13>, 
<1, 8, 10>, 
<0, 5, 11>, 
<0, 9, 13>, 
<1, 5, 11>, 
<0, 9, 2>, 
<1, 5, 6>, 
<9, 13, 0>, 
<1, 5, 0>, 
<4, 7, 8>, 
<3, 9, 13>, 
<6, 10, 11>, 
<5, 6, 11>, 
<2, 12, 13>, 
<3, 12, 13>.
