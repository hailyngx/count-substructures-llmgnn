Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (5, 6) (5, 11) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 11) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 10) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 2) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 13) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges:
- 0: {4, 14, 2}
- 1: {11, 14, 13, 8}
- 2: {3, 0, 12, 11}
- 3: {10, 9, 2}
- 4: {7, 13, 0, 14}
- 5: {6, 11}
- 6: {7, 9, 5, 10, 11}
- 7: {4, 11, 6, 9}
- 8: {1, 14, 10, 12}
- 9: {7, 3, 6}
- 10: {3, 6, 14, 8, 13}
- 11: {7, 1, 6, 5, 2}
- 12: {2, 8, 13}
- 13: {4, 1, 14, 12, 10}
- 14: {4, 1, 0, 8, 13, 10}

Now, let's reorder the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes in increasing order of degrees: [5, 12, 9, 10, 8, 3, 2, 0, 1, 14, 6, 11, 4, 13, 7]

Now, counting triangles:
Total number of triangles: [20]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 14>, <0, 2, 11>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 10>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 4, 14>, <1, 8, 14>, <2, 8, 14>, <2, 11, 14>, <2, 10, 13>, <3, 9, 10>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 11>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 11>, <8, 10, 14>, <10, 13, 14>, <10, 11, 13>
