Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 16) (22, 0) (22, 20) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 3) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 27) (29, 10) (29, 18) (20, 22) (20, 24) (25, 27) (25, 17) (18, 2) (18, 29) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 17) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 11) (6, 16) (28, 6) (28, 14) (28, 19) (28, 23) (8, 2) (8, 21) (8, 0) (8, 3) (24, 20) (24, 26) (24, 0) (24, 17) (24, 21) (26, 24) (26, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 21) (21, 8) (21, 24) (21, 3) (1, 15) (1, 27) (15, 1) (15, 11) (27, 29) (27, 25) (27, 1) (27, 10) (17, 25) (17, 5) (17, 24) (10, 29) (10, 26) (10, 27) (0, 22) (0, 8) (0, 24) (23, 28) (23, 14) (7, 29) (4, 19) (4, 11) (9, 16) (19, 28) (19, 4) (12, 18) (12, 14) (16, 13) (16, 22) (16, 6) (16, 9) (14, 5) (14, 28) (14, 23) (14, 12) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 15) (11, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be visually represented as follows:

```plaintext
0 -- 8 -- 3 -- 2 -- 29
|    |    |    |    |
24 - 21 -- 1    7    27 -- 25 -- 17 -- 5
|    |         |    |         |    |
20 - 22        15 -- 11 -- 13 -- 16 -- 6
|    |         |              |    |    |
|    |         10             9    28 - 14
|    |         |
26   24 -- 17 -- 25
|    |    |    |
|    0 -- 8    4
|         |
23 -- 14 - 12 -- 18
      |

Next, let's construct the Degree-Based Ordering based on the number of connections for each node (vertices) from least to most:

Nodes sorted by number of connections (ascending):
1. 9
2. 7
3. 12, 15, 19, 20, 21, 23, 26, 4
4. 1, 5, 10, 27
5. 0, 3, 13, 14, 18, 22, 28
6. 2, 6, 8, 11, 16, 24, 25, 29

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The total number of triangles is [54].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 6, 16>
<0, 6, 11>
<1, 10, 27>
<2, 6, 16>
<2, 6, 29>
<2, 8, 29>
<2, 18, 29>
<3, 8, 21>
<3, 8, 24>
<3, 21, 24>
<5, 17, 24>
<5, 17, 25>
<5, 14, 28>
<6, 11, 16>
<6, 14, 28>
<6, 16, 22>
<6, 16, 13>
<10, 26, 29>
<11, 15, 27>
<11, 13, 22>
<11, 13, 16>
