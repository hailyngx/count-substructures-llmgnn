Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 22) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 0) (20, 7) (20, 13) (25, 8) (25, 29) (25, 28) (25, 2) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 27) (17, 4) (24, 26) (24, 28) (24, 29) (26, 10) (26, 24) (26, 15) (26, 11) (26, 0) (15, 5) (15, 26) (16, 9) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 12) (23, 12) (8, 25) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 20) (13, 17) (1, 6) (1, 18) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 22) (22, 5) (22, 4) (22, 21) (0, 6) (0, 26) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 25) (3, 17) (3, 0) (7, 20) (7, 8) (29, 25) (29, 10) (29, 24) (14, 8) (14, 21) (12, 10) (12, 19) (12, 23) (21, 22) (21, 14) (21, 27) (27, 17) (27, 21) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 28) (28, 25) (28, 24) (28, 18) (11, 6) (11, 26) (11, 8) (11, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method first involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then, we will relabel the vertices and count the triangles based on the algorithm mentioned earlier.

After sorting the vertices by their degrees, we have the following labels:
Vertices: 3  7  21  23  27   1   6   0   11   12   14   18   20   22   5   9   16   19   8   13   17   24   10   26   29   2   4   15   28   25
