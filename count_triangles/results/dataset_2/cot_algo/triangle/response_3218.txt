Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) 

Response:
The vertices in order of increasing degree are: 
Node 10 with degree 1
Node 12 with degree 1
Node 13 with degree 2
Node 15 with degree 2
Node 3 with degree 3
Node 6 with degree 3
Node 9 with degree 3
Node 5 with degree 4
Node 1 with degree 5
Node 0 with degree 5
Node 4 with degree 6
Node 7 with degree 6
Node 14 with degree 6
Node 2 with degree 7
Node 8 with degree 7

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges accordingly. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 11>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 11>
<2, 4, 14>
<3, 4, 5>
<5, 7, 11>
<5, 7, 14>
<6, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 11>
<7, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 11>
<7, 8, 14>
<8, 9, 14>
<11, 12, 14>

There are a total of [16] triangles in the given graph.
