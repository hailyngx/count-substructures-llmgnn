Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 19) (6, 16) (6, 8) (10, 11) (2, 5) (2, 8) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 13) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 17) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 18) (13, 7) (15, 8) (15, 7) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 19) (7, 13) (7, 15) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 3) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 14) (3, 0) (3, 12) (19, 9) (19, 0) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 0) (17, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degrees (number of connections) and relabeling them accordingly. 

The sorted nodes with their degrees are:
Node 3: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 10: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 16: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 19: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 15: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 18: degree 5
Node 11: degree 5
Node 8: degree 6
Node 12: degree 6
Node 4: degree 6
Node 17: degree 6

Following the sorting, we observe the edges and only count the triangles where the lower labeled node has fewer connections. 

Triangles found:
<0, 16, 6>
<0, 16, 8>
<0, 17, 4>
<0, 19, 9>
<2, 5, 13>
<2, 5, 17>
<4, 11, 14>
<4, 11, 18>
<4, 17, 0>
<4, 17, 12>
<6, 8, 16>
<8, 12, 17>
<9, 18, 13>
<13, 5, 17>
<14, 11, 18>

Total number of triangles: [15]
