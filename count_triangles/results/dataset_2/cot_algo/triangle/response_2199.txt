Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 9) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 15) (4, 7) (4, 23) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 21) (21, 7) (21, 26) (21, 29) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 27) (25, 13) (25, 18) (25, 14) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 23) (14, 25) (19, 26) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 27) (26, 21) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 2) (9, 11) (9, 22) (22, 9) (22, 24) (22, 20) (22, 29) (6, 10) (6, 20) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 26) (2, 10) (12, 16) (12, 8) (23, 4) (23, 0) (23, 26) (23, 1) (1, 23) (1, 10) (29, 21) (29, 19) (29, 22) (17, 4) (17, 8) (13, 25) (13, 6) (13, 20) (13, 18) (24, 22) (24, 27) (24, 5) (27, 3) (27, 19) (27, 24) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 1) (18, 25) (18, 0) (18, 13) (8, 12) (8, 17) (20, 22) (20, 6) (20, 13) (20, 28) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 28) (5, 24) (5, 15) (5, 28) (28, 20) (28, 15) (28, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently in the graph by sorting the vertices based on their degrees. 

The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is as follows:
Vertex 13 - Degree 4
Vertex 0 - Degree 3
Vertex 1 - Degree 3
Vertex 8 - Degree 2
Vertex 15 - Degree 3
Vertex 16 - Degree 4
Vertex 17 - Degree 2
Vertex 18 - Degree 3
Vertex 21 - Degree 3
Vertex 23 - Degree 4
Vertex 25 - Degree 3
Vertex 27 - Degree 3
Vertex 2 - Degree 4
Vertex 5 - Degree 3
Vertex 6 - Degree 3
Vertex 7 - Degree 2
Vertex 9 - Degree 2
Vertex 10 - Degree 3
Vertex 12 - Degree 2
Vertex 26 - Degree 4
Vertex 29 - Degree 4
Vertex 3 - Degree 3
Vertex 4 - Degree 4
Vertex 19 - Degree 4
Vertex 20 - Degree 3
Vertex 22 - Degree 4
Vertex 24 - Degree 3
Vertex 11 - Degree 3
Vertex 28 - Degree 3

Now, let's count the triangles and list them:
