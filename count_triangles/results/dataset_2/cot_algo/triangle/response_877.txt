Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given edges first:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 4), (9, 4), (9, 1), (9, 0), (6, 5), (6, 3), (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 2), (8, 5), (8, 2), (8, 3), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (0, 9), (0, 2), (0, 3), (7, 3), (7, 1), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 2), (1, 7), (3, 6), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 2), (3, 0), (3, 7)

Next, we'll use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles. 

After sorting the vertices based on their degrees and relabeling them accordingly, the new order (from least connected to most connected) is:

Nodes: {6, 7, 0, 8, 9, 5, 1, 2, 4, 3}

Now, we will count the triangles based on the specified method:

- For edge (5, 9): Each has 4 common neighbors (1, 4, 8, 6) forming 4 triangles, <5, 9, 1>, <5, 9, 4>, <5, 9, 8>, <5, 9, 6>
- For the rest of the edges, no triangles are formed as the lower labeled vertex always has more connections than the higher labeled vertex.

Finally, we count the total number of triangles:

The unique triangles are:
<5, 9, 1>, <5, 9, 4>, <5, 9, 8>, <5, 9, 6>
