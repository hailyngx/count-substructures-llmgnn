Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 27) (15, 1) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 2) (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 8) (1, 15) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 13) (21, 27) (21, 0) (21, 29) (26, 1) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 17) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 26) (17, 29) (17, 25) (29, 21) (29, 17) (29, 23) (29, 11) (10, 4) (10, 23) (10, 5) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 9) (6, 1) (6, 25) (6, 16) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 22) (4, 2) (22, 3) (22, 4) (22, 11) (22, 24) (25, 17) (25, 6) (16, 5) (16, 6) (16, 24) (16, 20) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 8) (24, 9) (24, 13) (2, 27) (2, 4) (2, 13) (20, 26) (20, 16) (20, 18) (8, 0) (8, 24) (9, 19) (9, 24) (9, 7) (12, 14) (12, 18) (13, 1) (13, 24) (13, 2) (11, 26) (11, 29) (11, 22) (28, 7) (7, 9) (7, 28) (18, 20) (18, 12) (23, 29) (23, 10) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]

Edges: [(3, 15), (3, 17), (3, 22), (15, 27), (15, 1), (27, 0), (27, 21), (27, 2), (0, 21), (0, 8), (1, 26), (1, 6), (1, 13), (21, 29), (26, 20), (26, 11), (26, 17), (14, 12), (17, 29), (17, 25), (29, 23), (10, 4), (10, 5), (5, 19), (19, 9), (6, 25), (16, 24), (2, 13), (20, 18), (8, 24), (7, 28), (18, 12), (23, 10)]

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:
Nodes by degree: {14: 1, 7: 1, 28: 1, 0: 2, 2: 2, 13: 2, 10: 2, 12: 2, 18: 2, 11: 3, 4: 3, 5: 3, 6: 3, 9: 3, 8: 3, 23: 3, 16: 4, 20: 4, 26: 4, 15: 4, 25: 4, 1: 4, 29: 4, 3: 4, 17: 4, 22: 4, 24: 5, 19: 5, 27: 5, 21: 5}

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Total number of triangles: [26]

Unique triangles: 
<4, 10, 22>
<0, 21, 27>
<2, 13, 24>
<4, 19, 24>
<1, 15, 26>
<4, 16, 24>
<6, 16, 25>
<4, 17, 26>
<5, 16, 24>
<3, 15, 27>
<10, 23, 29>
<6, 16, 20>
<9, 19, 24>
<11, 22, 26>
<6, 16, 24>
<7, 9, 24>
<12, 14, 18>
<17, 25, 29>
<8, 24, 27>
<13, 2, 27>
<8, 24, 9>
<17, 29, 23>
<1, 6, 25>
