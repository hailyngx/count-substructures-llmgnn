Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
Let's start by representing the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0 connects to: 7, 6, 5
- 1 connects to: 2, 5, 8
- 2 connects to: 1, 6, 8
- 3 connects to: 4, 6, 8
- 4 connects to: 7, 9, 3
- 5 connects to: 7, 1, 6, 8, 0
- 6 connects to: 3, 9, 5, 2, 8, 0
- 7 connects to: 4, 0, 9, 5, 8
- 8 connects to: 7, 1, 3, 6, 5, 2
- 9 connects to: 4, 7, 6

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:
Nodes by degree: 1, 2, 9, 0, 5, 4, 8, 3, 6, 7

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed by the lower-degree node in the pair. 

Count of triangles inside brackets []: [3]

Unique triangles:
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 7>
