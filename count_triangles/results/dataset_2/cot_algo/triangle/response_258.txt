Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections). 

Nodes and their degrees:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, let's list the edges based on the node with the lower label having fewer connections:

Edges in the order of processing:
(1, 7), (4, 8), (4, 5), (4, 2), (2, 8), (2, 5), (2, 7)

Now, let's count the triangles formed by these edges:
- Triangle <4, 5, 8>
- Triangle <2, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
