Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (2, 14) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 6) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 19) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 9) (8, 19) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 17) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 4) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 12) (19, 6) (19, 15) (19, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 16) (16, 10) (16, 7) (16, 12) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 18) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 16) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Nodes and their degrees:
Node 0 : 4
Node 1 : 4
Node 2 : 2
Node 3 : 3
Node 4 : 3
Node 5 : 3
Node 6 : 5
Node 7 : 4
Node 8 : 1
Node 9 : 3
Node 10 : 3
Node 11 : 3
Node 12 : 4
Node 13 : 3
Node 14 : 3
Node 15 : 3
Node 16 : 3
Node 17 : 3
Node 18 : 2
Node 19 : 3

Based on their degrees, we reorder the nodes from lowest degree to highest degree:
Lowest degree: 8, 2, 18
Next set: 9, 14, 17
Next set: 10, 11, 15, 16
Next set: 0, 1, 7
Next set: 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 19
Highest degree: 6

Now, we will count the triangles using the degree-based ordering:

[Total number of triangles: 4]
<2, 4, 18>
<3, 9, 17>
<4, 9, 13>
<4, 9, 17>
