Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 11) (15, 16) (4, 8) (4, 17) (7, 19) (7, 18) (7, 13) (5, 17) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 11) (17, 4) (17, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (1, 10) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 1) (18, 7) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 12) (18, 13) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 0) (12, 18) (12, 16) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 12) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (13, 7) (13, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method provides the following sorted list of vertices based on their number of connections [vertex: degree]:

```
0: 4
1: 3
4: 3
5: 2
6: 1
9: 2
12: 2
13: 2
16: 3
3: 4
7: 3
10: 3
15: 4
17: 2
2: 4
8: 5
11: 4
14: 2
18: 5
19: 4
```

Now, let's count the triangles based on the method described. The triangles found are:

1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <0, 2, 19>
3. <0, 3, 15>
4. <0, 15, 16>
5. <1, 10, 8>
6. <2, 8, 10>
7. <2, 8, 11>
8. <2, 8, 19>
9. <7, 13, 18>
10. <7, 18, 19>
11. <8, 10, 11>
12. <8, 10, 16>
13. <8, 11, 14>
14. <8, 16, 12>
15. <8, 16, 15>
16. <10, 11, 15>
17. <11, 14, 5>
18. <13, 7, 18>
19. <13, 18, 19>
20. <15, 16, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [20].
