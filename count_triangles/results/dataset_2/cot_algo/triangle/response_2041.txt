Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 6) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 16) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (9, 16) (9, 19) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 17) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 7) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 0) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 1) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 18) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 0) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 18) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 11) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 19) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 12) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 2) (16, 18) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 19) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Node 3: degree 2
Node 14: degree 2
Node 18: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 9: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 19: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 12: degree 3
Node 15: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 11: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 17: degree 3

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now check for triangles:

Total number of triangles: [14]
