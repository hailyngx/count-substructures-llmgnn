Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The vertices arranged according to their degrees are:  
\[0 : 4, 1 : 4, 6 : 4, 8 : 4, 5 : 4, 9 : 6, 3 : 5, 7 : 5, 2 : 5, 4 : 6\]

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph:

Looking at the edge (5, 9):
- 5 and 9 share connections with 8 and 0.
- Therefore, there is one unique triangle <5, 8, 9>.

Looking at the edge (5, 2):
- 5 and 2 share connections with 8.
- Therefore, there is one unique triangle <5, 8, 2>.

Looking at the edge (5, 8):
- As 5 is connected to 9 and 2 is also connected to 9, there is no unique triangle formed by this edge.

Looking at the edge (5, 0):
- As 9 and 0 both are connected to 7 and 4, there is no unique triangle formed by this edge.

Remaining edges are similarly analyzed, with their triangles counted:
- (9, 8): <9, 4, 8>
- (9, 3): <9, 4, 3>
- (9, 7): <9, 4, 7>
- (9, 0): No triangles
- (4, 7): <4, 1, 7>
- (4, 8): <4, 1, 8>
- (4, 0): No triangles
- (4, 6): <4, 1, 6>
- (4, 3): <4, 1, 3>
- (7, 9): <7, 4, 9>
- (7, 4): <7, 1, 4>
- (7, 2): <7, 1, 2>
- (7, 8): <7, 1, 8>
- (7, 1): No triangles
- (1, 7): <1, 4, 7>
- (1, 3): <1, 4, 3>
- (1, 6): <1, 4, 6>
- (1, 2): <1, 7, 2>
- (3, 9): <3, 4, 9>
- (3, 4): <3, 1, 4>
- (3, 1): <3, 4, 1>
- (3, 2): <3, 1, 2>
- (6, 4): <6, 1, 4>
- (6, 1): <6, 4, 1>
- (8, 5): <8, 5, 2>
- (8, 9): <8, 4, 9>
- (8, 4): <8, 1, 4>
- (8, 7): <8, 1, 7>
- (0, 5): No triangles
- (0, 9): No triangles
- (0, 4): No triangles
- (2, 5): <2, 8, 5>
- (2, 7): <2, 1, 7>
- (2, 1): <2, 1, 7>
- (2, 3): <2, 1, 3>
