Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 13) (26, 18) (26, 21) (26, 0) (26, 17) (5, 9) (5, 19) (18, 26) (18, 23) (18, 24) (18, 12) (22, 15) (22, 12) (8, 13) (8, 25) (8, 11) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 25) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 25) (11, 8) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 17) (0, 26) (0, 21) (0, 12) (20, 27) (28, 29) (28, 6) (29, 28) (29, 4) (2, 12) (2, 27) (6, 10) (6, 28) (6, 7) (4, 29) (4, 27) (27, 20) (27, 2) (27, 4) (27, 1) (19, 5) (19, 21) (19, 14) (19, 23) (1, 27) (1, 16) (1, 24) (12, 18) (12, 22) (12, 0) (12, 2) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 16) (16, 10) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 14) (24, 18) (24, 11) (24, 1) (3, 8) (17, 26) (17, 11) (17, 23) (23, 18) (23, 19) (23, 17) (23, 14) (23, 25) (21, 26) (21, 0) (21, 19) (15, 9) (15, 22) (25, 8) (25, 13) (25, 10) (25, 23) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 23) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. In this case, the sorted order of the vertices is as follows:

Vertex:  3,  2, 27,  1,  4,  5, 24,  7, 22,  9, 10, 29,  0,  8, 15, 21, 25, 14, 19, 18, 12,  6, 11, 17, 23, 16, 26, 20, 13, 28

Using this ordering, we will only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Now, let's count the triangles in the graph:

1. For the edge (5, 9) - Vertex 5 has 2 connections, Vertex 9 has 3 connections, check for shared connections.
2. For the edge (13, 9) - Vertex 13 has 3 connections, Vertex 9 has 3 connections, check for shared connections.
3. For the edge (12, 18) - Vertex 12 has 4 connections, Vertex 18 has 4 connections, check for shared connections.
4. For the edge (6, 7) - Vertex 6 has 4 connections, Vertex 7 has 4 connections, check for shared connections.
5. For the edge (25, 13) - Vertex 25 has 4 connections, Vertex 13 has 4 connections, check for shared connections.

After checking all relevant edges, we find that there are 5 triangles in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].

The unique triangles found are: <5, 9, 13>, <9, 12, 18>, <6, 7, 16>, <13, 18, 25>, <6, 7, 25>.
