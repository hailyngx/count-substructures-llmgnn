Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 10) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 15) (2, 18) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 0) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 15) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 19) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 7) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 7) (15, 10) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 11) (17, 5) (4, 2) (4, 14) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 4) (5, 17) (5, 1) (1, 12) (1, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(6, 9), (6, 14), (6, 7), (6, 19), (9, 15), (9, 11), (9, 13), (8, 13), (8, 19), (8, 10), 
(13, 12), (13, 15), (2, 18), (2, 4), (2, 0), (18, 19), (18, 10), 
(7, 12), (7, 0), (7, 15), (11, 3), (11, 19), 
(0, 18), (0, 7), (10, 15), (15, 7), 
(5, 17), (5, 1)

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):
Vertices in increasing order of degrees: 
(5, 17), (1, 3), (4, 5), (12, 6), (10, 8), (8, 10), (18, 10), (7, 11), (11, 11), (0, 12), 
(3, 12), (19, 12), (14, 12), (2, 12), (13, 12), (15, 12), (6, 14), (9, 14)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [70]
Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 18>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 19>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 7, 12>, <0, 7, 15>, <0, 7, 18>, <0, 10, 18>, <0, 10, 15>, <0, 18, 19>, 
<0, 10, 8>, <0, 12, 13>, <0, 12, 15>, <0, 13, 15>, <0, 15, 10>, <0, 19, 18>, 
<1, 5, 17>, <1, 5, 12>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 12>, 
<2, 19, 6>, <2, 19, 8>, <2, 19, 11>, <2, 19, 18>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 14>, <2, 4, 18>, <2, 4, 14>, <2, 18, 10>, 
<3, 11, 9>, <3, 11, 13>, <3, 11, 14>, <3, 11, 15>, 
<4, 2, 6>, <4, 2, 14>, <4, 14, 6>, 
<5, 1, 12>, <5, 1, 12>, <5, 12, 7>, <5, 12, 7>, <5, 12, 14>, 
<6, 9, 15>, <6, 9, 11>, <6, 9, 13>, <6, 7, 15>, <6, 7, 12>, <6, 14, 3>, <6, 9, 11>, 
<7, 12, 13>, <7, 12, 1>, <7, 12, 13>, <7, 12, 1>, <7, 15, 13>, <7, 15, 10>, 
<8, 10, 18>, <8, 10, 15>, <8, 10, 18>, <8, 13, 15>, <8, 13, 10>, 
<9, 11, 19>, <9, 13, 12>, <9, 13, 15>, <9, 13, 15>, 
<10, 15, 7>, <10, 15, 18>, <10, 18, 19>, 
<11, 3, 14>, <11, 19, 18>, 
<12, 13, 15>, 
<13, 15, 7>, 
<14, 3, 4>
