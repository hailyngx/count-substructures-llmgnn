Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 10) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 12) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:

Vertex 3 (Degree: 2)
Vertex 0 (Degree: 3)
Vertex 9 (Degree: 4)
Vertex 12 (Degree: 4)
Vertex 2 (Degree: 4)
Vertex 10 (Degree: 4)
Vertex 13 (Degree: 4)
Vertex 1 (Degree: 5)
Vertex 11 (Degree: 5)
Vertex 5 (Degree: 6)
Vertex 6 (Degree: 6)
Vertex 8 (Degree: 6)
Vertex 4 (Degree: 7)
Vertex 7 (Degree: 7)
Vertex 14 (Degree: 7)

Now, we will proceed with counting the triangles:

[Number of triangles: 9]

Unique triangles:
<5, 9, 7>
<5, 4, 7>
<5, 6, 1>
<9, 8, 2>
<12, 7, 0>
<2, 8, 1>
<4, 14, 11>
<8, 3, 1>
<10, 13, 6>
