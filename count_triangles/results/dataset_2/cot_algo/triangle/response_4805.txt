Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 5) (15, 27) (15, 5) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 23) (27, 6) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 12) (28, 16) (28, 1) (29, 10) (29, 5) (7, 12) (7, 20) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 7) (9, 22) (9, 24) (9, 3) (9, 1) (22, 9) (22, 19) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 27) (4, 3) (4, 20) (20, 7) (20, 4) (20, 21) (20, 24) (14, 11) (14, 26) (14, 13) (26, 14) (26, 21) (6, 27) (6, 24) (6, 2) (24, 9) (24, 20) (24, 6) (24, 8) (19, 22) (19, 0) (25, 8) (18, 16) (18, 13) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 29) (5, 23) (23, 27) (23, 5) (23, 1) (1, 11) (1, 28) (1, 9) (1, 23) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 24) (8, 25) (8, 0) (21, 20) (21, 26) (13, 14) (13, 18) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 2) (0, 8)
