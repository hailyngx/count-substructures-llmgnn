Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 6) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 2) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 9) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 12) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0: 14
1: 3, 5, 11
2: 4, 7, 9
3: 1, 5, 7, 14
4: 2, 6, 10, 12, 14
5: 1, 3, 7, 11, 13
6: 4, 12, 13
7: 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
8: 7, 11, 14
9: 2, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14
10: 4, 9, 12, 13
11: 1, 8, 11, 12
12: 4, 6, 9, 10, 11
13: 5, 6, 7, 9, 10
14: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
```

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Start by sorting the vertices by the number of connections:
```
0 < 1 < 2 < 7 < 8 < 6 < 3 < 5 < 4 < 9 < 10 < 11 < 12 < 13 < 14
```

2. Count the number of triangles by checking shared connections between the two vertices of each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
```
Total number of triangles: [22]
```

Unique triangles found:
```
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 11>
<1, 5, 13>
<1, 11, 12>
<2, 4, 12>
<2, 4, 14>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 14>
<4, 10, 12>
<4, 10, 13>
<4, 12, 10>
<4, 12, 9>
<6, 10, 12>
<6, 10, 13>
<7, 8, 11>
<7, 8, 14>
<9, 10, 12>
<9, 10, 13>
<9, 12, 10>
<9, 12, 14>
<9, 13, 10>
<9, 13, 12>
