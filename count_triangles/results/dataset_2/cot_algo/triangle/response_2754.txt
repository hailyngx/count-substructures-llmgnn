Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 7) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 25) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 16) (27, 4) (27, 23) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 28) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 2) (0, 7) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 12) (21, 10) (21, 2) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 6) (2, 17) (2, 21) (18, 20) (18, 7) (13, 26) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 23) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 29) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 5) (4, 27) (4, 11) (4, 28) (23, 27) (23, 13) (23, 6) (8, 20) (8, 6) (19, 9) (19, 29) (22, 16) (22, 20) (29, 9) (29, 3) (29, 19) (29, 12) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 29) (24, 11) (28, 14) (28, 4) (28, 25) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 23) (6, 8) (6, 16) (20, 18) (20, 8) (20, 22) (25, 26) (25, 28) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 16) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 22) (16, 6) (16, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on the number of connections they have.

The sorted nodes based on their degrees are:
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 26: 4 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 27: 2 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 17: 3 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 21: 2 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 13: 6 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 23: 3 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 19: 3 connections
Node 22: 2 connections
Node 29: 4 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 24: 1 connection
Node 28: 3 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 20: 3 connections
Node 25: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 16: 5 connections

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the edges while considering the vertices in increasing order of connections:

Total number of triangles: [26]

Unique triangles:
