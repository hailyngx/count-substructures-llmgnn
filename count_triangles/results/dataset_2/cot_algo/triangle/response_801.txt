Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 26) (15, 9) (15, 17) (27, 23) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 9) (2, 29) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 1) (29, 6) (29, 19) (20, 25) (20, 18) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 16) (25, 8) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 21) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 24) (11, 28) (11, 7) (11, 21) (28, 11) (28, 3) (28, 12) (24, 17) (24, 26) (24, 6) (24, 4) (26, 15) (26, 24) (26, 3) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 22) (9, 8) (22, 9) (22, 1) (1, 29) (1, 22) (1, 23) (1, 19) (8, 25) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 0) (13, 3) (4, 24) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (19, 29) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 21) (16, 20) (16, 25) (21, 14) (21, 11) (21, 19) (12, 28) (12, 5) (12, 18) (3, 28) (3, 26) (3, 13) (6, 29) (6, 24) (6, 8) (6, 7) (7, 29) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 6) (18, 20) (18, 14) (18, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (23, 27) (23, 1) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. Let's sort the nodes based on their degree, and then count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Sorted nodes with degrees:
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 13: degree 1
- Node 23: degree 1
- Node 27: degree 1
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 22: degree 2
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 4
- Node 21: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 24: degree 4
- Node 25: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 20: degree 3
- Node 26: degree 3
- Node 29: degree 7
