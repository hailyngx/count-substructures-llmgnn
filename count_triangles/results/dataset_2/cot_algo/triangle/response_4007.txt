Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 12) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 1) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 3) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 
0 (degree 4), 5 (degree 4), 9 (degree 4), 13 (degree 4), 6 (degree 4), 1 (degree 4), 7 (degree 4), 2 (degree 4), 14 (degree 4), 8 (degree 4), 10 (degree 3), 3 (degree 3), 11 (degree 3), 12 (degree 3), and 4 (degree 4).

Based on the edges provided and the sorted vertices, the triangles found are:
<0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 14>, <5, 8, 9>, <0, 5, 10>, <2, 0, 10>, <1, 9, 13>, <1, 9, 12>, <4, 8, 11>, <4, 8, 12>, <3, 7, 12>, <3, 7, 13>, <3, 6, 12>, <10, 0, 6>, and <1, 2, 3>.

The total number of triangles is [14].
