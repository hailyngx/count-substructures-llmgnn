Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 14) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 9) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are:  
0(4), 7(1), 12(2), 14(3), 3(3), 10(4), 2(4), 5(4), 1(5), 6(5), 13(5), 11(6), 4(6), 8(6), 9(6)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles formed by the edges by considering the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections:

Triangles:
<0, 9, 1>  
<0, 6, 14>  
<0, 9, 3>  
<1, 5, 2>  
<1, 9, 3>  
<2, 5, 1>  
<3, 7, 9>  
<4, 8, 10>  
<4, 11, 6>  
<5, 8, 2>  
<6, 4, 8>  
<8, 13, 5>  
<9, 1, 11>  
<9, 0, 14>  

Total number of triangles: [14]
