Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 2) (6, 0) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Node 6 : degree 2
Node 7 : degree 3
Node 1 : degree 3
Node 3 : degree 4
Node 0 : degree 5
Node 4 : degree 5
Node 9 : degree 5
Node 2 : degree 5
Node 8 : degree 5
Node 5 : degree 5
