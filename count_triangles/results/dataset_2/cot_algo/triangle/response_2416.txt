Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 17) (10, 11) (10, 18) (17, 9) (17, 15) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (1, 15) (1, 0) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 19) (18, 10) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 0) (19, 15) (19, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 0) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (7, 18) (7, 19) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 2) (0, 12) (3, 16) (3, 12) (14, 16) (14, 4) (14, 18) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19)

Edges:
- 0: (1, 15), (2, 0), (12, 0), (18, 0)
- 1: (0, 15)
- 2: (0, 12), (6, 2)
- 3: (12, 3), (16, 3)
- 4: (8, 4), (14, 4), (6, 4)
- 5: (8, 5), (13, 5), (9, 5)
- 6: (2, 6), (4, 6), (11, 6)
- 7: (18, 7), (19, 7)
- 8: (5, 8), (9, 8), (4, 8)
- 9: (17, 9), (15, 9), (8, 9), (5, 9)
- 10: (18, 10), (11, 10)
- 11: (10, 11), (16, 11), (6, 11), (13, 11)
- 12: (0, 12), (2, 12), (3, 12), (13, 12)
- 13: (12, 13), (5, 13), (11, 13)
- 14: (4, 14), (18, 14), (16, 14)
- 15: (9, 15), (17, 15), (1, 15), (19, 15)
- 16: (3, 16), (11, 16), (14, 16)
- 17: (9, 17), (15, 17)
- 18: (0, 18), (14, 18), (7, 18), (10, 18)
- 19: (15, 19), (7, 19)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted by degree from least to most:
(1, 7, 10, 16, 17, 19, 4, 8, 18, 5, 14, 3, 6, 0, 12, 13, 9, 15, 11, 2)

Number of triangles: [23]

Unique triangles:
<2, 12, 0>
<0, 2, 6>
<2, 6, 4>
<4, 6, 2>
<0, 12, 3>
<12, 3, 16>
<12, 16, 14>
<0, 18, 10>
<18, 10, 11>
<10, 11, 6>
<0, 12, 13>
<12, 13, 5>
<12, 5, 8>
<12, 8, 4>
<0, 18, 14>
<18, 14, 16>
<18, 16, 11>
<14, 16, 11>
<18, 0, 1>
<15, 1, 0>
<15, 0, 2>
<9, 17, 15>
<17, 15, 19>
