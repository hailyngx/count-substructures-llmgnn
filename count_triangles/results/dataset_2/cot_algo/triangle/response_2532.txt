Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 12) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 12) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) 

Response:
The vertices with their number of connections are as follows:
(0: 4), (1: 5), (2: 3), (3: 5), (4: 4), (5: 4), (6: 5), (7: 4), (8: 3), (9: 5), (10: 4), (11: 3), (12: 6), (13: 4), (14: 4)

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
(2, 8, 11), (0, 4, 5, 10, 14), (3, 7, 13), (1, 6, 9, 2), (12)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found in the graph are:
1. <0, 9, 12>
2. <0, 9, 7>
3. <0, 9, 12>
4. <4, 3, 13>
5. <4, 10, 14>
6. <4, 3, 13>
7. <0, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
