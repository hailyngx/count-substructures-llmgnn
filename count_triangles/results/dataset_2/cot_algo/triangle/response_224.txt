Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 4: 5 connections
- Node 9: 5 connections
- Node 2: 6 connections

Next, we'll relabel the nodes based on their degree-order:

- Node 8 (Degree: 1) -> Node 0
- Node 6 (Degree: 4) -> Node 1
- Node 1 (Degree: 4) -> Node 2
- Node 3 (Degree: 4) -> Node 3
- Node 5 (Degree: 4) -> Node 4
- Node 0 (Degree: 4) -> Node 5
- Node 7 (Degree: 4) -> Node 6
- Node 4 (Degree: 5) -> Node 7
- Node 9 (Degree: 5) -> Node 8
- Node 2 (Degree: 6) -> Node 9

Now, we'll list the triangles formed by the shared connections:

- Triangle 1: <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 2>
- Triangle 3: <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle 4: <0, 3, 1>
- Triangle 5: <0, 3, 2>
- Triangle 6: <0, 5, 1>
- Triangle 7: <0, 5, 4>
- Triangle 8: <1, 4, 5>
- Triangle 9: <1, 2, 5>
- Triangle 10: <1, 2, 3>
- Triangle 11: <1, 2, 4>
- Triangle 12: <1, 3, 5>
- Triangle 13: <2, 4, 5>
- Triangle 14: <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle 15: <2, 4, 3>
- Triangle 16: <2, 5, 4>
- Triangle 17: <2, 5, 1>
- Triangle 18: <2, 5, 3>
- Triangle 19: <3, 5, 4>
- Triangle 20: <4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [20].
