Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 17) (7, 8) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 16) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 0) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 0) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 9) (15, 12) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 5) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (16, 2) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 10) (18, 5) (18, 16) (13, 10) (13, 6) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 9) (6, 13) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: 
(4, 7) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 17) (7, 8) (14, 9) (14, 12) (17, 1) (10, 11) 
(10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 13) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 16) (1, 16) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 5) 
(3, 8) (3, 9) (0, 5) (9, 3) (9, 12) (16, 18) (18, 16) (13, 6)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes in increasing order of degree with corresponding degrees: 
{6: 1, 4: 2, 15: 2, 0: 3, 2: 3, 5: 3, 13: 3, 16: 3, 14: 4, 12: 4, 
8: 4, 10: 4, 11: 4, 1: 5, 9: 5, 18: 5, 19: 5, 17: 5, 3: 6, 7: 6}

We will now count the number of triangles:

[Number of triangles: 16]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 5, 18>
<0, 5, 19>
<0, 17, 5>
<0, 17, 1>
<1, 0, 5>
<1, 0, 17>
<1, 16, 2>
<1, 16, 18>
<2, 8, 3>
<2, 8, 7>
<3, 8, 7>
<3, 9, 14>
<4, 11, 10>
<7, 3, 8>
<9, 3, 8>
<9, 12, 14>
