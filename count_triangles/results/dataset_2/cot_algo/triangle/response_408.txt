Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 9) (21, 7) (21, 28) (7, 21) (7, 24) (7, 23) (22, 14) (22, 6) (22, 8) (23, 7) (23, 11) (23, 0) (0, 23) (0, 14) (0, 15) (20, 6) (20, 10) (20, 16) (14, 22) (14, 0) (14, 15) (14, 5) (17, 1) (17, 29) (17, 4) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 25) (28, 21) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 2) (5, 1) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 8) (13, 5) (13, 25) (8, 22) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 28) (9, 8) (11, 23) (11, 26) (11, 2) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (2, 28) (2, 11) (2, 12) (6, 22) (6, 20) (6, 24) (24, 7) (24, 6) (24, 18) (24, 10) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 26) (15, 18) (26, 11) (26, 15) (26, 27) (3, 4) (3, 18) (27, 29) (27, 26) (27, 19) (25, 29) (25, 13) (25, 16) (16, 1) (16, 20) (16, 25) (18, 24) (18, 15) (18, 3) (10, 20) (10, 24) (19, 28) (19, 27) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections) in increasing order. The list of vertices with their degrees is as follows:

(3: 2), (29: 3), (27: 3), (26: 3), (18: 3), (10: 3), (12: 3), (17: 3), (4: 3), (6: 3), (25: 3), (24: 4), (13: 2), (8: 3), (11: 3), (0: 3), (2: 3), (15: 4), (20: 3), (5: 4), (23: 4), (22: 4), (14: 4), (9: 3), (7: 4), (19: 2), (1: 4), (21: 2), (16: 4), (28: 4)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices should be relabeled as follows:
(3 → 1), (29 → 2), (27 → 3), (26 → 4), (18 → 5), (10 → 6), (12 → 7), (17 → 8), (4 → 9), (6 → 10), (25 → 11), (24 → 12), (13 → 13), (8 → 14), (11 → 15), (0 → 16), (2 → 17), (15 → 18), (20 → 19), (5 → 20), (23 → 21), (22 → 22), (14 → 23), (9 → 24), (7 → 25), (19 → 26), (1 → 27), (21 → 28), (16 → 29), (28 → 30)

After relabeling the vertices, we can now count the number of triangles formed by the edges. 

The total number of triangles found is [54]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 26, 29>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 17, 20>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 10, 12>, <6, 10, 24>, <7, 24, 25>, <8, 9, 28>, <11, 15, 26>, <13, 16, 25>, <15, 18, 26>, <18, 24, 3>, <18, 24, 15>, <19, 27, 28>, <20, 16, 25>, <24, 10, 6>
