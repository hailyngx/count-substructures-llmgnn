Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 8) (9, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 19) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 15) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 21) (8, 18) (28, 6) (28, 3) (28, 0) (28, 2) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 23) (15, 4) (15, 1) (15, 25) (20, 2) (20, 19) (20, 5) (20, 16) (29, 0) (29, 5) (5, 17) (5, 20) (5, 29) (5, 19) (5, 25) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 20) (19, 5) (14, 1) (14, 26) (26, 14) (26, 11) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 22) (16, 20) (16, 7) (16, 2) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 24) (11, 26) (11, 12) (24, 3) (24, 2) (25, 6) (25, 15) (25, 5) (2, 28) (2, 20) (2, 16) (2, 24) (0, 4) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 21) (18, 8) (18, 23) (18, 27) (18, 13) (23, 17) (23, 1) (23, 18) (21, 8) (21, 0) (27, 18) (27, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 22) (22, 7) (22, 12) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 27) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degrees first. Let's list the nodes and their degrees:

Node 6: degree 4
Node 9: degree 1
Node 28: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 10: degree 2
Node 17: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 15: degree 3
Node 20: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5
Node 19: degree 4
Node 1: degree 2
Node 14: degree 2
Node 26: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 11: degree 2
Node 24: degree 2
Node 25: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 21: degree 2
Node 18: degree 4
Node 27: degree 2
Node 12: degree 3
Node 22: degree 2
Node 13: degree 3
Node 29: degree 2

Now, we label the nodes accordingly starting from the node with the least degree and breaking ties arbitrarily:

Node 9: label 0
Node 10: label 1
Node 26: label 2
Node 1: label 3
Node 14: label 4
Node 11: label 5
Node 24: label 6
Node 13: label 7
Node 27: label 8
Node 22: label 9
Node 7: label 10
Node 3: label 11
Node 2: label 12
Node 12: label 13
Node 20: label 14
Node 17: label 15
Node 4: label 16
Node 15: label 17
Node 8: label 18
Node 21: label 19
Node 18: label 20
Node 5: label 21
Node 19: label 22
Node 16: label 23
Node 0: label 24
Node 29: label 25
Node 6: label 26
Node 25: label 27
Node 28: label 28

Now, we check the edges based on the labels. We will only consider edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:

1. (6, 9): Not considered (label 0 has a higher degree than label 26).
2. (6, 28): Not considered (label 26 has a lower degree than label 28).
