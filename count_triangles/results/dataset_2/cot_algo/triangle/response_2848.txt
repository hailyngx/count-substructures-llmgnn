Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 10) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 4) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 17) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 13) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 1) (17, 6) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 9) (10, 0) (18, 11) (18, 5) (12, 2) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 6) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 17) (6, 4) (7, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections.

After sorting the vertices based on their degrees from least to most:
Nodes: 7, 12, 0, 5, 2, 1, 18, 4, 13, 8, 17, 15, 10, 14, 6, 3, 9, 16, 11

By following the guideline to only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will analyze each edge to count the triangles.

The total number of triangles [ ] is:
[ 12 ]
