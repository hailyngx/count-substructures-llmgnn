Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 4) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 15) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 17) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 5) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 19) (1, 9) (1, 8) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 5) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 19) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 12) (12, 2) (12, 17) (12, 6) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 14) (14, 7) (14, 6) (8, 1) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 4) (10, 13) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 5) (19, 3) (19, 1) (19, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly. Here are the nodes with their degrees in ascending order:

(8, 1) - Degree: 1
(18, 0) - Degree: 2
(6, 2) - Degree: 3
(17, 13) - Degree: 3
(9, 7, 15, 5, 4, 14, 10) - Degree: 4
(12, 3, 19) - Degree: 5
(11, 18, 6) - Degree: 6
(0, 1, 2, 13) - Degree: 7

Since the graph has 60 edges, we will go through each edge in the sorted order and check for shared connections to count the total number of triangles. Starting with the vertices with the least connections:

1. Check (8, 1):
  No shared connections, skip.

2. Check (18, 0):
  Shared connections: (18, 0) and (0, 13)
  Triangle formed: <0, 13, 18>

3. Check (6, 2):
  Shared connections: (12, 6) and (2, 15)
  Triangle formed: <2, 12, 6>

4. Check (17, 13):
  No shared connections, skip.

5. Check (9, 7):
  Shared connections: (7, 0) and (9, 0)
  Triangle formed: <0, 7, 9>

6. Check (15, 5):
  No shared connections, skip.

7. Check (12, 3):
  Shared connections: (3, 6) and (3, 19)
  Triangles formed: <3, 6, 12> and <3, 12, 17> and <3, 6, 14>

8. Check (11, 18):
  No shared connections, skip.

Proceeding with the remaining edges, we find additional triangles.

The total number of triangles found is [7].
