Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 17) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 18) (7, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 6) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 1) (0, 7) (0, 19) (15, 1) (15, 5) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 19) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 14) (18, 8) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 10) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 19) (19, 0) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 10) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 10) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree from least to most are as follows:
Vertex 7 has degree 1,
Vertices 2, 9, and 12 have degree 2,
Vertices 0, 3, and 15 have degree 2,
Vertices 1 and 19 have degree 3,
Vertices 6, 11, and 16 have degree 3,
Vertices 4 and 18 have degree 4,
Vertices 5 and 17 have degree 5,
Vertices 8 and 14 have degree 5,
Vertices 10 have degree 6,
Vertices 13 have degree 7.

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 16]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 17>
<0, 6, 19>
<0, 19, 10>
<1, 6, 19>
<1, 15, 5>
<1, 17, 8>
<2, 9, 14>
<3, 12, 6>
<3, 13, 14>
<4, 13, 3>
<4, 13, 14>
<5, 10, 19>
<5, 10, 18>
<5, 15, 1>
<5, 18, 10>
<8, 17, 4>
