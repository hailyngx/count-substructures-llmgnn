Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 13) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 5) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 13) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 0) (5, 12) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 13) 

Response:
By constructing the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges given, we can sort the vertices by their degree to apply the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The sorted list of vertices by degree is as follows:
(5) - Node 4
(5) - Node 8
(6) - Node 7
(6) - Node 9
(6) - Node 11
(6) - Node 14
(6) - Node 0
(6) - Node 5
(6) - Node 10
(7) - Node 1
(7) - Node 12
(7) - Node 3
(8) - Node 13
(8) - Node 2
(9) - Node 6

Now, based on the rule of processing edges only when the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we check the edges to count the triangles. 

The number of triangles found in the graph is: [27]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 6, 12>
<0, 11, 12>
<0, 11, 13>
<0, 12, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 12>
<1, 3, 10>
<1, 12, 5>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 13>
<2, 8, 14>
<2, 13, 14>
<3, 6, 10>
<4, 8, 11>
<4, 8, 14>
<7, 8, 14>
<7, 13, 14>
<10, 6, 13>
<11, 12, 13>
<11, 13, 14>
<12, 5, 0>
<12, 5, 11>
