Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 0) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 10) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 8) (3, 8) (3, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 13), (7, 4), (7, 12), (7, 10), (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 10), (6, 2), (6, 11), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 14), (9, 1), (9, 13), (12, 7), (12, 2), (12, 10), (12, 0), (2, 6), (2, 12), (2, 8), (2, 13), (2, 11), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 11), (8, 3), (8, 1), (0, 12), (0, 14), (0, 13), (14, 9), (14, 0), (14, 3), (14, 1), (14, 13), (14, 10), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 1), (10, 7), (10, 6), (10, 12), (10, 14), (11, 6), (11, 2), (11, 8), (3, 8), (3, 14), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 14), (1, 5), (13, 4), (13, 9), (13, 2), (13, 0), (13, 14)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes by degree: {3, 0, 5, 11, 10, 7, 4, 1, 12, 8, 13, 2, 6, 14, 9}

Next, we will count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

There are a total of [57] triangles in the graph. 

Unique triangles found are: 
<4, 9, 13>, <6, 9, 14>, <0, 12, 13>, <2, 12, 13>, <2, 8, 11>, <2, 8, 13>, <2, 8, 1>, <2, 11, 6>, <2, 11, 8>, <2, 11, 13>, <2, 13, 14>, <6, 10, 12>, <8, 1, 5>, <8, 1, 14>, <8, 3, 14>, <3, 8, 1>, <3, 8, 14>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 9, 14>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <10, 6, 9>, <10, 6, 12>, <10, 6, 14>, <10, 7, 12>, <11, 6, 2>
