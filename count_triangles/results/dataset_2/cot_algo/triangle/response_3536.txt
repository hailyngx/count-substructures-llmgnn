Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's first list the nodes with their corresponding connections:

Node 0 : 5, 9, 6, 3, 7, 2  
Node 1 : 5, 9, 4, 8  
Node 2 : 5, 3, 7, 8, 0  
Node 3 : 7, 0, 2  
Node 4 : 1, 8  
Node 5 : 9, 2, 1, 0  
Node 6 : 9, 0  
Node 7 : 3, 0, 2, 8  
Node 8 : 9, 1, 4, 7, 2  
Node 9 : 5, 6, 8, 1, 0

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in non-decreasing order:

Node 3 : 1  
Node 6 : 2  
Node 4 : 2  
Node 7 : 2  
Node 1 : 3  
Node 0 : 3  
Node 2 : 4  
Node 8 : 4  
Node 5 : 4  
Node 9 : 5  

Next, let's count the triangles by following the degree-based ordering method as described:

Triangles:  
<0, 5, 9>  
<1, 2, 8>  
<0, 2, 3>  
<0, 8, 9>  

[Total number of triangles: 4]
