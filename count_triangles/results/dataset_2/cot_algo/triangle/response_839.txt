Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The graph sorted by the number of connections for each node is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 5, 6, 5, 8, 4, 7, 2, 9

Edges with lower labeled vertices having fewer connections:
(0, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 6), (2, 9), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 5), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 6)

Triangles found: 
<1, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
