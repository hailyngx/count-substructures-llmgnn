Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, we relabel the vertices according to this ordering. 

The degrees of each node are as follows:
0: degree 3
1: degree 4
2: degree 3
3: degree 4
4: degree 5
5: degree 5
6: degree 4
7: degree 5
8: degree 4
9: degree 3

After relabeling based on degree:
0 -> 1
1 -> 2
2 -> 3
3 -> 4
4 -> 5
5 -> 6
6 -> 7
7 -> 8
8 -> 9
9 -> 10

Now, we will check each edge using the degree-based ordering method to count the number of triangles:

<3, 4, 5>     (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)
<1, 2, 7>     (1, 2), (1, 7), (2, 7)
<1, 3, 4>     (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 4)
<4, 5, 6>     (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)
<1, 5, 7>     (1, 5), (1, 7), (5, 7)
<1, 2, 3>     (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)
<4, 5, 7>     (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 7)
<3, 4, 8>     (3, 4), (3, 8), (4, 8)
<1, 7, 8>     (1, 7), (1, 8), (7, 8)
<2, 4, 7>     (2, 4), (2, 7), (4, 7)

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [10] and the unique triangles found are <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 5, 6>.
