Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 4) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 5) (8, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 8) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 5) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 2) 

Response:
The vertices can be labeled based on their degree. 

Degrees of vertices:  
0 has degree 4  
1 has degree 4  
2 has degree 3  
3 has degree 3  
4 has degree 6  
5 has degree 6  
6 has degree 7  
7 has degree 4  
8 has degree 4  
9 has degree 3  
10 has degree 3  
11 has degree 5  
12 has degree 4  
13 has degree 4  
14 has degree 3  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the edge pairs that fit the criteria (lower label has fewer connections) are:
(1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 13), (3, 1), (3, 11), (11, 3), (2, 14), (2, 5), (5, 2), (5, 8), (8, 5), (13, 1), (13, 0), (13, 7)

Counting the triangles formed by these edge pairs, we find the following triangles:
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 5, 13> 
<3, 1, 11> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
