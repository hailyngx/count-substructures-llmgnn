Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 25) (15, 24) (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 13) (9, 19) (18, 26) (18, 14) (18, 24) (22, 9) (22, 14) (22, 25) (22, 21) (25, 3) (25, 15) (25, 22) (25, 1) (1, 3) (1, 25) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 29) (2, 12) (29, 2) (29, 19) (0, 15) (0, 6) (20, 21) (20, 4) (12, 2) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 8) (27, 12) (27, 26) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 23) (8, 11) (8, 7) (23, 8) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 28) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 21) (21, 6) (21, 22) (21, 20) (21, 11) (19, 9) (19, 29) (26, 18) (26, 27) (26, 17) (17, 23) (17, 26) (17, 16) (14, 18) (14, 22) (16, 17) (16, 4) (7, 8) (7, 23) (7, 10) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 28) (24, 15) (24, 18) (4, 20) (4, 16) (4, 28) (28, 23) (28, 13) (28, 4) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on the number of connections is as follows:
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 16: 1 connection
Node 10: 1 connection
Node 20: 1 connection
Node 29: 2 connections
Node 17: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 19: 3 connections
Node 27: 3 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 21: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 26: 4 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 22: 5 connections
Node 11: 5 connections
Node 12: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 15: 6 connections
Node 23: 6 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 24: 6 connections
Node 25: 6 connections
Node 28: 6 connections

Based on the degree-based ordering method, we will consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Now, let's proceed to count the triangles:

Triangles: [107]
Unique triangles: <12, 13, 28>, <3, 12, 13>, <3, 12, 27>, <3, 13, 28>, <3, 12, 15>, <3, 13, 27>, <3, 12, 24>, <13, 22, 25>, <6, 18, 24>, <7, 8, 23>, <7, 10, 11>, <8, 11, 21>, <0, 15, 25>, <0, 6, 21>, <0, 4, 16>, <0, 4, 28>, <16, 17, 23>, <1, 2, 29>, <1, 25, 22>, <2, 12, 27>, <2, 29, 19>, <2, 27, 26>, <17, 26, 27>, <18, 22, 25>, <9, 13, 28>, <9, 19, 29>, <14, 18, 22>, <18, 26, 17>, <21, 11, 10>, <21, 20, 4>]
