Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 3) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 5) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 2) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the nodes is as follows:
Node 9, degree 4
Node 8, degree 4
Node 13, degree 3
Node 4, degree 4
Node 12, degree 3
Node 11, degree 4
Node 14, degree 5
Node 3, degree 4
Node 7, degree 3
Node 2, degree 5
Node 5, degree 4
Node 1, degree 3
Node 10, degree 4
Node 6, degree 4
Node 0, degree 4

By analyzing the edges and applying the degree-based ordering method:

- Node 5 (degree 4) and Node 8 (degree 4) have 2 shared connections: with Node 12 and Node 0. The shared connections form one triangle: <5, 8, 12>.

- Node 5 (degree 4) and Node 8 (degree 4) also have 1 shared connection: with Node 1. The shared connections form one triangle: <5, 8, 1>.

- Node 5 (degree 4) and Node 8 (degree 4) also have 1 shared connection: with Node 0. The shared connection forms one triangle: <5, 8, 0>.

- Node 10 (degree 4) and Node 14 (degree 5) have 2 shared connections: with Node 4 and Node 3. The shared connections form one triangle: <10, 14, 4>.

- Node 10 (degree 4) and Node 14 (degree 5) also have 1 shared connection: with Node 2. The shared connection forms one triangle: <10, 14, 2>.

- Node 3 (degree 4) and Node 9 (degree 4) have 1 shared connection: with Node 13. The shared connection forms one triangle: <3, 9, 13>.

- Node 3 (degree 4) and Node 9 (degree 4) also have 1 shared connection: with Node 2. The shared connection forms one triangle: <3, 9, 2>.

- Node 0 (degree 4) and Node 8 (degree 4) have 1 shared connection: with Node 11. The shared connection forms one triangle: <0, 8, 11>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
