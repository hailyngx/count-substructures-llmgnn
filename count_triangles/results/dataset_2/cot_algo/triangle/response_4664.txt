Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 10) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
The given graph with the provided edges can be constructed as follows:
Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
Edges:
- 0: [5, 4, 13, 14]
- 1: [5, 7, 6, 10]
- 2: [9, 4, 14, 12, 10]
- 3: [5, 10, 13, 12]
- 4: [0, 11, 6, 2]
- 5: [1, 7, 0, 3]
- 6: [4, 7, 1]
- 7: [5, 11, 6, 14, 1]
- 8: [13, 10, 11, 12]
- 9: [2, 14]
- 10: [1, 3, 8, 2]
- 11: [4, 7, 8, 0, 14]
- 12: [3, 8, 2]
- 13: [3, 8, 0]
- 14: [9, 7, 0, 11, 2]

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [21]
Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 13>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 14>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 10>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 14>
<2, 8, 12>
<3, 5, 10>
<3, 5, 13>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 11>
<7, 11, 14>
<8, 10, 13>
<8, 10, 12>
<8, 11, 12>
<12, 2, 14>
<0, 11, 14>
<1, 10, 3>
<10, 2, 14>
