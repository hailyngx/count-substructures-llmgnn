Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 12) (16, 17) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 18) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (19, 18) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (18, 14) (18, 19) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 1) (12, 16) (12, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (7, 13) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 4) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 4) (2, 3) (15, 13) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 4) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree. The sorted nodes are as follows:
Node 16: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 12: 2 connections
Node 19: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 15: 1 connection
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 14: 5 connections

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections, we count the triangles.
