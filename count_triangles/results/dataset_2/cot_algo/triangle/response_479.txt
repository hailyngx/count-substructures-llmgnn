Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 4) (16, 19) (16, 14) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 3) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 14) (5, 7) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (17, 12) (17, 1) (17, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 0) (9, 17) (9, 8) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 3) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 19) (15, 18) (15, 13) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 15) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (14, 16) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 11)
(1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 17)
(2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 18)
(3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 19)
(4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 11)
(5, 0) (5, 7)
(6, 8) (6, 10)
(7, 4) (7, 5)
(8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 10)
(9, 8) (9, 17)
(10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14)
(11, 0) (11, 4)
(12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 17)
(13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 15)
(14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 16)
(15, 13) (15, 18)
(16, 14) (16, 19)
(17, 1) (17, 9) (17, 12)
(18, 2) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 19)
(19, 3) (19, 16) (19, 18)

Let's relabel the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes by degree: 3, 5, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4

Relabeled nodes: 
0 -> 1
1 -> 17
2 -> 15
3 -> 9
4 -> 0
5 -> 10
6 -> 11
7 -> 6
8 -> 8
9 -> 5
10 -> 16
11 -> 7
12 -> 13
13 -> 2
14 -> 3
15 -> 4
16 -> 18
17 -> 14
18 -> 12
19 -> 19

Now, let's count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 4]

<0, 8, 10>
<1, 9, 13>
<4, 8, 0>
<14, 3, 17>
