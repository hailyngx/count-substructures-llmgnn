Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
The nodes and edges in the graph are as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 4), (9, 0), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 3), (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 8), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2), (8, 0), (2, 6), (0, 1), (3, 8)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

1. Sort nodes by their degree in increasing order:
Degrees:  
Node 5: 4
Node 9: 3
Node 4: 3
Node 7: 4
Node 6: 3
Node 8: 3
Node 2: 4
Node 0: 3
Node 1: 2
Node 3: 3

2. Relabel the nodes based on their degree in increasing order:
New Labels:
Node 1: 0
Node 9: 1
Node 0: 2
Node 4: 3
Node 6: 4
Node 8: 5
Node 3: 6
Node 7: 7
Node 2: 8
Node 5: 9

3. Check edges with the lower labeled node having fewer connections:
- (2, 5): 2 is lower labeled and has degree 4, whereas 5 has degree 4.
- (2, 7): 2 is lower labeled and has degree 4, whereas 7 has degree 4.
- (2, 6): 2 is lower labeled and has degree 4, whereas 6 has degree 3.
- (2, 8): 2 is lower labeled and has degree 4, whereas 8 has degree 3.
- (0, 9): 0 is lower labeled and has degree 3, whereas 9 has degree 3.
- (0, 7): 0 is lower labeled and has degree 3, whereas 7 has degree 4.
- (0, 8): 0 is lower labeled and has degree 3, whereas 8 has degree 3.
- (0, 1): 0 is lower labeled and has degree 3, whereas 1 has degree 2.

4. Count the triangles formed by the shared connections:
Triangles: <2, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4] as shown in the list of unique triangles above.
