Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
Node 5: degree = 5
Node 9: degree = 4
Node 4: degree = 4
Node 8: degree = 4
Node 1: degree = 4
Node 6: degree = 3
Node 0: degree = 3
Node 7: degree = 2
Node 3: degree = 3
Node 2: degree = 3

2. Relabel the nodes from 0 to 9 based on their degree:
Node 7: 0
Node 2: 1
Node 3: 2
Node 6: 3
Node 0: 4
Node 4: 5
Node 8: 6
Node 1: 7
Node 9: 8
Node 5: 9

3. Counting triangles:
- For each edge, we will only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This ensures that each triangle is only counted once.

This graph forms the following unique triangles: 
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 6>
