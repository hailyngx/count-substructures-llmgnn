Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 5: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 7: degree 3
Vertex 8: degree 4
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 3: degree 4
Vertex 9: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 5
Vertex 4: degree 6

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 5 (degree 3) -> Vertex 0
Vertex 6 (degree 3) -> Vertex 1
Vertex 0 (degree 3) -> Vertex 2
Vertex 7 (degree 3) -> Vertex 3
Vertex 8 (degree 4) -> Vertex 4
Vertex 1 (degree 4) -> Vertex 5
Vertex 3 (degree 4) -> Vertex 6
Vertex 9 (degree 4) -> Vertex 7
Vertex 2 (degree 5) -> Vertex 8
Vertex 4 (degree 6) -> Vertex 9

Now, we will check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to count the triangles:

1. Triangle: <0, 4, 9>
2. Triangle: <1, 4, 6>
3. Triangle: <1, 5, 8>
4. Triangle: <2, 4, 9>
5. Triangle: <2, 5, 8>
6. Triangle: <3, 4, 6>
7. Triangle: <3, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
