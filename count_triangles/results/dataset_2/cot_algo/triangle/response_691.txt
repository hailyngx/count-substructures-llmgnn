Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 19) (6, 7) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 2) (13, 5) (13, 15) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 12) (10, 18) (10, 1) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 2) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 4) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 15) (2, 12) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (17, 16) (17, 8) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 16) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 12) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 15) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 17) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
- Edges: 
{0, 9}, {0, 14}, {0, 16}, {0, 3}, {0, 12}, 
{1, 14}, {1, 10}, {1, 16}, {1, 12}, 
{2, 3}, {2, 11}, {2, 15}, {2, 12}, 
{3, 0}, {3, 7}, {3, 2}, 
{4, 5}, {4, 19}, {4, 16}, 
{5, 13}, 
{6, 7}, 
{7, 3}, {7, 8}, {7, 6}, 
{8, 11}, {8, 7}, {8, 17}, 
{9, 0}, {9, 11}, {9, 19}, 
{10, 1}, {10, 18}, 
{11, 9}, {11, 18}, {11, 8}, {11, 2}, 
{12, 0}, {12, 19}, {12, 2}, {12, 1}, 
{13, 5}, {13, 15}, 
{14, 0}, {14, 1}, 
{15, 13}, {15, 18}, {15, 2}, 
{16, 0}, {16, 17}, {16, 1}, {16, 4}, 
{17, 16}, {17, 8}, 
{18, 10}, {18, 11}, {18, 15}, 
{19, 9}, {19, 4}, {19, 12}

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degrees:

Node 6: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 17: degree 2
Node 10: degree 2
Node 13: degree 2
Node 15: degree 3
Node 18: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 12: degree 5
Node 0: degree 6
Node 9: degree 6
Node 11: degree 6
Node 4: degree 5

Let's count the triangles (cycles of length 3) using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
- <0, 9, 11>
- <0, 9, 12>
- <0, 9, 19>
- <0, 12, 19>
- <1, 12, 14>
- <3, 7, 2>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <4, 16, 1>
- <4, 16, 19>
- <7, 6, 3>
- <11, 9, 19>
- <15, 2, 18>

[Total number of triangles: 12]
