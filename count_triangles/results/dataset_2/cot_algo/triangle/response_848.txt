Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 7

Next, we will use Degree-Based Ordering to count the number of triangles.
