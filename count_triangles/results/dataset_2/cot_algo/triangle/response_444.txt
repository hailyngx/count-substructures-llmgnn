Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (21, 19) (0, 27) (0, 17) (0, 22) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 29) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (22, 0) (22, 23) (22, 26) (23, 0) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 3) (23, 19) (8, 23) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 25) (6, 2) (28, 3) (28, 10) (28, 2) (26, 22) (26, 2) (26, 29) (26, 12) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 15) (17, 11) (3, 23) (3, 28) (3, 11) (3, 9) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 14) (10, 28) (15, 4) (15, 17) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 29) (9, 25) (29, 27) (29, 26) (29, 9) (16, 4) (16, 19) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 18) (13, 4) (13, 20) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 28) (2, 26) (25, 6) (25, 9) (25, 19) (25, 18) (12, 26) (12, 18) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 25) (18, 12) (18, 20) (24, 19) (19, 21) (19, 23) (19, 16) (19, 25) (19, 24) (20, 13) (20, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is used to count the number of triangles in the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are listed as provided. We will now sort the nodes based on their degrees and relabel them accordingly.

The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
Node 0: 5
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 5
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 4
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 3
Node 7: 3
Node 8: 2
Node 9: 4
Node 10: 1
Node 11: 4
Node 12: 2
Node 13: 2
Node 14: 3
Node 15: 2
Node 16: 2
Node 17: 4
Node 18: 5
Node 19: 5
Node 20: 2
Node 21: 1
Node 22: 4
Node 23: 6
Node 24: 1
Node 25: 4
Node 26: 4
Node 27: 2
Node 28: 3
Node 29: 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the relabeling of the nodes will be as follows:
Node 0 -> 0
Node 10 -> 1
Node 12 -> 2
Node 13 -> 3
Node 16 -> 4
Node 1 -> 5
Node 21 -> 6
Node 24 -> 7
Node 11 -> 8
Node 8 -> 9
Node 27 -> 10
Node 7 -> 11
Node 2 -> 12
Node 6 -> 13
Node 28 -> 14
Node 3 -> 15
Node 9 -> 16
Node 25 -> 17
Node 4 -> 18
Node 5 -> 19
Node 14 -> 20
Node 15 -> 21
Node 20 -> 22
Node 26 -> 23
Node 17 -> 24
Node 29 -> 25
Node 18 -> 26
Node 19 -> 27
Node 22 -> 28
Node 23 -> 29

Now, let's count the number of triangles and list them:
Total number of triangles: [34]
Unique triangles found: 
<0, 15, 23>
<0, 19, 25>
<0, 23, 29>
<2, 12, 26>
<2, 12, 28>
<2, 12, 23>
<3, 15, 23>
<3, 15, 28>
<4, 18, 15>
<5, 11, 19>
<5, 11, 14>
<5, 11, 22>
<5, 14, 18>
<7, 11, 22>
<9, 17, 25>
