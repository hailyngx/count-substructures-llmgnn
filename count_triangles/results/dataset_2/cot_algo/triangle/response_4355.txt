Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 10) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 13) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method sorts the vertices based on the number of connections.

Here is the list of vertices from least to most connections:
Nodes: 5, 13, 1, 8, 7, 4, 3, 14, 10, 2, 0, 12, 11, 6, 9

Using this order, we will check each edge starting from the node with the lower label to count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles is [15].

The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<0, 2, 10> 
<0, 2, 6> 
<0, 6, 11> 
<0, 10, 14> 
<1, 10, 14> 
<2, 6, 11> 
<2, 6, 13> 
<2, 9, 10> 
<6, 9, 12> 
<6, 9, 11> 
<7, 9, 14> 
<8, 9, 11> 
<10, 14, 7> 
<11, 12, 0> 
<11, 13, 2> 
<11, 13, 3>
