Response:
First, let's construct the graph G with the given nodes and edges. 

The nodes are numbered from 0 to 29.

The nodes with their connections are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 11.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 12, 16, and 17.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 24.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8, 21.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 15, 21, and 28.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 6, 13, 18, and 21.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 11, 13, 24, and 29.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 20.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 23.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 14, 15, 20, and 24.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 11, and 22.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1 and 25.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 13, and 17, and 26.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 10, 17, and 26.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 5, 10, and 16.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 1, 15, and 19.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 1, 13, 14, 17, and 20.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 6 and 20.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 16, 19, 22, and 27.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 8, 10, 17, and 18.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 21.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 11, 19, and 22.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 9 and 27.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 10, and 11.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 12.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 13, 14, and 19.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 19, 23, and 27.
- Node 28 is connected to node 5.
- Node 29 is connected to node 7.

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes by their degree: 28 (1 connection), 2, 29 (2 connections), 16, 18, 22, 25, 28 (2 connections), 0, 8, 9 (3 connections), 1, 12, 15, 28 (3 connections), 3, 5, 6, 17, 24, 2 (4 connections), 4, 13, 18, 26, 27, 29 (5 connections), 10 (6 connections), 7, 11, 19 (7 connections), 14 (8 connections), 20 (8 connections), 21 (4 connections), 23 (3 connections).

Now, calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method based on the sorted nodes above. Count the triangles based on the shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [42].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 21>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 12, 17>, <1, 12, 25>, <1, 16, 19>, <3, 5, 21>, <3, 6, 21>, <4, 5, 15>, <4, 5, 21>, <7, 11, 24>, <10, 14, 17>, <13, 17, 26>, <13, 17, 14>, <13, 14, 26>, <13, 20, 17>, <15, 16, 19>, <16, 1, 12>, <16, 1, 17>, <16, 1, 12>, <16, 1, 12>, <16, 19, 26>, <18, 20, 17>, <18, 20, 6>, <18, 20, 21>, <18, 6, 21>, <19, 23, 27>, <19, 22, 11>, <19, 22, 22>, <19, 26, 13>, <21, 3, 6>, <21, 3, 5>, <21, 6, 18>, <21, 6, 21>, <21, 5, 15>, <21, 5, 21>, <21, 5, 4>, <21, 6, 18>, <24, 7, 11>, <24, 7, 13>, <24, 7, 29>, <24, 10, 11>, <24, 10, 7>.
