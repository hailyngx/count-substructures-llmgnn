Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 14) (4, 7) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 17) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 9) (2, 12) (2, 14) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 8) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 0) (15, 4) (15, 18) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 0) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (6, 18) (6, 14) (6, 19) (6, 0) (14, 16) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 3) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 3) (8, 10) (8, 18) (8, 1) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 6) (3, 16) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 19) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: (13, 12, 1, 6)
- 1: (7, 13, 8, 0)
- 2: (14, 12)
- 3: (16, 4, 9, 19)
- 4: (7, 15, 3)
- 6: (18, 14, 19, 0)
- 7: (4, 1, 17)
- 8: (10, 18, 1)
- 9: (17, 14, 3)
- 10: (17, 8)
- 11: (16, 12)
- 12: (11, 17, 2, 0)
- 13: (1, 19, 0)
- 14: (16, 2, 6, 9)
- 15: (4, 18)
- 16: (11, 3, 14)
- 17: (7, 10, 12, 9)
- 18: (15, 6, 8)
- 19: (13, 6, 3)

Now, let's count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 11]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 13>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 12>
<0, 6, 19>
<1, 8, 10>
<1, 8, 18>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 9, 14>
<6, 14, 19>
<7, 8, 10>
<12, 17, 9>
