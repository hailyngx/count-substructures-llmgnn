Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's label the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order. The degrees of the nodes are as follows:

Node 0: 6 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections

Based on these degrees, we can relabel the nodes as follows:

Nodes by labels:
Node 1 → 0
Node 3 → 1
Node 4 → 2
Node 2 → 3
Node 5 → 4
Node 6 → 5
Node 7 → 6
Node 0 → 7
Node 8 → 8
Node 9 → 9

Now, we can go through each edge and count the triangles. We only consider the cases where the node with the lower label has fewer connections. 

After counting, we find the total number of triangles to be [7]. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <6, 7, 8>.
