Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 3) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are: 
Node 7: 4 connections 
Node 4: 3 connections 
Node 0: 3 connections 
Node 1: 3 connections 
Node 2: 3 connections 
Node 5: 3 connections 
Node 3: 3 connections 
Node 9: 3 connections 
Node 6: 4 connections 
Node 8: 4 connections
