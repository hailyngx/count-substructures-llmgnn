Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 14) (12, 13) (12, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 3) (3, 0) (3, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections and relabelling them accordingly.

After counting the number of connections for each node, the list of nodes from least to most connections is as follows:
Node 3 - 2 connections
Node 9 - 3 connections
Node 12 - 3 connections
Node 2 - 4 connections
Node 6 - 4 connections
Node 14 - 4 connections
Node 11 - 4 connections
Node 10 - 4 connections
Node 4 - 5 connections
Node 5 - 5 connections
Node 8 - 6 connections
Node 0 - 7 connections
Node 13 - 7 connections
Node 7 - 8 connections
Node 1 - 8 connections

After relabelling the nodes, the new list of nodes is as follows:
Node 0 - 1 connection
Node 1 - 2 connections
Node 2 - 3 connections
Node 3 - 4 connections
Node 4 - 5 connections
Node 5 - 6 connections
Node 6 - 7 connections
Node 7 - 8 connections
Node 8 - 9 connections
Node 9 - 10 connections
Node 10 - 11 connections
Node 11 - 12 connections
Node 12 - 13 connections
Node 13 - 14 connections
Node 14 - 15 connections

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:
- Since we consider only edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we will look at edges involving nodes 0 to 9.
- We will check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to find triangles.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 13>
<1, 5, 13>
<1, 8, 13>
