Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 0) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 5) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges:
- 0: {8, 3, 12, 2}
- 1: {6, 12, 2, 14, 5}
- 2: {6, 3, 0, 1}
- 3: {9, 11, 0, 10, 13, 2}
- 4: {7, 8, 12, 13, 5}
- 5: {4, 8, 1, 10}
- 6: {9, 1, 2}
- 7: {4, 10, 14}
- 8: {4, 5, 14, 0}
- 9: {6, 14, 3, 13}
- 10: {7, 3, 5}
- 11: {3, 14}
- 12: {4, 0, 13, 1}
- 13: {9, 4, 3, 12}
- 14: {9, 7, 8, 11, 1}

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

Vertices in degree-based order: [11, 7, 10, 6, 0, 5, 2, 8, 1, 12, 4, 13, 9, 3, 14]

Now, let's count the triangles:

Triangles: [9]

<0, 2, 1>, <0, 8, 4>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 12, 4>, <0, 12, 13>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 14>, <3, 9, 13>, <4, 12, 13>
