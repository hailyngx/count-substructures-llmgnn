Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 19) (16, 0) (16, 2) (5, 4) (5, 17) (9, 8) (9, 17) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 14) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 18) (4, 5) (4, 19) (8, 9) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 13) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 18) (15, 14) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 13) (2, 16) (2, 0) (2, 19) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 2) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 15) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) from least to most. 

The sorted nodes in the graph are:
Node 16: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 19: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 12: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 15: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 14: Degree 3
Node 18: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 6
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 17: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4

Using this ordering, let's count the triangles in the graph:

Total number of triangles: [13]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 16>, <0, 2, 19>, <0, 7, 14>, <0, 7, 15>, <0, 10, 14>, <0, 10, 17>, <0, 11, 3>, <1, 6, 13>, <3, 13, 6>, <3, 13, 7>, <6, 13, 7>, <6, 13, 12>, <10, 14, 15>
