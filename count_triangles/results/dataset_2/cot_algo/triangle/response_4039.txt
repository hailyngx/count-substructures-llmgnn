Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 24) (7, 23) (7, 9) (21, 0) (21, 27) (21, 22) (22, 21) (22, 23) (22, 14) (23, 7) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 19) (20, 27) (20, 0) (20, 12) (27, 21) (27, 20) (27, 18) (10, 16) (10, 29) (17, 6) (4, 23) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 29) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 3) (29, 10) (29, 4) (29, 0) (2, 26) (18, 27) (18, 16) (18, 28) (0, 21) (0, 20) (0, 29) (0, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (26, 2) (26, 28) (26, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (11, 13) (28, 18) (28, 26) (28, 24) (25, 15) (25, 24) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 9) (15, 25) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 23) (19, 8) (19, 15) (5, 0) (5, 26) (5, 15) (5, 16) (12, 20) (12, 6) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 24) (6, 17) (6, 12) (24, 7) (24, 28) (24, 25) (24, 1) (24, 16) (14, 22) (14, 13) (14, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 14) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently in the given graph. Let's relabel the vertices based on their connections in ascending order:

Node 1: 6 connections
Node 2: 0 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 11: 1 connection
Node 12: 2 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 16: 4 connections
Node 17: 1 connection
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 20: 3 connections
Node 21: 3 connections
Node 22: 3 connections
Node 23: 6 connections
Node 24: 7 connections
Node 25: 2 connections
Node 26: 3 connections
Node 27: 3 connections
Node 28: 3 connections
Node 29: 3 connections

Based on the relabeling, the edges need to be checked in the order of the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections.

By following the degree-based ordering and checking for shared connections between vertices of each edge, the total number of triangles in the graph is <3, 8, 23>, and the count is [14].
