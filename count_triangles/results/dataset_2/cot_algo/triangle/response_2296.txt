Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 13) (3, 23) (25, 3) (25, 26) (25, 15) (8, 27) (13, 3) (13, 17) (7, 21) (7, 12) (21, 7) (21, 16) (22, 9) (22, 5) (22, 12) (22, 1) (23, 3) (23, 29) (23, 0) (23, 9) (4, 24) (4, 16) (4, 26) (4, 2) (12, 7) (12, 22) (12, 1) (17, 13) (17, 29) (17, 15) (29, 23) (29, 17) (29, 6) (10, 6) (9, 22) (9, 23) (26, 25) (26, 4) (26, 0) (16, 21) (16, 4) (16, 28) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 27) (28, 5) (5, 22) (5, 28) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 24) (14, 27) (14, 24) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 11) (0, 23) (0, 26) (11, 18) (11, 24) (11, 1) (11, 20) (24, 4) (24, 19) (24, 14) (24, 11) (24, 27) (1, 22) (1, 12) (1, 28) (1, 11) (6, 29) (6, 10) (20, 11) (20, 27) (27, 8) (27, 28) (27, 14) (27, 24) (27, 20) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 2) (2, 4) (2, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections.  
The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is [8, 3, 7, 10, 6, 20, 18, 5, 9, 26, 13, 28, 0, 29, 4, 16, 1, 21, 12, 22, 19, 14, 27, 11, 17, 15, 24, 25, 2, 23].

Using this ordering, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph. 

The total number of triangles is [25].

The unique triangles found are <7, 21, 12>, <15, 25, 17>, <15, 25, 5>, <5, 28, 1>, <5, 28, 27>, <5, 15, 18>, <5, 15, 2>, <9, 22, 23>, <13, 17, 29>, <13, 3, 17>, <13, 3, 23>, <13, 3, 25>, <13, 3, 23>, <13, 17, 29>, <13, 17, 15>, <13, 17, 29>, <13, 3, 23>, <22, 12, 1>, <22, 12, 7>, <22, 12, 1>, <22, 9, 23>, <22, 9, 23>, <26, 0, 23>, <26, 0, 4>.
