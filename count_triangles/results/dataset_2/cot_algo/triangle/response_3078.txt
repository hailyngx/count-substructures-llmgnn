Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 18) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 0) (7, 9) (7, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 4) (2, 4) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 15) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 16) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 5) (5, 1) (5, 17) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 10) (19, 6) (19, 8) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 17) (15, 2) (15, 18) 

Response:
Based on the provided graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, the vertices can be sorted by their number of connections:

```
Node: 8, 7, 18, 10, 5, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 0, 2, 3, 13, 1, 4, 11, 12, 6, 9
Degree: 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 7
```

Now, following the Degree-Based Ordering method and examining each edge starting from the one with the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections, we can count the total number of triangles and list them:

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found: 
- <2, 0, 8>
- <4, 1, 3>
- <4, 1, 5>
- <4, 1, 17>
- <10, 11, 12>
- <9, 6, 11>
