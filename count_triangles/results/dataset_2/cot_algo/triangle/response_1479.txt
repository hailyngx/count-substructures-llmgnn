Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 16) (14, 3) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 14) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 19) (11, 8) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 19) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 19) (2, 1) (2, 12) (9, 18) (9, 13) (9, 0) (18, 12) (18, 9) (18, 7) (6, 4) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 12) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 18) (7, 8) (13, 12) (13, 9) (0, 9) (0, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves first sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Here is the list of vertices and their degrees:

0: 2  
1: 3  
2: 2  
3: 4  
4: 4  
5: 4  
6: 1  
7: 3  
8: 4  
9: 3  
10: 2  
11: 2  
12: 5  
13: 2  
14: 5  
15: 2  
16: 3  
17: 1  
18: 3  
19: 5 

Next, we will process the edges based on the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles.

After processing the edges using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles is [26].
The unique triangles found are:
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 0>
<3, 5, 4>
<3, 5, 1>
<3, 8, 7>
<3, 8, 16>
<3, 8, 1>
<3, 8, 5>
<3, 14, 1>
<3, 14, 10>
<3, 14, 19>
<3, 14, 17>
<5, 4, 6>
<5, 4, 0>
<8, 7, 1>
<8, 7, 18>
<8, 7, 16>
<8, 1, 2>
<8, 1, 7>
<8, 1, 14>
<14, 10, 19>
<14, 10, 3>
<14, 19, 12>
<14, 19, 1>
<14, 10, 3>
