Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 0) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 15) (18, 4) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 2) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 19) (0, 17) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 16) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 16) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 10) (16, 19) (16, 9) (16, 10) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 6) (10, 16) (2, 15) (2, 11) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 
Vertices with degree 2: [0, 2, 4, 6, 16, 18]
Vertices with degree 3: [1, 5, 8, 9, 13]
Vertices with degree 4: [7, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19]
Vertices with degree 5: [3, 10, 11]

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following unique triangles:
<13, 1, 17>
<13, 1, 7>
<13, 1, 19>
<13, 12, 7>
<13, 12, 1>
<13, 12, 3>
<1, 7, 17>
<1, 19, 17>
<1, 17, 0>
<1, 17, 7>
<1, 17, 14>
<7, 12, 3>
<7, 12, 5>
<7, 12, 13>
<1, 7, 12>
<1, 7, 5>
<1, 7, 13>
<14, 10, 6>
<14, 10, 19>
<14, 6, 4>
<16, 10, 19>
<16, 10, 6>
<16, 10, 14>

Total number of triangles: [24]
