Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (16, 11) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 4) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 3) (3, 11) (3, 1) (3, 18) (2, 14) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 4) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 15) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 12) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 19) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 15) (9, 8) (9, 10) (10, 14) (10, 9) (19, 0) (19, 12) (12, 13) (12, 19) (12, 15) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 12) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 6) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges:

(0) --- (17) --- (1) --- (11) --- (3)
 |       |       |       |
 |       |       |       |
(19)---(12)---(15)---(18)---(2)
 |       |       |       |
 |       |       |       |
(8) --- (6) --- (7) --- (14) --- (10)
 |       |       |        |       |
 |       |       |        |       |
(9) --- (5) --- (13) --- (2)
 |       |
(4)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by degree:
0(3) < 13(3) < 15(3) < 19(3) < 4(3) < 18(4) < 5(4) < 12(4) < 10(4) < 11(4) < 8(4) < 9(4) < 6(5) < 1(5) < 7(5) < 3(5) < 2(5) < 14(5) < 17(5) < 16(6)
