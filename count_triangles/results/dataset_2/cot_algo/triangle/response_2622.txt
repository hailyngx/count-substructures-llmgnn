Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 8) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 13) (14, 11) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 10) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 9) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will now count the number of triangles present using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

First, we sort the vertices by their number of connections:
```
Node  Degree
0     3
1     4
2     5
3     4
4     4
5     5
6     3
7     5
8     3
9     5
10    4
11    4
12    5
13    4
14    2
```

Next, we will proceed with counting the triangles by following the method mentioned earlier:

```
Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 6, 1>
<1, 7, 4>
<1, 7, 5>
<1, 11, 3>
<2, 7, 4>
<2, 9, 4>
<2, 9, 13>
<4, 7, 5>
<5, 6, 1>
