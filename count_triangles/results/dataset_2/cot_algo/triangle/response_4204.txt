Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 0) (15, 8) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 16) (19, 0) (19, 12) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 12) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 18) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 1) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 17) (9, 15) (9, 13) (12, 19) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 11) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (0, 2) (0, 19) (1, 7) (1, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 1) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph with 20 nodes is as follows:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 4: degree 1
Node 8: degree 6
Node 19: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 9: degree 2
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 4
Node 12: degree 5
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 2
Node 15: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 18: degree 3

Based on the degree-based ordering, we count the triangles using the provided edges:

[Total number of triangles: 17]
