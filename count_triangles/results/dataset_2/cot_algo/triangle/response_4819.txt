Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 15) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 17) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 6) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 9) (17, 18) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 15) (0, 10) (14, 11) (14, 16) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 9) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 19) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 3) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 19) (3, 9) (15, 2) (15, 17) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 9) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. First, we need to list the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:

Vertices with degree 1: 8, 14, 6
Vertices with degree 2: 0, 5, 8, 10, 18, 1, 19
Vertices with degree 3: 4, 7, 11, 15
Vertices with degree 4: 12, 13, 16
Vertices with degree 5: 2, 17, 3, 9

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed. We only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

After counting the triangles, we find that there are:
[15] triangles in total.

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 1>, <2, 4, 15>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 17>, <2, 15, 17>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 1, 19>, <5, 7, 17>, <5, 3, 9>, 
<7, 17, 13>, <11, 13, 17>, <11, 2, 15>, <12, 7, 16>, <9, 13, 17>
