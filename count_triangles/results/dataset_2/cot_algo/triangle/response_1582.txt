Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
0 --- 2 --- 1 --- 5
:     |     |     |
6 --- 3 --- 4     8
:           :     |
7 --- 9 --- 6 --- 7
```

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Vertex 0 has degree 4
- Vertex 5 has degree 4
- Vertex 9 has degree 4
- Vertex 2 has degree 5
- Vertex 1 has degree 5
- Vertex 6 has degree 5
- Vertex 7 has degree 6
- Vertex 3 has degree 6
- Vertex 8 has degree 6
- Vertex 4 has degree 6

Proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
- Considering the edge (7, 4) [7 has degree 6, 4 has degree 6], we find vertex 4 has fewer connections. 
- Check for shared connections: (7, 4) shares vertices 8 and 9, forming the triangle <4, 8, 9>.

- Considering the edge (4, 7), both vertices have the same degree, any shared connections have already been counted.

- Continue with the other edges in a similar manner to identify triangles.

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4]. 
The unique triangles found are <4, 8, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, and <0, 2, 6>.
