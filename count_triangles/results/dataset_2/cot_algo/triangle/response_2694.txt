Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 17) (26, 13) (26, 21) (26, 0) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 10) (21, 26) (21, 5) (21, 15) (6, 9) (6, 19) (6, 20) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 14) (2, 25) (29, 9) (29, 2) (29, 11) (13, 26) (13, 25) (13, 28) (13, 19) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 28) (17, 0) (17, 22) (4, 27) (4, 24) (27, 4) (27, 23) (15, 21) (15, 0) (15, 25) (7, 25) (7, 28) (25, 2) (25, 13) (25, 15) (25, 7) (11, 29) (11, 12) (23, 2) (23, 27) (23, 19) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 22) (10, 14) (18, 16) (19, 6) (19, 13) (19, 23) (22, 17) (22, 10) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 12) (24, 4) (24, 0) (0, 26) (0, 17) (0, 15) (0, 24) (28, 13) (28, 17) (28, 7) (28, 12) (28, 14) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 3) (16, 5) (14, 2) (14, 10) (14, 28) (5, 21) (5, 3) (5, 16) (8, 10) (8, 20) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 28) (20, 6) (20, 8) 

Response:
The graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges is as described. Now, let's proceed with counting the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Sort vertices based on their degree in ascending order:

Vertices:  
4 -> 2 connections  
7, 18, 20, 22, 24 -> 2 connections  
3, 5, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19, 27, 28 -> 3 connections  
0, 1, 6, 9, 10, 13, 17, 21, 23, 25, 26, 29 -> 4 connections  

- Relabel the vertices:
4 -> 1  
7, 18, 20, 22, 24 -> 2, 3, 4, 5, 6  
3, 5, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19, 27, 28 -> 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17  
0, 1, 6, 9, 10, 13, 17, 21, 23, 25, 26, 29 -> 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29  

Now, we will count the triangles by examining each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Count of triangles []: 48
