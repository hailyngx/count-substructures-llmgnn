Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied to count the triangles in this graph.

First, let's list the nodes sorted by their number of connections:

Nodes:  
0 (Degree: 5)  
1 (Degree: 5)  
2 (Degree: 4)  
3 (Degree: 4)  
4 (Degree: 3)  
5 (Degree: 2)  
6 (Degree: 4)  
7 (Degree: 6)  
8 (Degree: 5)  
9 (Degree: 4)  

Now, we will iterate through the edges in the graph and count the triangles:

1. (4, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 4, 7, 9 <4, 7, 9>.  
2. (4, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 4, 7, 9 <4, 7, 9>.  
3. (4, 2) cannot form a triangle since 4 has fewer connections than 2.  
4. (7, 4) forms a triangle with nodes 4, 7, 9 <4, 7, 9>.  
5. (7, 6) forms a triangle with nodes 6, 7, 1 <1, 6, 7>.  
6. (7, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 4, 7, 9 <4, 7, 9>.  
7. (7, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 1, 6, 7 <1, 6, 7>.  
8. (7, 8) forms a triangle with nodes 1, 7, 8 <1, 7, 8>.  
9. (6, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 1, 6, 7 <1, 6, 7>.  
10. (6, 3) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 3, 6 <0, 3, 6>.  
11. (6, 8) forms a triangle with nodes 1, 6, 8 <1, 6, 8>.  
12. (6, 0) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 3, 6 <0, 3, 6>.  
13. (9, 4) forms a triangle with nodes 4, 7, 9 <4, 7, 9>.  
14. (9, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 4, 7, 9 <4, 7, 9>.  
15. (9, 2) forms a triangle with nodes 2, 4, 9 <2, 4, 9>.  
16. (9, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 1, 7, 9 <1, 7, 9>.  
17. (1, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 1, 6, 7 <1, 6, 7>.  
18. (1, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 1, 7, 9 <1, 7, 9>.  
19. (1, 3) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 1, 3 <0, 1, 3>.  
20. (1, 0) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 1, 3 <0, 1, 3>.  
21. (1, 8) forms a triangle with nodes 1, 7, 8 <1, 7, 8>.  
22. (3, 6) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 3, 6 <0, 3, 6>.  
23. (3, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 1, 3 <0, 1, 3>.  
24. (3, 0) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 1, 3 <0, 1, 3>.  
25. (3, 2) cannot form a triangle since 3 has fewer connections than 2.  
26. (8, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 1, 7, 8 <1, 7, 8>.  
27. (8, 6) forms a triangle with nodes 1, 6, 8 <1, 6, 8>.  
28. (8, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 1, 6, 8 <1, 6, 8>.  
29. (8, 5) cannot form a triangle since 8 has fewer connections than 5.  
30. (8, 0) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 1, 8 <0, 1, 8>.  
31. (0, 6) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 3, 6 <0, 3, 6>.  
32. (0, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 1, 3 <0, 1, 3>.  
33. (0, 3) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 1, 3 <0, 1, 3>.  
34. (0, 8) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 1, 8 <0, 1, 8>.  
35. (2, 4) forms a triangle with nodes 2, 4, 9 <2, 4, 9>.  
36. (2, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 2, 4, 9 <2, 4, 9>.  
37. (2, 3) cannot form a triangle since 2 has fewer connections than 3.  
38. (2, 5) cannot form a triangle since 2 has fewer connections than 5.  
39. (5, 8) cannot form a triangle since 5 has fewer connections than 8.  
40. (5, 2) cannot form a triangle since 5 has fewer connections than 2.
