Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 10) (17, 3) (17, 14) (17, 10) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 19) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 16) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 7) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 16) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 11) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 5) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 13) (7, 3) (7, 18) (7, 11) (11, 1) (11, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 4) (13, 4) (13, 16) (0, 6) (0, 18) 

Response:
The degree of each node is as follows:

Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 6
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 2
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 2
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 2
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 2
Node 16: degree 4
Node 17: degree 3
Node 18: degree 3
Node 19: degree 3

The vertices sorted by their degrees in non-increasing order are:

3 > 4 > 10 > 16 > 17 > 18 > 12 > 7 > 2 > 8 > 5 > 6 > 0 > 1 > 14 > 19 > 11 > 13 > 9 > 15

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles:

1. For the edge (3, 15), we check common nodes - None
2. For the edge (3, 7), we check common nodes - None
3. For the edge (3, 17), we check common nodes - None
4. For the edge (3, 5), we check common nodes - None
5. For the edge (3, 8), we check common nodes: 2
6. For the edge (15, 1), we check common nodes - None
7. For the edge (14, 17), we check common nodes - None
8. For the edge (14, 12), we check common nodes: 10
9. For the edge (14, 10), we check common nodes - None
10. For the edge (6, 12), we check common nodes - None
11. For the edge (6, 19), we check common nodes - None
12. For the edge (6, 0), we check common nodes - None
13. For the edge (9, 1), we check common nodes - None
14. For the edge (9, 19), we check common nodes - None
15. For the edge (10, 14), we check common nodes - None
16. For the edge (10, 17), we check common nodes - None
17. For the edge (10, 16), we check common nodes: 4
18. For the edge (2, 18), we check common nodes: 8
19. For the edge (2, 8), we check common nodes - None
20. For the edge (2, 5), we check common nodes: 3

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: 
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 5>
<4, 8, 3>
<5, 2, 3>
<10, 14, 12>
