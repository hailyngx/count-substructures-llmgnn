Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
(5, 1) (5, 4)
(9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0)
(6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0)
(4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2)
(7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8)
(1, 5) (1, 6)
(3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2)
(8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2)
(2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8)
(0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3)

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degree:

Node 1: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 9: 6 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start counting triangles:

Triangles:
<3, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
