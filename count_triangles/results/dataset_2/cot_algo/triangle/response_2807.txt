Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 10) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections). Let's do that first:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 2: degree 3
Node 11: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 10: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 4: degree 5
Node 7: degree 6
Node 9: degree 4

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: 
1. <8, 1, 3>
2. <8, 1, 13>
3. <8, 1, 5>
4. <8, 1, 9>
5. <1, 3, 5>
6. <1, 3, 13>
7. <1, 5, 7>
8. <5, 6, 7>
9. <5, 6, 13>
10. <3, 0, 10>
11. <3, 0, 11>
12. <0, 4, 10>
13. <0, 4, 14>
14. <4, 9, 12>
15. <4, 9, 1>
16. <9, 12, 4>
17. <9, 12, 11>
18. <7, 2, 8>
19. <7, 2, 13>
20. <7, 12, 11>
21. <7, 12, 9>
