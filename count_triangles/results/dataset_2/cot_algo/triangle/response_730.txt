Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the vertices by the number of connections each vertex has:

Node 4: 1 connection
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

Now, we can relabel the nodes based on their connections from least to most:

Node 4 (1)
Node 1 (3)
Node 3 (4)
Node 6 (4)
Node 0 (4)
Node 7 (5)
Node 8 (5)
Node 9 (5)
Node 2 (5)
Node 5 (5)

Next, we'll go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed:

Triangles:
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 0>
<5, 6, 2>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 1>
<5, 8, 7>
<5, 8, 6>
<5, 9, 8>
<5, 1, 7>
<5, 1, 2>
<5, 9, 3>
<5, 9, 0>
<5, 9, 3>
<5, 3, 7>
<5, 3, 0>
<6, 0, 2>
<6, 0, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 7>
<6, 9, 0>
<6, 9, 3>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 3>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<7, 1, 2>
<7, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 6>
<7, 6, 2>
<1, 2, 4>
<8, 9, 3>
<8, 9, 0>
<8, 6, 0>
<9, 3, 0>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 0>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 1, 7>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [39].
