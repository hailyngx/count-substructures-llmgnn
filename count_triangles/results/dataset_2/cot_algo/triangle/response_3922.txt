Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 9) (2, 3) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 13) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 0) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method first requires sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. The sorted vertices are as follows:
(2) - 3 connections
(14) - 3 connections
(11) - 4 connections
(3) - 4 connections
(6) - 4 connections
(1) - 4 connections
(5) - 4 connections
(12) - 4 connections
(0) - 5 connections
(10) - 5 connections
(13) - 5 connections
(7) - 5 connections
(8) - 5 connections
(9) - 5 connections
(4) - 6 connections

Now, we will check each edge to count the number of triangles. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
Considering this, we have the following triangles:
<5, 13, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 11>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 13>
<6, 10, 0>
<7, 9, 13>
<7, 9, 8>
<7, 9, 12>
<10, 4, 0>
<10, 4, 6>
<13, 1, 5>
<13, 1, 14>
<13, 7, 9>
<13, 7, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
