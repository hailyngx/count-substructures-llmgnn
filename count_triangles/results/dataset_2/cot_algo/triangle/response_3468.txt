Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 20) (11, 15) (16, 25) (16, 3) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 27) (3, 16) (3, 1) (3, 27) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 10) (0, 7) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 20) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 13) (8, 10) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 29) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 28) (18, 17) (9, 0) (9, 22) (9, 20) (9, 23) (22, 2) (22, 9) (22, 27) (22, 20) (17, 18) (17, 7) (7, 0) (7, 17) (7, 24) (7, 23) (28, 18) (28, 15) (6, 24) (6, 12) (24, 7) (24, 6) (5, 11) (5, 26) (5, 29) (10, 26) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 19) (12, 4) (12, 6) (15, 11) (15, 14) (15, 28) (15, 21) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 25) (20, 11) (20, 14) (20, 9) (20, 22) (29, 4) (29, 5) (29, 13) (29, 21) (27, 1) (27, 3) (27, 22) (25, 16) (25, 19) (25, 21) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 29) (23, 9) (23, 7) (21, 15) (21, 29) (21, 25) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph by sorting the vertices based on their degrees. The sorted vertices are as follows:
1. 0 (Degree: 2)
2. 5 (Degree: 3)
3. 6 (Degree: 2)
4. 8 (Degree: 2)
5. 12 (Degree: 2)
6. 17 (Degree: 2)
7. 19 (Degree: 3)
8. 23 (Degree: 2)
9. 24 (Degree: 2)
10. 27 (Degree: 3)
11. 28 (Degree: 2)
12. 2 (Degree: 3)
13. 7 (Degree: 4)
14. 10 (Degree: 4)
15. 13 (Degree: 3)
16. 21 (Degree: 3)
17. 25 (Degree: 3)
18. 29 (Degree: 4)
19. 4 (Degree: 4)
20. 9 (Degree: 4)
21. 15 (Degree: 4)
22. 20 (Degree: 4)
23. 3 (Degree: 5)
24. 26 (Degree: 4)
25. 18 (Degree: 5)
26. 11 (Degree: 4)
27. 16 (Degree: 2)
28. 1 (Degree: 4)
29. 22 (Degree: 4)
30. 14 (Degree: 3)

After relabeling the vertices based on their degrees, we can count the triangles using the given edges:
- <2, 7, 27>
- <2, 10, 19>
- <2, 13, 29>
- <2, 19, 25>
- <3, 1, 26>
- <3, 16, 25>
- <4, 14, 15>
- <4, 14, 20>
- <4, 18, 17>
- <4, 18, 28>
- <4, 29, 21>
- <5, 11, 26>
- <5, 11, 29>
- <7, 9, 22>
- <9, 20, 22>
- <10, 19, 25>
- <13, 10, 29>
- <15, 14, 20>
- <15, 14, 21>
- <15, 20, 29>
- <18, 17, 28>

There are a total of [19] triangles in the given graph.
