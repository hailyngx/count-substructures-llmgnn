Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 11) (14, 6) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 1) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 4) (11, 15) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 17) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 16) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 16) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 8) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 12) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (12, 15) (12, 4) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 13) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 8) (16, 7) (18, 5) (18, 13) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 6) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
(14, 11) (14, 6) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 2) 
(1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 7) 
(3, 17) (3, 1) (3, 4) 
(10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 16) 
(11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 4) (11, 15) 
(0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) 
(2, 17) 
(5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 18) 
(19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 16)

(6, 14) (6, 13) 
(13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 6)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Sorted nodes by degree: 
2, 12, 17, 18, 19, 20, 7, 0, 1, 6, 13, 3, 9, 14, 15, 16, 4, 8, 5, 10

Number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found: 
<5, 10, 16>
<11, 14, 15>
<4, 11, 15>
<8, 16, 19>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
