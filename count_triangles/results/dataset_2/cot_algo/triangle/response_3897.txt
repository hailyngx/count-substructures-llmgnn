Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (10, 4) (10, 11) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 14) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 5) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 12) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the nodes is as follows (node: degree):  
0: 4  
1: 3  
2: 4  
3: 4  
4: 3  
5: 6  
6: 4  
7: 4  
8: 4  
9: 5  
10: 3  
11: 6  
12: 4  
13: 3  
14: 5  

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will consider the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

1. Edge (4, 10)  
Shared connections with nodes 4 and 10: 9  
Triangles found: <4, 9, 10>  

2. Edge (7, 11)  
Shared connections with nodes 7 and 11: 9  
Triangles found: <7, 9, 11>  

3. Edge (8, 13)  
Shared connections with nodes 8 and 13: 2  
Triangles found: <8, 2, 13>  

4. Edge (3, 6)  
Shared connections with nodes 3 and 6: 5  
Triangles found: <3, 5, 6>  

5. Edge (2, 12)  
Shared connections with nodes 2 and 12: 5  
Triangles found: <2, 5, 12>  

6. Edge (5, 12)  
Shared connections with nodes 5 and 12: 2  
Triangles found: <5, 2, 12>  

7. Edge (0, 13)  
Shared connections with nodes 0 and 13: 2  
Triangles found: <0, 2, 13>
