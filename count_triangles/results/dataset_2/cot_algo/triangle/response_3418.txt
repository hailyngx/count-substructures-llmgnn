Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (1, 3), (3, 4), (4, 6)
- 1: (0, 3), (3, 7)
- 2: (3, 9), (4, 9), (6, 9), (9, 4)
- 3: (0, 1), (1, 7), (2, 4), (4, 6), (6, 2)
- 4: (0, 6), (0, 3), (2, 9), (3, 2), (6, 7), (7, 5), (7, 9), (9, 2)
- 5: (4, 7), (7, 5), (7, 8)
- 6: (0, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 7), (6, 7), (7, 9), (9, 6)
- 7: (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 9), (7, 5), (9, 7)
- 8: (5, 7), (9, 5)
- 9: (2, 3), (2, 4), (6, 2), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 9)

Next, we will relabel the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):

Nodes sorted by degree (ascending):
0: 3 connections
1: 2 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 7 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 5 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 6 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
- <2, 3, 4>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <5, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [6]
