Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees, then looking for triangles while iterating over the edges. Let's organize the information:

Vertices sorted by degrees:
0(3), 6(4), 9(4), 5(4), 8(4), 2(4), 4(4), 7(5), 1(5), 3(5)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Start with the edge (6, 5):
   - Since 5 has fewer connections than 6, check for shared connections of 5: (5, 3), (5, 2)
   - Shared connection found: triangle <5, 3, 2>
  
- Continue with the edge (6, 1):
   - Since 1 has fewer connections than 6, check for shared connections of 1: (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 7)
   - Shared connections found: triangles <1, 9, 7>, <1, 3, 7>
  
- Move to the edge (6, 3):
   - Since 3 has fewer connections than 6, check for shared connections of 3: (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 7)
   - Shared connection found: triangle <3, 1, 7>
  
- Proceed to the edge (6, 2):
   - Since 2 has fewer connections than 6, check for shared connections of 2: (2, 4), (2, 5)
   - Shared connection found: triangle <2, 5, 4>

The total number of triangles is [5], and the unique triangles found are:
<5, 3, 2>, <1, 9, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <3, 1, 7>, <2, 5, 4>
