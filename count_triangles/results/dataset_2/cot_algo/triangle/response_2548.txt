Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 11) (11, 4) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 10) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
0-----3
|\  /|\
| \/ | \
|/  \|  \
5-----4--11
|    /|  |

```

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):
Node 6 -> degree: 2
Node 8 -> degree: 3
Node 2 -> degree: 3
Node 11 -> degree: 3
Node 7 -> degree: 3
Node 13 -> degree: 3
Node 10 -> degree: 5
Node 5 -> degree: 6
Node 14 -> degree: 6
Node 0 -> degree: 6
Node 3 -> degree: 6
Node 4 -> degree: 6
Node 1 -> degree: 6
Node 9 -> degree: 7
Node 12 -> degree: 7

Now, let's count the triangles:

- For edge (5, 9):
  Node 5 -> [0, 4, 10] shared with node 9 -> Triangle <5, 9, 0>, <5, 9, 4>, <5, 9, 10>

- For edge (5, 1):
  Node 5 -> [0, 4, 10] shared with node 1 -> Triangle <5, 1, 0>, <5, 1, 4>, <5, 1, 10>

- For edge (5, 4):
  Node 5 -> [0, 10] shared with node 4 -> Triangle <5, 4, 0>, <5, 4, 10>

- For edge (5, 0):
  Node 5 -> [4, 10] shared with node 0 -> Triangle <5, 0, 4>, <5, 0, 10>

- For edge (9, 6):
  Node 9 -> [0, 12, 14] shared with node 6 -> Triangle <9, 6, 0>, <9, 6, 12>, <9, 6, 14>

- For edge (9, 14):
  Node 9 -> [0, 6, 12] shared with node 14 -> Triangle <9, 14, 0>, <9, 14, 6>, <9, 14, 12>

- For edge (6, 10):
  Node 6 -> [9, 13] shared with node 10 -> Triangle <6, 10, 9>, <6, 10, 13>

- For edge (2, 1):
  Node 2 -> [10] shared with node 1 -> Triangle <2, 1, 10>

Total number of triangles: [12]
