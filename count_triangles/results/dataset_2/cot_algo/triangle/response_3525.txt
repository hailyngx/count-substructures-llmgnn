Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 1) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 13) (3, 10) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 3) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 0) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the triangles efficiently. Let's organize the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 5
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 5
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 2
Node 14: degree 5

Now, let's check for triangles starting with edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

Triangles found:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 14>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 14>
<1, 8, 14>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 11>
<2, 4, 14>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 10>
<6, 7, 13>
<8, 11, 14>

Total number of triangles: [13]
