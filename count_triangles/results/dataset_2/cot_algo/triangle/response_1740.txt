Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges: 

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 7, 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 7, 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 0, 1, 6, 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 8, 1.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 3, 8, 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 0, 2, 1, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 6, 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 1.

Now, let's use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Nodes sorted by their degrees:
{3, 5, 8, 9, 0, 1, 7, 6, 2, 4} 

Triangles found:
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
