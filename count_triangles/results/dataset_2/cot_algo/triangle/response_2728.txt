Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (3, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 12) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 12) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 10) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 5) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the nodes by their degree. The sorted order of nodes based on their degrees is as follows: 

Nodes: 3, 0, 14, 5, 9, 13, 2, 12, 8, 10, 7, 6, 1, 11, 4

By examining the given edges and following the method, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].

The unique triangles found are as follows:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 13, 14>
<2, 6, 13>
<2, 8, 10>
<5, 7, 12>
<6, 11, 12>
<8, 1, 4>
