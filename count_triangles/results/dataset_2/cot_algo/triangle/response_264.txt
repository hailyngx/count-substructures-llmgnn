Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 14) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 6) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 18) (18, 16) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 15) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 0) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 17) (17, 19) (17, 12) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 1) (2, 0) (14, 16) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 10) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 15) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 15) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 6) (15, 9) (10, 14) (10, 6) (12, 8) (12, 17) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections). Then, we relabel the nodes accordingly.

Here is the list of nodes sorted by their degree:
Node 16: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 4
Node 18: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 11: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 15: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 2
Node 12: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 19: Degree 3
Node 17: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 2

Now, let's count the triangles using the degree-based ordering method. We will only consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

After going through all the edges, we find that there are a total of 6 triangles.

So, the total number of triangles is [6].
The unique triangles found are: 
<4, 8, 13>
<4, 8, 14>
<4, 13, 18>
<8, 13, 18>
<11, 16, 18>
<13, 15, 18>
