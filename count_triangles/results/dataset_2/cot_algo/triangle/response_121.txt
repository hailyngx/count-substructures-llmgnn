Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 10) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has:

Vertices and their connections:
0: 8, 13, 11, 7, 10, 12
1: 5, 9, 6, 2, 14
2: 1, 12, 10
3: 6, 9
4: 8, 13, 9, 5
5: 4, 12, 1, 11, 14
6: 8, 3, 11, 7, 1
7: 0, 6, 9
8: 13, 4, 9, 0, 6
9: 8, 4, 3, 7, 1, 12
10: 0, 2, 14
11: 5, 0, 6
12: 5, 0, 9, 2
13: 8, 4, 0
14: 5, 1, 10

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, relabeling the vertices from lowest degree to highest degree:
2, 3, 7, 10, 12, 14, 1, 5, 4, 11, 6, 0, 13, 8, 9

Calculating the number of triangles:
There are [24] triangles in total.

Unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 11>
<0, 9, 12>
<1, 5, 14>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 9, 12>
<6, 8, 9>
<9, 12, 0>
<9, 12, 5>
