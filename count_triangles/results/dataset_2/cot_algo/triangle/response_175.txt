Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 7, 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 7.

Let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
- Node 2 has degree 3.
- Nodes 1, 8 have degree 4.
- Nodes 3, 4, 6 have degree 5.
- Nodes 0, 9 have degree 6.
- Nodes 5, 7 have degree 7.

Taking the edges provided and applying the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Considering the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- Edge (5, 6) forms triangle with node 7: <5, 6, 7>.
- Edge (5, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 0) forms triangles with nodes 1 and 3: <0, 1, 5> and <0, 3, 5>.
- Edge (5, 3) forms triangle with node 9: <3, 5, 9>.
- Edge (9, 4) forms triangle with node 7: <4, 7, 9>.
- Edge (9, 0) forms triangles with nodes 1 and 3: <0, 1, 9> and <0, 3, 9>.
- Edge (6, 5) forms triangle with node 7: <5, 6, 7>.
- Edge (6, 1) forms triangle with node 0: <1, 5, 6>.
- Edge (6, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 9) forms triangle with node 7: <4, 7, 9>.
- Edge (4, 0) forms triangles with nodes 1 and 3: <0, 1, 4> and <0, 3, 4>.
- Edge (7, 5) forms triangle with node 0: <5, 7, 0>.
- Edge (1, 6) forms triangle with node 5: <1, 5, 6>.
- Edge (1, 3) forms triangle with node 0: <1, 3, 0>.
- Edge (1, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 5) forms triangle with node 9: <3, 5, 9>.
- Edge (8, 5) forms triangle with node 0: <5, 8, 0>.
- Edge (2, 6) does not form a triangle.

Count of triangles: [11]

Unique triangles found: <5, 6, 7>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 0>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 4>.
