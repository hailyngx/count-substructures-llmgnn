Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 26) (10, 18) (11, 3) (4, 18) (4, 23) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 20) (18, 12) (3, 11) (3, 5) (27, 8) (27, 19) (27, 13) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 26) (5, 21) (5, 16) (19, 27) (19, 5) (19, 24) (19, 9) (9, 19) (9, 29) (9, 15) (29, 9) (29, 1) (29, 8) (13, 27) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 23) (17, 13) (17, 7) (17, 15) (14, 26) (14, 28) (14, 16) (14, 25) (14, 21) (26, 10) (26, 5) (26, 14) (26, 6) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 20) (7, 1) (16, 5) (16, 14) (16, 7) (16, 22) (22, 16) (22, 2) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 23) (6, 26) (24, 19) (1, 29) (1, 7) (1, 0) (2, 13) (2, 22) (2, 28) (2, 25) (20, 18) (20, 7) (20, 21) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 28) (21, 5) (21, 14) (21, 20) (21, 8) (0, 1) (23, 4) (23, 13) (23, 12) (8, 27) (8, 29) (8, 21) (25, 14) (25, 2) (28, 14) (28, 2) (28, 15) 

Response:
Edges sorted by the lower label of the vertices in each pair:
(0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 29) (2, 13) (2, 22) (2, 25) (2, 28) (3, 5) (3, 11) (4, 18) (4, 23) (5, 19) (5, 21) (5, 26) (6, 26) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 20) (8, 21) (8, 27) (8, 29) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 29) (10, 18) (10, 26) (11, 3) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 23) (13, 17) (13, 27) (13, 23) (13, 12) (14, 16) (14, 21) (14, 25) (14, 26) (14, 28) (15, 17) (15, 28) (15, 9) (16, 22) (16, 5) (16, 7) (16, 14) (17, 15) (17, 7) (17, 13) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 20) (19, 5) (19, 9) (19, 24) (19, 27) (20, 7) (20, 18) (20, 21) (21, 5) (21, 8) (21, 14) (21, 20) (22, 2) (22, 16) (23, 4) (23, 12) (23, 13) (24, 19) (25, 2) (25, 14) (26, 5) (26, 6) (26, 10) (26, 14) (27, 8) (27, 13) (27, 19) (28, 14) (28, 15) (28, 2) (29, 1) (29, 9) (29, 8)

Counting the triangles:
Triangles: [18]
