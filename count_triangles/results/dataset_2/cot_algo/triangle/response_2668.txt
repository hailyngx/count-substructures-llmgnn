Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 5) (11, 12) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 9) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 5) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph and count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (10, 6), (10, 2), (10, 5), (11, 5), (11, 12), (7, 12), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 13), (7, 8), (12, 11), (12, 7), (12, 4), (12, 9), (2, 10), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 13), (2, 6), (8, 7), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 1), (4, 12), (4, 3), (4, 1), (4, 6), (0, 5), (0, 1), (0, 6), (0, 9), (3, 7), (3, 4), (3, 14), (3, 9), (1, 8), (1, 4), (1, 0), (1, 14), (5, 10), (5, 11), (5, 8), (5, 0), (5, 14), (14, 3), (14, 1), (14, 5), (9, 12), (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 13), (6, 10), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 0), (6, 13), (13, 7), (13, 2), (13, 9), (13, 6)

Sorted vertices by their number of connections (degrees):
Degrees: 0(4), 11(2), 1(4), 3(4), 4(4), 5(4), 6(4), 9(4), 14(3), 10(3), 8(3), 13(3), 7(5), 2(5), 12(4)

Based on Degree-Based Ordering, we proceed as follows:
1. Start with vertex 0:
   - Adjacent vertices: 5, 1, 6, 9
   - Check shared connections for each pair of adjacent vertices.

2. Continue with the remaining vertices based on their degrees.

After counting all the triangles, the total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [9].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 14>, <3, 4, 9>, <7, 12, 13>.
