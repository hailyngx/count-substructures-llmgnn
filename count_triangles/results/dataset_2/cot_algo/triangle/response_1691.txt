Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first:

Node 0 is connected to nodes: 5, 1, 8, 6
Node 1 is connected to nodes: 5, 9, 0
Node 2 is connected to nodes: 5, 9, 6, 8
Node 3 is connected to nodes: 7, 4, 8
Node 4 is connected to nodes: 6, 3, 8
Node 5 is connected to nodes: 2, 1, 0, 7
Node 6 is connected to nodes: 9, 2, 8, 4, 0
Node 7 is connected to nodes: 5, 9, 3, 8
Node 8 is connected to nodes: 6, 3, 4, 2, 0, 7
Node 9 is connected to nodes: 6, 2, 1, 7

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 0 -> 2 connections
Node 1 -> 2 connections
Node 3 -> 3 connections
Node 4 -> 3 connections
Node 7 -> 3 connections
Node 5 -> 4 connections
Node 9 -> 4 connections
Node 6 -> 5 connections
Node 8 -> 6 connections
Node 2 -> 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge considering only the cases where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:

- Edge (5, 2): Both nodes have 4 and 6 connections, respectively.
- Edge (5, 1): Both nodes have 4 connections, but node 1 is lower labeled.
- Edge (5, 0): Node 0 has 2 connections, lower than node 5 with 4 connections. Forms a triangle with node 1.
- Edge (5, 7): Node 7 has 3 connections, lower than node 5 with 4 connections. Forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 9.
- Edge (9, 6): Node 9 has 4 connections, lower than node 6 with 5 connections. Forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 7.
- Edge (9, 2): Node 9 has 4 connections, lower than node 2 with 6 connections. Forms a triangle with nodes 1, 7, and 8.
- Remaining edges do not meet the criteria.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles are <1, 5, 0>, <1, 7, 5>, <1, 7, 9>.
