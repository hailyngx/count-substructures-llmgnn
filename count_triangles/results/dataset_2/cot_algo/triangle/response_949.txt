Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 26) (15, 20) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 18) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 20) (20, 15) (20, 8) (20, 14) (17, 29) (17, 6) (17, 24) (17, 27) (29, 17) (29, 5) (29, 18) (13, 26) (13, 28) (13, 19) (26, 3) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 2) (28, 13) (28, 26) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 12) (25, 5) (18, 7) (18, 29) (18, 26) (18, 10) (18, 16) (0, 11) (0, 16) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 5) (2, 15) (2, 26) (2, 1) (2, 21) (22, 27) (22, 6) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 23) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 22) (6, 27) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (24, 17) (24, 21) (21, 2) (21, 24) (21, 27) (21, 23) (21, 14) (27, 17) (27, 22) (27, 6) (27, 21) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 19) (5, 29) (5, 25) (5, 16) (23, 12) (23, 21) (19, 13) (19, 12) (19, 10) (14, 20) (14, 21) 

Response:
The given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: (3, 6), (3, 26), (15, 20), (15, 2), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 11), (7, 4), (7, 1), (7, 18), (8, 4), (8, 10), (8, 20), (20, 15), (20, 8), (20, 14), (17, 29), (17, 6), (17, 24), (17, 27), (29, 17), (29, 5), (29, 18), (13, 26), (13, 28), (13, 19), (26, 3), (26, 13), (26, 28), (26, 18), (26, 2), (28, 13), (28, 26), (11, 4), (11, 0), (11, 12), (25, 5), (18, 7), (18, 29), (18, 26), (18, 10), (18, 16), (0, 11), (0, 16), (16, 18), (16, 0), (16, 5), (2, 15), (2, 26), (2, 1), (2, 21), (22, 27), (22, 6), (12, 11), (12, 19), (12, 23), (6, 3), (6, 17), (6, 22), (6, 27), (9, 4), (9, 1), (1, 7), (1, 2), (1, 9), (24, 17), (24, 21), (21, 2), (21, 24), (21, 27), (21, 23), (21, 14), (27, 17), (27, 22), (27, 6), (27, 21), (10, 8), (10, 18), (10, 19), (5, 29), (5, 25), (5, 16), (23, 12), (23, 21), (19, 13), (19, 12), (19, 10), (14, 20)

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices by their degree:

Vertices by degree: 23(2), 24(2), 25(2), 0(3), 9(3), 10(3), 12(3), 14(3), 15(3), 16(3), 18(6), 1(4), 11(4), 13(4), 17(4), 19(4), 20(4), 21(5), 2(5), 22(2), 26(6), 27(4), 28(3), 3(2), 4(7), 5(4), 6(5), 7(3), 8(3), 29(4)

With this ordering, we can now proceed to count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles is [17].

Unique triangles found are: <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <6, 17, 27>, <10, 18, 26>, <11, 12, 19>, <1, 2, 21>, <1, 7, 18>, <1, 9, 4>, <12, 19, 10>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 8, 20>, <25, 5, 16>, <13, 19, 12>, <13, 26, 18>, <14, 20, 15>, <16, 5, 29>, <18, 16, 0>
