Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 18) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 13) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 14) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 8) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (12, 7) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 19) (5, 4) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 6) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 14) (6, 8) (6, 19) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 16) (14, 13) (9, 15) (9, 13) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order. 

Here are the vertices sorted by their degrees (number of connections):
Node 11: 0 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 16: 1 connection
Node 19: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 10: 5 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 18: 5 connections
Node 13: 6 connections
Node 14: 6 connections
Node 15: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering, we will only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

By applying this method, we find the following triangles:
