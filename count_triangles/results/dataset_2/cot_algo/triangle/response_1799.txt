Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 5) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 13) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows with 15 nodes and the corresponding edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) 
(7, 6) (7, 1) 
(6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) 
(9, 2) (9, 13) 
(8, 13) (8, 10) 
(13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) 
(2, 5) 
(12, 1) 
(11, 14) (11, 0) 
(5, 14) 
(3, 5) 
(1, 9) 
(10, 8)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices based on the number of connections are as follows:
Nodes: {7, 5, 9, 8, 11, 10, 12, 14, 2, 6, 1, 13, 0, 3, 4}

Now, we will proceed with counting the triangles based on the shared connections between vertices with edges sorted according to the lower labeled vertices having fewer connections.

After counting, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [8]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 13>
<0, 4, 12>
<0, 11, 12>
<0, 11, 3>
<1, 13, 14>
<4, 3, 0>
<2, 6, 12>
<2, 6, 3>
