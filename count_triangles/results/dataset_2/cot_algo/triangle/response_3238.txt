Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 6), (7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 9), (1, 8), (3, 0), (3, 9), (8, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (6, 5), (2, 5)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes sorted by degree: 5, 3, 9, 8, 0, 2, 1, 7, 4, 6

Now, we will count the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Starting with edge (4, 7):
   Nodes 4 and 7 have lower degrees than 0 and 6. They share a connection with node 0.
   <0, 4, 7> is a triangle.

2. Moving to edge (4, 8):
   Nodes 4 and 8 have lower degrees than 0 and 6. They share a connection with node 0.
   <0, 4, 8> is a triangle.

3. Considering edge (4, 0):
   Nodes 4 and 0 have lower degrees than 7 and 6. They share connections with nodes 7 and 6.
   No new triangles.

4. For edge (4, 6):
   Nodes 4 and 6 have lower degrees than 0 and 7. They share connections with nodes 0 and 7.
   No new triangles.

5. Edge (7, 0):
   Nodes 7 and 0 have lower degrees than 6 and 2. They share a connection with node 6.
   <6, 7, 0> is a triangle.

6. Edge (7, 6):
   Nodes 7 and 6 have lower degrees than 0 and 2. They share connections with nodes 0 and 2.
   No new triangles.

7. Edge (7, 2):
   Nodes 7 and 2 have lower degrees than 6 and 1. They share a connection with node 6.
   <6, 7, 2> is a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles found: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <6, 7, 0>
