Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 1) (16, 19) (5, 18) (5, 0) (9, 14) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 8) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 10) (14, 9) (14, 2) (6, 13) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 18) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 14) (19, 11) (19, 16) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 18) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) from least to most. Then, relabel the vertices accordingly.

After sorting the nodes based on their degrees, the new labels will be:
0 - 4 connections
14 - 2 connections
9 - 1 connection
5 - 2 connections
16 - 2 connections
3 - 4 connections
8 - 3 connections
13 - 3 connections
10 - 3 connections
17 - 3 connections
6 - 3 connections
2 - 3 connections
1 - 3 connections
7 - 2 connections
12 - 4 connections
18 - 3 connections
11 - 3 connections
19 - 2 connections
15 - 3 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles formed by the edges:

Triangles:
- <0, 8, 13>
- <0, 13, 6>
- <0, 7, 4>
- <0, 13, 12>
- <1, 3, 17>
- <1, 3, 12>
- <1, 4, 12>
- <1, 16, 19>
- <2, 11, 14>
- <3, 10, 17>
- <3, 8, 10>
- <3, 12, 13>
- <4, 11, 12>
- <6, 13, 17>
- <6, 13, 15>
- <6, 15, 18>
- <8, 10, 17>
- <12, 13, 10>
- <12, 3, 13>

There are a total of [19] triangles in the given graph.
