Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 12) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 10) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 7) (2, 3) (18, 16) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 5) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 16) (5, 7) (5, 3) (19, 17) (19, 9) (10, 14) (10, 15) (10, 0) (15, 12) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 11) (15, 16) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 9) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 9) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (11, 15) (11, 13) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 16) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (13, 14) (13, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections). The vertices with their degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 5
- Node 15: degree 5
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 1
- Node 19: degree 3

Based on the degrees, we relabel the vertices as follows:
- Node 2 (degree 1) -> Node 0
- Node 18 (degree 1) -> Node 1
- Node 5 (degree 2) -> Node 2
- Node 11 (degree 2) -> Node 3
- Node 13 (degree 2) -> Node 4
- Node 19 (degree 3) -> Node 5
- Node 3 (degree 3) -> Node 6
- Node 4 (degree 3) -> Node 7
- Node 8 (degree 3) -> Node 8
- Node 17 (degree 3) -> Node 9
- Node 15 (degree 4) -> Node 10
- Node 10 (degree 4) -> Node 11
- Node 16 (degree 4) -> Node 12
- Node 1 (degree 4) -> Node 13
- Node 12 (degree 4) -> Node 14
- Node 6 (degree 4) -> Node 15
- Node 7 (degree 4) -> Node 16
- Node 0 (degree 4) -> Node 17
- Node 9 (degree 5) -> Node 18
- Node 14 (degree 5) -> Node 19

After relabeling, we sort the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
(2, 3), (1, 3), (11, 13), (0, 3), (3, 8), (1, 4), (7, 8), (4, 8), (1, 6), (6, 8), (4, 9), (16, 9), (1, 12), (6, 12), (1, 15), (12, 15), (9, 14), (13, 14), (10, 15), (1, 16), (9, 16), (0, 17), (6, 17), (7, 17), (17, 19), (3, 5), (6, 7), (4, 16), (7, 5), (10, 14), (12, 14)

Now, we count the triangles using the shared connections between vertices:
- Total number of triangles: [89]
- Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 16>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 16>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 12>
<1, 15, 12>
<1, 15, 16>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 9, 16>
<6, 7, 8>
<0, 3, 17>
<6, 7, 17>
<17, 19, 6>
<1, 10, 15>
<1, 14, 15>
<10, 12, 14>
<10, 14, 15>
