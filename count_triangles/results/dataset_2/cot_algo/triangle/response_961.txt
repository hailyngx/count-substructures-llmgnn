Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (8, 10) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (5, 9), (5, 12), (5, 1), (5, 11), (5, 0), (5, 10), (9, 5), (9, 2), (9, 10), (9, 3)
- 1: (4, 7), (4, 3), (4, 2)
- 2: (7, 4), (7, 12), (7, 11), (7, 2), (7, 13)
- 3: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 11), (6, 13)
- 4: (8, 10)
- 5: (12, 5), (12, 7), (12, 13)
- 6: (0, 5), (0, 3), (0, 11)
- 7: (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 11), (1, 2), (1, 14)
- 8: (10, 5), (10, 9), (10, 8)
- 9: (11, 5), (11, 7), (11, 6), (11, 0), (11, 1)
- 10: (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 0), (3, 14)
- 11: (14, 1), (14, 3), (14, 13)
- 12: (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 1), (2, 13)
- 13: (13, 7), (13, 6), (13, 12), (13, 14), (13, 2)

After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new ordering is:
Nodes in order of degree: 8, 10, 0, 4, 6, 12, 1, 3, 11, 13, 2, 7, 5, 9, 14

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we find the following triangles: 

[Total number of triangles: 20]
<2, 3, 14>
<0, 6, 11>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 13>
<1, 6, 11>
<1, 11, 14>
<2, 7, 13>
<2, 13, 14>
<4, 7, 13>
<5, 9, 12>
<5, 9, 13>
<8, 9, 10>
<0, 3, 11>
<2, 6, 13>
<2, 7, 12>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 9, 14>
<4, 7, 12>
<6, 11, 13>
<7, 11, 13>
