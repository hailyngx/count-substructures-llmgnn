Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (4, 7), (4, 2), (4, 9), (4, 5), (4, 6), (7, 4), (7, 1), (7, 8), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 0), (9, 4), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (1, 7), (1, 9), (1, 3), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 8), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 3), (8, 7), (8, 9), (8, 3), (8, 0), (0, 6), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 0)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their degrees (number of connections):

Vertices by degree:
1. 3 (degree 4)
2. 0, 1, 2, 5, 7 (degree 5)
3. 8, 9 (degree 6)
4. 4, 6 (degree 7)

Now, we will count the number of triangles:

1. Consider edge (4, 7):
   - Vertex 4 (degree 7) has more connections than vertex 7 (degree 5): proceed.
   - Shared connections between 4 and 7: 1
   - Triangle <4, 7, 1> found.

2. Consider edge (4, 2):
   - Vertex 4 (degree 7) has more connections than vertex 2 (degree 5): proceed.
   - Shared connections between 4 and 2: 1
   - Triangle <4, 2, 6> found.

3. Consider edge (4, 9):
   - Vertex 4 (degree 7) has more connections than vertex 9 (degree 6): proceed.
   - Shared connections between 4 and 9: 1
   - Triangle <4, 9, 6> found.

4. Consider edge (4, 5):
   - Vertex 4 (degree 7) has more connections than vertex 5 (degree 5): proceed.
   - Shared connections between 4 and 5: 1
   - Triangle <4, 5, 6> found.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles:
<4, 7, 1>
<4, 2, 6>
<4, 9, 6>
<4, 5, 6>
