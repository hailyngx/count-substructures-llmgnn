Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 0) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 10) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 10) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently.  
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:  
Vertex 0: 5 connections  
Vertex 6: 3 connections  
Vertex 9: 3 connections  
Vertex 5: 3 connections  
Vertex 11: 3 connections  
Vertex 13: 3 connections  
Vertex 4: 4 connections  
Vertex 7: 4 connections  
Vertex 12: 4 connections  
Vertex 14: 4 connections  
Vertex 8: 5 connections  
Vertex 2: 5 connections  
Vertex 1: 5 connections  
Vertex 10: 4 connections  
Vertex 3: 5 connections  

Following the degree-based ordering method, we count triangles as follows:
- For each edge, only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.  

In this graph, we find the following triangles:
<0, 13, 9>
<0, 13, 8>
<0, 13, 1>
<0, 13, 3>
<0, 13, 14>
<6, 12, 7>
<9, 13, 8>
<9, 13, 11>
<5, 0, 13>
<5, 0, 1>
<4, 12, 7>
<4, 12, 14>
<4, 10, 2>
<4, 10, 1>
<7, 12, 6>
<7, 12, 4>
<7, 12, 3>
<7, 2, 11>
<7, 2, 5>
<12, 4, 10>
<12, 4, 14>
<12, 3, 14>
<0, 14, 11>
<0, 14, 3>
<5, 2, 8>
<5, 2, 7>
<2, 10, 4>
<2, 10, 1>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 12, 4>
<3, 12, 14>
<3, 10, 4>
<11, 14, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [31].
