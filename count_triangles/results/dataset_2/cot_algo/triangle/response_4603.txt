Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Let's list the nodes and their connections based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 5, 2, 1, 3
- Node 1: 9, 6, 4, 0
- Node 2: 4, 1, 3, 0
- Node 3: 5, 9, 8, 2, 0
- Node 4: 9, 6, 8, 2, 1
- Node 5: 9, 8, 0, 3, 7
- Node 6: 9, 4
- Node 7: 5, 8
- Node 8: 5, 4, 3, 7
- Node 9: 5, 6, 4, 3, 1

Next, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Node 0 (degree 4) -> Node A
- Node 1 (degree 4) -> Node B
- Node 2 (degree 4) -> Node C
- Node 3 (degree 5) -> Node D
- Node 4 (degree 5) -> Node E
- Node 5 (degree 5) -> Node F
- Node 6 (degree 2) -> Node G
- Node 7 (degree 2) -> Node H
- Node 8 (degree 4) -> Node I
- Node 9 (degree 5) -> Node J
