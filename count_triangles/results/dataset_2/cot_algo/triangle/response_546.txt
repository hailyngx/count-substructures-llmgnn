Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 14) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 10) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 10) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (5, 9)
- 1: (5, 11), (5, 14), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 8)
- 2: (3, 4), (3, 6), (2, 8), (2, 10)
- 3: (2, 6), (4, 8), (3, 9), (3, 5), (3, 11)
- 4: (6, 8), (10, 2), (4, 6), (12, 13), (4, 3), (4, 12)
- 5: (0, 9), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 10)
- 6: (1, 4), (1, 10), (1, 2), (1, 5), (6, 8), (2, 10), (6, 1)
- 7: (9, 0)
- 8: (14, 2), (1, 2), (8, 6), (8, 10), (1, 4), (8, 4), (1, 11), (8, 14)
- 9: (7, 9), (9, 12), (9, 3), (0, 5), (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 9), (9, 12)
- 10: (9, 4), (10, 5), (2, 3), (6, 1), (10, 9), (2, 6), (10, 4), (5, 10)
- 11: (3, 1), (9, 12), (11, 9), (11, 12)
- 12: (13, 9), (9, 12), (4, 13), (13, 14), (11, 3), (4, 11)
- 13: (12, 9), (14, 12)
- 14: (13, 12), (14, 1), (14, 8)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their degree in ascending order and re-label the nodes accordingly:
New labels: 
0 (Degree: 1), 14 (Degree: 1), 7 (Degree: 1), 5 (Degree: 4), 13 (Degree: 4), 10 (Degree: 4), 11 (Degree: 4), 12 (Degree: 4), 2 (Degree: 5), 6 (Degree: 5), 9 (Degree: 8), 3 (Degree: 5), 1 (Degree: 5), 8 (Degree: 8), 4 (Degree: 6)

Now, based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will identify the triangles:
Triangles:  [<1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 10>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 6, 4>, <1, 11, 3>, <1, 11, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 12>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 10>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 6>]

Total number of triangles: [14]
