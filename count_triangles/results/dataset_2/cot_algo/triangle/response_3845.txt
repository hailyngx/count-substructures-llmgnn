Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (1, 4) (1, 13) (9, 13) (9, 11) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
- 0: (6, 11), (2, 0), (10, 0)
- 1: (4, 1), (13, 1)
- 2: (5, 2), (12, 2), (14, 2), (0, 2)
- 3: (7, 3), (5, 3), (11, 3), (14, 3)
- 4: (7, 4), (13, 4), (1, 4), (6, 4)
- 5: (7, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5)
- 6: (4, 6), (8, 6), (12, 6), (0, 6)
- 7: (4, 7), (3, 7), (10, 7), (13, 7), (5, 7)
- 8: (13, 8), (10, 8), (6, 8), (12, 8)
- 9: (13, 9), (11, 9)
- 10: (7, 10), (12, 10), (10, 0), (8, 10)
- 11: (3, 11), (9, 11), (0, 11), (14, 11)
- 12: (8, 12), (6, 12), (13, 12), (2, 12), (10, 12), (14, 12)
- 13: (4, 13), (8, 13), (1, 13), (9, 13), (7, 13), (12, 13)
- 14: (3, 14), (11, 14), (2, 14), (12, 14)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:
Nodes sorted by degree: 1, 9, 5, 10, 4, 8, 0, 2, 6, 14, 7, 3, 11, 12, 13
Triangles: 
- Total number of triangles: [18]
- Unique triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 12>, <0, 6, 12>, <0, 10, 12>, <0, 3, 11>, <0, 11, 14>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 5, 14>, <2, 3, 14>, <2, 6, 12>, <3, 5, 14>, <3, 11, 14>, <4, 1, 13>, <7, 4, 13>, <7, 13, 8>, <8, 12, 13>, <10, 7, 13>, <10, 12, 13>
