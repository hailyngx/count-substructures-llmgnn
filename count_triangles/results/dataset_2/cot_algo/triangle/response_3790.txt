Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 7) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 0) (15, 10) (15, 16) (15, 9) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 19) (16, 10) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 4) (6, 18) (14, 19) (14, 4) (12, 16) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 15) (9, 19) (18, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 14) (19, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 14) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are as follows:
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertices 6, 12, 18, 2, 8: 2 connections each
Vertices 5, 14: 3 connections each
Vertices 1, 6, 11, 12: 4 connections each
Vertices 0, 9, 15, 18: 5 connections each
Vertices 3, 13: 6 connections each
Vertices 4, 7, 16: 7 connections each
Vertex 19: 8 connections
Vertex 10 and 17: 9 connections each

After relabeling the vertices according to their degrees, the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections are as follows:
(1, 17), (1, 2), (1, 13), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 10), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 0), (4, 16), (4, 14), (5, 0), (5, 8), (6, 18), (7, 10), (9, 11), (9, 17), (9, 15), (9, 19), (10, 11), (10, 15), (10, 3), (10, 7), (10, 16), (11, 9), (13, 1), (13, 17), (13, 19), (14, 4), (15, 16), (16, 12), (18, 6), (19, 17), (19, 13), (19, 14)

There are a total of [9] triangles in the graph. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 13, 17>
<1, 4, 14>
<3, 0, 2>
<4, 1, 14>
<9, 11, 17>
<9, 15, 19>
<10, 11, 15>
<13, 1, 17>
<13, 19, 14>
