Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 14) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 2) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 4) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be visualized in the following format:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (9, 14), (9, 0), (9, 7), (1, 11), (1, 13), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 7), (3, 0), (3, 13), (3, 2), (10, 12), (10, 14), (10, 7), (11, 4), (8, 2), (13, 7), (6, 12)

Next, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes by degree: 2, 4, 12, 13, 14, 3, 5, 6, 10, 1, 8, 11, 0, 9, 7

Using the degree-based ordering, we consider the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

Triangles formed (in order of consideration):
[<1, 7, 11>]
[<0, 3, 13>]
[<2, 8, 13>]
[<2, 8, 12>]
[<4, 11, 1>]
[<4, 11, 14>]
[<6, 7, 10>]
[<6, 7, 11>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
