Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first label the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 0 - Degree 4
Vertex 1 - Degree 5
Vertex 2 - Degree 5
Vertex 3 - Degree 3
Vertex 4 - Degree 4
Vertex 5 - Degree 3
Vertex 6 - Degree 4
Vertex 7 - Degree 4
Vertex 8 - Degree 5
Vertex 9 - Degree 5

Now, we will list the edges while considering only the pairs where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. (0, 2) - Forms a triangle with vertex 4: <0, 2, 4>
2. (0, 6) - Forms a triangle with vertex 3: <0, 3, 6>
3. (0, 3) - Forms a triangle with vertex 5: <0, 3, 5>
4. (1, 4) - Forms a triangle with vertex 9: <1, 4, 9>
5. (1, 7) - Forms a triangle with vertex 9: <1, 7, 9>
6. (1, 6) - Forms a triangle with vertex 9: <1, 6, 9>
7. (1, 8) - Forms a triangle with vertex 9: <1, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
