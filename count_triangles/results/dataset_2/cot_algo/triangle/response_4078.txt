Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 0), (6, 9), (6, 3), (6, 2), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 7), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 4), (3, 8), (2, 6), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 0), (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 7), (0, 9), (0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 4), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 0)

Next, we will sort the vertices by their degree:

Vertices by degree:
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 7: 7 connections
Node 3: 7 connections
Node 8: 7 connections
Node 9: 7 connections

Now, we will label the nodes accordingly:
Node 5: 0
Node 6: 1
Node 4: 2
Node 2: 3
Node 0: 4
Node 1: 5
Node 7: 6
Node 3: 7
Node 8: 8
Node 9: 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 18]
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 7, 3>
<0, 4, 1>
<6, 7, 3>
<6, 5, 7>
<6, 9, 0>
<6, 8, 7>
<1, 9, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 7, 0>
<3, 9, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<2, 7, 0>
<2, 5, 1>
<4, 7, 3>
<4, 1, 0>
