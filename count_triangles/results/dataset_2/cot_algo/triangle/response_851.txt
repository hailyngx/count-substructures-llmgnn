Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. The vertices with their degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 5
- Node 2: Degree 4
- Node 3: Degree 5
- Node 4: Degree 4
- Node 5: Degree 5
- Node 6: Degree 5
- Node 7: Degree 5
- Node 8: Degree 3
- Node 9: Degree 4
- Node 10: Degree 4
- Node 11: Degree 3
- Node 12: Degree 3
- Node 13: Degree 2
- Node 14: Degree 4

Now, we will proceed with counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The triangles found are: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 10>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 10>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 4, 14>, <3, 7, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
