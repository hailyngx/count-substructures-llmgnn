Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the vertices based on their degree, which is the number of connections each vertex has. Then, we can proceed with counting the number of triangles.

After sorting the vertices by degree, the relabeled vertices are as follows:
```
Vertex 0 - Degree: 2
Vertex 1 - Degree: 3
Vertex 2 - Degree: 3
Vertex 3 - Degree: 4
Vertex 4 - Degree: 3
Vertex 5 - Degree: 5
Vertex 6 - Degree: 2
Vertex 7 - Degree: 4
Vertex 8 - Degree: 5
Vertex 9 - Degree: 4
Vertex 10 - Degree: 2
Vertex 11 - Degree: 4
Vertex 12 - Degree: 4
Vertex 13 - Degree: 3
Vertex 14 - Degree: 3
Vertex 15 - Degree: 1
Vertex 16 - Degree: 3
Vertex 17 - Degree: 4
Vertex 18 - Degree: 3
Vertex 19 - Degree: 2
Vertex 20 - Degree: 4
Vertex 21 - Degree: 5
Vertex 22 - Degree: 4
Vertex 23 - Degree: 4
Vertex 24 - Degree: 2
Vertex 25 - Degree: 3
Vertex 26 - Degree: 3
Vertex 27 - Degree: 3
Vertex 28 - Degree: 2
Vertex 29 - Degree: 2
```

Now, let's count the triangles by looking at the given edges and following the steps mentioned in the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is: [20].

The unique triangles found are:
```
<3, 0, 18>
<3, 19, 27>
<1, 5, 14>
<1, 23, 29>
<21, 3, 23>
<7, 17, 10>
<7, 21, 12>
<8, 5, 11>
<8, 6, 27>
<8, 18, 26>
<10, 17, 15>
<17, 7, 21>
<17, 11, 22>
<20, 4, 23>
<13, 2, 19>
<13, 14, 16>
<22, 9, 16>
<22, 12, 21>
<25, 21, 12>
<25, 22, 11>
