Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves the following steps:
1. Sort the vertices based on the number of connections in ascending order.
2. Relabel the nodes based on their new sorted order.
3. Identify shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to count triangles.

Following these steps, the sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is:
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will check the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (2, 7) will be considered, forming a triangle <2, 7, 4>.
- Edge (0, 2) will be considered, forming a triangle <0, 2, 4>.
