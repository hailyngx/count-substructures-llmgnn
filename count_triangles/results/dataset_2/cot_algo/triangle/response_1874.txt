Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 12) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (0, 11) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 13) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 16) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 16) (4, 17) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 1) (13, 14) (13, 15) (8, 5) (8, 16) (9, 4) (9, 15) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 19) (1, 7) (1, 18) (1, 16) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 16) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 9) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 19) 

Response:
The vertices with their respective number of connections are as follows:
Vertex 0: 1 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 10: 4 connections
Vertex 11: 5 connections
Vertex 12: 3 connections
Vertex 13: 2 connections
Vertex 14: 3 connections
Vertex 15: 3 connections
Vertex 16: 5 connections
Vertex 17: 3 connections
Vertex 18: 3 connections
Vertex 19: 4 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

The triangles in the graph are:
