Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Sorted vertices by their number of connections:
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 5: 6 connections

Now we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

Count of triangles: [18]
Unique triangles found: <1, 4, 6>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 8, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 2, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 8, 9>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 8, 5>, <1, 6, 7>
