Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 7) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 12) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows with the nodes and their connections:

0: 4, 7, 12, 14, 6  
1: 5, 8, 2  
2: 5, 0, 14, 1, 6, 11  
3: 5, 4  
4: 0, 11, 6, 3  
5: 2, 8, 1, 3, 10  
6: 4, 7, 0, 14, 2, 12  
7: 0, 6, 13  
8: 5, 14, 10, 11, 1  
9: 11, 12  
10: 5, 8, 14, 12  
11: 9, 4, 8, 2  
12: 9, 0, 6, 10  
13: 7  
14: 8, 0, 6, 2, 10  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can first sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes sorted by degree:  
13 (degree 1)  
1, 3, 9 (degree 2)  
4, 7 (degree 3)  
0, 10, 12 (degree 4)  
5, 8, 11, 13 (degree 5)  
2, 6, 14 (degree 6)  

Now, we can proceed with counting triangles based on the edges given:

Total number of triangles: [8]  
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 6, 12>, <0, 6, 14>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 12>, <4, 6, 12>, <6, 10, 14>
