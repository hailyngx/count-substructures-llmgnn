Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:  
0 (degree 5)  
2 (degree 5)  
4 (degree 5)  
6 (degree 5)  
8 (degree 5)  
5 (degree 6)  
7 (degree 6)  
9 (degree 6)  
1 (degree 7)  
3 (degree 7)  

Based on the sorted vertices, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

Triangles:  
[45]  
<0, 3, 5>  
<0, 5, 9>  
<0, 7, 8>  
<0, 7, 9>  
<1, 3, 5>  
<1, 3, 7>  
<1, 5, 7>  
<1, 5, 9>  
<2, 7, 8>  
<2, 8, 9>  
<3, 5, 7>  
<3, 5, 9>  
<4, 7, 8>  
<4, 7, 9>  
<5, 7, 9>
