Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 19) (7, 17) (14, 9) (14, 8) (17, 7) (17, 15) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 0) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 2) (0, 18) (0, 15) (1, 5) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 8) (16, 6) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 6) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 15) (2, 3) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 2) (15, 6) (15, 12) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 13) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 3) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 15) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 13) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices in non-decreasing order of their degrees. The vertices are then relabeled based on this order.

Here is the sorted list of nodes based on their number of connections:
0: 3 connections
1: 2 connections
2: 4 connections
13: 3 connections
5: 3 connections
7: 3 connections
9: 2 connections
11: 4 connections
14: 2 connections
16: 3 connections
17: 2 connections
19: 5 connections
18: 5 connections
6: 5 connections
8: 5 connections
12: 4 connections
15: 5 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 4 connections

Using these relabeled vertices, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph:

The number of triangles in the graph is [15].

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 18>
<0, 2, 15>
<0, 15, 17>
<0, 15, 6>
<1, 5, 3>
<2, 15, 3>
<2, 15, 6>
<3, 13, 2>
<4, 18, 19>
<6, 11, 8>
<6, 11, 16>
<6, 15, 12>
<8, 14, 9>
<8, 14, 16>
<8, 15, 12>
