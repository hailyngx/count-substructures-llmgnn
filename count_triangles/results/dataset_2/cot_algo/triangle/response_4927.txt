Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 2) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (10, 12) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 18) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 1) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 15) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 12) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 13) (15, 19) (7, 1) (7, 19) (2, 16) (2, 17) (3, 16) (3, 4) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 5) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 19) (0, 4) (0, 19) 

Response:
The given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges:
(11, 16), (11, 9), (16, 11), (16, 15), (16, 3), (16, 8), (16, 2), (6, 9), (6, 18), (6, 4), (6, 13), (9, 11), (9, 6), (9, 8), (14, 18), (14, 15), (14, 13), (17, 12), (17, 2), (10, 12), (4, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (8, 16), (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 18), (5, 19), (5, 18), (5, 1), (13, 6), (13, 14), (13, 15), (1, 8), (1, 5), (1, 7), (19, 5), (19, 15), (19, 7), (19, 0), (19, 12), (15, 16), (15, 14), (15, 13), (15, 19), (7, 1), (7, 19), (2, 16), (2, 17), (3, 16), (3, 4), (18, 6), (18, 14), (18, 8), (18, 5), (12, 17), (12, 10), (12, 19), (0, 4), (0, 19)

Using Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows:
Node Degrees: [(0, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 6), (7, 2), (8, 5), (9, 4), (10, 2), (11, 2), (12, 4), (13, 4), (14, 3), (15, 5), (16, 6), (17, 2), (18, 5), (19, 5)]

Now, we count the number of triangles by examining the shared connections between the vertices of each edge.

The total number of triangles is [12].

Unique triangles: 
<6, 9, 13>, <6, 13, 15>, <6, 13, 18>, <6, 13, 14>, 
<0, 4, 19>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 3>, <1, 5, 8>, 
<1, 5, 19>, <8, 1, 5>, <8, 1, 19>, <15, 14, 13>
