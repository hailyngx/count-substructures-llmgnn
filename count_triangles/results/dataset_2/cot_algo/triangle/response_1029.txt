Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as shown in the list of edges you provided. Let's now identify the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Now, let's sort the vertices by their degrees:

Vertices in increasing order of degrees:
0 (degree 5), 3 (degree 5), 4 (degree 2), 8 (degree 3), 6 (degree 3), 9 (degree 3), 7 (degree 6), 2 (degree 5), 5 (degree 8), 1 (degree 8)

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices relabeled:
0 → 0 (degree 5)
3 → 1 (degree 5)
4 → 2 (degree 2)
8 → 3 (degree 3)
6 → 4 (degree 3)
9 → 5 (degree 3)
7 → 6 (degree 6)
2 → 7 (degree 5)
5 → 8 (degree 8)
1 → 9 (degree 8)

Now, we will check each edge, making sure the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Counting the triangles via shared connections:
Total triangles: [18]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 6, 3>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 8, 7>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 7, 1>, <3, 7, 5>, <3, 7, 1>, <4, 1, 5>, <4, 1, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <6, 5, 7>, <6, 5, 1>, <6, 5, 2>, <6, 5, 0>, <6, 5, 3>, <6, 8, 7>, <8, 7, 1>
