Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows these steps:

1. List all vertices and their degrees:
   - Node 0: degree 3
   - Node 1: degree 4
   - Node 2: degree 3
   - Node 3: degree 1
   - Node 4: degree 2
   - Node 5: degree 3
   - Node 6: degree 4
   - Node 7: degree 2
   - Node 8: degree 3
   - Node 9: degree 3
   - Node 10: degree 4
   - Node 11: degree 4
   - Node 12: degree 2
   - Node 13: degree 4
   - Node 14: degree 5
   - Node 15: degree 2
   - Node 16: degree 5
   - Node 17: degree 2
   - Node 18: degree 4
   - Node 19: degree 4
   - Node 20: degree 3
   - Node 21: degree 3
   - Node 22: degree 3
   - Node 23: degree 2
   - Node 24: degree 3
   - Node 25: degree 2
   - Node 26: degree 4
   - Node 27: degree 2
   - Node 28: degree 5
   - Node 29: degree 3

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
   - Node 3: degree 1 -> relabel as Node 0
   - Node 7: degree 2 -> relabel as Node 1
   - Node 12: degree 2 -> relabel as Node 2
   - Node 17: degree 2 -> relabel as Node 3
   - Node 23: degree 2 -> relabel as Node 4
   - Node 25: degree 2 -> relabel as Node 5
   - Node 15: degree 2 -> relabel as Node 6
   - Node 27: degree 2 -> relabel as Node 7
   - Node 0: degree 3 -> relabel as Node 8
   - Node 2: degree 3 -> relabel as Node 9
   - Node 5: degree 3 -> relabel as Node 10
   - Node 9: degree 3 -> relabel as Node 11
   - Node 20: degree 3 -> relabel as Node 12
   - Node 21: degree 3 -> relabel as Node 13
   - Node 22: degree 3 -> relabel as Node 14
   - Node 24: degree 3 -> relabel as Node 15
   - Node 29: degree 3 -> relabel as Node 16
   - Node 8: degree 3 -> relabel as Node 17
   - Node 10: degree 4 -> relabel as Node 18
   - Node 11: degree 4 -> relabel as Node 19
   - Node 13: degree 4 -> relabel as Node 20
   - Node 19: degree 4 -> relabel as Node 21
   - Node 28: degree 5 -> relabel as Node 22
   - Node 14: degree 5 -> relabel as Node 23
   - Node 1: degree 4 -> relabel as Node 24
   - Node 4: degree 2 -> relabel as Node 25
   - Node 6: degree 4 -> relabel as Node 26
   - Node 16: degree 5 -> relabel as Node 27
   - Node 18: degree 4 -> relabel as Node 28
   - Node 26: degree 4 -> relabel as Node 29

3. Calculate the triangles based on the relabeled nodes:
   - Triangles found: 27

Output: [27]
