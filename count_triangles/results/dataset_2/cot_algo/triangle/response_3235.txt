Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 11) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 4) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 13) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 0), 
(9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 10), (9, 3), 
(7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 2), 
(12, 4), (12, 10), (12, 6), (12, 11), 
(0, 7), (0, 13), 
(14, 11), (14, 6), (14, 1), (14, 4), 
(3, 10), (3, 13), 
(11, 14), (11, 13), 
(8, 10), (8, 1), 
(4, 12), (4, 14), (4, 6), 
(2, 7), (2, 1), 
(6, 13), 
(1, 10)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node Degrees:
0: 3
1: 4
2: 3
3: 3
4: 6
5: 5
6: 5
7: 3
8: 4
9: 5
10: 5
11: 4
12: 3
13: 4
14: 4

Sorted Nodes based on Degrees:
0, 2, 7, 12, 3, 11, 13, 1, 8, 14, 5, 9, 10, 4, 6

Based on the sorted order, the triangles in the graph are:
[Total number of triangles: 15]
<0, 7, 13>, <0, 13, 3>, <0, 13, 6>, <0, 13, 11>, <1, 10, 8>, <1, 10, 14>, <1, 14, 4>, <2, 1, 7>, <2, 1, 14>, <2, 7, 6>, <3, 9, 10>, <3, 10, 13>, <4, 6, 14>, <4, 6, 12>, <4, 6, 13>
