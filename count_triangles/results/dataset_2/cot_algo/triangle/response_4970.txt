Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 17) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 7) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 17) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 8) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 17) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 16) (19, 4) (19, 14) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 16) (14, 19) (14, 12) (18, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 17) (17, 15) (17, 7) (17, 11) (17, 12) (16, 4) (16, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph by listing the nodes and their connections:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(3, 15), (3, 10), (3, 2), (15, 17), (6, 1), (6, 10), (6, 4), (6, 8), (9, 2), (9, 11), (5, 13), (5, 18), (5, 7), (13, 11), (13, 1), (13, 7), (0, 7), (0, 12), (7, 11), (7, 17), (1, 8), (10, 8), (11, 17), (4, 19), (4, 16), (2, 9), (2, 16), (14, 19), (14, 12), (18, 5), (12, 17)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

0(2), 1(3), 9(3), 18(2), 12(3), 4(3), 14(2), 16(2), 17(4), 19(2), 8(3), 11(4), 5(4), 13(4), 7(6), 6(4), 10(4), 2(4), 3(4), 15(2)

Next, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [18]

Unique triangles found: <7, 11, 17>, <7, 11, 13>, <7, 11, 17>, <7, 11, 13>, <12, 14, 17>, <12, 14, 17>, <12, 14, 19>, <12, 14, 19>, <4, 16, 19>, <10, 3, 15>, <6, 10, 8>, <6, 10, 8>, <6, 10, 3>, <6, 10, 8>, <6, 10, 3>, <1, 13, 8>, <1, 13, 8>, <1, 13, 6>
