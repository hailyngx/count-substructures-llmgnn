Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 28) (17, 18) (6, 9) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 2) (9, 16) (22, 11) (22, 0) (22, 29) (23, 19) (23, 15) (23, 29) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 21) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (1, 26) (1, 15) (1, 29) (26, 1) (26, 18) (26, 7) (2, 9) (2, 12) (21, 4) (21, 28) (21, 19) (28, 17) (28, 21) (28, 5) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 5) (20, 17) (20, 3) (15, 23) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 11) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 7) (19, 23) (19, 21) (18, 17) (18, 26) (7, 6) (7, 26) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 16) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 7) (12, 2) (12, 29) (11, 22) (11, 15) (11, 24) (24, 11) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 25) (29, 22) (29, 23) (29, 1) (29, 12) (25, 14) (25, 9) (25, 24) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 24) (0, 22) (0, 8) (0, 24) (27, 10) 

Response:
Based on the provided graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):

Vertices in ascending order of degrees:
Node 26: degree = 3
Node 27: degree = 1
Node 28: degree = 3
Node 29: degree = 4
Node 0: degree = 3
Node 1: degree = 3
Node 4: degree = 4
Node 5: degree = 3
Node 6: degree = 2
Node 7: degree = 5
Node 8: degree = 3
Node 9: degree = 4
Node 10: degree = 4
Node 11: degree = 3
Node 12: degree = 2
Node 13: degree = 3
Node 14: degree = 3
Node 15: degree = 4
Node 16: degree = 4
Node 17: degree = 4
Node 18: degree = 2
Node 19: degree = 3
Node 20: degree = 2
Node 21: degree = 3
Node 22: degree = 3
Node 23: degree = 3
Node 24: degree = 4
Node 25: degree = 3

Now, let's count the triangles:
Triangles: <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 8, 10>, <0, 8, 24>, <0, 22, 24>, <0, 24, 25>, <1, 15, 29>, <1, 26, 18>, <1, 26, 7>, <2, 9, 16>, <2, 9, 25>, <4, 13, 5>, <4, 13, 21>, <4, 16, 7>, <4, 16, 9>, <5, 13, 7>, <5, 13, 28>, <5, 28, 17>, <6, 7, 26>, <7, 10, 27>, <7, 10, 15>, <7, 10, 16>, <7, 10, 26>, <7, 16, 9>, <9, 16, 7>, <10, 15, 11>, <10, 15, 27>, <11, 15, 23>, <11, 22, 29>, <12, 2, 9>, <12, 2, 29>, <13, 4, 16>, <14, 17, 20>, <15, 23, 19>, <17, 18, 26>, <19, 21, 4>, <19, 21, 28>, <20, 3, 14>, <22, 11, 15>, <22, 11, 24>, <22, 29, 12>, <24, 11, 15>, <24, 11, 22>, <24, 25, 9>, <29, 22, 23> 

Total number of triangles: [42]
