Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (3, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 13) (2, 9) (2, 7) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 0) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on the number of connections are:  
Node 2: Degree 2  
Node 3: Degree 2  
Node 5: Degree 3  
Node 0: Degree 4  
Node 1: Degree 4  
Node 11: Degree 4  
Node 6: Degree 5  
Node 12: Degree 5  
Node 4: Degree 6  
Node 13: Degree 6  
Node 7: Degree 6  
Node 14: Degree 6  
Node 8: Degree 7  
Node 9: Degree 7  

Let's count the triangles by checking the shared connections between vertices for each edge:
[Total number of triangles: 5]
<6, 11, 14>
<4, 8, 14>
<1, 4, 12>
<7, 12, 14>
<6, 10, 14>
