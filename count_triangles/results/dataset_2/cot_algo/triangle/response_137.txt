Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 8) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 4) (12, 10) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 0) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their connections:

(5) - 4 connections
(9) - 5 connections
(4) - 4 connections
(7) - 2 connections
(1) - 3 connections
(3) - 4 connections
(10) - 5 connections
(11) - 4 connections
(6) - 4 connections
(8) - 4 connections
(13) - 3 connections
(12) - 2 connections
(2) - 3 connections
(14) - 4 connections
(0) - 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

1. (5, 9): No triangles formed.
2. (5, 6): Triangle formed with node 0. Triangle: <0, 5, 6>.
3. (5, 8): No triangles formed. 
4. (5, 11): No triangles formed.
5. (9, 6): No triangles formed.
6. (9, 14): No triangles formed.
7. (9, 7): No triangles formed.
8. (9, 0): Triangle formed with node 6. Triangle: <0, 6, 9>.
9. (4, 8): No triangles formed.
10. (4, 12): No triangles formed.
11. (4, 13): No triangles formed.
12. (4, 10): Triangle formed with node 3. Triangle: <3, 4, 10>.
13. (7, 9): No triangles formed.
14. (7, 1): No triangles formed.
15. (1, 3): Triangle formed with node 10. Triangle: <1, 3, 10>.
16. (1, 6): Triangle formed with node 0. Triangle: <0, 1, 6>.
17. (1, 2): No triangles formed.
18. (3, 10): No triangles formed.
19. (3, 11): No triangles formed.
20. (10, 6): Triangle formed with nodes 0 and 1. Triangles: <0, 6, 10> and <1, 6, 10>.
21. (10, 8): No triangles formed.
22. (11, 5): Triangle formed with node 0. Triangle: <0, 5, 11>.
23. (11, 3): No triangles formed.
24. (11, 14): No triangles formed.
25. (6, 5): No triangles formed.
26. (6, 1): No triangles formed.
27. (6, 10): No triangles formed.
28. (6, 0): No triangles formed.
29. (8, 5): No triangles formed.
30. (8, 4): No triangles formed.
31. (8, 10): No triangles formed.
32. (8, 14): No triangles formed.
33. (13, 4): No triangles formed.
34. (13, 2): No triangles formed.
35. (13, 14): No triangles formed.
