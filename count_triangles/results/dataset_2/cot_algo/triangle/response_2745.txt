Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to count the number of triangles efficiently. Let's construct the graph, sort the nodes by their number of connections from least to most, and find the triangles.

The sorted nodes with their respective connections are as follows:
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 9: 6 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

[Total number of triangles: 12]
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 7, 5>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<3, 7, 5>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<7, 9, 2>
<8, 9, 1>
