Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
The sorted nodes based on their degree are as follows:
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 1: 7 connections

Now, we will look for triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

For the edge (5, 6): No triangles found.
For the edge (5, 8): No triangles found.
For the edge (9, 3): No triangles found.
For the edge (9, 1): No triangles found.
For the edge (9, 7): No triangles found.
For the edge (1, 9): No triangles found.
For the edge (1, 3): Found a triangle: <1, 3, 9>.
For the edge (1, 6): No triangles found.
For the edge (1, 4): Found a triangle: <1, 4, 8>.
