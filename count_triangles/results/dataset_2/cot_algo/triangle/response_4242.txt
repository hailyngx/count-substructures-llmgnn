Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (17, 19) (17, 7) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 18) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (0, 10) (0, 5) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 4) (14, 9) (14, 15) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 18) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 15) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 4) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 16) (15, 14) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 5) (12, 5) (12, 19) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 12) (18, 8) (18, 3) (18, 16) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (19, 17) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 12) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method will help to count the number of triangles in this graph. Let's start by sorting the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) from least to most:

Sorted nodes: 13, 0, 12, 13, 5, 1, 16, 4, 14, 11, 2, 17, 6, 18, 3, 15, 7, 8, 9, 10

Now, we will relabel the nodes as follows:
- Node 0 -> A
- Node 5 -> B
- Node 12 -> C
- Node 13 -> D
- Node 1 -> E
- Node 16 -> F
- Node 4 -> G
- Node 14 -> H
- Node 11 -> I
- Node 2 -> J
- Node 17 -> K
- Node 6 -> L
- Node 18 -> M
- Node 3 -> N
- Node 15 -> O
- Node 7 -> P
- Node 8 -> Q
- Node 9 -> R
- Node 10 -> S

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph, considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Counting the triangles:
- Triangles: 20

Unique triangles: <A, B, C>, <B, A, C>, <B, N, F>, <B, O, S>, <A, Q, S>, <C, B, S>, <D, Q, S>, <E, Q, S>, <F, N, G>, <G, B, C>, <N, F, O>, <N, G, F>, <H, R, S>, <I, G, N>, <J, S, G>, <K, P, N>, <L, P, S>, <M, Q, N>, <P, L, S>, <Q, S, S> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [20].
