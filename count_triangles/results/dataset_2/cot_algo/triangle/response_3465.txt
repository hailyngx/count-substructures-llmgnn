Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 14) (18, 10) (18, 16) (18, 12) (15, 10) (15, 7) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 12) (13, 14) (17, 9) (17, 19) (10, 1) (10, 18) (10, 15) (10, 6) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 18) (12, 19) (12, 4) (12, 14) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 7) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 6) (0, 9) (0, 6) (11, 9) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 20
Edges: 60
Edge List:
(5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 14) (18, 10) (18, 16) (18, 12) (15, 10) (15, 7) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 12) (13, 14) (17, 9) (17, 19) (10, 1) (10, 18) (10, 15) (10, 6) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 18) (12, 19) (12, 4) (12, 14) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 7) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 6) (0, 9) (0, 6) (11, 9) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 8)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree. 

Node Degrees:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 13: degree 1
Node 15: degree 2
Node 18: degree 3
Node 6: degree 4
Node 11: degree 2
Node 14: degree 5
Node 3: degree 6
Node 2: degree 4
Node 4: degree 3
Node 7: degree 6
Node 10: degree 4
Node 17: degree 3
Node 19: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 12: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4

Based on the degree-based ordering, let's relabel the vertices in ascending order of degree:
Node 0 -> Node 1
Node 1 -> Node 2
Node 5 -> Node 3
Node 13 -> Node 4
Node 15 -> Node 5
Node 18 -> Node 6
Node 6 -> Node 7
Node 11 -> Node 8
Node 14 -> Node 9
Node 3 -> Node 10
Node 2 -> Node 11
Node 4 -> Node 12
Node 7 -> Node 13
Node 10 -> Node 14
Node 17 -> Node 15
Node 19 -> Node 16
Node 8 - > Node 17
Node 9 -> Node 18
Node 12 -> Node 19
Node 16 -> Node 20

Next, we will count the number of triangles in the graph using the degree-based ordering method.
The total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
The unique triangles found are:
<2, 9, 13>
<2, 12, 14>
<3, 10, 12>
<3, 10, 19>
<3, 11, 12>
<3, 14, 15>
<3, 14, 17>
<4, 12, 19>
<6, 10, 14>
<6, 14, 17>
<6, 14, 19>
<7, 13, 16>
<7, 14, 16>
<10, 14, 17>
<10, 14, 19>
<12, 14, 19>
