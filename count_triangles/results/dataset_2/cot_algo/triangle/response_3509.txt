Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 11) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 12) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 14) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 14) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 2 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 12 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 4 connections.
Node 0 has 5 connections.
Node 7 has 5 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 5 connections.
Node 13 has 3 connections.
Node 11 has 5 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 14 has 4 connections.
Node 10 has 3 connections.

Now, we will proceed with counting the triangles using the degree-based ordering method.

We start with the edge (4, 7) since 4 has 4 connections and 7 has 5 connections. They share nodes 9, 13, and 11 forming <4, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 13>, and <4, 7, 11>.

Moving on to the next qualifying edge (4, 9), we find that 4 and 9 share node 3, creating the triangle <4, 9, 3>.

Continuing with the remaining edges, we find no more triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4] and the unique triangles found are <4, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 13>, <4, 7, 11>, and <4, 9, 3>.
