Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Sorted nodes by the number of connections:
Nodes: 2, 0, 1, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 4, 3

Calculating triangles:
- For edge (0, 1): <0, 1, 6>
- For edge (0, 6): No triangles
- For edge (0, 8): <0, 8, 5>
- For edge (1, 6): <1, 6, 4>
- For edge (1, 7): No triangles
- For edge (2, 4): No triangles
- For edge (2, 8): No triangles
- For edge (3, 4): <3, 4, 6>
- For edge (3, 6): <3, 6, 1>
- For edge (3, 7): No triangles
- For edge (3, 8): <3, 8, 0>
- For edge (3, 9): <3, 9, 5>

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 8, 5>, <1, 6, 4>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 1>, <3, 8, 0>, <3, 9, 5>
