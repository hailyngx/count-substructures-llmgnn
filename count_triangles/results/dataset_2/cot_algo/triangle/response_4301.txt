Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 4) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 4) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 1) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (8, 13), (8, 1), (8, 7), (13, 8), (13, 12), (13, 4), (13, 11), (13, 3), (10, 11), (10, 0), (10, 12), (10, 7), (11, 13), (11, 10), (11, 9), (11, 12), (5, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3), (6, 5), (6, 0), (0, 10), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 2), (0, 7), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 14), (2, 4), (7, 8), (7, 10), (7, 0), (7, 9), (7, 1), (12, 13), (12, 10), (12, 11), (14, 2), (14, 1), (14, 9), (14, 4), (3, 13), (3, 5), (3, 2), (3, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 14), (1, 4), (1, 9), (4, 13), (4, 2), (4, 14), (4, 1), (9, 11), (9, 7), (9, 14), (9, 3), (9, 1)
```

Next, we will apply Degree-Based Ordering to label the vertices accordingly:

Vertices sorted by degree from least to most:
```
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 12: 3 connections
Vertex 14: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 5 connections
Vertex 10: 5 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 11: 5 connections
Vertex 13: 7 connections
```

Now, let's go through the edges and count the number of triangles by checking shared connections between the vertices of each edge. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles:
```
[Total number of triangles: 18]
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 13>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 10>
<0, 7, 14>
<0, 9, 1>
<0, 9, 7>
<0, 10, 7>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 14>
<7, 9, 1>
<7, 9, 11>
