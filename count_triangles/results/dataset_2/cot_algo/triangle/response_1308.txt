Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 4) (16, 15) (5, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 16) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 18) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 18) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 16) (15, 10) (15, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (19, 1) (19, 10) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 13) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 15) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the nodes by their degree of connections in ascending order.

Nodes with their degrees of connection:
0: 3
1: 5
2: 3
3: 3
4: 2
5: 2
6: 3
7: 3
8: 3
9: 3
10: 3
11: 3
12: 4
13: 4
14: 5
15: 3
16: 2
17: 4
18: 3
19: 2

Now, based on the sorted order of nodes by their degrees, the edges that we consider are:
(4, 16), (5, 13), (5, 13), (12, 15), (12, 15), (16, 4), (19, 10)

Calculating the triangles, we find that there are:
[10] triangles in total.

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 16, 0>, <5, 13, 14>, <12, 15, 1>, <4, 16, 15>, <4, 16, 0>, <4, 16, 2>, <5, 13, 18>, <5, 13, 14>, <12, 15, 10>, <19, 10, 1>
