Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes can be relabeled based on their degree as follows:
Node 0: Degree 7
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 6
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections in order to count triangles.

Counting the triangles:
- For edge (0, 3): They share node 2 forming a triangle <0, 2, 3>.
- For edge (0, 4): They share nodes 6 and 1 forming triangles <0, 6, 4> and <0, 1, 4>.
- For edge (0, 6): They share nodes 4, 2, and 1 forming a triangle <0, 4, 6>.
- For edge (0, 2): They share nodes 1 and 3 forming a triangle <0, 1, 2>.
- For edge (0, 1): They share nodes 4 and 2 forming a triangle <0, 4, 1>.
- For edge (1, 2): They share node 0 forming a triangle <1, 0, 2>.
- For edge (1, 7): They share nodes 5 and 8 forming a triangle <1, 5, 7>.
- For edge (2, 3): They share node 0 forming a triangle <2, 0, 3>.
- For edge (4, 6): They share node 0 forming a triangle <4, 0, 6>.

Total number of triangles: [9]
