Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 9) (16, 18) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 6) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 0) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 13) (17, 3) (17, 14) (17, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 5) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 13) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 13) (9, 11) (9, 0) (18, 16) (18, 1) (18, 8) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 18) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 2) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 19) (1, 18) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's determine the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort the vertices by the number of connections (degree):
   Nodes in ascending order of degree: 11, 16, 4, 7, 9, 18, 6, 12, 1, 13, 19, 0, 5, 2, 8, 17, 3, 15, 10, 14.

2. Relabel the nodes based on their order:
   New labels: 
   11 -> 0, 16 -> 1, 4 -> 2, 7 -> 3, 9 -> 4, 18 -> 5, 6 -> 6, 12 -> 7, 1 -> 8, 13 -> 9, 19 -> 10, 0 -> 11, 5 -> 12, 2 -> 13, 8 -> 14, 17 -> 15, 3 -> 16, 15 -> 17, 10 -> 18, 14 -> 19

3. Determine the triangles by checking for shared connections between the lower labeled node in each edge:
   Triangles found: <3, 6, 5>, <3, 6, 0>, <3, 6, 2>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 1>, <5, 12, 2>, <5, 12, 7>, <5, 12, 6>, <1, 13, 2>, <1, 13, 7>, <1, 13, 19>

4. Count the total number of triangles and output the result:
   Total number of triangles: [11]
