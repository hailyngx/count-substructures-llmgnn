Response:
The graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29
Edges: (9, 26), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 23), (9, 19), (26, 3), (26, 0), (3, 24), (3, 18), (3, 4), (15, 1), (15, 6), (15, 29), (15, 21), (6, 21), (10, 17), (10, 28), (10, 14), (17, 13), (17, 5), (21, 10), (1, 16), (1, 28), (16, 22), (16, 27), (28, 25), (13, 23), (8, 20), (19, 11), (25, 0), (11, 7), (14, 20), (23, 18), (7, 18), (24, 8), (12, 29), (20, 2), (4, 29), (27, 16), (5, 22)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes degrees: 
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 12: 1 connection
Node 13: 2 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 16: 4 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 20: 3 connections
Node 21: 4 connections
Node 22: 3 connections
Node 23: 3 connections
Node 24: 2 connections
Node 25: 3 connections
Node 26: 2 connections
Node 27: 1 connection
Node 28: 4 connections
Node 29: 3 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

Triangles: 
Total number of triangles: [39]
Unique triangles: <1, 15, 21>, <1, 16, 28>, <1, 28, 10>, <2, 17, 10>, <2, 21, 10>, <3, 4, 29>, <3, 18, 23>, <4, 19, 29>, <5, 17, 10>, <7, 11, 19>, <7, 18, 23>, <9, 6, 21>, <9, 19, 11>, <10, 14, 20>, <10, 17, 13>, <11, 14, 20>, <11, 19, 4>, <12, 29, 15>, <13, 17, 5>, <13, 23, 18>, <15, 21, 6>, <16, 1, 15>, <16, 1, 28>, <16, 22, 25>, <16, 27, 2>, <17, 2, 20>, <18, 23, 13>, <20, 8, 19>, <22, 11, 14>, <22, 16, 27>, <23, 9, 19>, <24, 3, 18>, <25, 0, 26>, <25, 28, 16>, <26, 0, 25>, <26, 3, 24>, <28, 10, 14>, <29, 4, 3>
