Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 17) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 12) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 5) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 12) (5, 18) (5, 2) (5, 8) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 9) (13, 7) (13, 15) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 19) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 16) (16, 1) (16, 2) (16, 12) (16, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 15) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 9) (9, 19) (9, 15) (14, 10) (14, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method includes the following steps:
1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most.
2. Relabel the vertices accordingly based on the sorting.
3. For each edge, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
4. Check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge; these shared connections form triangles.

After applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given graph, the vertices are sorted as follows:
Vertices: 4, 7, 3, 10, 18, 2, 8, 5, 19, 13, 1, 11, 6, 12, 16, 15, 9, 14

The total number of triangles is [3].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 10, 11>
<2, 6, 8>
<9, 15, 19>
