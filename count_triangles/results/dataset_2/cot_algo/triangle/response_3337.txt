Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 0) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 10) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 14) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on the number of connections is as follows:  
Vertex 11: degree 2  
Vertex 6: degree 3  
Vertex 0: degree 4  
Vertex 8: degree 4  
Vertex 9: degree 4  
Vertex 3: degree 5  
Vertex 12: degree 5  
Vertex 2: degree 6  
Vertex 13: degree 6  
Vertex 1: degree 7  
Vertex 5: degree 7  
Vertex 4: degree 8  
Vertex 10: degree 8  
Vertex 7: degree 10  
Vertex 14: degree 10  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through the edges while ensuring that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles found in the graph is [18].  

The unique triangles found are as follows:
<0, 4, 12>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 12>
<0, 5, 10>
<0, 11, 12>
<1, 5, 13>
<2, 9, 14>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 10>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 10>
<4, 7, 12>
<5, 7, 10>
<5, 10, 13>
<7, 10, 14>
