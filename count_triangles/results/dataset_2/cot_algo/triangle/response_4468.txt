Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 0), (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 7), (6, 3), (6, 8), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 0), (3, 8), (8, 7)

Degree-Based Ordering: 
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 5: 5 connections

Triangles:
[6]

Explanation:
- Based on the degree-based ordering, the nodes are relabeled in increasing order of their connections.
- By observing the edges and the relabeled nodes, we find that there is only one triangle in the graph, which includes nodes 6, 8, and 3.
- The total number of triangles in the graph is 1, as indicated by [1].
