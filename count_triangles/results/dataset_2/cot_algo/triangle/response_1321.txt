Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 3), (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 8), (2, 5), (2, 1), (2, 7), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 0), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 4), (7, 2), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 9), (7, 1), (9, 7), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 1), (1, 5), (1, 2), (1, 7), (1, 9), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 0), (3, 7), (3, 9), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 9), (4, 3)

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles and find unique triangles.

After sorting the nodes by their degrees in ascending order, we can relabel the nodes to get: 8, 6, 2, 0, 7, 1, 9, 5, 4, 3

Now we will count the number of triangles and list the unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 7, 3>
<0, 7, 1>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 5, 2>
<1, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 0>
