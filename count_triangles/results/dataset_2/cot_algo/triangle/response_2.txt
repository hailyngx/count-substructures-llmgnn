Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves the following steps:

Step 1: Sort vertices by their number of connections from least to most.
Step 2: Relabel the vertices accordingly.
Step 3: For each edge, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
Step 4: Check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge; these shared connections form triangles.

After applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will now calculate the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found.

The sorted vertices with their degrees are:
(2:0), (9:2), (1:2), (0:4), (12:4), (8:4), (4:4), (5:4), (13:4), (10:5), (14:5), (7:6), (6:6), (11:6), (3:7)

The total number of triangles is [10] in this graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 10>
<1, 7, 12>
<1, 7, 14>
<3, 5, 13>
<3, 7, 10>
<3, 7, 11>
<7, 9, 10>
<7, 9, 11>
<1, 4, 7>
