Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 3) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 9) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 13) (4, 13) (4, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order. Then, we will relabel the vertices accordingly.

Here is the sorted list of vertices with their connections:

- Vertex 0: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 8: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 4 connections
- Vertex 13: 3 connections
- Vertex 12: 6 connections
- Vertex 2: 4 connections
- Vertex 3: 4 connections
- Vertex 9: 6 connections
- Vertex 14: 4 connections
- Vertex 1: 6 connections
- Vertex 11: 4 connections
- Vertex 10: 4 connections

Since we have 15 nodes, we will relabel the vertices as follows:
- Vertex 0 -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 5 -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 7 -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 8 -> Vertex 3
- Vertex 4 -> Vertex 4
- Vertex 6 -> Vertex 5
- Vertex 13 -> Vertex 6
- Vertex 12 -> Vertex 7
- Vertex 2 -> Vertex 8
- Vertex 3 -> Vertex 9
- Vertex 9 -> Vertex 10
- Vertex 14 -> Vertex 11
- Vertex 1 -> Vertex 12
- Vertex 11 -> Vertex 13
- Vertex 10 -> Vertex 14

Now, let's count the triangles by examining the edges and shared connections between the vertices:

- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 1, 12>
- <0, 2, 12>
- <0, 9, 12>
- <1, 7, 12>
- <1, 12, 13>
- <2, 9, 12>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <3, 9, 14>
- <4, 13, 14>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <5, 6, 11>
- <6, 10, 11>
- <9, 12, 14>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
