Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 14) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (10, 8) (10, 2) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 15) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 18) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 15) (1, 14) (15, 17) (15, 1) (5, 7) (5, 18) (5, 14) (19, 16) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 19) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 0) (3, 19) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 5) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 13) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows these steps:
1. Count the degree of each node.
2. Sort the nodes based on their degree in ascending order.
3. Relabel the nodes based on the sorted order.
4. For each edge, consider only the case where the lower labeled node has fewer connections.
5. Look for shared connections between the two nodes of each edge to find triangles.

Based on the provided graph and the given edges, we have calculated the degrees of each node:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 1
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 2
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 2
Node 16: degree 5
Node 17: degree 3
Node 18: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4

After relabeling the nodes from 0 to 19 based on their degrees in ascending order, the new labels become:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 1
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 2
Node 16: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 18: degree 3
Node 19: degree 4

Now, we will consider each edge one by one, starting from the edge between the lowest labeled node and proceed if it has fewer connections:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 14>
3. <0, 7, 5>
4. <0, 7, 8>
5. <0, 13, 4>
6. <1, 14, 5>
7. <1, 15, 17>
8. <2, 9, 1>
9. <2, 9, 14>
10. <2, 9, 10>
11. <2, 0, 7>
12. <2, 0, 13>
13. <3, 19, 12>
14. <4, 16, 11>
15. <5, 7, 8>
16. <5, 7, 18>
17. <5, 14, 1>
18. <6, 9, 1>
19. <6, 9, 12>
20. <6, 18, 8>
21. <7, 0, 13>
22. <7, 5, 18>
23. <8, 4, 13>
24. <8, 4, 16>
25. <8, 7, 5>
26. <9, 2, 0>
27. <9, 2, 10>
28. <9, 2, 1>
29. <9, 6, 12>
30. <10, 9, 2>
31. <10, 8, 4>
32. <11, 16, 14>
33. <12, 6, 9>
34. <12, 6, 18>
35. <12, 17, 15>
36. <13, 18, 8>
37. <13, 0, 7>
38. <13, 4, 16>
39. <14, 16, 11>
40. <14, 16, 4>
41. <14, 5, 18>
42. <14, 1, 15>
43. <15, 17, 11>
44. <16, 4, 8>
45. <17, 11, 16>
46. <18, 5, 14>
47. <18, 6, 12>
48. <18, 6, 9>
49. <19, 16, 4>
50. <19, 16, 14>
51. <19, 3, 12>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [51]
