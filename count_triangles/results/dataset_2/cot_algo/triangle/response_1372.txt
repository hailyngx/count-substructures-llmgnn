Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 6) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 13) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most. Below is the list of vertices sorted by their degrees:

Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 10: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 5 connections
Vertex 14: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 13: 5 connections
Vertex 12: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 6 connections
Vertex 11: 6 connections
Vertex 1: 6 connections
Vertex 9: 7 connections
Vertex 2: 7 connections
Vertex 5: 7 connections

Now, let's count the triangles:
