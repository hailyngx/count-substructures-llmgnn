Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 16) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 10) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 5) (17, 2) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 19) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 11) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 15) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 8) (19, 12) (11, 14) (11, 13) (12, 19) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 17) (5, 17) (5, 15) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 5) (10, 9) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method organizes the nodes by degree as follows: 

Node 3 has degree 1
Node 10 has degree 1
Node 12 has degree 1
Node 5 has degree 2
Node 11 has degree 2
Node 9 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 3
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 16 has degree 3
Node 19 has degree 5
Node 0 has degree 4
Node 15 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 5
Node 18 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 13 has degree 4
Node 17 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 14 has degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and the given edges, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7], and the unique triangles found are:

<1, 8, 15>
<1, 15, 0>
<1, 15, 8>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 17, 14>
<8, 1, 4>
<8, 1, 6>
