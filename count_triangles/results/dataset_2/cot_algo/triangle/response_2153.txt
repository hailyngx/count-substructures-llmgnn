Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted vertices are: 5, 8, 2, 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 1.

Now, we will count the number of triangles:

- For the edge (5, 9), both 5 and 9 have 5 connections. As 5 < 9, and there are shared connections 1 and 7, there is a triangle <5, 9, 1>.
- For the edge (5, 1), 5 has 5 connections while 1 has 4 connections. As 1 < 5, and there are shared connections 3 and 7, there is a triangle <1, 5, 3>.
- For the rest of the edges, the conditions of the Degree-Based Ordering method are not met, so no additional triangles are formed using these edges.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
