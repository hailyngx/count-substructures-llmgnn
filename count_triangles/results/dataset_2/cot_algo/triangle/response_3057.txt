Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (1, 6), (3, 0), (4, 0)
- 1: (0, 1), (4, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1)
- 2: (3, 2), (5, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2)
- 3: (0, 3), (2, 3), (4, 3), (6, 3), (8, 3)
- 4: (1, 4), (3, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)
- 5: (2, 5), (4, 5), (7, 5)
- 6: (0, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6)
- 7: (1, 7), (2, 7), (5, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7)
- 8: (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (7, 8), (9, 8)
- 9: (1, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9)

After relabeling the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order, we get:
Nodes: 5, 0, 6, 4, 2, 1, 7, 3, 8, 9

Now, we can see that the vertex with lower label has fewer connections for the following edges:
(2, 5), (2, 4), (5, 7), (2, 1), (2, 8), (6, 4), (0, 3), (0, 1), (6, 3), (4, 3), (7, 5), (7, 1), (7, 3), (3, 4), (9, 7)

Counting the triangles formed by the shared connections:
Triangles:  <4, 6, 2>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 3>, <3, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 3>, <4, 7, 3>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
