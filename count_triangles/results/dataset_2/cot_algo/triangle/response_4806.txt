Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (4, 7), (4, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (7, 9), (7, 5), (1, 6), (3, 0), (3, 8), (6, 5), (9, 0), (5, 2), (8, 2)

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Count of connections for each node:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 5 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

2. Sort nodes by number of connections (in ascending order): 1, 6, 7, 8, 0, 3, 5, 9, 2, 4

3. Relabel the nodes accordingly:
- Node 1 with 1 connection becomes Node 0
- Node 6 with 2 connections becomes Node 1
- Node 7 with 2 connections becomes Node 2
- Node 8 with 3 connections becomes Node 3
- Node 0 with 3 connections becomes Node 4
- Node 3 with 3 connections becomes Node 5
- Node 5 with 3 connections becomes Node 6
- Node 9 with 4 connections becomes Node 7
- Node 2 with 4 connections becomes Node 8
- Node 4 with 5 connections becomes Node 9

4. Proceed with edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:
- (1, 6): Check shared connections - None
- (1, 7): Check shared connections - None
- (6, 5): Check shared connections - None
- (7, 9): Check shared connections - None
- (7, 2): Check shared connections - None
- (8, 2): Check shared connections - None

5. Count the total number of triangles: 
Since there are no shared connections in the edges that were considered, the total number of triangles is 0.

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [0].
