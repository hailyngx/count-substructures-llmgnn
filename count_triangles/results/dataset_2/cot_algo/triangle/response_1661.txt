Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 11) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 15) (13, 5) (13, 11) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 4) (7, 17) (7, 18) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 15) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 15) (9, 1) (9, 18) (18, 7) (18, 9) (6, 11) (6, 19) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 16) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 16) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 4) (15, 12) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 19) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 0, 2, 4, 5, 10, 12, 17, 18: 4 connections
Node 1, 7, 8, 13, 15, 16, 19: 5 connections
Node 6, 9, 11, 14: 3 connections

Now, we will go through each edge starting from the one with the vertex with the lower label: 

Triangles found: 
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 12>
<0, 3, 15>
<2, 10, 17>
<2, 11, 16>
<4, 12, 15>
<7, 17, 18>
<8, 11, 16>
<8, 11, 13>
<11, 13, 6>
<11, 13, 8>
<11, 13, 15>
<11, 14, 16>
<14, 16, 19>

The total number of triangles is [14].
