Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Edges:
- 0: [1, 5, 7, 9]
- 1: [0, 8]
- 2: [3, 4, 5, 7, 8]
- 3: [2, 6, 8]
- 4: [2, 6, 8, 9, 5]
- 5: [0, 2, 4, 6]
- 6: [3, 4, 5, 8]
- 7: [0, 2, 8, 9]
- 8: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]
- 9: [0, 4, 7]

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph: []
