Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 10) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 12) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 14) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 1) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 4) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 4) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 14) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: [(6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 10), (6, 2), (6, 11), (6, 0), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 7), (5, 13), (5, 12), (5, 7), (2, 0), 
        (8, 10), (8, 3), (0, 12), (3, 11), (3, 14), (11, 1), (13, 14), (10, 14), (12, 1), (1, 4)]

Now, we will assign labels to the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:

Nodes with their degrees:
{0: 4, 1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 4, 6: 6, 7: 2, 8: 2, 9: 4, 10: 3, 11: 4, 12: 3, 13: 3, 14: 4}

Labeling based on degree:
{2: 0, 7: 1, 8: 2, 13: 3, 10: 4, 1: 5, 12: 6, 3: 7, 5: 8, 9: 9, 11: 10, 0: 11, 4: 12, 6: 13, 14: 14}

Now, we will check the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections to count the triangles. 

The total number of triangles is: [8]

The unique triangles found:
<5, 6, 11>
<0, 6, 11>
<4, 6, 11>
<5, 4, 13>
<6, 4, 11>
<1, 4, 11>
<10, 6, 11>
<5, 13, 14>
