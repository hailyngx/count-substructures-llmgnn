Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 4, 5, 9, 8, 2, 0, 5, 6, 1, 7.

Now, let's count the triangles by checking the shared connections between the two vertices of each edge:

Triangles: [  <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 0, 8>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 0, 2>, <2, 3, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, <3, 5, 6>, <0, 2, 8> ]

Total number of triangles: [10]
