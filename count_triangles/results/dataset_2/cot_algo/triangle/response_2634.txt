Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 16) (13, 7) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 15) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 17) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 15) (1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 2) (17, 6) (17, 1) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 1) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 15) (14, 4) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 9) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 11) (9, 10) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 20
Edges: 60
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 11), (1, 16), (1, 17), (2, 10), (2, 15), (2, 18), (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 0), (4, 14), (4, 18), (4, 19), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 10), (5, 18), (6, 5), (6, 17), (7, 10), (7, 12), (7, 13), (7, 19), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 16), (9, 10), (10, 2), (10, 5), (10, 7), (11, 0), (11, 15), (11, 19), (11, 14), (12, 7), (12, 15), (13, 16), (13, 7), (14, 11), (14, 4), (15, 11), (15, 12), (15, 2), (15, 18), (16, 1), (16, 8), (16, 13), (17, 1), (17, 2), (17, 6), (18, 2), (18, 4), (18, 5), (18, 15), (19, 4), (19, 7), (19, 11)

After sorting the nodes by their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes: 20
Sorted Nodes: (9), (13, 14, 19, 0, 6, 11, 1), (3, 7, 16, 12, 4), (5), (2, 10, 15, 18, 17, 8)

Now, counting the triangles:
Triangles: [39]
Unique Triangles: <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 11>, <0, 8, 16>, <1, 16, 8>, <1, 17, 2>, <2, 10, 5>, <2, 10, 15>, <2, 10, 17>, <2, 15, 18>, <3, 5, 10>, <3, 5, 18>, <3, 5, 0>, <4, 14, 11>, <4, 14, 19>, <4, 18, 15>, <5, 6, 17>, <5, 6, 18>, <5, 10, 7>, <5, 10, 2>, <7, 12, 15>, <7, 12, 19>, <7, 13, 16>, <7, 19, 11>, <8, 0, 3>, <8, 0, 11>, <8, 0, 16>, <10, 2, 15>, <10, 2, 17>, <10, 5, 3>, <11, 0, 3>, <11, 0, 8>, <11, 14, 4>, <12, 7, 13>, <12, 7, 19>, <15, 2, 10>, <15, 2, 18>, <15, 11, 4>, <15, 11, 19>
