Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 17) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (2, 18) (2, 0) (2, 15) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 8) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 12) (17, 4) (17, 19) (17, 8) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 19) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 13) (10, 15) (10, 8) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 10) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 17) (8, 10) (19, 17) (19, 3) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 6) (14, 5) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 14) (6, 18) (6, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering of nodes based on their connections is as follows:

Node 5: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 18: Degree 5
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 17: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 19: Degree 2
Node 16: Degree 3
Node 15: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 14: Degree 2
Node 12: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we can count the triangles:

1. Nodes 2, 18, and 15 form a triangle <2, 18, 15>.
2. Nodes 2, 18, and 8 form a triangle <2, 18, 8>.
3. Nodes 2, 18, and 0 form a triangle <2, 18, 0>.
4. Nodes 2, 18, and 5 form a triangle <2, 18, 5>.
5. Nodes 13, 11, and 3 form a triangle <13, 11, 3>.
6. Nodes 13, 11, and 0 form a triangle <13, 11, 0>.
7. Nodes 13, 11, and 9 form a triangle <13, 11, 9>.
8. Nodes 13, 14, and 5 form a triangle <13, 14, 5>.
9. Nodes 13, 16, and 6 form a triangle <13, 16, 6>.
10. Nodes 18, 8, and 5 form a triangle <18, 8, 5>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
