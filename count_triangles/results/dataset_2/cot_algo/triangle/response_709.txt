Response:
The given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges is as follows:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

(9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 24) 
(26, 14) (26, 10) (26, 12)
(3, 18)
(15, 1) (15, 17) (15, 21)
(5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 28)

Now, let's find the triangles using the degree-based ordering method by sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Node degrees:
0: 5, 1: 3, 2: 4, 3: 1, 4: 3, 5: 4, 6: 3, 7: 2, 8: 3, 9: 3, 10: 4, 11: 3, 12: 2, 13: 4, 14: 2, 15: 3, 16: 3, 17: 3, 18: 3, 19: 3, 20: 3, 21: 2, 22: 5, 23: 2, 24: 3, 25: 3, 26: 4, 27: 3, 28: 3, 29: 2

According to the degree-based ordering method, we'll process the edges such that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Starting with the edges, we find the triangles. 

Total number of triangles []: 34
