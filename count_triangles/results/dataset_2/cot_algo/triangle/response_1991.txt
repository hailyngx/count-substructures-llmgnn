Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 11) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 10) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 9) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are as follows:
0 (degree 5), 14 (degree 2), 5 (degree 3), 11 (degree 4), 6 (degree 4), 2 (degree 4), 7 (degree 4), 4 (degree 3), 12 (degree 3), 13 (degree 4), 10 (degree 4), 8 (degree 5), 3 (degree 5), 9 (degree 4), 1 (degree 5).

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles as follows: 
Triangles: [32]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 9, 10>, <3, 9, 10>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 8, 12>, <4, 8, 13>, <4, 12, 13>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 12>, <6, 8, 13>, <7, 9, 10>, <8, 12, 13>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <10, 12, 13>, <10, 13, 14>, <11, 12, 14>, <2, 11, 14>.
