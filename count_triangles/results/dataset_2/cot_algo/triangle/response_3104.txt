Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 6) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 3) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 6) (2, 14) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 19) (10, 14) (10, 15) (15, 4) (15, 10) (0, 18) (0, 5) (16, 8) (16, 12) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 11) (19, 13) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 11) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 19) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 9) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 8) (3, 12) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 2) (9, 2) (9, 12) (5, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted list of vertices from least connected to most connected is as follows:
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 18: 2 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 16: 2 connections
Node 17: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 11: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph as follows:
First, we will consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
The unique triangles found are as follows:
<2, 6, 13>
<2, 6, 14>
<2, 9, 12>
<3, 8, 13>
<3, 12, 16>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 13>
<8, 13, 16>
<11, 14, 17>
<11, 14, 3>
<11, 14, 2>
<11, 14, 10>
<11, 18, 19>
<12, 16, 8>
<19, 1, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
