Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 5) (12, 11) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 14) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: {(5, 9), (5, 12), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 10), (9, 8), (9, 11), (9, 7), (10, 6), (10, 7), (10, 13), (11, 6), (11, 12), (2, 1), (2, 14), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 1), (3, 0), (12, 11), (1, 14), (8, 6), (1, 13), (1, 7), (8, 9), (4, 9), (12, 5), (6, 1), (6, 14), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 2), (7, 8), (0, 3), (14, 13), (13, 10), (13, 1), (8, 7), (11, 10)}

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method by sorting nodes by their degree:
Nodes: {14, 0, 2, 12, 13, 8, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 1, 7, 9, 10}

Now, by examining the edges and shared connections between nodes with lower labels and higher labels:
Triangles: [<0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 5, 10>, <0, 5, 12>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 14>, <1, 7, 10>, <1, 7, 13>, <1, 7, 14>, <1, 13, 14>, <2, 7, 10>, <6, 8, 11>, <12, 5, 9>]

Total number of triangles: [13]
