Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 10) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 0) (7, 14) (10, 16) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (18, 8) (18, 10) (18, 19) (19, 18) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 1) (3, 2) (3, 17) (3, 12) (17, 15) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 17) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 5) (12, 8) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 17) (13, 11) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degree is as follows:
Nodes: 16, 18, 0, 14, 7, 10, 15, 3, 4, 1, 8, 12, 6, 17, 5, 2, 11, 9, 19, 13

Now, let's count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 8]
<0, 7, 14>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 5, 15>
<2, 3, 17>
<2, 5, 17>
<2, 3, 12>
<2, 5, 12>
<3, 12, 17>
