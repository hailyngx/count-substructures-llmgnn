Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 21) (26, 9) (26, 6) (26, 8) (26, 17) (13, 25) (13, 23) (22, 19) (22, 28) (22, 0) (6, 26) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 12) (8, 26) (8, 2) (28, 22) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 14) (28, 18) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 5) (29, 11) (4, 24) (18, 28) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 21) (15, 18) (15, 20) (15, 7) (20, 15) (20, 10) (20, 16) (2, 8) (2, 1) (11, 28) (11, 29) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 21) (1, 2) (1, 0) (17, 26) (17, 6) (17, 21) (0, 22) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 23) (7, 15) (7, 0) (23, 13) (23, 11) (23, 0) (23, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (19, 22) (19, 29) (5, 29) (5, 18) (5, 23) (16, 20) (16, 24) (24, 4) (24, 16) (24, 10) (3, 14) (3, 27) (14, 6) (14, 28) (14, 3) (21, 9) (21, 18) (21, 11) (21, 17) (25, 13) (25, 10) (10, 20) (10, 12) (10, 24) (10, 25) (10, 27) (27, 3) (27, 10) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degree (number of connections) is as follows:
[19, 4, 8, 12, 2, 16, 9, 13, 20, 25, 6, 1, 3, 26, 7, 14, 17, 18, 21, 24, 10, 0, 28, 11, 5, 23, 29, 15, 22, 27]

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

After examining the given edges, we find the following triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 5]
<0, 1, 11>
<0, 1, 22>
<0, 7, 15>
<21, 11, 18>
<21, 11, 23> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles within the given graph is [5].
