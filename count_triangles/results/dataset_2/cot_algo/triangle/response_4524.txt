Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 17) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 3) (19, 5) (19, 7) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 17) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 15) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 1) (16, 8) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 10) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 11) (18, 14) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 3) (7, 15) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 12) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph:   

Nodes by their degree: 
Node 0: degree 4   
Node 1: degree 4    
Node 2: degree 3     
Node 3: degree 4     
Node 4: degree 3     
Node 5: degree 4      
Node 6: degree 2     
Node 7: degree 3     
Node 8: degree 5     
Node 9: degree 4     
Node 10: degree 2    
Node 11: degree 5    
Node 12: degree 3    
Node 13: degree 2     
Node 14: degree 3    
Node 15: degree 3     
Node 16: degree 1     
Node 17: degree 6    
Node 18: degree 4     
Node 19: degree 3    

Sorted nodes based on degree:
Node 16: degree 1    
Node 13: degree 2    
Node 10: degree 2    
Node 6: degree 2    
Node 14: degree 3    
Node 7: degree 3     
Node 3: degree 4     
Node 4: degree 3    
Node 1: degree 4     
Node 12: degree 3    
Node 19: degree 3     
Node 2: degree 3    
Node 15: degree 3    
Node 0: degree 4    
Node 5: degree 4    
Node 9: degree 4    
Node 11: degree 5     
Node 18: degree 4      
Node 8: degree 5     
Node 17: degree 6    

Triangles (counted in brackets []) in the graph are: [4]    

Unique Triangles:  
<5, 11, 18>  
<3, 7, 15>  
<9, 17, 13>  
<0, 12, 1>
