Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections. The sorted list of nodes is as follows:
```
Node 10: Degree 2
Node 1 : Degree 2
Node 5 : Degree 3
Node 8 : Degree 3
Node 20: Degree 3
Node 21: Degree 3
Node 2 : Degree 3
Node 23: Degree 4
Node 24: Degree 2
Node 26: Degree 2
Node 27: Degree 4
Node 28: Degree 2
Node 4 : Degree 4
Node 6 : Degree 4
Node 9 : Degree 4
Node 7 : Degree 4
Node 0 : Degree 5
Node 3 : Degree 5
Node 12: Degree 3
Node 16: Degree 3
Node 11: Degree 5
Node 29: Degree 3
Node 18: Degree 5
Node 25: Degree 4
Node 19: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 22: Degree 2
Node 17: Degree 2
Node 14: Degree 2
```
