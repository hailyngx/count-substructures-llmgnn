Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
