Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 16) (29, 14) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 20) (13, 15) (13, 10) (20, 13) (20, 5) (20, 10) (25, 6) (25, 12) (25, 18) (12, 25) (12, 17) (12, 23) (27, 14) (28, 26) (28, 0) (28, 9) (1, 4) (17, 12) (17, 4) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 6) (26, 28) (26, 16) (26, 0) (26, 7) (22, 2) (22, 5) (22, 15) (9, 28) (9, 18) (9, 21) (18, 25) (18, 9) (18, 21) (16, 29) (16, 26) (16, 24) (24, 2) (24, 16) (24, 23) (24, 15) (5, 8) (5, 20) (5, 3) (5, 22) (5, 15) (0, 28) (0, 26) (6, 25) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 23) (7, 26) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 23) (4, 1) (4, 17) (21, 9) (21, 18) (10, 13) (10, 20) (10, 3) (10, 7) (14, 29) (14, 27) (14, 15) (23, 12) (23, 24) (23, 6) (23, 7) (15, 13) (15, 22) (15, 24) (15, 5) (15, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method:  

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:  
   - Node 1: Degree 1  
   - Node 4: Degree 2  
   - Node 27: Degree 2  
   - Node 21: Degree 2  
   - Node 9: Degree 3  
   - Node 20: Degree 3  
   - Node 7: Degree 4  
   - Node 17: Degree 4  
   - Node 11: Degree 4  
   - Node 28: Degree 5  
   - Node 25: Degree 5  
   - Node 22: Degree 5  
   - Node 6: Degree 5  
   - Node 18: Degree 5  
   - Node 10: Degree 5  
   - Node 12: Degree 5  
   - Node 26: Degree 5  
   - Node 2: Degree 6  
   - Node 14: Degree 6  
   - Node 24: Degree 6  
   - Node 29: Degree 6  
   - Node 5: Degree 6  
   - Node 15: Degree 6  
   - Node 3: Degree 6  
   - Node 23: Degree 6  
   - Node 8: Degree 6  
   - Node 16: Degree 6  
   - Node 0: Degree 6  
   - Node 13: Degree 6  

2. Now, starting from edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections, we count the triangles by checking shared connections:
   - <2, 29, 16>
   - <2, 29, 14>
   - <2, 22, 5>
   - <29, 16, 26>
   - <29, 14, 27>
   - <8, 13, 20>
   - <8, 13, 15>
   - <13, 20, 5>
   - <25, 12, 17>
   - <12, 17, 4>
   - <26, 28, 0>
   - <26, 28, 9>
   - <3, 8, 5>
   - <3, 13, 10>
   - <11, 3, 6>
   - <22, 5, 15>
   - <9, 28, 0>
   - <9, 28, 26>
   - <18, 25, 6>
   - <18, 9, 21>
   - <16, 26, 24>
   - <24, 2, 15>
   - <5, 8, 20>
   - <5, 3, 15>
   - <0, 26, 28>
   - <6, 25, 23>
   - <7, 26, 23>
   - <7, 6, 10>
   - <4, 1, 17>
   - <21, 18, 9>
   - <10, 13, 7>
   - <14, 29, 15>

After considering all the edges, the total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [30].
