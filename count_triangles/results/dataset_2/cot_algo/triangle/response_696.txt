Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) 

Response:
The graph after sorting the vertices based on their degrees is as follows:

Nodes:
0 (degree 5)
1 (degree 3)
3 (degree 3)
7 (degree 3)
8 (degree 2)
6 (degree 4)
4 (degree 3)
2 (degree 5)
9 (degree 7)
5 (degree 5)

Edges based on the sorted nodes:
(8, 3), (8, 9), (6, 7), (6, 2), (4, 0), (4, 9), (4, 5), (7, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 9), (2, 6), (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 3), (9, 7), (9, 1), (9, 2), (5, 6), (5, 4)

Number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 1, 2>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
