Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The vertices and their connections based on the given edges are as follows:
0: 9, 6, 2
1: 3, 7
2: 9, 4, 8, 7, 0
3: 1, 7, 4
4: 5, 9, 3, 2, 6
5: 9, 6, 4
6: 5, 4, 8, 7, 0
7: 9, 1, 3, 6, 2
8: 9, 2, 6
9: 5, 8, 4, 2, 7, 0

Considering the degree-based ordering method, we relabel the vertices according to their degrees:
0: 3
1: 2
8: 2
3: 3
5: 3
2: 5
6: 5
7: 5
9: 6
4: 5

Now, we go through the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
<0, 2, 9> (common neighbor: 9)
<0, 6, 9> (common neighbor: 6)
<2, 6, 9> (common neighbor: 9)
<2, 6, 7> (common neighbor: 6)
<2, 7, 9> (common neighbor: 9)
<6, 7, 9> (common neighbor: 7)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
