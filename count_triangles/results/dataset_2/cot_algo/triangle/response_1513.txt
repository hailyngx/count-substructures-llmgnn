The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 10) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 13) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 13) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes with their corresponding connections (edges):

Node 0: 6, 7, 3
Node 1: 4, 5, 6, 8, 3
Node 2: 9, 8, 10
Node 3: 7, 1, 0, 14, 13
Node 4: 5, 9, 7
Node 5: 9, 1, 4, 14
Node 6: 1, 10, 0
Node 7: 4, 12, 0, 3, 14
Node 8: 2, 1, 10, 11, 12
Node 9: 5, 4, 2, 11, 14
Node 10: 6, 2, 8, 12
Node 11: 9, 8, 12, 13
Node 12: 7, 8, 10, 11
Node 13: 3, 14, 11
Node 14: 5, 9, 7, 3, 13

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, nodes are labeled from least to most connected as follows:
Node 0: 0
Node 6: 1
Node 2: 2
Node 13: 3
Node 1: 4
Node 5: 5
Node 4: 6
Node 12: 7
Node 8: 8
Node 11: 9
Node 9: 10
Node 10: 11
Node 7: 12
Node 3: 13
Node 14: 14

Following the method:
- Triangles involving node 0: <0, 3, 7>
- Triangles involving node 1: <1, 4, 5>
- Triangles involving node 2: None
- Triangles involving node 3: None
- Triangles involving node 4: None
- Triangles involving node 5: None
- Triangles involving node 6: None
- Triangles involving node 7: None
- Triangles involving node 8: None
- Triangles involving node 9: None
- Triangles involving node 10: None
- Triangles involving node 11: None
- Triangles involving node 12: None
- Triangles involving node 13: <0, 3, 13>
- Triangles involving node 14: <3, 13, 14>

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 5>, <3, 13, 14>
