Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 14) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 7) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: [(5, 9), (5, 12), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 14), (9, 0), (6, 9), (6, 3), (6, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7), (3, 6), (3, 11), (3, 7), (3, 2), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 2), (11, 3), (11, 10), (11, 7), (11, 13), (11, 4), (4, 1), (4, 11), (4, 8), (4, 0), (8, 4), (8, 14), (8, 0), (8, 12), (13, 11), (13, 2), (13, 14), (13, 7), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 12), (2, 6), (2, 3), (2, 10), (2, 13), (2, 12), (12, 5), (12, 10), (12, 8), (12, 0), (12, 2), (12, 14), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 11), (7, 13), (7, 14), (14, 9), (14, 8), (14, 13), (14, 12), (14, 7)]

Degree-Based Ordering (sorted vertices by their degree):
Nodes: {1, 5, 6, 10, 4, 8, 13, 0, 12, 7, 2, 3, 11, 9, 14}

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we can count the number of triangles:
Triangles: 5

[Total number of triangles: 5]

<1, 3, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 7, 11>
<4, 7, 14>
<7, 11, 13>
