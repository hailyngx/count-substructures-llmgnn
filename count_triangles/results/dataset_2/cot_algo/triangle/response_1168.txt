Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted list would be:  

Node 4: degree 4  
Node 5: degree 4  
Node 8: degree 4  
Node 1: degree 5  
Node 2: degree 5  
Node 7: degree 5  
Node 3: degree 5  
Node 9: degree 5  
Node 0: degree 6  
Node 6: degree 6  

Next, let's identify triangles by looking at shared connections between the lower labeled vertices of each edge. The total number of triangles in this graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:  
<1, 4, 8>  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 2, 6>  
<0, 2, 7>  
<0, 3, 7>  
<0, 4, 8>
