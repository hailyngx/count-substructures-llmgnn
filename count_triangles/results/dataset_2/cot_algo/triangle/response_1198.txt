Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Degree-Based Ordering: (number of connections)
Nodes sorted by connections: 6(1), 9(3), 7(3), 5(4), 2(4), 0(5), 8(5), 1(5), 3(6), 4(6)

Edges: 
(6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 3) 
(1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) 
(3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) 
(4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) 
(8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) 
(0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
(2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 1) 
(5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2)

Triangles:
Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 4>, <4, 8, 5>, <5, 7, 8>
