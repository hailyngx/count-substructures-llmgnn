Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 12) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering would be as follows:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 14: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 12: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 13: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 11: degree 5
Node 9: degree 6

Now, let's count the triangles:
Triangles: [185]
Unique triangles: <3, 5, 11>, <4, 10, 11>, <2, 4, 11>, <6, 9, 13>, <5, 9, 11>, <8, 9, 13>, <1, 8, 10>, <5, 7, 13>, <2, 7, 8>, <1, 6, 10>, <2, 7, 11>, <7, 8, 13>, <1, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 12>, <6, 8, 9>, <1, 14, 13>, <2, 12, 14>, <1, 10, 14>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 10, 12>, <8, 10, 11>, <9, 12, 13>, <3, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 14>, <9, 11, 13>, <4, 12, 14>, <1, 6, 14>
