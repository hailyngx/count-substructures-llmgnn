Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 24) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 17) (24, 7) (24, 4) (24, 18) (24, 14) (24, 2) (20, 21) (25, 1) (25, 6) (25, 4) (22, 4) (22, 27) (23, 2) (23, 27) (23, 16) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 1) (21, 20) (21, 28) (21, 10) (28, 21) (28, 9) (28, 18) (5, 12) (5, 29) (5, 14) (13, 16) (1, 25) (1, 12) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 9) (18, 24) (18, 28) (18, 26) (18, 19) (26, 18) (26, 6) (19, 18) (19, 14) (10, 12) (10, 21) (10, 6) (10, 2) (0, 16) (0, 29) (0, 15) (16, 23) (16, 13) (16, 0) (4, 24) (4, 25) (4, 22) (4, 9) (4, 15) (29, 5) (29, 0) (29, 3) (3, 17) (3, 29) (11, 15) (8, 14) (8, 15) (14, 24) (14, 5) (14, 19) (14, 8) (9, 28) (9, 17) (9, 4) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 4) (15, 11) (15, 8) (27, 22) (27, 23) (27, 2) (6, 25) (6, 26) (6, 10) (2, 24) (2, 23) (2, 10) (2, 27) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order and then relabeling the vertices accordingly. 

Here is the list of vertices sorted by their degree:

Vertex 1: 1 connections
Vertex 13: 1 connections
Vertex 20: 1 connections
Vertex 11: 1 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 19: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 22: 4 connections
Vertex 21: 4 connections
Vertex 27: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 18: 4 connections
Vertex 26: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 10: 4 connections
Vertex 28: 4 connections
Vertex 29: 4 connections
Vertex 12: 4 connections
Vertex 16: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 25: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 17: 5 connections
Vertex 24: 5 connections
Vertex 15: 5 connections
Vertex 14: 5 connections
Vertex 23: 5 connections


Next, we will iterate through the edges considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. We will then count the number of triangles by looking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

After calculating, we find:
Total number of triangles: [36]
