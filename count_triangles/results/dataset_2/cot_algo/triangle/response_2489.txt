Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 1) (3, 13) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 14) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 
- Node 0: (5, 0), (6, 0), (11, 0), (2, 0)
- Node 1: (5, 1), (3, 1), (12, 1), (8, 1)
- Node 2: (6, 2), (7, 2), (13, 2), (0, 2)
- Node 3: (5, 3), (4, 3), (10, 3), (1, 3), (13, 3)
- Node 4: (6, 4), (7, 4), (13, 4), (14, 4), (3, 4)
- Node 5: (8, 5), (1, 5), (0, 5), (3, 5), (7, 5)
- Node 6: (10, 6), (7, 6), (4, 6), (2, 6), (0, 6), (12, 6)
- Node 7: (10, 7), (4, 7), (2, 7), (5, 7)
- Node 8: (5, 8), (1, 8), (13, 8), (14, 8), (12, 8)
- Node 9: (11, 9), (13, 9)
- Node 10: (6, 10), (7, 10), (3, 10)
- Node 11: (9, 11), (0, 11)
- Node 12: (6, 12), (1, 12), (8, 12), (14, 12)
- Node 13: (9, 13), (4, 13), (3, 13), (8, 13), (2, 13)
- Node 14: (4, 14), (8, 14), (12, 14)

Next, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees from least to most:

Nodes by degree: 11, 5, 7, 9, 14, 10, 12, 2, 6, 1, 3, 0, 4, 8, 13

Now, we will count the number of triangles following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [15]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 6, 12>
<1, 3, 13>
<1, 8, 12>
<2, 6, 12>
<3, 4, 13>
<3, 8, 13>
<4, 8, 13>
<5, 7, 10>
<6, 7, 10>
<6, 10, 13>
<7, 10, 13>
<8, 12, 14>
<9, 11, 13>
