Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 0) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (8, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 12) (3, 18) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 14) (15, 0) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 2) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 13) (19, 15) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 18) (18, 3) (18, 5) (13, 14) (16, 6) (16, 3) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(6, 9), (6, 16)
(9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 11), (9, 0)
(10, 17), (10, 4), (10, 2)
(17, 10), (17, 2), (17, 7)
(4, 10), (4, 1)
(8, 1)
(3, 11), (3, 0), (3, 16), (3, 12), (3, 18)
(11, 9), (11, 3), (11, 14), (11, 12)
(0, 9), (0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 15)
(7, 17), (7, 0), (7, 14)
(1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 15), (1, 14)
(15, 0), (15, 1), (15, 19), (15, 5)
(2, 9), (2, 10), (2, 17), (2, 12), (2, 5)
(12, 3), (12, 11), (12, 2)
(14, 11), (14, 7), (14, 1), (14, 13)
(19, 15)
(5, 15), (5, 2), (5, 18)
(18, 3), (18, 5)
(13, 14)
(16, 6), (16, 3)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

Nodes with their degrees:
0: 4
1: 4
2: 5
3: 5
4: 3
5: 4
6: 2
7: 3
8: 1
9: 4
10: 3
11: 4
12: 3
13: 1
14: 4
15: 4
16: 2
17: 3
18: 2
19: 1

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles.

[Total number of triangles: 12]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 15>
<0, 7, 15>
<0, 15, 19>
<1, 4, 15>
<1, 14, 15>
<2, 5, 15>
<2, 12, 15>
<3, 11, 12>
<3, 11, 14>
<3, 13, 14>
<3, 12, 14>
<5, 15, 18>
