Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given information:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: 
  - 0: (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 0), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 2), (3, 8), (3, 7)
  - 1: (8, 1), (6, 1), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 6), (1, 0), (1, 7)
  - 2: (4, 2), (2, 5), (2, 7), (7, 2)
  - 3: (8, 3), (3, 0), (3, 7)
  - 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (2, 4), (0, 4)
  - 5: (5, 6), (5, 2), (0, 5)
  - 6: (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 7), (7, 6)
  - 7: (9, 7), (8, 7), (6, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7), (7, 3)
  - 8: (8, 3), (8, 1), (8, 7)
  - 9: (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 0), (7, 9), (0, 9)

Next, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:
- Node degrees: 
  - 0: degree 4
  - 1: degree 6
  - 2: degree 4
  - 3: degree 3
  - 4: degree 5
  - 5: degree 3
  - 6: degree 5
  - 7: degree 6
  - 8: degree 3
  - 9: degree 5

Vertices in the Degree-Based Ordering (ascending order):
0 -> 3 -> 8 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 9 -> 1 -> 7

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method as described earlier. 
After counting the triangles, please find the total number of triangles inside brackets [] and list the unique triangles found inside <> each only once in the answer.
