Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following connections between nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7.

Now, let's start counting triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Sort vertices by their number of connections from least to most: 
   Nodes with least connections: 3, 5
   Nodes with intermediate connections: 0, 1, 6
   Nodes with most connections: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9

2. Relabel the vertices based on their sorted order: 
   3 → 0, 5 → 1, 0 → 2, 1 → 3, 6 → 4, 2 → 5, 4 → 6, 7 → 7, 8 → 8, 9 → 9

3. Now, check each edge in the order given, and count the triangles: 
   - For (0, 3): Ignore since 0 has more connections than 3.
   - For (5, 9): Ignore since 5 has more connections than 9.
   - For (5, 8): Ignore since 5 has more connections than 8.
   - For (5, 1): (5, 1, 9) form a triangle.
   - For (5, 4): (5, 4, 8) form a triangle.
   - For (9, 5): Ignore since 9 has more connections than 5.
   - For (9, 6): Ignore since 9 has more connections than 6.
   - For (9, 2): (9, 2, 4) form a triangle.
   - For (9, 1): (9, 1, 7) form a triangle.
   - For (4, 5): Ignore since 5 has more connections than 4.
   - For (4, 7): (4, 7, 1) form a triangle.
   - For (4, 8): Ignore since 8 has more connections than 4.
   - For (4, 2): (4, 2, 9) form a triangle.
   - For (4, 0): (4, 0, 3) form a triangle.
   - For (7, 4): Ignore since 4 has more connections than 7.
   - For (7, 6): (7, 6, 9) form a triangle.
   - For (7, 2): (7, 2, 4) form a triangle.
   - For (7, 1): (7, 1, 9) form a triangle.
   - For (1, 5): Ignore since 5 has more connections than 1.
   - For (1, 9): Ignore since 9 has more connections than 1.
   - For (1, 7): (1, 7, 4) form a triangle.
   - For (1, 8): (1, 8, 4) form a triangle.
   - For (3, 0): Ignore since 0 has more connections than 3.
   - For (3, 2): (3, 2, 4) form a triangle.
   - For (6, 9): Ignore since 9 has more connections than 6.
   - For (6, 7): (6, 7, 4) form a triangle.
   - For (6, 8): (6, 8, 4) form a triangle.
   - For (6, 0): Ignore since 6 has more connections than 0.
   - For (8, 5): Ignore since 5 has more connections than 8.
   - For (8, 4): (8, 4, 2) form a triangle.
   - For (8, 1): (8, 1, 7) form a triangle.
   - For (8, 6): (8, 6, 9) form a triangle.
   - For (8, 0): (8, 0, 4) form a triangle.
   - For (0, 4): Ignore since 4 has more connections than 0.
   - For (0, 3): Ignore since 0 has more connections than 3.
   - For (0, 6): Ignore since 6 has more connections than 0.
   - For (0, 8): (0, 8, 1) form a triangle.
   - For (2, 9): Ignore since 9 has more connections than 2.
   - For (2, 4): (2, 4, 7) form a triangle.
   - For (2, 7): (2, 7, 1) form a triangle.
   - For (2, 3): Ignore since 3 has more connections than 2.

Finally, count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found:
Total number of triangles: [16]
Unique triangles: <5, 1, 9>, <5, 4, 8>, <9, 2, 4>, <9, 1, 7>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 2, 9>, <4, 0, 3>, <7, 6, 9>, <7, 2, 4>, <7, 1, 9>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 8, 4>, <3, 2, 4>, <6, 7, 4>, <6, 8, 4>, <8, 0, 4>
