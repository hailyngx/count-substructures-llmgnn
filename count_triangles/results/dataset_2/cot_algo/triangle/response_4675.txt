Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
(5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) 
(9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) 
(4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) 
(7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) 
(1, 3) (1, 6) 
(3, 6) 
(6, 8) 
(2, 7) 
(8, 0)

Next, we list the vertices along with their degrees (number of connections):

Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 5
Vertex 2: degree 4
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 4: degree 3
Vertex 5: degree 4
Vertex 6: degree 5
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 3
Vertex 9: degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
We start with the edge with the vertex having the lower label and fewer connections. 

In this case, vertex 0 has the fewest connections, so we start with the edges connected to it:
(0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 9)

Looking for triangles:
- (0, 4): No triangles
- (0, 8): No triangles
- (0, 9): No triangles

Moving to the next vertex with the next lowest degree, which is vertex 3:
(3, 1), (3, 6)

Looking for triangles:
- (3, 1): No triangles
- (3, 6): No triangles

Next, vertex 2:
(2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 9), (2, 1)

Looking for triangles:
- (2, 5): No triangles
- (2, 7): No triangles
- (2, 9): No triangles
- (2, 1): <1, 2, 3>

After checking all vertices, the total number of triangles is [1].

Unique triangles found are:
<1, 2, 3>
