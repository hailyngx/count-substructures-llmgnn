Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 0), (7, 0), (2, 9), (2, 8), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 1), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 7), (0, 2), (0, 3)
- 1: (6, 9), (6, 1), (4, 6), (4, 1), (7, 1), (1, 6), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 8)
- 2: (9, 6), (9, 2), (7, 8), (2, 0), (3, 9), (3, 6), (2, 8), (0, 2), (3, 4), (3, 8)
- 3: (9, 3), (6, 3), (4, 3), (8, 3), (3, 0)

Next, let's sort the nodes based on the number of connections:
Nodes Degree: 0(8), 1(6), 2(5), 4(4), 7(4), 5(3), 8(5), 6(6), 9(4), 3(5)

Now, we will proceed with counting the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [7] 
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 8>
