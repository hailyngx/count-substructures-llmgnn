Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 17) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 17) (5, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 19) (10, 17) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 17) (14, 15) (14, 12) (14, 16) (18, 6) (18, 11) (18, 12) (19, 9) (19, 11) (1, 6) (1, 13) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 16) (16, 14) (16, 12) (16, 8) (11, 18) (11, 19) (11, 8) (8, 16) (8, 11) (2, 9) (2, 13) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
- Edges: (3, 15), (3, 6), (3, 12), (15, 7), (15, 14), (15, 12), (4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 13), (4, 17), (7, 0), (7, 17), (5, 6), (9, 2), (9, 19), (10, 17), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 18), (0, 17), (14, 16), (18, 11), (19, 11), (1, 13), (12, 16), (16, 8)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes: 0, 5, 10, 2, 1, 18, 19, 8, 11, 16, 9, 5, 10, 2, 1, 18, 19, 8, 11, 16, 9, 3, 13, 14, 15, 4, 12, 6, 7, 17

Counting the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <3, 12, 15>
- Triangle 2: <4, 7, 17>
- Triangle 3: <6, 13, 1>
- Triangle 4: <6, 18, 12>
- Triangle 5: <12, 14, 15>
- Triangle 6: <11, 18, 19>
- Triangle 7: <8, 11, 16>

Total number of triangles: [7]
