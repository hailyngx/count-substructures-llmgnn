Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (1, 6) (1, 11) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 2) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 12) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 10) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves relabelling the vertices based on their number of connections. 
Here are the vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most:
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 10: 5 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

Based on the relabelling, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph:

There are 4 triangles: <0, 4, 14>, <2, 13, 14>, <3, 10, 14>, <4, 9, 10>

The total number of triangles is [4].
