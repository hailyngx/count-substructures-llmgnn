Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (0, 9) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are:  
Node 0 is connected to 2 nodes  
Node 2 is connected to 3 nodes  
Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes  
Node 5 is connected to 4 nodes  
Node 4 is connected to 5 nodes  
Node 7 is connected to 5 nodes  
Node 8 is connected to 5 nodes  
Node 3 is connected to 5 nodes  
Node 9 is connected to 5 nodes  
Node 6 is connected to 4 nodes    

The triangles found in the graph are:  
<0, 5, 9>  
<0, 5, 2>  
<2, 1, 5>  
<2, 1, 8>  
<4, 3, 7>  
<4, 3, 8>  
<4, 3, 5>  
<4, 3, 9>  
<4, 7, 9>  
<4, 7, 8>  
<4, 9, 8>  
<5, 1, 8>  
<5, 3, 7>  
<5, 3, 8>  
<5, 3, 9>  
<5, 6, 7>  
<5, 6, 1>  
<6, 1, 8>  
<9, 8, 7>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [19].
