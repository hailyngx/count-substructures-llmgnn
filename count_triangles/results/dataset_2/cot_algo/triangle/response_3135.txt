Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 18) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 19) (4, 14) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 10) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 15) (1, 13) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 15) (6, 3) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 14) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 18) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 14) 

Response:
The graph with nodes and edges can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(11, 9), (16, 7), (16, 13), (16, 5), (8, 13), (8, 10), (8, 18), (13, 16), (13, 8), (13, 1), (13, 10), (13, 19), (4, 14), (7, 16), (7, 12), (7, 3), (7, 6), (12, 7), (12, 14), (12, 6), (0, 10), (0, 9), (2, 5), (2, 19), (2, 15), (1, 13), (15, 2), (15, 18), (15, 6), (10, 8), (10, 13), (10, 0), (10, 19), (10, 5), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 5), (5, 16), (5, 2), (5, 10), (5, 3), (6, 7), (6, 12), (6, 15), (6, 3), (19, 13), (19, 2), (19, 10), (19, 14), (9, 11), (9, 0), (9, 3), (14, 4), (14, 12), (14, 19), (14, 18), (18, 8), (18, 15), (18, 14)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes in decreasing order of degree: 16, 13, 10, 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18, 19, 7, 15, 3, 2, 0, 9, 11, 1, 4, 17

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles by identifying shared connections between vertices. After counting, the total number of triangles is [33], and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 9>, <0, 6, 15>, <0, 10, 19>, <1, 13, 16>, <2, 5, 19>, <2, 15, 18>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 12>, <4, 12, 14>, <5, 13, 16>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 10, 19>, <6, 12, 14>, <6, 12, 15>, <7, 12, 15>, <8, 13, 16>, <8, 13, 19>, <10, 13, 16>, <10, 13, 19>, <10, 16, 19>, <10, 16, 5>, <13, 16, 19>, <13, 16, 7>, <13, 19, 14>, <14, 15, 18>, <14, 18, 8>, <16, 18, 15>, <16, 18, 14>, <16, 19, 14>, <16, 19, 10>, <16, 19, 13>
