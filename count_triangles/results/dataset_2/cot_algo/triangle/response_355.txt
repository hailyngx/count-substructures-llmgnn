Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 11) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 2) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 2) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 4), 
(9, 5), (9, 3), (9, 12), 
(8, 5), (8, 13), (8, 10), (8, 1), 
(13, 8), (13, 4), (13, 2), (13, 11), (13, 3), (13, 10), 
(6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 14), (6, 10), (6, 11), 
(0, 4), (0, 12), (0, 1), 
(14, 6), (14, 4), 
(7, 3), (7, 1), 
(1, 8), (1, 6), (1, 0), (1, 7), (1, 4), 
(2, 13), (2, 12), (2, 10), (2, 3), (2, 11), 
(12, 9), (12, 0), (12, 2), (12, 11), 
(11, 13), (11, 6), (11, 2), (11, 12), 
(3, 9), (3, 13), (3, 7), (3, 2), 
(10, 8), (10, 13), (10, 6), (10, 2), 
(4, 5), (4, 13), (4, 0), (4, 14), (4, 1)

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degrees from least to most:

Nodes (Degree): {14 (1), 7 (1), 10 (2), 0 (3), 12 (3), 7 (3), 5 (4), 6 (5), 9 (5), 3 (5), 8 (5), 11 (5), 2 (5), 1 (6), 4 (6)}

Now, we will count the triangles formed using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [15]

Unique triangles:
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 9, 13>
<1, 4, 13>
<6, 8, 13>
<6, 10, 13>
<6, 11, 13>
<2, 11, 13>
<0, 2, 12>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 11>
<8, 10, 13>
<2, 10, 13>
<4, 5, 13>
<4, 6, 13>
