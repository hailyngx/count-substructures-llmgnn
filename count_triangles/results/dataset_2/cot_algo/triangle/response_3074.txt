Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 14) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 15) (13, 8) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 0) (7, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 17) (19, 5) (19, 0) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 17) (10, 16) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 18) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 10) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 15) 

Response:
The vertices with their respective connections ranked from least to most are:
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 18: 3 connections
Vertex 19: 2 connections
Vertex 16: 4 connections
Vertex 13: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 12: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 14: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 10: 6 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 17: 4 connections
Vertex 11: 3 connections
Vertex 15: 3 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the order given and only count triangles where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

After counting, the total number of triangles is [24].

Unique triangles found are: 
<1, 3, 12>
<0, 5, 19>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 18>
<0, 14, 16>
<5, 10, 17>
<8, 10, 15>
<10, 16, 17>
<4, 6, 18>
<9, 11, 16>
<6, 12, 1>
<9, 11, 16>
<5, 10, 17>
<10, 16, 17>
<8, 10, 15>
<0, 14, 16>
<5, 10, 17>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 12, 3>
<12, 1, 3>
<10, 16, 17>
