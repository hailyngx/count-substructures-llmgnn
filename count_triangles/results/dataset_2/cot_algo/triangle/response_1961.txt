Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 15) (5, 17) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (4, 16) (4, 14) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 6) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 19) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 15) (19, 18) (0, 13) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 2) (2, 16) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 14) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 7) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 12) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 7) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 12) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph.

The sorted list of nodes based on their degrees is as follows:
0: degree 1
18: degree 1
19: degree 1
13: degree 2
10: degree 3
3: degree 3
6: degree 3
4: degree 3
8: degree 3
7: degree 4
5: degree 4
14: degree 4
12: degree 4
2: degree 5
1: degree 5
9: degree 5
16: degree 5
17: degree 5
11: degree 5
15: degree 5

By examining the edges while considering the node order, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:
[Total number of triangles: 24]
