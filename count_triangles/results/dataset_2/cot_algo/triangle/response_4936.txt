Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
The nodes can be represented as follows based on their degrees:
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 5

Now, looking at the edges in the graph we can use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles.

Count of triangles [] = 17

Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 1>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 1, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 0, 7>
<4, 0, 3>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 4>
<6, 8, 2>
<7, 9, 1>
