Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 19) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 11) (7, 21) (7, 15) (7, 28) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 25) (21, 15) (18, 22) (18, 9) (18, 20) (18, 29) (22, 18) (0, 23) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 26) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 25) (29, 18) (29, 9) (29, 8) (6, 17) (28, 7) (28, 23) (9, 18) (9, 29) (9, 23) (26, 14) (26, 27) (26, 15) (26, 20) (5, 13) (5, 24) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 12) (13, 5) (3, 2) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 19) (11, 17) (11, 23) (11, 20) (11, 25) (23, 0) (23, 28) (23, 9) (23, 11) (16, 8) (16, 4) (10, 21) (10, 5) (10, 2) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 2) (24, 27) (24, 5) (15, 7) (15, 21) (15, 26) (15, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 25) (20, 18) (20, 26) (20, 11) (8, 29) (8, 16) (4, 14) (4, 16) (25, 21) (25, 12) (25, 11) (25, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Here is the list of nodes sorted by their degrees:

Node 0: degree 1
Node 3: degree 1
Node 6: degree 1
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 2
Node 16: degree 2
Node 18: degree 4
Node 22: degree 2
Node 24: degree 2
Node 28: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 13: degree 2
Node 19: degree 4
Node 27: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 26: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 15: degree 4
Node 23: degree 4
Node 25: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5
Node 9: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 20: degree 3
Node 21: degree 4
Node 29: degree 3
Node 17: degree 4

Now, we will count the triangles using the information provided and the Degree-Based Ordering method.
