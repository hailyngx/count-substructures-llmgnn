Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (6, 7) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices based on their degree. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their respective degrees:

Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 1
Node 9: degree 9
Node 11: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 12: degree 5
Node 1: degree 6
Node 14: degree 6
Node 4: degree 7
Node 8: degree 3
Node 3: degree 8
Node 10: degree 4

Now, we will label the vertices in ascending order based on their degrees:
Node 6: label 0
Node 5: label 1
Node 11: label 2
Node 13: label 3
Node 2: label 4
Node 9: label 5
Node 7: label 6
Node 0: label 7
Node 3: label 8
Node 8: label 9
Node 10: label 10
Node 12: label 11
Node 1: label 12
Node 4: label 13
Node 14: label 14

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 
The total number of triangles found is [16].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 7, 6>
<0, 7, 3>
<0, 7, 14>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 2>
<0, 3, 12>
<0, 3, 14>
<2, 3, 12>
<2, 9, 5>
<2, 9, 12>
<2, 12, 13>
<5, 9, 2>
<9, 10, 11>
<9, 10, 3>
<9, 11, 10>
