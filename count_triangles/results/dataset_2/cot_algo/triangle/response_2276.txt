Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method sorts the nodes based on the number of connections. The sorted list of nodes with their degrees is as follows:
(0, 4)
(1, 4)
(3, 4)
(5, 1)
(7, 3)
(4, 5)
(6, 4)
(8, 5)
(2, 5)
(9, 7)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles based on the conditions mentioned earlier.

Total number of triangles: [9]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
