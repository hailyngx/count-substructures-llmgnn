Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 8) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 4), (6, 0), (9, 1), (9, 0), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 7), (3, 7), (3, 5), (3, 8), (4, 7), (4, 5), (4, 2), (7, 0), (0, 5), (0, 8), (2, 8), (8, 5)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on the number of connections:

Nodes by degree: {2, 9, 7, 2, 5, 5, 7, 6, 7, 6}

Now, let's count the triangles in the graph by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [8]
Unique Triangles: <4, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 3, 5>, <3, 4, 7>, <0, 8, 9>
