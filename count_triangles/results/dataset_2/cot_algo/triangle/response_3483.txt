Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 11) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: {(6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 10), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 10), (9, 13), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 13), (1, 4), (1, 12),
(3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 14), (3, 8), (8, 9), (8, 3), (8, 10), (8, 11), (13, 9), (13, 1), (13, 12), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 5),
(12, 1), (12, 13), (12, 5), (0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 14), (0, 11), (0, 2), (14, 3), (14, 0), (14, 11), (14, 4), (14, 2),
(5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 12), (4, 9), (4, 1), (4, 14), (4, 11), (11, 8), (11, 0), (11, 14), (11, 4), (11, 2), (2, 1), (2, 7),
(2, 0), (2, 14), (2, 11), (10, 6), (10, 9), (10, 8)}

Next, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to find the number of triangles in the graph. 

With vertices sorted based on their degree (number of connections), we get the following relabeled nodes:
Nodes: {10, 12, 7, 5, 6, 2, 13, 1, 8, 14, 4, 11, 3, 0, 9}

Now, let's analyze the edges and count the triangles formed:
Triangles: [19]
Unique Triangles: <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 11>, <0, 3, 14>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 7, 14>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 13>, <2, 7, 5>, <2, 7, 11>, <2, 11, 8>, <2, 11, 14>, <3, 8, 9>, <3, 8, 13>, <3, 8, 11>, <3, 9, 13>, <7, 11, 14>, <8, 9, 13>, <8, 9, 10>, <11, 13, 12>
