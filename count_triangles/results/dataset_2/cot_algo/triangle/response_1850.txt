Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 10) (15, 12) (27, 11) (27, 1) (27, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 21) (4, 25) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 24) (7, 13) (3, 25) (3, 14) (3, 2) (25, 4) (25, 3) (25, 16) (18, 22) (18, 9) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 16) (22, 6) (22, 29) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 21) (17, 10) (17, 9) (8, 2) (8, 28) (28, 8) (28, 29) (28, 5) (29, 22) (29, 28) (29, 1) (29, 14) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 3) (14, 29) (14, 0) (26, 22) (26, 11) (11, 27) (11, 26) (11, 5) (21, 4) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 20) (21, 19) (19, 21) (16, 7) (16, 25) (16, 22) (6, 27) (6, 22) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 20) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 27) (1, 29) (1, 0) (5, 28) (5, 11) (12, 15) (12, 0) (12, 24) (12, 9) (12, 20) (20, 21) (20, 24) (20, 12) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. 

We will first list the degrees of each node:
Node 0: 5
Node 1: 4
Node 2: 3
Node 3: 3
Node 4: 4
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 3
Node 7: 4
Node 8: 3
Node 9: 4
Node 10: 3
Node 11: 3
Node 12: 5
Node 13: 3
Node 14: 3
Node 15: 2
Node 16: 4
Node 17: 2
Node 18: 2
Node 19: 1
Node 20: 3
Node 21: 5
Node 22: 5
Node 25: 4
Node 26: 3
Node 27: 4
Node 28: 3
Node 29: 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider edges only where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(15, 10), (27, 11), (27, 6), (4, 0), (25, 3), (18, 22), (10, 17), (8, 2), (28, 5), (29, 1), (2, 13), (26, 11), (21, 19), (16, 7)

Now, we will look for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to find triangles:
1. Triangle: <0, 4, 21>
2. Triangle: <2, 8, 28>
3. Triangle: <3, 14, 29>
4. Triangle: <4, 7, 16>
5. Triangle: <11, 26, 27>
6. Triangle: <12, 9, 20>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
