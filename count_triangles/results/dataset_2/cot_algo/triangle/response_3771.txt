Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to efficiently count the number of triangles in the graph provided. Let's follow the steps:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections (degree):
    - Node 16: Degree 2
    - Node 11: Degree 2
    - Node 14: Degree 2
    - Node 17: Degree 3
    - Node 10: Degree 3
    - Node 5: Degree 3
    - Node 6: Degree 2
    - Node 2: Degree 3
    - Node 8: Degree 3
    - Node 13: Degree 3
    - Node 3: Degree 3
    - Node 15: Degree 3
    - Node 9: Degree 4
    - Node 0: Degree 3
    - Node 4: Degree 4
    - Node 12: Degree 4
    - Node 18: Degree 4
    - Node 19: Degree 2
    - Node 1: Degree 4
    - Node 7: Degree 3

2. Relabel the vertices according to their degrees:
    - Node 16: Node A
    - Node 11: Node B
    - Node 14: Node C
    - Node 17: Node D
    - Node 10: Node E
    - Node 5: Node F
    - Node 6: Node G
    - Node 2: Node H
    - Node 8: Node I
    - Node 13: Node J
    - Node 3: Node K
    - Node 15: Node L
    - Node 9: Node M
    - Node 0: Node N
    - Node 4: Node O
    - Node 12: Node P
    - Node 18: Node Q
    - Node 19: Node R
    - Node 1: Node S
    - Node 7: Node T

3. Check the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
    - <B, A> -> Shared connections: 13
    - <B, P> -> Shared connections: None

    - <D, N> -> Shared connections: 0, 18
    - <D, E> -> Shared connections: 10, 15, 17
    - <D, I> -> Shared connections: 8
    - <E, T> -> Shared connections: 10
    - <F, G> -> Shared connections: None
    - <F, Q> -> Shared connections: 5

    - <I, H> -> Shared connections: 2
    - <J, A> -> Shared connections: 16
    - <J, H> -> Shared connections: 2
    - <J, P> -> Shared connections: 13
    - <K, F> -> Shared connections: 3
    - <K, Q> -> Shared connections: 8, 12
    - <K, G> -> Shared connections: None
    - <L, E> -> Shared connections: 10, 15
    - <L, R> -> Shared connections: 19
    - <L, T> -> Shared connections: 15
    - <M, I> -> Shared connections: 8
    - <M, Q> -> Shared connections: 9, 18
    - <M, S> -> Shared connections: 1
    - <M, T> -> Shared connections: 9, 7
    - <N, D> -> Shared connections: 0
    - <N, K> -> Shared connections: 3
    - <N, Q> -> Shared connections: 0, 18
    - <O, H> -> Shared connections: 2, 4
    - <O, P> -> Shared connections: 12
    - <O, K> -> Shared connections: 3
    - <O, S> -> Shared connections: 1, 4
    - <P, B> -> Shared connections: None
    - <P, J> -> Shared connections: 13
    - <P, O> -> Shared connections: 12
    - <P, S> -> Shared connections: 4
