Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (10, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 6) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the provided information.

6. Node 14: 4 connections
7. Node 8: 4 connections
8. Node 13: 4 connections
9. Node 7: 4 connections
10. Node 3: 4 connections
11. Node 12: 5 connections
12. **Node 0: 6 connections**
13. **Node 9: 6 connections**
14. Node 4: 6 connections
15. Node 1: 6 connections

Triangles counted using the Degree-Based Ordering method: 
[<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 9, 1>, <0, 9, 3>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 14>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 0>, <1, 8, 3>, <1, 8, 14>, <1, 9, 3>, <1, 9, 10>, <2, 7, 13>, <2, 7, 14>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 1>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 9, 1>, <3, 9, 14>, <3, 12, 0>, <3, 14, 1>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 7, 2>, <6, 7, 14>, <9, 1, 3>, <9, 3, 4>, <9, 3, 14>]
