Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 10) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 3) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 11 has 1 connection.
Node 5 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 2 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 3 connections.
Node 12 has 3 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 0 has 5 connections.
Node 14 has 6 connections.
Node 10 has 6 connections.
Node 4 has 6 connections.
Node 8 has 6 connections.
Node 13 has 6 connections.
 
Analyzing the edges using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
(10, 11) -> Node 11 has fewer connections, proceed.
(10, 0) -> Node 0 has fewer connections, proceed.
(10, 8) -> Shared connection between Node 8 and Node 10 forms triangle with Node 4: <4, 8, 10>.
(10, 4) -> Shared connection between Node 10 and Node 4 forms triangle with Node 8: <4, 8, 10>.
(10, 13) -> Shared connection between Node 10 and Node 13 forms triangle with Node 4: <4, 10, 13>.

(4, 9) -> Node 4 has fewer connections, proceed.
(4, 10) -> Shared connection between Node 4 and Node 10 forms triangle with Node 8: <4, 8, 10>.
(4, 8) -> Shared connection between Node 4 and Node 8 forms triangle with Node 10: <4, 8, 10>.
(4, 0) -> Shared connection between Node 4 and Node 0 forms triangle with Node 8: <0, 4, 8>.
(4, 14) -> Shared connection between Node 4 and Node 14 forms triangle with Node 2: <2, 4, 14>.

(8, 5) -> Node 5 has fewer connections, proceed.
(8, 9) -> Node 8 has more connections, do not count.
(8, 10) -> Shared connection between Node 8 and Node 10 forms triangle with Node 4: <4, 8, 10>.
(8, 4) -> Shared connection between Node 8 and Node 4 forms triangle with Node 10: <4, 8, 10>.
(8, 1) -> Shared connection between Node 8 and Node 1 forms triangle with Node 9: <1, 8, 9>.

(7, 5) -> Node 5 has more connections, do not count.
(0, 7) -> Node 0 has more connections, do not count.

(14, 12) -> Node 12 has fewer connections, proceed.
(14, 6) -> Shared connection between Node 14 and Node 6 forms triangle with Node 2: <2, 6, 14>.
(14, 1) -> Shared connection between Node 14 and Node 1 forms triangle with Node 13: <1, 13, 14>.
(14, 2) -> Shared connection between Node 14 and Node 2 forms triangle with Node 6: <2, 6, 14>.

(3, 12) -> Node 3 has fewer connections, proceed.
(3, 0) -> Shared connection between Node 3 and Node 0 forms triangle with Node 14: <0, 3, 14>.
(3, 13) -> Shared connection between Node 3 and Node 13 forms triangle with Node 1: <1, 3, 13>.
(3, 2) -> Shared connection between Node 3 and Node 2 forms triangle with Node 14: <2, 3, 14>.

(6, 12) -> Shared connection between Node 6 and Node 12 forms triangle with Node 14: <6, 12, 14>.
(6, 13) -> Shared connection between Node 6 and Node 13 forms triangle with Node 2: <2, 6, 13>.

(1, 9) -> Node 1 has more connections, do not count.
(2, 9) -> Node 2 has more connections, do not count.

(13, 9) -> Node 13 has more connections, do not count.

Adding up the unique triangles found:
[9 triangles total]
<0, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 14>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 6, 14>, <1, 13, 14>, <2, 6, 14>, <0, 3, 14>, <1, 3, 13>
