Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 11) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 18) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 11) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 12) (5, 10) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 15) (6, 13) (0, 18) (0, 11) (0, 19) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 16) (13, 2) (13, 6) (13, 12) (15, 4) (15, 6) (16, 14) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 19) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 12) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: <br>
Degree 2: {8, 7, 16, 5, 15, 9} <br>
Degree 3: {6, 13} <br>
Degree 4: {3, 12} <br>
Degree 5: {2} <br>
Degree 6: {18} <br>
Degree 7: {11} <br>
Degree 9: {0, 14} <br>
Degree 11: {17} <br>
Degree 13: {10} <br>
Degree 17: {19} <br>
Degree 21: {1} <br>

The triangles found in the graph are: <br>
<1, 4, 10> <br>
<1, 4, 19> <br>
<1, 10, 17> <br>
<1, 10, 19> <br>
<4, 9, 10> <br>
<4, 9, 19> <br>
<10, 17, 19> <br>

The total number of triangles is: [7]
