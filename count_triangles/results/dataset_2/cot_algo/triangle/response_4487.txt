Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 24) (2, 25) (29, 25) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 6) (22, 4) (22, 25) (22, 3) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 17) (23, 13) (18, 2) (18, 16) (8, 23) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 7) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 24) (21, 9) (21, 19) (28, 11) (28, 26) (11, 28) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 12) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 19) (17, 23) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (26, 28) (26, 16) (10, 13) (15, 23) (15, 12) (15, 4) (20, 24) (4, 22) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 24) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 25) (5, 3) (9, 14) (9, 21) (9, 11) (9, 16) (16, 18) (16, 26) (16, 9) (3, 22) (3, 5) (24, 2) (24, 14) (24, 20) (24, 7) (25, 2) (25, 29) (25, 22) (25, 5) (25, 6) (6, 27) (6, 25) (6, 12) (6, 13) (19, 0) (19, 21) (19, 1) (19, 17) (13, 23) (13, 10) (13, 6) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's proceed with counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections (degrees):
   - Node 29: Degree 1
   - Node 20: Degree 1
   - Node 0: Degree 3
   - Node 10: Degree 1
   - Node 21: Degree 2
   - Node 28: Degree 2
   - Node 1: Degree 4
   - Node 2: Degree 3
   - Node 3: Degree 3
   - Node 4: Degree 4
   - Node 5: Degree 4
   - Node 6: Degree 4
   - Node 7: Degree 3
   - Node 8: Degree 4
   - Node 9: Degree 4
   - Node 11: Degree 4
   - Node 12: Degree 4
   - Node 13: Degree 3
   - Node 14: Degree 3
   - Node 15: Degree 3
   - Node 16: Degree 3
   - Node 17: Degree 4
   - Node 18: Degree 2
   - Node 19: Degree 4
   - Node 22: Degree 3
   - Node 23: Degree 4
   - Node 24: Degree 4
   - Node 25: Degree 5
   - Node 26: Degree 2
   - Node 27: Degree 2

2. Relabel the vertices in ascending order of degrees:
   - Nodes 29 and 20 labeled as 0
   - Nodes 0 and 10 labeled as 1
   - Nodes 21 and 28 labeled as 2
   - Nodes 1 and 2 labeled as 3
   - Nodes 3, 18, and 27 labeled as 4
   - Nodes 4, 22, and 26 labeled as 5
   - Nodes 5, 7, 13, and 16 labeled as 6
   - Nodes 6 and 19 labeled as 7
   - Nodes 8, 15, 17, and 23 labeled as 8
   - Nodes 9, 11, 12, and 24 labeled as 9
   - Node 14 labeled as 10
   - Nodes 25 labeled as 11

3. Check for triangles using the edges given:
   - Triangles found: <2, 14, 24>, <2, 14, 7>, <2, 18, 16>, <2, 25, 5>, <2, 25, 22>, <0, 14, 21>, <0, 14, 9>, <0, 19, 1>, <0, 19, 17>, <0, 19, 21>, <27, 0, 14>, <27, 0, 6>, <27, 6, 13>, <4, 15, 12>, <4, 15, 6>, <4, 1, 19>, <8, 23, 17>, <8, 23, 1>, <8, 23, 13>, <8, 5, 25>, <8, 5, 3>, <8, 12, 11>, <8, 12, 6>, <8, 17, 19>, <14, 9, 24>, <14, 9, 11>, <14, 24, 7>, <21, 19, 17>, <21, 19, 9>, <28, 26, 16>, <11, 9, 16>, <1, 17, 23>, <17, 5, 3>, <26, 16, 9>, <15, 12, 6>

4. Count the total number of triangles:
   - Total number of triangles: [36]
