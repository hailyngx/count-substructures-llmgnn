Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 16) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 9) (17, 2) (17, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 13) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 5) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 5) (10, 0) (10, 18) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 13) (7, 19) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 7) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 1) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 16) (8, 15) (8, 12) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 5) (18, 3) (18, 10) (18, 16) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 16) (4, 6) (4, 17) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees first. Here are the degrees of each vertex in the given graph:

Node 0: 5 edges
Node 1: 3 edges
Node 2: 4 edges
Node 3: 4 edges
Node 4: 2 edges
Node 5: 4 edges
Node 6: 2 edges
Node 7: 2 edges
Node 8: 2 edges
Node 9: 4 edges
Node 10: 2 edges
Node 11: 3 edges
Node 12: 4 edges
Node 13: 4 edges
Node 14: 2 edges
Node 15: 3 edges
Node 16: 4 edges
Node 17: 3 edges
Node 18: 3 edges
Node 19: 4 edges

By sorting the nodes by their degrees in increasing order, we get the following relabeling:

Node 4: 2 edges
Node 6: 2 edges
Node 7: 2 edges
Node 8: 2 edges
Node 14: 2 edges
Node 17: 3 edges
Node 1: 3 edges
Node 11: 3 edges
Node 15: 3 edges
Node 0: 5 edges
Node 2: 4 edges
Node 3: 4 edges
Node 5: 4 edges
Node 9: 4 edges
Node 10: 2 edges
Node 12: 4 edges
Node 13: 4 edges
Node 16: 4 edges
Node 18: 3 edges
Node 19: 4 edges

Now, we will check for triangles by examining each edge in the order described above. 
Please find the total number of triangles and the unique triangles below.

[Total number of triangles: 9]

<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 18>
<0, 12, 13>
<0, 12, 8>
<3, 11, 19>
<3, 5, 16>
<5, 15, 1>
<12, 13, 16>
<13, 16, 9>
