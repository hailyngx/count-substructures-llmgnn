Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8)
