Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 5) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 5) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 19) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 18) (13, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (7, 17) (7, 6) (12, 14) (12, 19) (6, 13) (6, 7) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 15) (9, 3) (9, 2) (15, 17) (15, 4) (15, 18) (10, 3) (10, 8) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 13) (18, 15) (5, 16) (5, 17) (19, 16) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 12) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
(11, 16), (11, 18), (11, 8), (11, 4), (16, 11), (16, 19), (16, 5), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 12), (17, 14), (17, 5), (17, 15), (17, 7), (1, 3), (1, 19), (1, 0), (3, 1), (3, 10), (3, 9), (3, 19), (8, 11), (8, 13), (8, 2), (8, 10), (13, 8), (13, 2), (13, 18), (13, 6), (2, 8), (2, 13), (2, 9), (0, 1), (0, 4), (7, 17), (7, 6), (12, 14), (12, 19), (6, 13), (6, 7), (4, 11), (4, 0), (4, 15), (9, 3), (9, 2), (15, 17), (15, 4), (15, 18), (10, 3), (10, 8), (18, 11), (18, 14), (18, 13), (18, 15), (5, 16), (5, 17), (19, 16), (19, 1), (19, 3), (19, 12)

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degree from least to most connections:

Nodes sorted by degree: {6, 0, 10, 12, 7, 9, 5, 17, 2, 15, 1, 4, 19, 14, 13, 18, 16, 8, 11, 3}

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Start with the edge (11, 16): Both 11 and 16 have the same degree (4), so we proceed.
   Shared connections between 11 and 16: {8, 18}
   Triangle formed: <11, 8, 18>

2. Move to the edge (11, 18): 11 has degree 4 and 18 has degree 4, proceed.
   Shared connections between 11 and 18: {8}
   Triangle formed: <11, 8, 18>

3. Continue this process for all edges.

After counting all triangles, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].

Unique triangles found in the graph are:
<11, 8, 18>
<1, 0, 4>
<1, 3, 19>
<1, 5, 17>
<1, 14, 18>
<3, 9, 2>
<3, 15, 17>
<3, 18, 13>
<8, 10, 3>
<8, 13, 2>
<13, 18, 15>
<16, 5, 17>
