Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 13) (2, 4) (29, 2) (29, 4) (29, 24) (29, 21) (18, 27) (18, 24) (22, 5) (22, 15) (22, 3) (20, 25) (20, 14) (20, 19) (20, 23) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 26) (10, 17) (10, 15) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 11) (8, 19) (8, 26) (8, 12) (23, 20) (23, 14) (1, 15) (1, 5) (26, 25) (26, 8) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 19) (21, 29) (21, 28) (21, 13) (21, 27) (28, 21) (28, 11) (28, 12) (11, 20) (11, 17) (11, 28) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 9) (13, 2) (13, 21) (15, 22) (15, 10) (15, 1) (9, 7) (9, 16) (9, 19) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 9) (19, 6) (14, 20) (14, 23) (16, 9) (16, 27) (5, 22) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 27) (3, 22) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 12) (24, 29) (24, 18) (27, 18) (27, 21) (27, 16) (27, 5) (12, 8) (12, 28) (12, 3) (6, 19) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 2) (4, 29) (4, 6) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed based on the given information. 
The vertices are sorted by their degree in ascending order and relabeled accordingly as follows:
Vertices: 
0 (degree 4), 
1 (degree 3), 
2 (degree 3), 
3 (degree 4), 
4 (degree 3), 
5 (degree 4), 
6 (degree 3), 
7 (degree 4), 
8 (degree 3), 
9 (degree 3), 
10 (degree 2), 
11 (degree 4), 
12 (degree 3), 
13 (degree 3), 
14 (degree 2), 
15 (degree 3), 
16 (degree 2), 
17 (degree 4), 
18 (degree 2), 
19 (degree 5), 
20 (degree 5), 
21 (degree 4), 
22 (degree 4), 
23 (degree 2), 
24 (degree 2), 
25 (degree 2), 
26 (degree 3), 
27 (degree 4), 
28 (degree 3), 
29 (degree 4).

Based on the degree-based ordering and the given edges, the unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<2, 4, 29>, 
<2, 13, 21>, 
<2, 29, 24>, 
<4, 6, 19>, 
<4, 29, 24>, 
<5, 22, 27>, 
<5, 22, 3>, 
<5, 22, 15>, 
<5, 27, 16>, 
<20, 23, 14>, 
<20, 25, 26>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
