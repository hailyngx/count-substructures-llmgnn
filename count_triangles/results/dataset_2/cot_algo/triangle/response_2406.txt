Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The new labels for the vertices will be as follows:
- Node 5: degree 7 -> labeled as 0
- Node 9: degree 4 -> labeled as 1
- Node 4: degree 3 -> labeled as 2
- Node 7: degree 6 -> labeled as 3
- Node 6: degree 4 -> labeled as 4
- Node 8: degree 2 -> labeled as 5
- Node 2: degree 3 -> labeled as 6
- Node 0: degree 5 -> labeled as 7
- Node 1: degree 3 -> labeled as 8
- Node 3: degree 3 -> labeled as 9

Now, let's count the triangles based on the provided edges:

Triangles found: <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 8]
