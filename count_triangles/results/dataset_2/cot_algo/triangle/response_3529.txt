Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 14) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) 

Response:
Based on the provided list of edges, let's construct the graph with nodes and their connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 10, 4, and 12.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 12, 13, and 14.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 11, 2, 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 8, 14, and 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 12, and 11.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 11, 8, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 11, 0, 10, 14, and 13.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 3, 4, and 12.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 14, and 0.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 12, and 13.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 5, 2, and 10.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 10.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 2, and 7.

Next, we will sort the nodes based on the number of connections:

Nodes by degree:
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 14: Degree 4

Now, let's count the number of triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method.

[Total number of triangles: 40]
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 7, 13>, <0, 9, 14>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 11>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 7, 13>, <2, 10, 13>, <2, 10, 14>, <2, 12, 14>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 8, 12>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 11>, <5, 6, 12>, <5, 11, 12>, <7, 10, 13>, <7, 10, 14>, <8, 12, 14>
