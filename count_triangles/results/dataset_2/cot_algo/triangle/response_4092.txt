Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 17) (12, 14) (12, 11) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 9) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 5) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 0) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 13) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 18) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 19) (0, 2) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (18, 9) (18, 5) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 10) (17, 7) (17, 3) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 16) (5, 14) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 16) (13, 15) (16, 5) (16, 14) (6, 4) (6, 15) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 14) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: 
(4, 8), (4, 6), (8, 4), (8, 0), (8, 7), (7, 8), (7, 10), (7, 1), (7, 17), 
(12, 14), (12, 11), (3, 11), (3, 17), (3, 9), (11, 12), (11, 3), (11, 19), (11, 5), 
(1, 7), (1, 14), (1, 0), 
(15, 9), (15, 6), (15, 13), 
(9, 3), (9, 15), (9, 18), 
(0, 8), (0, 1), (0, 10), (0, 19), (0, 2), 
(10, 7), (10, 0), (10, 19), (10, 2), 
(18, 9), (18, 5), 
(19, 11), (19, 0), (19, 10), 
(17, 7), (17, 3), 
(5, 11), (5, 18), (5, 16), (5, 14), 
(14, 12), (14, 1), (14, 5), (14, 2), (14, 16), 
(13, 15), 
(16, 5), (16, 14), 
(6, 4), (6, 15), 
(2, 0), (2, 10), (2, 14)

After sorting the nodes by their degree, we get the following labels:
Nodes: 18, 13, 16, 6, 3, 5, 19, 12, 2, 10, 1, 14, 7, 17, 4, 8, 15, 0, 9, 11

The unique triangles are <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 14>, <0, 8, 7>, <0, 10, 7>, <0, 19, 10>, <1, 7, 17>, <1, 14, 5>, <3, 9, 15>, <3, 11, 5>, <3, 17, 7>, <5, 14, 16>, <9, 15, 6>, <11, 12, 14>, <11, 19, 0>, <14, 16, 5>.
 
The total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
