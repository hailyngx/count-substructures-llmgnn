This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 26) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 22) (16, 18) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 2) (21, 20) (21, 19) (3, 1) (3, 25) (3, 17) (3, 23) (7, 15) (7, 22) (7, 26) (25, 11) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 13) (26, 11) (26, 1) (26, 7) (26, 22) (22, 16) (22, 7) (22, 26) (9, 27) (4, 27) (4, 24) (4, 29) (4, 17) (27, 9) (27, 4) (27, 20) (0, 28) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 12) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 15) (19, 21) (19, 18) (19, 12) (6, 24) (6, 17) (6, 2) (24, 4) (24, 0) (24, 6) (17, 3) (17, 25) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 23) (5, 11) (5, 23) (5, 12) (5, 10) (23, 3) (23, 17) (23, 5) (13, 25) (13, 12) (28, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 14) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 12) (14, 2) (15, 7) (15, 18) (20, 21) (20, 27) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 8) (29, 4) (29, 0) (29, 8) (10, 5) (10, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be illustrated as:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29
Edges: (11, 16), (11, 5), (11, 26), (11, 25), (16, 11), (16, 22), (16, 18), (1, 3), (1, 26), (1, 2), (21, 20), (21, 19), (3, 1), (3, 25), (3, 17), (3, 23), (7, 15), (7, 22), (7, 26), (25, 11), (25, 3), (25, 17), (25, 13), (26, 11), (26, 1), (26, 7), (26, 22), (22, 16), (22, 7), (22, 26), (9, 27), (4, 27), (4, 24), (4, 29), (4, 17), (27, 9), (27, 4), (27, 20), (0, 28), (0, 24), (0, 29), (0, 12), (18, 16), (18, 19), (18, 15), (19, 21), (19, 18), (19, 12), (6, 24), (6, 17), (6, 2), (24, 4), (24, 0), (24, 6), (17, 3), (17, 25), (17, 4), (17, 6), (17, 23), (5, 11), (5, 23), (5, 12), (5, 10), (23, 3), (23, 17), (23, 5), (13, 25), (13, 12), (28, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 14), (8, 10), (8, 29), (8, 12), (14, 2), (15, 7), (15, 18), (20, 21), (20, 27), (12, 0), (12, 19), (12, 5), (12, 13), (12, 8), (29, 4), (29, 0), (29, 8), (10, 5), (10, 8)

After relabeling the nodes based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Nodes in increasing order of degree: [9, 28, 20, 21, 6, 14, 8, 9, 10, 13, 23, 15, 7, 0, 1, 2, 12, 18, 19, 26, 24, 17, 22, 5, 4, 3, 27, 11, 25, 16, 29]

By checking the shared connections, we find the following unique triangles: <0, 5, 12>, <0, 12, 29>, <2, 6, 24>, <3, 17, 25>, <4, 12, 24>, <4, 12, 29>, <4, 17, 24>, <4, 17, 27>, <5, 11, 25>, <5, 11, 26>, <5, 12, 13>, <5, 12, 23>, <5, 12, 29>, <5, 13, 23>, <6, 17, 24>, <8, 10, 29> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
