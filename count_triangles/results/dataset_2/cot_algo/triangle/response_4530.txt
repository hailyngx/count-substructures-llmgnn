Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 0), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 7), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 7), (0, 5), (7, 3), (8, 1), (8, 3), (3, 2), (2, 4)

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices' degree:
0: 2
1: 2
2: 3
3: 4
4: 3
5: 4
6: 5
7: 3
8: 3
9: 5

Sorting by degree:
0, 1, 4, 7, 8
2, 3
5
6, 9

Triangles found:
[8]
<1, 2, 3>
<2, 3, 4>
<5, 3, 7>
<5, 3, 4>
<5, 7, 4>
<6, 9, 8>
<6, 9, 3>
<6, 9, 5>
<6, 9, 4>
<6, 9, 7>

Total number of triangles: [10]
