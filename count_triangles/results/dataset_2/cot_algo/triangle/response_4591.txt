Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
By counting the degrees of each node in the graph, we can list the nodes sorted by their degrees:

Nodes: 
1. 5 (Degree: 2)
2. 8 (Degree: 2)
3. 4 (Degree: 3)
4. 1 (Degree: 3)
5. 2 (Degree: 3)
6. 9 (Degree: 4)
7. 0 (Degree: 4)
8. 6 (Degree: 6)
9. 7 (Degree: 8)
10. 3 (Degree: 9)

Now, we can go through the edges according to the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:

Triangles:
