Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degree of connections is:  

0 (degree 5)  
2 (degree 4)  
4 (degree 2)  
1 (degree 3)  
5 (degree 5)  
7 (degree 5)  
8 (degree 4)  
9 (degree 4)  
3 (degree 7)  
6 (degree 6)  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we consider the edges in the following order:

(0, 1): forms triangles with 3, 8  
(0, 2): forms triangles with 9, 7  
(0, 3): forms triangles with 6, 8  
(0, 7): forms triangles with 9, 2  
(1, 3): forms triangles with 0, 8  
(1, 8): forms triangles with 0, 3  
(3, 5): forms triangles with 6, 8  
(3, 6): forms triangles with 0, 8, 5  
(3, 8): forms triangles with 0, 5  
(5, 6): forms triangles with 3, 8  
(5, 7): forms triangles with 0, 9  
(6, 7): forms triangles with 0, 9, 5  
(6, 8): forms triangles with 0, 3, 5  
(6, 9): forms triangles with 0, 7  
(7, 9): forms triangles with 0, 6  
(8, 9): forms triangles with 0, 6  
 
So, the total number of triangles is [15].  

The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 1, 3>  
<0, 2, 7>  
<0, 3, 6>  
<0, 5, 7>  
<0, 6, 8>  
<0, 7, 9>  
<1, 3, 8>  
<3, 5, 6>  
<3, 5, 8>  
<5, 6, 8>  
<6, 7, 9>
