Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 9) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 1) (12, 4) (12, 14) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
(4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 3) 
(7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) 
(10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 1) 
(11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) 
(8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) 
(13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) 
(0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) 
(14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 5) 
(2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 9) 
(5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 1) 
(12, 4) (12, 14) 
(1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) 
(6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) 
(3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
(9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2)

Now, let's list the nodes based on their degree:
Node 0: degree 6
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 6
Node 12: degree 2
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start counting triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 13]
<0, 5, 11>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 9, 7>
<0, 9, 14>
<1, 5, 11>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 5, 11>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 9, 7>
<2, 13, 11>
<4, 8, 2>
<7, 9, 14>
