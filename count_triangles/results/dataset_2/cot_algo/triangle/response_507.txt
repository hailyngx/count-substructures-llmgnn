Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 16) (1, 19) (1, 9) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 24) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 26) (3, 12) (25, 3) (25, 14) (2, 18) (2, 22) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 20) (18, 13) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 29) (20, 18) (20, 27) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 25) (14, 0) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 28) (6, 23) (28, 21) (28, 6) (28, 5) (13, 2) (13, 18) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 19) (26, 3) (26, 13) (17, 13) (17, 16) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 23) (12, 21) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 29) (24, 21) (24, 22) (11, 2) (11, 23) (23, 6) (23, 7) (23, 11) (23, 10) (27, 20) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 9) (22, 2) (22, 24) (8, 15) (8, 5) (19, 1) (19, 13) (19, 7) (4, 5) (5, 28) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 29) (10, 3) (10, 23) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 16) (29, 15) (29, 12) (29, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort the vertices by their degree (number of connections):
Nodes with degree 0: 27, 30
Nodes with degree 1: 26, 28
Nodes with degree 2: 24, 25, 29
Nodes with degree 3: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26
Nodes with degree 4: 5, 6, 13, 15, 21, 23
Nodes with degree 5: 0, 12, 19
Nodes with degree 6: 4, 9, 14
Nodes with degree 7: 16

2. Label the vertices accordingly based on their degree:
Nodes with degree 0: 27, 30
Nodes with degree 1: 26, 28
Nodes with degree 2: 24, 25, 29
Nodes with degree 3: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Nodes with degree 4: 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23
Nodes with degree 5: 0, 31, 32
Nodes with degree 6: 33, 34, 35, 36
Nodes with degree 7: 37

3. Process the edges in the order given, and count the triangles:

- <12, 21, 24>
- <2, 12, 13>
- <7, 12, 23>
- <2, 13, 19>
- <6, 15, 28>
- <0, 6, 14>
- <6, 12, 23>
- <5, 5, 28>
- <2, 18, 20>
- <0, 0, 9>
- <3, 3, 26>

Total number of triangles: [10]
