Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 10) (26, 20) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 18) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 7) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 2) (1, 3) (1, 29) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 24) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 7) (22, 23) (22, 0) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 16) (12, 27) (12, 29) (6, 5) (6, 11) (19, 15) (19, 21) (19, 20) (21, 19) (21, 29) (28, 7) (28, 25) (0, 22) (0, 10) (0, 24) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 20) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 11) (14, 18) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 25) (29, 1) (29, 12) (29, 21) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 23) (24, 27) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 4) (20, 26) (20, 19) (20, 10) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 28) (4, 13) (4, 24) (4, 16) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 4) (16, 2) (25, 23) (25, 28) (25, 18) (25, 2) (2, 27) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 25) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. The sorted vertices are then relabeled accordingly.

The vertices with their respective degrees are as follows:
- Node 28: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 21: degree 2
- Node 26: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 20: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 25: degree 5
- Node 15: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 5
- Node 22: degree 5
- Node 16: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 18: degree 6
- Node 8: degree 6
- Node 23: degree 6
- Node 29: degree 6
- Node 13: degree 6
- Node 17: degree 6
- Node 24: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 6
- Node 27: degree 6

After relabeling, the vertices in ascending order of degree are:
- Node 28: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 21: degree 2
- Node 26: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 20: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 25: degree 5
- Node 15: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 5
- Node 22: degree 5
- Node 16: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 18: degree 6
- Node 8: degree 6
- Node 23: degree 6
- Node 29: degree 6
- Node 13: degree 6
- Node 17: degree 6
- Node 24: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 6
- Node 27: degree 6
