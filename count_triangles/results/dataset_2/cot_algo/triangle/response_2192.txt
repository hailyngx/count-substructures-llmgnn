Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 2) (14, 5) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 4) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 15) (8, 2) (3, 12) (11, 19) (0, 10) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 17) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 4) (13, 17) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 16) (16, 17) (16, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 18) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (18, 5) (18, 9) (18, 10) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 4) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 19) 

Response:
Let's construct and label the graph with 20 nodes and corresponding edges:

Nodes: 

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 

(0, 10), (1, 13), (1, 19), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 12), (2, 15), (3, 12), (4, 14), (4, 15), (4, 17), (4, 19), (5, 7), (5, 14), (5, 18), (6, 9), (6, 12), (6, 13), (6, 14), (7, 14), (7, 17), (9, 18), (9, 6), (9, 2), (10, 0), (10, 12), (10, 18), (11, 19), (12, 2), (12, 3), (13, 1), (13, 6), (13, 16), (13, 17), (14, 4), (14, 5), (14, 6), (14, 7), (14, 17), (15, 2), (15, 4), (15, 19), (16, 13), (16, 17), (17, 4), (17, 7), (17, 13), (17, 14), (17, 16), (18, 5), (18, 9), (18, 10), (19, 1), (19, 4), (19, 11), (19, 15)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degree from lowest to highest:

Nodes by degree:

0(2), 1(2), 3(2), 5(3), 7(3), 8(1), 10(3), 11(1), 18(3), 9(4), 12(4), 13(4), 16(2), 19(4), 2(5), 4(5), 6(5), 14(5), 15(3), 17(5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 8]

Triangles found: 
<1, 2, 15>, <1, 13, 19>, <4, 13, 19>, <4, 15, 19>, <6, 9, 2>, <6, 9, 14>, <13, 14, 17>, <13, 16, 17>
