Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 3) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 0) (8, 7) (8, 2) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 1) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph with the provided nodes and edges:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
- Edges: 
    - 0: [4, 1, 3, 13, 2, 12]
    - 1: [5, 14, 13, 0]
    - 2: [5, 8, 12, 0]
    - 3: [5, 10, 0]
    - 4: [6, 7, 0, 11]
    - 5: [9, 2, 1, 3, 10]
    - 6: [9, 14, 4, 13]
    - 7: [4, 11, 10, 8]
    - 8: [7, 2]
    - 9: [5, 6, 14, 10]
    - 10: [5, 9, 7, 11, 3]
    - 11: [4, 7, 10, 12]
    - 12: [11, 13, 2, 0]
    - 13: [6, 1, 12, 0]
    - 14: [9, 6, 1]

Next, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices by degree: 
0(6) 1(4) 2(4) 3(3) 4(4) 5(5) 6(4) 7(4) 8(2) 9(4) 10(5) 11(4) 12(4) 13(4) 14(3)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: 15

Answer: [15]
