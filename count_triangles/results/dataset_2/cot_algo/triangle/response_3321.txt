Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 3) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 15) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 12) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 15) (18, 17) (18, 1) (5, 17) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 17) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 19) (1, 18) (1, 10) (17, 18) (17, 5) (17, 13) (0, 11) (0, 16) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 3) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 2) (10, 8) (10, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 11), (0, 16), (1, 18), (1, 10), (2, 9), (2, 14), (2, 15), (3, 16), (3, 7), (3, 14),
(3, 19), (4, 8), (4, 19), (4, 14), (5, 17), (6, 9), (6, 14), (6, 15), (6, 12), (7, 16),
(7, 12), (7, 3), (8, 4), (8, 10), (8, 15), (8, 12), (9, 6), (9, 2), (10, 1), (10, 8), 
(11, 0), (11, 16), (11, 19), (11, 13), (12, 7), (12, 6), (12, 8), (12, 13), (13, 11),
(13, 12), (13, 17), (14, 4), (14, 6), (14, 2), (14, 3), (15, 6), (15, 8), (15, 2), 
(16, 11), (16, 0), (16, 7), (16, 3), (17, 18), (17, 5), (17, 13), (18, 17), (18, 1),
(19, 11), (19, 4), (19, 3)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Degrees:
0: 4, 1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 5, 4: 4, 5: 2, 6: 4, 7: 4, 8: 4, 9: 2, 10: 2, 11: 4, 12: 4, 
13: 4, 14: 4, 15: 3, 16: 4, 17: 3, 18: 2, 19: 3

Vertices sorted by degree: 1, 5, 9, 10, 18, 19, 15, 17, 0, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 2, 7, 13, 14, 3, 11

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 16]

<3, 19, 11>, <2, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 14>, <4, 8, 12>, <2, 14, 3>, <4, 14, 6>, <4, 14, 3>, <6, 12, 7>, <8, 10, 1>, <8, 12, 7>, <8, 12, 13>, <12, 7, 3>, <12, 7, 16>, <12, 13, 17>, <13, 11, 16>, <13, 17, 18>
