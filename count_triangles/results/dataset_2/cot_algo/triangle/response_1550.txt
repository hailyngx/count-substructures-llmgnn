Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 4) (16, 18) (16, 4) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (15, 18) (15, 17) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 18) (19, 11) (19, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 17) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (18, 16) (18, 15) (18, 8) (18, 5) (17, 15) (17, 8) (17, 5) (17, 12) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 17) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 0) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
The vertices based on their number of connections are as follows:
Vertex 0 (degree 3)
Vertex 7 (degree 2)
Vertex 2 (degree 4)
Vertex 5 (degree 4)
Vertex 19 (degree 2)
Vertex 12 (degree 4)
Vertex 8 (degree 4)
Vertex 15 (degree 3)
Vertex 17 (degree 4)
Vertex 16 (degree 2)
Vertex 11 (degree 2)
Vertex 4 (degree 3)
Vertex 6 (degree 4)
Vertex 9 (degree 3)
Vertex 14 (degree 3)
Vertex 1 (degree 3)
Vertex 3 (degree 4)
Vertex 10 (degree 2)
Vertex 13 (degree 4)
Vertex 18 (degree 5)

Using the degree-based ordering method, we check each edge and count the total number of triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 3, 13>
<1, 3, 14>
<1, 13, 14>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 17>
<3, 5, 18>
<3, 17, 18>
<5, 17, 18>
<6, 9, 13>
<8, 12, 17>
<8, 12, 19>
<8, 17, 19>
<8, 18, 19>
<12, 17, 19>
<13, 14, 1>

Total number of triangles: [20]
