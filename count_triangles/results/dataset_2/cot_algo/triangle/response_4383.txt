Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 2) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 9) (21, 24) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 16) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 18) (17, 13) (17, 18) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 11) (23, 4) (23, 5) (23, 28) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 29) (12, 3) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 15) (14, 0) (14, 29) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 20) (28, 23) (26, 1) (26, 2) (26, 20) (9, 21) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 27) (13, 17) (13, 24) (13, 27) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 2) (19, 4) (19, 6) (19, 22) (19, 15) (19, 3) (22, 16) (22, 19) (22, 3) (18, 7) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 9) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 19) (15, 25) (3, 12) (3, 19) (3, 22) (29, 7) (29, 12) (29, 14) (29, 5) (29, 11) (5, 23) (5, 29) (2, 1) (2, 26) (2, 16) (20, 6) (20, 26) (20, 27) (25, 15) (24, 21) (24, 13) (11, 8) (11, 29) (27, 9) (27, 13) (27, 20) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, we will sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices sorted by their degree in ascending order:
(5) - Connections: 2
(6) - Connections: 3
(0) - Connections: 3
(4) - Connections: 3
(2) - Connections: 3
(7) - Connections: 3
(1) - Connections: 4
(3) - Connections: 4
(9) - Connections: 4
(11) - Connections: 4
(13) - Connections: 4
(16) - Connections: 5
(19) - Connections: 5
(22) - Connections: 5
(26) - Connections: 5
(8) - Connections: 5
(12) - Connections: 5
(15) - Connections: 5
(20) - Connections: 5
(14) - Connections: 6
(27) - Connections: 6
(25) - Connections: 6
(24) - Connections: 6
(18) - Connections: 6
(21) - Connections: 6
(23) - Connections: 6
(29) - Connections: 6
(17) - Connections: 6
(10) - Connections: 0
(28) - Connections: 0

Next, we will count the triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 30]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 16>
<0, 3, 12>
<0, 4, 19>
<0, 15, 25>
<1, 8, 16>
<1, 9, 21>
<3, 12, 29>
<4, 16, 22>
<6, 15, 19>
<7, 12, 18>
<9, 13, 17>
<9, 18, 21>
<11, 12, 29>
<13, 24, 27>
<15, 19, 22>
<16, 19, 22>
<20, 26, 27>
<18, 21, 24>
<18, 29, 7>
<23, 5, 29>
<24, 21, 1>
<26, 2, 16>
<27, 13, 17>
