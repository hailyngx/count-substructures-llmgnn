Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Nodes with their connections:
0: 1, 3, 5, 9
1: 0, 2, 4, 8
2: 1, 3, 6, 9
3: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9
4: 1, 7, 8, 9
5: 0, 3, 6
6: 2, 5, 9
7: 3, 4, 8
8: 1, 4, 7, 9
9: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8

Based on the above connections, relabel the nodes as follows:
0(4), 1(1), 2(2), 3(5), 4(9), 5(3), 6(6), 7(7), 8(8), 9(0)

Edges based on their labeling:
(4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 6) (9, 5) (9, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7)
