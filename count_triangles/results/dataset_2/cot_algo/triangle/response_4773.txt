Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 14) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 2) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 19) (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 5) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 2) (6, 5) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 18) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 0) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 1) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 11) (12, 13) (12, 18) (19, 7) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 18) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their number of connections. Here is the graph with the nodes relabeled based on their degree:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 16: 0 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 19: 1 connection
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 12: 2 connections
Node 16: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 18: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Node 15: 5 connections
Node 17: 6 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we scan through the edges in the order specified and count the triangles:

Triangles:
[31]

Unique triangles:
<0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 5>, <1, 11, 13>, <2, 15, 17>, <3, 7, 15>, <4, 11, 17>, <4, 13, 18>, <5, 7, 5>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 9, 14>, <7, 5, 7>, <7, 5, 9>, <8, 13, 18>, <10, 14, 0>, <10, 14, 8>, <10, 14, 9>, <11, 3, 7>, <12, 13, 18>, <13, 4, 11>, <13, 12, 18>, <15, 2, 17>, <15, 14, 17>, <15, 3, 7>, <17, 2, 15>, <17, 4, 11>, <18, 13, 12>, <18, 13, 4>, <18, 13, 8>
