Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 12) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 19) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 0) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 16) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 5) (13, 5) (13, 17) (15, 1) (15, 4) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 16) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 19) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 17) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 10) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 14) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph with nodes and edges constructed is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
(0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 11), 
(1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 15), 
(2, 0), (2, 7), (2, 16), 
(3, 10), (3, 16), (3, 19), 
(4, 0), (4, 14), (4, 15), (4, 18), 
(5, 0), (5, 8), (5, 13), (5, 17), 
(6, 8), (6, 9), 
(7, 2), 
(8, 5), (8, 6), 
(9, 6), (9, 12), (9, 19), 
(10, 3), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 14), 
(11, 0), (11, 1), (11, 10), (11, 14), 
(12, 1), (12, 9), (12, 10), 
(13, 5), (13, 17), 
(14, 4), (14, 10), (14, 11), (14, 19), 
(15, 1), (15, 4), 
(16, 2), (16, 3), (16, 17), (16, 18), 
(17, 5), (17, 13), (17, 16), 
(18, 4), (18, 16), 
(19, 9), (19, 14), (19, 3)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices: 7, 13, 18, 19, 2, 8, 16, 1, 12, 15, 17, 3, 5, 6, 10, 0, 4, 11, 14, 9

Using Degree-Based Ordering, the triangles formed in this graph are as follows:

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 11>
<0, 4, 15>
<0, 5, 8>
<4, 10, 14>
<4, 11, 14>
<10, 11, 14>
