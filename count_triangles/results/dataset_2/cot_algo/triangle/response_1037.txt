Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 7) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 13) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Vertices sorted by number of connections:
Node 11 - 4 connections
Nodes 1, 2, 8, 10, 12, 14 - 3 connections
Nodes 0, 3, 5, 9 - 4 connections
Nodes 4, 7, 13 - 5 connections
Node 6 - 6 connections

Now, we will analyze the edges based on the sorting:

(1, 3) - Proceed as both have 3 connections: No triangle
(1, 5) - Proceed as 1 has 3 connections and 5 has 4 connections: Triangle with 0 and 7 as shared connections <0, 1, 5>
(1, 9) - Proceed as 1 has 3 connections and 9 has 4 connections: Triangle with 0 and 8 as shared connections <0, 1, 9>
(1, 0) - Proceed as 0 has 4 connections and 1 has 3 connections: No triangle
(3, 1) - Proceed as 3 has 4 connections and 1 has 3 connections: No triangle
(3, 10) - Proceed as 3 has 4 connections and 10 has 3 connections: No triangle
(3, 6) - Proceed as 3 has 4 connections and 6 has 6 connections: Triangle with 0 and 7 as shared connections <0, 3, 6>
(3, 2) - Proceed as both have 3 connections: No triangle
(3, 12) - Proceed as 3 has 4 connections and 12 has 3 connections: No triangle
(10, 3) - Proceed as 10 has 3 connections and 3 has 4 connections: No triangle
(10, 4) - Proceed as 10 has 3 connections and 4 has 5 connections: No triangle
(10, 5) - Proceed as 10 has 3 connections and 5 has 4 connections: Triangle with 0 and 7 as shared connections <0, 5, 10>
(11, 14) - Proceed as 11 has 4 connections and 14 has 3 connections: No triangle
(11, 13) - Proceed as 11 has 4 connections and 13 has 5 connections: Triangle with 4 and 7 as shared connections <4, 11, 13>
(11, 6) - Proceed as 11 has 4 connections and 6 has 6 connections: No triangle
(11, 8) - Proceed as 11 has 4 connections and 8 has 3 connections: No triangle

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, <4, 11, 13>
