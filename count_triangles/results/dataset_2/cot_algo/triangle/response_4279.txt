Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 12) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 12) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first.

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 12) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 12) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 10)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles and list them.

Sorted vertices by their degrees (connections):
Vertices: {0-2, 1-3, 3-3, 10-3, 13-3, 14-4, 5-4, 6-4, 12-5, 8-5, 2-5, 4-5, 11-5, 9-5, 7-5}

Triangles found: 
<0, 13, 2>
<0, 13, 4>
<0, 9, 14>
<1, 2, 11>
<2, 13, 12>
<3, 10, 8>
<4, 7, 2>
<4, 7, 14>
<5, 6, 12>
<5, 7, 1>
<5, 7, 6>
<6, 12, 8>
<8, 10, 9>
<8, 12, 3>
<9, 10, 7>
<9, 10, 8>
<11, 14, 2>
<11, 14, 6>
<11, 1, 7>
<11, 2, 4>
<12, 13, 3>

Total number of triangles: [21]
