Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 5) (17, 13) (10, 1) (10, 2) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 11) (15, 8) (15, 11) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (8, 15) (8, 9) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 16) (16, 0) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 3) (12, 19) (3, 13) (3, 12) (7, 6) (11, 0) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 19) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 2) (5, 14) (5, 16) (5, 4) (2, 10) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 19) (18, 16) (18, 12) 

Response:
The vertices based on their degrees are: <br>
Vertices with degree 1: 7, 17, 18, 3, 8, 10, 15, 19 <br>
Vertices with degree 2: 14, 0, 1, 5, 7, 18 <br>
Vertices with degree 3: 9, 11, 13, 16, 2 <br>
Vertices with degree 4: 6, 12, 4 <br>

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Considering edge (14, 0): 0 shares neighbors 11 and 16 with 9 which form a triangle <0, 9, 11>.
- Considering edge (14, 5): 5 shares neighbors 16 and 4 with 9 which form a triangle <5, 9, 16>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
