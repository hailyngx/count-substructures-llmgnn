Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of their connections and then relabeling them accordingly. Based on the information provided, the sorted vertices with their degrees are as follows:
- Vertex 5: 3 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 8: 3 connections
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 4 connections
- Vertex 3: 4 connections
- Vertex 1: 5 connections
- Vertex 7: 5 connections
- Vertex 2: 6 connections
- Vertex 4: 6 connections

Next, we will process the edges by only considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. By doing so, we avoid double-counting triangles.

For each edge, we will check if there are shared connections between the two vertices. Triangles are formed by shared connections.

After processing all edges, we find that the total number of triangles is [18], and the unique triangles found are:
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 1>
<6, 8, 1>
