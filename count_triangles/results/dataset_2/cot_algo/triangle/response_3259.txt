Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method based on the above information, we have the following unique triangles:
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 1, 11>
- <0, 8, 28>
- <1, 10, 23>
- <1, 24, 2>
- <2, 3, 24>
- <2, 5, 9>
- <2, 7, 11>
- <3, 2, 25>
- <4, 26, 13>
- <4, 27, 12>
- <5, 2, 9>
- <7, 2, 11>
- <7, 9, 5>
- <8, 28, 0>
- <10, 23, 1>
- <11, 7, 2>
- <12, 16, 25>
- <13, 26, 4>
- <14, 24, 2>
- <16, 12, 27>
- <16, 25, 3>
- <16, 28, 8>
- <17, 26, 4>
- <17, 23, 10>
- <17, 24, 2>
- <19, 23, 10>
- <22, 20, 9>

The total number of triangles is [28].
