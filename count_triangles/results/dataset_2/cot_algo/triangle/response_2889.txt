Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 19) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 13) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 15) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 15) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 16) (12, 18) (12, 8) (16, 18) (16, 15) (16, 2) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 0) (7, 11) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 7) (2, 14) (2, 16) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
(5, 6), (5, 19), (5, 1), (5, 11), 
(9, 4), (9, 15), (9, 13), 
(6, 5), (6, 14), (6, 0), 
(4, 9), (4, 18), (4, 13), (4, 3), (4, 17), 
(18, 4), (18, 16), (18, 12), (18, 3), 
(0, 6), (0, 3), (0, 19), 
(14, 6), (14, 1), (14, 2), 
(1, 5), (1, 14), (1, 17), 
(17, 4), (17, 1), (17, 13), 
(19, 5), (19, 0), (19, 15), 
(8, 11), (8, 12), 
(13, 9), (13, 4), (13, 17), (13, 15), 
(10, 15), 
(15, 9), (15, 19), (15, 13), (15, 10), (15, 16), 
(12, 18), (12, 8), 
(16, 18), (16, 15), (16, 2), 
(3, 4), (3, 18), (3, 0), 
(7, 11), 
(11, 5), (11, 8), (11, 7), 
(2, 14), (2, 16)

Now, let's arrange the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes by degree: {7, 10, 2, 16, 17, 8, 12, 19, 0, 6, 14, 5, 1, 18, 3, 4, 9, 13, 15, 11}

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method and counting the triangles, we find that there are [14] triangles in total:

<0, 6, 19>
<4, 13, 17>
<3, 4, 18>
<6, 5, 1>
<4, 9, 13>
<2, 14, 1>
<1, 5, 11>
<4, 9, 15>
<4, 13, 15>
<4, 3, 0>
<6, 5, 11>
<6, 14, 1>
<4, 13, 9>
<15, 9, 13>
