Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 24) (5, 16) (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 22) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 0) (10, 8) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 27) (10, 7) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 24) (2, 8) (2, 22) (2, 27) (2, 25) (26, 28) (26, 20) (26, 29) (26, 16) (28, 26) (28, 3) (1, 4) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 27) (22, 6) (22, 2) (22, 0) (22, 20) (22, 25) (16, 5) (16, 26) (16, 21) (16, 12) (16, 14) (21, 13) (21, 16) (21, 20) (3, 10) (3, 28) (3, 27) (12, 9) (12, 16) (12, 19) (12, 23) (11, 24) (11, 18) (11, 4) (24, 5) (24, 17) (24, 11) (24, 19) (7, 8) (7, 10) (14, 16) (27, 10) (27, 2) (27, 29) (27, 3) (18, 11) (18, 25) (23, 12) (20, 26) (20, 22) (20, 21) (25, 2) (25, 22) (25, 18) (0, 13) (0, 22) (0, 19) (19, 12) (19, 24) (19, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) 

Response:
The graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: {(5, 17), (5, 24), (5, 16), (9, 6), (9, 29), (9, 13), (9, 12), (6, 22), (8, 13), (8, 2), (8, 10), (8, 7), (13, 21), (13, 0), (10, 3), (10, 27), (17, 24), (2, 27), (26, 28), (26, 20), (26, 29), (28, 3), (1, 4), (22, 20), (16, 21), (16, 14), (3, 28), (12, 19), (11, 18), (7, 14)}

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes by degree: {4, 1, 18, 23, 14, 11, 19, 10, 18, 7, 15, 25, 20, 21, 6, 9, 12, 16, 3, 5, 24, 17, 8, 0, 2, 22, 26, 27, 13, 29, 28}

Now, let's identify the triangles and count the total number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles:
<2, 8, 10>
<7, 8, 10>
<12, 13, 21>
<5, 16, 26>
<3, 10, 27>
