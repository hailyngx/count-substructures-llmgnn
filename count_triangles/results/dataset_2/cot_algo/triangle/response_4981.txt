Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (1, 10) (1, 14) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 14) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph. 

First, let's construct the graph with nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: 
{0, 6}, {0, 10}, {0, 2}, {0, 14}, {0, 8}, {0, 13}
{1, 10}, {1, 14}
{2, 5}, {2, 4}, {2, 0}, {2, 3}
{3, 4}, {3, 7}, {3, 10}, {3, 2}
{4, 5}, {4, 10}, {4, 3}, {4, 2}
{5, 2}, {5, 8}, {5, 12}, {5, 4}
{6, 9}, {6, 7}, {6, 10}, {6, 11}, {6, 0}
{7, 3}, {7, 6}, {7, 8}
{8, 5}, {8, 7}, {8, 0}, {8, 14}
{9, 6}, {9, 11}, {9, 13}, {9, 12}
{10, 4}, {10, 6}, {10, 0}, {10, 3}, {10, 1}
{11, 9}, {11, 6}, {11, 12}
{12, 5}, {12, 9}, {12, 11}, {12, 13}
{13, 9}, {13, 0}, {13, 14}, {13, 12}
{14, 0}, {14, 8}, {14, 1}, {14, 13}

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order: 
Nodes: {1, 11, 7, 5, 4, 12, 2, 14, 13, 3, 8, 0, 10, 9, 6}

Let's count the triangles: 

Triangles: [<0, 6, 10>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 10, 2>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 14>, <6, 9, 10>, <6, 7, 10>, <6, 10, 4>, <6, 10, 3>, <6, 10, 0>, <6, 10, 11>, <10, 4, 3>, <10, 4, 2>, <10, 3, 2>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 4, 3>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 14>, <5, 12, 4>, <5, 4, 8>, <5, 4, 12>, <4, 8, 5>, <9, 11, 12>, <11, 12, 9>]

Finally, the total number of triangles inside brackets is: [25]
