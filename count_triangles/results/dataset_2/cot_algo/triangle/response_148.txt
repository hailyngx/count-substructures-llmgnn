Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 15) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 2) (18, 27) (18, 28) (18, 8) (22, 16) (22, 29) (22, 12) (8, 18) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 7) (23, 24) (23, 28) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 27) (14, 25) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 6) (26, 13) (28, 18) (28, 23) (3, 21) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 24) (17, 0) (17, 13) (17, 24) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 9) (12, 22) (12, 16) (12, 25) (16, 22) (16, 12) (16, 29) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 9) (9, 11) (9, 19) (9, 25) (9, 20) (9, 27) (25, 14) (25, 12) (25, 9) (25, 4) (7, 8) (7, 24) (20, 9) (20, 4) (20, 10) (24, 23) (24, 15) (24, 17) (24, 7) (6, 0) (6, 13) (6, 29) (6, 2) (6, 4) (29, 22) (29, 16) (29, 6) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 9) (10, 20) (10, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 21) (2, 6) (2, 10) (4, 25) (4, 20) (4, 6) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: 
(1, 21) (1, 15) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 2) 
(18, 27) (18, 28) (18, 8) 
(22, 16) (22, 29) (22, 12) 
(8, 18) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 7) 
(23, 24) (23, 28) 
(0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 6) 
(14, 11) (14, 27) (14, 25) 
(13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 6) (26, 13) 
(28, 18) (28, 23) 
(3, 21) (3, 19) (3, 5) 
(15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 24) 
(17, 0) (17, 13) (17, 24) 
(11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 9) 
(12, 22) (12, 16) (12, 25) 
(16, 22) (16, 12) (16, 29) 
(19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 9) 
(9, 11) (9, 19) (9, 25) (9, 20) (9, 27) 
(25, 14) (25, 12) (25, 9) (25, 4) 
(7, 8) (7, 24) 
(20, 9) (20, 4) (20, 10) 
(24, 23) (24, 15) (24, 17) (24, 7) 
(6, 0) (6, 13) (6, 29) (6, 2) (6, 4) 
(29, 22) (29, 16) (29, 6) 
(27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 9) 
(10, 20) (10, 2) 
(5, 0) (5, 3) 
(2, 21) (2, 6) (2, 10) 
(4, 25) (4, 20) (4, 6)

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections in ascending order:
(1 connection) - {29, 7, 20, 10, 22, 16, 26, 18, 3, 23}
(2 connections) - {0, 1, 14, 24, 11, 12, 13, 19, 5}
(3 connections) - {17, 15, 27, 4}
(4 connections) - {25, 6, 21, 8, 9}

Since the vertices are sorted by their degree, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

After counting the triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8], and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 20>
<2, 6, 10>
<9, 20, 4>
<9, 11, 14>
<9, 11, 25>
<15, 19, 3>
<17, 24, 7>
