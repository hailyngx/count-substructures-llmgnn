Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 9) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 14) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 14) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 2) 

Response:
The graph representation based on the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: [(1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 10), (1, 13), (1, 4), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 14), (3, 6), (10, 0), (10, 8), (10, 5), (11, 7), (11, 9), (11, 5), (11, 8), (11, 12), (4, 12), (8, 2), (8, 9), (8, 7), (5, 6), (6, 13), (2, 13), (0, 12), (0, 9), (14, 9), (12, 0)]

Now, let's re-label the nodes based on their degrees from least to most connected nodes:
Nodes with their new labels: {5: 0, 2: 1, 4: 2, 6: 3, 12: 4, 7: 5, 13: 6, 0: 7, 10: 8, 14: 9, 8: 10, 9: 11, 3: 12, 11: 13, 1: 14}

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following unique triangles:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 7, 13>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 12>
<2, 4, 12>
<3, 6, 13>
<5, 6, 13>
<7, 9, 14>
<8, 9, 10>
<8, 9, 11>
<8, 9, 14>
<8, 10, 11>
<8, 10, 12>
<9, 10, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
