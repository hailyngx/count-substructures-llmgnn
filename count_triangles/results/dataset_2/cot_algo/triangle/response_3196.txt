Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 0) (18, 29) (22, 9) (22, 11) (22, 17) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 12) (28, 29) (28, 3) (28, 24) (28, 25) (28, 2) (29, 18) (29, 28) (29, 24) (9, 22) (9, 14) (8, 25) (8, 3) (25, 28) (25, 8) (25, 27) (25, 17) (27, 25) (27, 17) (5, 26) (5, 11) (26, 5) (26, 2) (17, 22) (17, 23) (17, 25) (17, 27) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 16) (16, 6) (16, 21) (16, 20) (21, 16) (21, 13) (21, 2) (11, 22) (11, 5) (11, 24) (11, 19) (11, 13) (24, 28) (24, 29) (24, 11) (3, 28) (3, 8) (3, 7) (7, 23) (7, 3) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 10) (13, 21) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (2, 28) (2, 26) (2, 21) (2, 14) (2, 15) (20, 16) (20, 4) (12, 23) (12, 15) (15, 2) (15, 12) (15, 0) (0, 18) (0, 13) (0, 15) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 20) (4, 14) (10, 19) (10, 13) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the nodes by the number of connections they have, from least to most connections: 

Node 10: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 12: degree 2
Node 20: degree 2
Node 21: degree 2
Node 27: degree 2
Node 15: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 16: degree 3
Node 19: degree 3
Node 22: degree 3
Node 26: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 24: degree 4
Node 25: degree 4
Node 18: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5
Node 13: degree 5
Node 28: degree 6
Node 29: degree 6

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed by them, considering the nodes with lower labels having fewer connections:

Triangles:
[20, 2, 4]
[18, 0, 13]
[18, 0, 15]
[26, 2, 14]
[14, 9, 22]
[4, 6, 1]
[24, 11, 13]

The total number of triangles in the graph is: [7]
