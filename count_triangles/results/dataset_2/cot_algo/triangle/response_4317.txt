Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 10) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 11) (5, 7) (5, 16) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 6) (3, 18) (3, 13) (3, 17) (3, 16) (11, 18) (11, 4) (1, 12) (15, 9) (15, 8) (17, 0) (17, 13) (17, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (6, 8) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 9) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 16) (10, 7) (10, 14) (8, 15) (8, 6) (16, 5) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method first requires us to sort the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order. Then we will proceed with counting the triangles.

After sorting the nodes by their degrees, we have:
Nodes: 18, 1, 5, 10, 0, 15, 11, 4, 8, 6, 2, 19, 16, 9, 13, 3, 17, 7, 12, 14

Now we can count the number of triangles:

Triangles: [42]
Unique triangles: <0, 12, 14>, <0, 12, 17>, <0, 14, 17>, <4, 11, 18>, <4, 13, 17>, <4, 13, 6>, <7, 12, 0>, <7, 12, 2>, <7, 12, 1>, <7, 12, 9>, <7, 12, 10>, <7, 12, 5>, <7, 12, 19>, <7, 9, 15>, <7, 9, 19>, <7, 9, 16>, <13, 3, 17>, <13, 3, 16>, <13, 4, 17>, <13, 4, 11>, <13, 6, 14>, <13, 6, 8>, <13, 6, 7>, <13, 6, 9>, <16, 3, 17>, <16, 3, 6>, <16, 3, 9>, <16, 5, 7>, <16, 5, 9>, <16, 5, 13>, <16, 9, 7>, <16, 9, 13>, <18, 11, 4>, <19, 2, 14>, <19, 2, 9>, <19, 9, 7>, <19, 9, 15>, <19, 9, 16>, <19, 14, 0>, <19, 14, 10>, <19, 14, 6>]
