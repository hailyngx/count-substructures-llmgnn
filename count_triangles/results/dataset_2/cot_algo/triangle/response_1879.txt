Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 12) (2, 29) (2, 11) (29, 2) (29, 6) (27, 3) (27, 26) (27, 19) (20, 25) (20, 22) (20, 4) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 13) (25, 16) (25, 8) (18, 5) (18, 7) (28, 16) (28, 9) (16, 3) (16, 25) (16, 28) (16, 13) (7, 25) (7, 18) (9, 28) (9, 13) (4, 20) (4, 14) (4, 21) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 18) (5, 10) (5, 14) (26, 27) (23, 1) (23, 6) (10, 5) (10, 14) (19, 27) (19, 17) (19, 6) (0, 12) (0, 11) (6, 29) (6, 23) (6, 19) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 11) (13, 15) (13, 25) (13, 16) (13, 9) (13, 21) (21, 4) (21, 13) (21, 22) (8, 25) (8, 17) (8, 24) (8, 11) (8, 22) (24, 8) (1, 23) (1, 14) (1, 22) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 1) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 17) (11, 8) (22, 20) (22, 21) (22, 8) (22, 1) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with 30 nodes and 90 edges. Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Sorting the vertices by degree (number of connections):
Nodes with degree 0: {30}
Nodes with degree 1: {16, 18, 23, 24, 28}
Nodes with degree 2: {0, 1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 19, 21, 22, 26, 29}
Nodes with degree 3: {4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 17, 20, 25, 27}
Nodes with degree 4: {2, 15}
Nodes with degree 5: {3}

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles:

[Number of triangles] = 12

Unique triangles:
<3, 15, 13>
<3, 15, 16>
<3, 15, 25>
<3, 17, 19>
<3, 16, 13>
<3, 16, 25>
<29, 2, 6>
<27, 3, 16>
<27, 3, 19>
<25, 7, 18>
<25, 13, 9>
<25, 16, 28>
