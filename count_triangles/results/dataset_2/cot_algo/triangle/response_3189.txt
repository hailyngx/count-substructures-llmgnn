Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8)
(1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9)
(2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8)
(3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2)
(4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8)
(5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9)
(6, 2)
(7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9)
(8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5)
(9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 1)

Next, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Nodes sorted by degree: 6, 9, 0, 5, 6, 8, 1, 7, 3, 4

Now, we will relabel the nodes according to their degrees:

Nodes relabeled: 
6 → 0
9 → 1
0 → 2
5 → 3
6 → 4
8 → 5
1 → 6
7 → 7
3 → 8
4 → 9

Now, we will count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering method:

Triangles count: [8]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
