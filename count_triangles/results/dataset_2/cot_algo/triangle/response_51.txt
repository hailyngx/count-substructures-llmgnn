Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 10) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 11) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 13) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 3) (3, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 5) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 
(3) - 1 connection
(8) - 2 connections
(9) - 3 connections
(4) - 3 connections
(14) - 4 connections
(7) - 4 connections
(6) - 4 connections
(1) - 4 connections
(5) - 5 connections
(13) - 5 connections
(0) - 5 connections
(10) - 5 connections
(2) - 6 connections
(12) - 7 connections
(11) - 7 connections

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 7]

<1, 4, 10>
<0, 5, 11>
<0, 5, 13>
<0, 6, 11>
<0, 6, 13>
<0, 11, 13>
<7, 10, 12>
