Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 6
- Node 0: degree 6
- Node 7: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges starting from the nodes with the least degree.

Starting with node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
  - Node 4 and 8 are also connected.
    - Triangle formed: <2, 4, 8>

Moving to node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 8.
  - Node 1 and 8 are connected.
    - Triangle formed: <1, 5, 8>
  - Node 6 and 8 are connected.
    - Triangle formed: <5, 6, 8>

No more triangles can be formed from node 5.

Moving to node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
  - Node 4 and 8 are already considered in the previous steps.
  
No more triangles can be formed from node 3.

Moving to node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 6, 3, 2.
  - Node 7, 6, and 2 are already considered in the previous steps.
  
No more triangles can be formed from node 4.

Moving to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 9, 5, 0.
  - Node 7 and 9 are already considered in the previous steps.
  
No more triangles can be formed from node 1.

Moving to node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 9, 5, 8, 0.
  - Node 4, 9, and 8 are already considered in the previous steps.
  - Node 5 is also connected to node 8.
    - Triangle formed: <5, 6, 8>

No more triangles can be formed from node 6.

Moving to node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 3, 6, 5, 0, 2.
  - Node 7, 3, 6, 5, and 2 are already considered in the previous steps.
  
No more triangles can be formed from node 8.

Moving to node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 6, 9, 8.
  - Node 7, 1, and 9 are already considered in the previous steps.
  - Node 6 and 8 are also connected.
    - Triangle formed: <0, 6, 8>

No more triangles can be formed from node 0.

Moving to node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 0, 8, 9, 1.
  - Node 4, 0, 8, and 9 are already considered in the previous steps.
  - Node 1 is also connected to node 8.
    - Triangle formed: <1, 7, 8>

No more triangles can be formed from node 7.

Moving to node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 6, 0.
  - Node 7, 1, and 6 are already considered in the previous steps.
  - Node 0 is also connected to node 6.
    - Triangle formed: <0, 6, 9>

No more triangles can be formed from node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6] and the unique triangles found are <2, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <0, 6, 9>.
