Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 14) (0, 4) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 2) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 12) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we will start by sorting the nodes based on the number of connections each node has:

Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 11: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 12: 5 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Now, we will label the nodes accordingly:

Node 0 -> A
Node 1 -> B
Node 2 -> C
Node 3 -> D
Node 4 -> E
Node 5 -> F
Node 6 -> G
Node 7 -> H
Node 8 -> I
Node 9 -> J
Node 10 -> K
Node 11 -> L
Node 12 -> M
Node 13 -> N
Node 14 -> O

Next, we will list the triangles by checking the shared connections between the nodes of each edge (only considering edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections):

Triangles:
[42]

Unique triangles:
<4, 5, 8>
