Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order.
   - Node 5: degree 2
   - Node 1: degree 2
   - Node 6: degree 3
   - Node 4: degree 4
   - Node 8: degree 5
   - Node 9: degree 5
   - Node 3: degree 6
   - Node 7: degree 6
   - Node 2: degree 7
   - Node 0: degree 8

2. Relabel the nodes according to their sorted degrees:
   - Node 5 -> Node 0
   - Node 1 -> Node 1
   - Node 6 -> Node 2
   - Node 4 -> Node 3
   - Node 8 -> Node 4
   - Node 9 -> Node 5
   - Node 3 -> Node 6
   - Node 7 -> Node 7
   - Node 2 -> Node 8
   - Node 0 -> Node 9

3. Check each edge and count triangles:
   - <0, 1, 3> (Common connection: 4)
   - <0, 1, 7> (Common connection: 7)
   - <0, 1, 4> (Common connection: 3)
   - <0, 1, 3> (Common connection: 4)
   - <0, 2, 7> (Common connection: 8)
   - <1, 4, 3> (Common connection: 7)
   - <1, 3, 4> (Common connection: 7)

4. Total number of triangles: [7]
   
Therefore, there are 7 unique triangles in the given graph.
