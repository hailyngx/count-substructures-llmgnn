Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 5) (15, 27) (15, 26) (15, 0) (15, 18) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 10) (27, 7) (0, 15) (0, 27) (0, 17) (0, 26) (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 25) (17, 11) (17, 0) (17, 14) (17, 19) (6, 9) (6, 23) (6, 4) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 7) (28, 21) (28, 3) (29, 3) (29, 12) (2, 19) (8, 10) (8, 26) (21, 28) (21, 12) (24, 18) (24, 5) (24, 20) (26, 15) (26, 0) (26, 8) (26, 23) (22, 14) (3, 28) (3, 29) (3, 7) (4, 16) (4, 6) (23, 6) (23, 26) (7, 27) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 20) (13, 12) (13, 19) (20, 6) (20, 9) (20, 24) (20, 1) (20, 10) (19, 17) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 25) (12, 29) (12, 21) (12, 13) (10, 27) (10, 8) (10, 20) (5, 16) (5, 24) (5, 25) (25, 14) (25, 19) (25, 5) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 24) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph based on the given information:

- Nodes: 30 nodes (labeled 0 to 29)
- Edges: 90 edges connecting the nodes as described

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph:

Degree-Based Ordering:
1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections (degree):
   - Vertex 16: degree = 3
   - Vertex 27: degree = 4
   - Vertex 28: degree = 2
   - Vertex 29: degree = 2
   - Vertex 2: degree = 1
   - Vertex 8: degree = 2
   - Vertex 24: degree = 3
   - Vertex 22: degree = 2
   - Vertex 3: degree = 3
   - Vertex 6: degree = 4
   - Vertex 9: degree = 3
   - Vertex 13: degree = 2
   - Vertex 14: degree = 3
   - Vertex 17: degree = 4
   - Vertex 20: degree = 5
   - Vertex 7: degree = 4
   - Vertex 1: degree = 3
   - Vertex 25: degree = 3
   - Vertex 5: degree = 3
   - Vertex 15: degree = 4
   - Vertex 18: degree = 3
   - Vertex 0: degree = 4
   - Vertex 11: degree = 4
   - Vertex 21: degree = 2
   - Vertex 12: degree = 3
   - Vertex 19: degree = 4
   - Vertex 26: degree = 4
   - Vertex 10: degree = 3
   - Vertex 4: degree = 3

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
   - Sorted vertices from least to most connections: 2, 28, 29, 8, 21, 12, 13, 22, 9, 3, 10, 14, 19, 25, 4, 5, 18, 24, 16, 27, 0, 1, 17, 6, 7, 11, 15, 26, 20

3. Counting triangles:
   - Check each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
     - For example, consider edge (11, 16): Vertex 11(label 17) has 4 connections, and Vertex 16(label 18) has 3 connections. This edge can form triangles with shared connections.
     - Similarly, analyze all such edges to count the triangles.

Based on the given information, we can count the number of triangles and provide the unique triangles found. Let's calculate this now.
