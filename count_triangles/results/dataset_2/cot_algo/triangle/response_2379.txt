Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 5) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (2, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 1) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 4) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 4) 

Response:
The vertices and edges in the graph are as follows:

Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 13), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 13), (3, 4), (3, 10), (3, 11), (3, 14), (4, 9), (4, 14), (5, 7), (5, 10), (5, 11), (5, 13), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 12), (6, 14), (7, 12), (8, 9), (8, 12), (9, 11), (9, 12), (10, 11)

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree in increasing order (from least connections to most connections):
Degree 1: 0, 2, 8, 13
Degree 2: 7, 14
Degree 3: 1, 5
Degree 4: 3
Degree 5: 4, 6, 10
Degree 6: 12
Degree 7: 11
Degree 8: 9

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Checking edges involving vertices with fewer connections:
   - Edge (0, 1): No triangles
   - Edge (0, 3): Triangle formed: <0, 3, 4>
   - Edge (0, 4): No triangles
   - Edge (1, 7): Triangle formed: <1, 7, 12>
   - Edge (1, 8): No triangles
   - Edge (1, 13): No triangles
   - Edge (2, 4): No triangles
   - Edge (2, 7): No triangles
   - Edge (2, 13): No triangles
   - Edge (3, 4): No triangles
   - Edge (3, 10): No triangles
   - Edge (3, 11): No triangles
   - Edge (3, 14): No triangles

Total triangles found: 2
Triangles: <0, 3, 4>, <1, 7, 12>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
