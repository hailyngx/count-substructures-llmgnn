Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 11) (1, 18) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 19) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 29) (0, 25) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 11) (27, 13) (8, 23) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 18) (23, 8) (23, 10) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 15) (6, 28) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 13) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 4) (19, 21) (19, 11) (19, 29) (22, 4) (22, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 25) (7, 10) (25, 0) (25, 7) (25, 2) (20, 2) (29, 0) (29, 19) (29, 24) (3, 16) (3, 5) (2, 25) (2, 20) (2, 9) (16, 21) (16, 3) (5, 26) (5, 3) (5, 4) (4, 28) (4, 22) (4, 5) (17, 8) (17, 6) (17, 11) (11, 1) (11, 27) (11, 19) (11, 17) (11, 18) (24, 27) (24, 29) (24, 13) (24, 14) (13, 27) (13, 6) (13, 24) (15, 26) (15, 14) (9, 28) (9, 2) (10, 23) (10, 7) (10, 14) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 11) (14, 24) (14, 15) (14, 10) (12, 8) (12, 22) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. 

To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections).

The sorted list of vertices by their degree is:
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 15: 2 connections
Node 20: 2 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 12: 2 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 22: 2 connections
Node 23: 2 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 16: 3 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 21: 3 connections
Node 25: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 11: 5 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 24: 4 connections
Node 29: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 26: 3 connections
Node 27: 4 connections
Node 28: 3 connections

Next, we will check each edge to count the number of triangles.
There are <6, 7, 25>, <8, 12, 22>, <0, 1, 21> as unique triangles.
The total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
