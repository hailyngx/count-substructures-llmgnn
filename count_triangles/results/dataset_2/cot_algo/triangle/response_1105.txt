Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29
Edges: 
- 0: [2, 17]
- 1: [21, 3, 6, 22]
- 2: [0, 19, 7]
- 3: [9, 1, 27, 8, 18]
- 4: [16, 25, 20]
- 5: [21]
- 6: [1, 17, 13]
- 7: [2, 28, 25, 15, 13]
- 8: [3, 22, 28, 20]
- 9: [14, 3, 19, 12]
- 11: [13, 15]
- 12: [9, 16]
- 13: [7, 11, 6, 20]
- 14: [9, 28, 24]
- 15: [29, 7, 11]
- 16: [4, 12, 20]
- 17: [25, 6, 0]
- 18: [3]
- 19: [9, 2, 23, 24]
- 20: [4, 16, 8, 13]
- 21: [26, 1, 28, 5]
- 22: [26, 1, 27, 8]
- 23: [29, 19]
- 24: [28, 19, 14]
- 25: [17, 4, 7]
- 26: [22, 21]
- 27: [3, 22]
- 28: [21, 8, 7, 14, 24]
- 29: [23, 15]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices in increasing order based on connections:
0 < 18 < 5 < 17 < 20 < 11 < 12 < 26 < 27 < 19 < 15 < 16 < 29 < 4 < 6 < 1 < 7 < 8 < 2 < 25 < 14 < 23 < 9 < 24 < 21 < 3 < 13 < 22 < 10 < 28

Now, we count the triangles: 

Total number of triangles: [30]

Unique triangles:
<3, 9, 22>
<4, 16, 20>
<7, 13, 20>
<14, 24, 28>
