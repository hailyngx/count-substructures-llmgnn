Edges: 
(1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 8), (10, 12), (10, 13), (10, 16), (11, 14), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 19), (8, 3), (8, 14), (8, 7), (17, 6), (17, 9), (0, 7), (0, 18), (0, 19), (0, 9), (7, 8), (7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 18), (18, 0), (18, 7), (18, 19), (18, 6), (18, 13), (19, 4), (19, 0), (19, 18), (19, 2), (2, 19), (12, 10), (12, 16), (12, 15), (14, 11), (14, 8), (14, 16), (16, 10), (16, 12), (16, 14), (16, 5), (16, 6), (6, 17), (6, 7), (6, 18), (6, 16), (6, 15), (9, 17), (9, 0), (15, 12), (15, 6), (15, 13), (5, 16), (13, 10), (13, 18), (13, 15)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Degree-Based Ordering:
0: 4 connections
1: 2 connections
2: 1 connection
3: 4 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 1 connection
6: 5 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 3 connections
9: 2 connections
10: 3 connections
11: 1 connection
12: 3 connections
13: 3 connections
14: 3 connections
15: 3 connections
16: 5 connections
17: 2 connections
18: 5 connections
19: 4 connections

Triangles:
Total number of triangles: [18]

Unique triangles:
<0, 7, 18>, <0, 13, 15>, <0, 18, 19>, <3, 1, 4>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 8, 14>, <6, 7, 18>, <6, 15, 16>, <8, 14, 16>, <10, 13, 18>, <10, 12, 16>, <10, 12, 15>, <12, 14, 16>, <12, 16, 15>, <13, 15, 16>, <14, 16, 5>, <16, 5, 6>, <16, 6, 15>
