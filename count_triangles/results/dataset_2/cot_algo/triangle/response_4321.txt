Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 16) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 15) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 19) (14, 19) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 15) (18, 1) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 17) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 7) (17, 0) (17, 19) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 2) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 16) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 13) (8, 3) (8, 15) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 2) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 8) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 10), (6, 16), (6, 12), 
(9, 16), (9, 7), (1, 18), (1, 7), 
(3, 11), (3, 8), (10, 11), (10, 5), 
(11, 15), (0, 17), (0, 12), (0, 19), 
(14, 19), (4, 5), (4, 15), (5, 19), 
(19, 17), (13, 16), (13, 2), (13, 7), 
(7, 13), (8, 15), (16, 13), (15, 8)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes by degree:
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 14: 1 connection
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 18: 1 connection
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 16: 4 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 17: 2 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 15: 4 connections

Now, we will count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering method. 

Triangles: [46]

Unique triangles found:
<7, 1, 6>
<7, 1, 9>
<5, 4, 12>
<5, 4, 15>
