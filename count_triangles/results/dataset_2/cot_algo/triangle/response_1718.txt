Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 0) (4, 2) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on degree is as follows: <4, 6, 13, 14, 2, 1, 12, 0, 5, 8, 10, 9, 11, 3, 7>.

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given edges list, we find the following triangles:

Triangles: 
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 5, 14>
<1, 8, 12>
<2, 5, 14>
<3, 7, 11>
<5, 7, 14>
<8, 12, 14>

Total number of triangles: [10]
