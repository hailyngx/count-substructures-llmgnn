Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 2) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 2) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 14) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 17) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 19) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 1) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 19) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 6) (14, 5) (14, 16) (14, 4) (7, 19) (7, 13) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 15) (19, 12) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 1) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 18) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 19) (8, 0) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding connections are as follows:
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 0 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 12: 5 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 16: 3 connections
Node 17: 3 connections
Node 18: 4 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
