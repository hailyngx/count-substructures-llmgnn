Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 12) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 2) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 15 nodes and the given 60 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(4, 13), (4, 5), (4, 14), (4, 1), (7, 11), (7, 10), (7, 14), (7, 5), (1, 6), (1, 11), (1, 9), (1, 0), (3, 10), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 8), (6, 9), (6, 14), (6, 0), (9, 8), (9, 12), (0, 14), (0, 8), (2, 13), (12, 10)

Next, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and relabel the vertices accordingly:

Sorted vertices: 2, 13, 11, 12, 7, 4, 8, 3, 5, 10, 0, 1, 6, 9, 14

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (4, 13) - Proceed
    Shared connections with 4: 14
    Triangle found: <4, 13, 14>

2. Edge (4, 5) - Proceed
    Shared connections with 4: 1, 14
    Triangles found: <4, 5, 1>, <4, 5, 14>

3. Edge (4, 14) - Proceed
    Shared connections with 4: 13, 5
    Triangle found: <4, 13, 14>

4. Edge (4, 1) - Proceed
    Shared connections with 4: 5, 14
    Triangle found: <4, 1, 5>

5. Edge (7, 11) - Proceed
    No shared connections

6. Edge (7, 10) - Proceed
    No shared connections

7. Edge (7, 14) - Proceed
    No shared connections

8. Edge (7, 5) - Proceed
    Shared connections with 7: 4
    Triangle found: <7, 5, 4>

... (Process continued for all edges)

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found: 
<4, 13, 14>, <4, 5, 1>, <4, 5, 14>, <4, 1, 5>, <7, 5, 4>, <9, 10, 12>
