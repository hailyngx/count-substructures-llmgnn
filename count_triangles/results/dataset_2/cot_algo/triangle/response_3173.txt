Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 4) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 14) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 17) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 1) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 19) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 17) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 11) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 17) (3, 2) (3, 13) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 17) (5, 10) (8, 0) (8, 15) (17, 18) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 16) (1, 9) (10, 2) (10, 5) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each has. The sorted order of the vertices is as follows:

0, 1, 8, 9, 10, 15, 3, 12, 6, 2, 13, 11, 5, 19, 7, 4, 16, 18, 17, 14

Now, we will iterate through each edge considering the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections. Then, we count the number of triangles formed by the shared connection.

Here is the count of triangles: [30]

And the unique triangles found are:
<1, 9, 16>
<4, 11, 17>
<4, 14, 18>
<5, 12, 17>
<5, 10, 17>
<5, 17, 18>
<5, 17, 18>
<5, 17, 18>
<5, 17, 18>
<7, 13, 16>
<13, 3, 7>
<13, 6, 7>
<17, 11, 5>
<17, 16, 18>
<17, 16, 18>
<17, 16, 18>
<17, 16, 18>
<14, 4, 18>
<16, 7, 17>
<15, 8, 17>
<15, 17, 18>
<15, 19, 17>
<15, 19, 17>
<15, 19, 17>
<15, 19, 17>
<19, 12, 5>
<18, 14, 4>
<18, 17, 16>
<18, 17, 16>
