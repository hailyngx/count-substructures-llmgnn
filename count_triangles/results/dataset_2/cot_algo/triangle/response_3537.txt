Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
The vertices with their connections sorted by number of connections are as follows:
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 4: 2 connections - connected to nodes 0 and 8
Node 8: 3 connections - connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7
Node 6: 3 connections - connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4
Node 0: 3 connections - connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9
Node 7: 4 connections - connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8
Node 1: 5 connections - connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, and 9
Node 3: 5 connections - connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, and 9
Node 9: 5 connections - connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 9
Node 2: 6 connections - connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's count the triangles:
