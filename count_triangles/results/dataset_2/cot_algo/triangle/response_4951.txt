Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
The given graph consists of 10 nodes and 40 edges. Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections):
   - Node 5: 2 connections
   - Node 9: 5 connections
   - Node 6: 5 connections
   - Node 4: 5 connections
   - Node 8: 3 connections
   - Node 2: 4 connections
   - Node 0: 4 connections
   - Node 7: 4 connections
   - Node 3: 6 connections
   - Node 1: 4 connections

2. Now, we will label the nodes according to their decreasing degree:
   - Node 3 (6 connections)
   - Node 4 (5 connections)
   - Node 6 (5 connections)
   - Node 9 (5 connections)
   - Node 2 (4 connections)
   - Node 0 (4 connections)
   - Node 7 (4 connections)
   - Node 1 (4 connections)
   - Node 8 (3 connections)
   - Node 5 (2 connections)

3. We will iterate through the edges according to the lower label vertex having fewer connections:
   - <0, 4> shares connection with nodes 3 and 6, forming a triangle: <0, 4, 6>
   - <0, 5> does not form a triangle
   - <0, 3> shares connection with nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8, forming triangles: <0, 3, 1> and <0, 3, 4>
   - <0, 1> does not form a triangle
   - <1, 2> shares connection with nodes 3 and 8, forming a triangle: <1, 2, 3>
   - <1, 7> does not form a triangle
   - <2, 6> shares connection with nodes 3 and 8, forming a triangle: <2, 6, 3>
   - <2, 3> shares connection with nodes 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9, forming triangles: <2, 3, 1>, <2, 3, 4>, and <2, 3, 6>
   - <3, 6> shares connection with nodes 1, 2, 4, and 8, forming triangles: <3, 6, 1> and <3, 6, 4>
   - <3, 4> shares connection with nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8, forming triangles: <3, 4, 0>, <3, 4, 1>, and <3, 4, 6>

4. Total number of triangles in the graph: [11]
   Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 1>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 3>, <2, 3, 1>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 0>, <3, 4, 1>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 1>
