Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- 0: {6, 9, 1, 8, 5}
- 1: {4, 9, 0}
- 2: {4, 3, 8}
- 3: {9, 2, 5}
- 4: {7, 8, 1, 2}
- 5: {6, 3, 0}
- 6: {7, 9, 5, 8, 0}
- 7: {4, 6, 9}
- 8: {4, 6, 9, 2, 0}
- 9: {7, 6, 8, 3, 1, 0}

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes Degree: 
- Node 1: Degree 1
- Node 2: Degree 1
- Node 5: Degree 1
- Node 7: Degree 1
- Node 8: Degree 1
- Node 3: Degree 2
- Node 0: Degree 5
- Node 4: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 6
- Node 6: Degree 5

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes sorted by degree (lowest to highest):
3, 5, 1, 2, 7, 8, 4, 0, 6, 9

After relabeling the nodes, the edges become:
(0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 5) 
(3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) 
(1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) 
(2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) 
(5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 0) 
(7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) 
(8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0)
 
Now, let's count the triangles: 

[Total number of triangles: 6]
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 6, 8>
<3, 5, 0>
<2, 4, 8>
<7, 6, 9>
