Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
I will construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 7), (4, 5), (4, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 3), (7, 1), (7, 8), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 2), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 0), (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 0), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 0), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 1), (2, 0), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 2)}

Next, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees from least to most and relabel them: 

Nodes by degree: 
{9: 2 edges, 1: 4 edges, 8: 4 edges, 2: 5 edges, 6: 5 edges, 0: 6 edges, 3: 6 edges, 7: 7 edges, 4: 7 edges, 5: 7 edges}

Relabeling the nodes accordingly:
{9: 0, 1: 1, 8: 2, 2: 3, 6: 4, 0: 5, 3: 6, 7: 7, 4: 8, 5: 9}

Now, we will count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering method: 

Triangles: [6]

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 4>
