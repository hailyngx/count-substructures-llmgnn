Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method will be used to count the triangles in the graph provided. 

The sorted list of nodes based on their degrees is as follows:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 6: 6 connections

Following the method, triangles can be found by examining edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections. 

Triangles found in the graph are as follows:
