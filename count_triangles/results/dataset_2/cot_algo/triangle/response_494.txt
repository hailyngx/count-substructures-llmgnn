Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (5, 2), (5, 0), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 1), (4, 1), (4, 6), (7, 3), (7, 1), (7, 8), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 8), (3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 2), (6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 8), (8, 9), (8, 7), (8, 1), (8, 6), (8, 0), (0, 5), (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 2), (2, 5), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 0)

Now, to count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the nodes based on their degree:

0: degree 5
2: degree 5
4: degree 3
7: degree 3
5: degree 2
8: degree 4
6: degree 4
3: degree 6
1: degree 7
9: degree 6

Now, we will start counting the triangles by considering lower degree nodes first and checking for shared neighbors:

- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle 2: <4, 6, 1>
- Triangle 3: <7, 8, 1>
- Triangle 4: <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle 5: <0, 8, 2>
- Triangle 6: <2, 3, 5>
- Triangle 7: <1, 3, 6>
- Triangle 8: <1, 3, 8>
- Triangle 9: <1, 6, 8>
- Triangle 10: <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle 11: <1, 4, 6>
- Triangle 12: <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle 13: <1, 6, 7>
- Triangle 14: <8, 6, 9>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
