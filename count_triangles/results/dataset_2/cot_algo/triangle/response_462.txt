Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 1) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 11) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 4) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 3) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 2) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degrees, i.e., the number of connections each node has. The sorted order is as follows:  

Node 2 - degree 2  
Node 7 - degree 2  
Node 4 - degree 3  
Node 14 - degree 3  
Node 1 - degree 4  
Node 11 - degree 4  
Node 0 - degree 4  
Node 3 - degree 5  
Node 5 - degree 5  
Node 13 - degree 5  
Node 12 - degree 6  
Node 8 - degree 6  
Node 10 - degree 6  
Node 6 - degree 6  
Node 9 - degree 6  

Next, we process the edges while considering the lower labeled node first when both nodes have the edge. By doing so, we can count the number of triangles.

After processing all edges, the total number of triangles found in the given graph is [15].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:  
<1, 2, 7>  
<3, 5, 8>  
<3, 4, 12>  
<3, 11, 14>  
<5, 4, 12>  
<0, 7, 12>  
<9, 6, 13>  
<10, 0, 7>  
<11, 1, 14>  
<5, 3, 4>  
<10, 0, 3>  
<10, 5, 6>  
<3, 0, 12>  
<11, 1, 2>  
<12, 0, 7>
