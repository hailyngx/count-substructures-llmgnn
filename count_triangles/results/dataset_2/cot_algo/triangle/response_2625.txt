Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ,8, 9}

Edges:
- 0: {6, 2, 7, 1}
- 1: {0, 6, 8, 5}
- 2: {5, 9, 0, 3}
- 3: {5, 4, 2, 7}
- 4: {5, 3}
- 5: {2, 8, 1, 4, 3}
- 6: {9, 1, 7, 8, 0}
- 7: {9, 6, 8, 0, 3}
- 8: {5, 6, 7, 1}
- 9: {6, 2, 7}

Now, following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will sort the nodes based on the number of their connections in increasing order and rename them accordingly.

Renamed Nodes:
- Node 0: {6, 2, 7, 1}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 0, 3}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 7, 1}
- Node 4: {5, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 7, 8, 0}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 8, 5}
- Node 3: {5, 4, 2, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 1, 4, 3}
- Node 7: {9, 6, 8, 0, 3}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 7}

Now, we will count the number of triangles:

Triangles:
- Total number of triangles: [13]
- Unique triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>
