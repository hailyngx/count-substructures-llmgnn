Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:  
- 0: (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 1)
- 1: (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 3)
- 2: (8, 2), (8, 9), (8, 1)
- 3: (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 1)
- 4: (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 1)
- 5: (6, 0), (6, 9), (6, 4)
- 6: (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 8)
- 7: (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 8)
- 8: (2, 8), (2, 3), (2, 0)
- 9: (8, 0), (8, 9), (8, 2)

Next, we sort the nodes based on the number of connections:

Nodes in the ascending order of connections: 2, 5, 6, 0, 4, 7, 1, 9, 3, 8

Now, we count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [12]
Unique triangles:  
- <0, 2, 8>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <3, 8, 9>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <8, 9, 2>
