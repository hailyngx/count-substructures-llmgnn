Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 19) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 11) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 17) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 17) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 17) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 19) (15, 7) (15, 1) (15, 14) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 12) (12, 19) (12, 10) (12, 11) (16, 4) (16, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (10, 2) (10, 12) (17, 18) (17, 5) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 11) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 17) (14, 9) (14, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in this graph by first sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections.

After relabeling the vertices, the degrees are:
Vertex 0: degree 2
Vertex 1: degree 3
Vertex 2: degree 3
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 5: degree 4
Vertex 6: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 3
Vertex 9: degree 4
Vertex 10: degree 2
Vertex 11: degree 4
Vertex 12: degree 2
Vertex 13: degree 5
Vertex 14: degree 2
Vertex 15: degree 3
Vertex 16: degree 2
Vertex 17: degree 5
Vertex 18: degree 4
Vertex 19: degree 3

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph following the method:

Triangles:
<1, 5, 17>
<1, 5, 13>
<1, 5, 17>
<1, 5, 13>
<2, 10, 12>
<2, 10, 12>
<2, 11, 17>
<2, 11, 17>
<3, 4, 13>
<3, 7, 17>
<4, 13, 16>
<5, 13, 17>
<7, 15, 17>
<9, 13, 14>
<9, 13, 14>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
