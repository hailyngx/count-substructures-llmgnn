Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 20) (26, 24) (1, 24) (1, 13) (21, 8) (21, 11) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 19) (27, 11) (27, 8) (27, 16) (8, 21) (8, 27) (8, 13) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 19) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 17) (5, 18) (5, 25) (5, 15) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 4) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 23) (20, 9) (20, 17) (20, 4) (20, 16) (28, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 29) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 21) (11, 27) (11, 3) (11, 7) (17, 18) (17, 20) (24, 26) (24, 1) (24, 10) (10, 0) (10, 24) (10, 16) (4, 6) (4, 20) (4, 22) (4, 19) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 14) (7, 15) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 29) (29, 22) (29, 7) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 4) (23, 15) (23, 25) (23, 16) (25, 13) (25, 5) (25, 6) (25, 23) (16, 27) (16, 20) (16, 10) (16, 23) 

Response:
Based on the provided edges, the graph can be represented as:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29
Edges: (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 19) (1, 24) (1, 13) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 19) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 20) (4, 22) (4, 19) (5, 18) (5, 25) (5, 15) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 4) (7, 15) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 29) (8, 21) (8, 27) (8, 13) (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 20) (10, 0) (10, 24) (10, 16) (11, 21) (11, 27) (11, 3) (11, 7) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 14) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 2) (14, 0) (14, 12) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 23) (16, 27) (16, 20) (16, 10) (16, 23) (17, 18) (17, 20) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 17) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 4) (20, 9) (20, 17) (20, 4) (20, 16) (21, 8) (21, 11) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 29) (23, 15) (23, 25) (23, 16) (24, 26) (24, 1) (24, 10) (25, 13) (25, 5) (25, 6) (25, 23) (26, 24) (27, 11) (27, 8) (27, 16) (28, 6) (29, 22) (29, 7)

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degree from least to most connected nodes:

Nodes: 13, 16, 28, 2, 5, 6, 10, 14, 23, 26, 1, 17, 18, 22, 27, 29, 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25

Next, we will count the triangles by considering each edge and checking for shared connections between the vertices for each edge. This way, we will avoid counting the same triangle multiple times. 

The total number of triangles found is [13]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<2, 4, 19>
