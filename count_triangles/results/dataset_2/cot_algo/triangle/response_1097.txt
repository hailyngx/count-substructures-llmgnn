Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles involves relabeling the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most. 

The vertices in the graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  
After relabeling based on the number of connections, the new vertex labels are:  
0 → 7 connections  
1 → 3 connections  
2 → 5 connections  
3 → 6 connections  
4 → 6 connections  
5 → 4 connections  
6 → 5 connections  
7 → 4 connections  
8 → 2 connections  
9 → 5 connections  

Next, we will analyze the edges that follow the condition where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

The unique triangles formed by these edges are:   
<0, 2, 8>  
<0, 3, 7>  
<0, 4, 6>  
<0, 4, 7>  
<0, 5, 9>  
<1, 4, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
