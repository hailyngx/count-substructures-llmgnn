Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 3), (8, 7), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Now, let's relabel the nodes according to their degrees in increasing order:
Nodes sorted by degrees: 8, 4, 1, 7, 0, 6, 5, 2, 3, 9

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles:

[Number of triangles: 12]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 6, 5>
<2, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 1, 9>
<4, 3, 9>
<7, 3, 9>
