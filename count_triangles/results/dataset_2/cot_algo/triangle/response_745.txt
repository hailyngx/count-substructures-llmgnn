Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 28) (7, 27) (7, 1) (18, 22) (18, 14) (18, 6) (18, 29) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 29) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 20) (17, 15) (0, 10) (0, 20) (0, 15) (20, 11) (20, 0) (20, 27) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 27) (8, 28) (8, 21) (8, 3) (29, 18) (29, 22) (29, 13) (14, 18) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 5) (13, 11) (13, 29) (26, 2) (26, 28) (26, 3) (5, 14) (5, 21) (28, 7) (28, 8) (28, 26) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 24) (12, 1) (6, 18) (6, 14) (6, 24) (6, 25) (24, 12) (24, 6) (24, 25) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 16) (3, 8) (3, 26) (19, 2) (19, 25) (19, 16) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 17) (15, 0) (16, 22) (16, 1) (16, 19) (23, 4) (25, 6) (25, 24) (25, 19) (9, 10) (9, 11) (27, 7) (27, 20) (27, 2) (21, 8) (21, 5) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(0, 10), (0, 20), (0, 15), (1, 7), (1, 12), (1, 16), (2, 26), (2, 19), (2, 27), (3, 8), (3, 26), (4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 23), (4, 15), (5, 14), (5, 21), (6, 18), (6, 14), (6, 24), (6, 25), (7, 15), (7, 28), (8, 28), (8, 21), (8, 3), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 0), (10, 9), (11, 9), (11, 13), (11, 12), (11, 20), (12, 4), (12, 11), (12, 14), (12, 24), (12, 1), (13, 11), (13, 29), (14, 18), (14, 6), (14, 12), (14, 5), (15, 4), (15, 7), (15, 17), (15, 0), (16, 22), (16, 1), (16, 19), (17,... 

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes sorted by degrees:
(10, 11, 13, 20, 23, 28, 29, 5, 21, 16, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 14, 17, 19, 26, 0, 7, 12, 15, 18, 22, 24, 25, 27)

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Total number of triangles: [32]

Unique triangles:
<1, 11, 20>
<1, 12, 14>
<2, 19, 26>
<4, 7, 15>
<6, 14, 12>
<6, 14, 24>
<7, 15, 4>
<8, 28, 26>
<9, 10, 11>
<12, 14, 5>
<12, 14, 6>
<12, 14, 24>
<15, 17, 4>
<15, 17, 7>
<15, 17, 0>
<16, 19, 2>
<18, 22, 16>
<19, 25, 6>
<19, 25, 24>
<19, 25, 16>
<20, 27, 2>
<22, 29, 13>
<24, 25, 6>
<27, 20, 11>
<3, 8, 26>
<6, 24, 12>
<6, 24, 25>
<7, 28, 26>
<9, 10, 0>
<9, 11, 13>
<9, 11, 20>
