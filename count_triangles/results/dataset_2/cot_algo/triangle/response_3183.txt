Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. 

Given the graph with 30 nodes and edges provided, let's first list the nodes based on their degree:

Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 12: 2 connections
Node 13: 2 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 16: 3 connections
Node 17: 1 connection
Node 18: 5 connections
Node 19: 3 connections
Node 20: 4 connections
Node 21: 4 connections
Node 22: 4 connections
Node 23: 3 connections
Node 24: 3 connections
Node 25: 2 connections
Node 26: 3 connections
Node 27: 4 connections
Node 28: 4 connections
Node 29: 2 connections
Node 30: 0 connections
