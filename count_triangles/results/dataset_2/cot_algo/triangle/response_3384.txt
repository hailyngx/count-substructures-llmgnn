Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (21, 28) (21, 0) (21, 11) (0, 21) (0, 14) (0, 9) (27, 3) (27, 5) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 3) (22, 18) (22, 16) (20, 3) (20, 9) (25, 6) (25, 23) (25, 28) (25, 14) (10, 11) (10, 26) (10, 9) (10, 29) (11, 21) (11, 18) (11, 10) (8, 1) (8, 23) (8, 13) (23, 25) (23, 8) (23, 29) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 24) (7, 3) (12, 4) (12, 26) (12, 19) (6, 1) (6, 25) (6, 28) (6, 14) (28, 21) (28, 25) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 5) (14, 0) (14, 25) (14, 6) (17, 29) (17, 24) (17, 2) (29, 10) (29, 23) (29, 17) (26, 10) (26, 13) (26, 12) (26, 16) (24, 13) (24, 17) (4, 12) (19, 18) (19, 12) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 20) (9, 10) (9, 28) (3, 27) (3, 18) (3, 20) (3, 7) (3, 15) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 15) (15, 3) (15, 16) (2, 17) (5, 1) (5, 27) (5, 28) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: 
(1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) 
(21, 28) (21, 0) (21, 11) 
(0, 21) (0, 14) (0, 9) 
(27, 3) (27, 5) 
(18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 3) 
(22, 18) (22, 16) 
(20, 3) (20, 9) 
(25, 6) (25, 23) (25, 28) (25, 14) 
(10, 11) (10, 26) (10, 9) (10, 29) 
(11, 21) (11, 18) (11, 10) 
(8, 1) (8, 23) (8, 13) 
(23, 25) (23, 8) (23, 29) 
(13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 24) 
(7, 3) 
(12, 4) (12, 26) (12, 19) 
(6, 25) (6, 28) (6, 14) 
(28, 25) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 5) 
(14, 0) (14, 25)  

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Relabeling the vertices based on the number of connections (from least to most):
Nodes by degree: [2, 7, 6, 6, 3, 6, 8, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 4, 7, 4, 4, 3, 6]

Triangles: [287]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 6, 9>
<3, 18, 20>
<0, 9, 28>
<8, 13, 26>
<6, 14, 25>
<18, 19, 22>
<1, 5, 6>
<7, 12, 19>
<10, 11, 18>
<8, 23, 29>
