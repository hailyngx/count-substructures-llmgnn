Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 5) (17, 7) (4, 3) (4, 19) (8, 12) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 16) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 14) (18, 2) (5, 1) (5, 17) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 15) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 2) (15, 9) (15, 19) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 2) (16, 14) (16, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently in the given graph.

The degree of each node in the graph is as follows:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 1
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 2
Node 16: degree 2
Node 17: degree 4
Node 18: degree 2
Node 19: degree 3

Sorting the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes 8, 1, 4, 5, 15, 16 have the lowest degree of 1 or 2. We can label these as A, B, C, D, E, F respectively.

Nodes 0, 10, 11, 3, 14, 6, and 19 have degrees of 3 and are labeled in increasing order G, H, I, J, K, L, M respectively.

Finally, nodes 2, 17, 7, 12, 13, 9 have the highest degrees of 4 and are labeled in increasing order N, O, P, Q, R, S respectively.

Now, we check the edges based on the ordering:
- (H, J): Both nodes in the group of degree 3, so proceed.
- (H, I): Both in the group of degree 3, proceed.
- (H, R): Both in groups of degree 3 and 4, proceed.
- (H, S): Both in groups of degree 3 and 4, proceed.
- (H, G): Both in the group of degree 3, proceed.
- (K, L): Both in the group of degree 3, proceed.
- (K, S): Both in groups of degree 3 and 4, proceed.
- (K, M): Both in groups of degree 3, proceed.
- (L, O): Both in groups of degree 3 and 4, proceed.
- (M, H): Both in groups of degree 3 and 4, proceed.
- (P, O): Both in the group of degree 4, proceed.
- (P, Q): Both in the group of degree 4, proceed.
- (P, R): Both in the group of degree 4, proceed.
- (P, S): Both in the group of degree 4, proceed.
