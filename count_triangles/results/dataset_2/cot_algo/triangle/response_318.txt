Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 13) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 6) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:

Vertex 5: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 10: 3 connections
Vertex 11: 3 connections
Vertex 12: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 14: 3 connections
Vertex 13: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 0: 3 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

1. For the edge (5, 9):
   - Vertex 5 has connections with vertices 9, 2, 1, 11, 0.
   - Vertex 9 has connections with vertices 5, 8, 0, 12.
   These two vertices have a shared connection with vertex 0. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <0, 5, 9>.

2. For the edge (5, 2):
   - Vertex 5 has connections with vertices 9, 2, 1, 11, 0.
   - Vertex 2 has connections with vertices 5, 10, 8, 6.
   These two vertices have a shared connection with vertex 10. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <5, 2, 10>.

3. For the edge (5, 1):
   - Vertex 5 has connections with vertices 9, 2, 1, 11, 0.
   - Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 5, 4, 12, 8.
   These two vertices have a shared connection with vertex 12. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <5, 1, 12>.
