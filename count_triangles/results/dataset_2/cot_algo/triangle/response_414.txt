Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 2), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
Node 1: 2 edges
Node 4: 2 edges
Node 3: 3 edges
Node 7: 4 edges
Node 8: 4 edges
Node 0: 4 edges
Node 2: 4 edges
Node 6: 6 edges
Node 9: 6 edges
Node 5: 8 edges

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

1. Check for shared connections involving lower-degree nodes:
- Node 1 (2 edges) doesn't share connections with any lower-degree node.
- Node 4 (2 edges) doesn't share connections with any lower-degree node.
- Node 3 (3 edges) doesn't share connections with any lower-degree node.

2. Check for shared connections involving higher-degree nodes:
- Node 5 (8 edges) shares connections with Node 9 and Node 0. So, there are two triangles with Node 5 as the higher-degree node: <0, 5, 9> and <0, 5, 3>.
- Node 6 (6 edges) shares connections with Node 9, Node 0, Node 2, and Node 3. So, there are four triangles with Node 6 as the higher-degree node: <9, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 3>, <6, 2, 1>, and <6, 3, 2>.
- Node 9 (6 edges) shares connections with Node 0, Node 5, and Node 6. Among these shared connections, we have already counted the triangles involving Node 5 and Node 6.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6] which are as follows: <0, 5, 9>, <0, 5, 3>, <9, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 3>, <6, 2, 1>, and <6, 3, 2>.
