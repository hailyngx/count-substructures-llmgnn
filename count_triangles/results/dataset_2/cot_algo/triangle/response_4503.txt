Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 7) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 11) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 11) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 14) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 14) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 14) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (1, 6), (1, 0), (3, 7), (3, 12), (8, 11), (13, 7), (4, 10), (6, 11), (6, 12), (0, 7), (2, 11), (7, 14), (14, 10)

Sorting nodes by their degree:

Nodes: 4, 0, 10, 8, 12, 5, 13, 1, 3, 9, 2, 6, 14, 7, 11

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 26]

<2, 0, 1>, <2, 0, 7>, <8, 11, 6>, <12, 6, 14>, <12, 6, 11>, <4, 10, 14>, <10, 14, 6>, <10, 4, 6>, <8, 11, 0>, <8, 7, 14>, <12, 14, 10>, <12, 14, 6>, <12, 14, 7>, <9, 3, 7>, <9, 3, 12>, <9, 3, 2>, <9, 1, 6>, <9, 1, 0>, <9, 2, 0>, <9, 2, 11>, <13, 7, 2>, <13, 7, 0>, <13, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 11>, <5, 6, 1>
