Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Here are the nodes with their corresponding connections:

Node 6: 5 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 3: 4 connections

Now, we start by processing the edges by ensuring that for each edge, the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. (6, 5): Nodes 5 and 6 form a triangle with shared connections 1 and 4.
2. (6, 1): Nodes 1 and 6 form a triangle with shared connections 7 and 2.
3. (6, 3): No triangle formed as both nodes have equal connections.
4. (6, 2): No triangle formed as both nodes have equal connections.
5. (6, 8): Nodes 6 and 8 form a triangle with shared connection 9.
6. (9, 8): Node 8 has fewer connections than node 9, so proceed. Nodes 8 and 9 form a triangle with shared connection 6.
7. (9, 2): Nodes 2 and 9 form a triangle with shared connection 1.
8. (9, 1): Nodes 1 and 9 form a triangle with shared connection 6.
9. (9, 0): Nodes 0, 9, and 4 form a triangle.
10. (4, 0): Nodes 0 and 4 form a triangle with shared connection 5.
11. (4, 5): Nodes 4 and 5 form a triangle with shared connection 0.
12. (4, 1): Nodes 1 and 4 form a triangle with shared connections 6, 7, and 0.
13. (4, 3): Nodes 3 and 4 form a triangle with shared connections 7 and 0.
14. (8, 6): Nodes 6 and 8 form a triangle with shared connection 9.
15. (8, 9): Node 8 has fewer connections than node 9, so proceed. Nodes 8 and 9 form a triangle with shared connection 6.
16. (5, 6): Nodes 5 and 6 form a triangle with shared connections 1 and 4.
17. (5, 4): Nodes 4 and 5 form a triangle with shared connection 0.
18. (5, 0): Nodes 0 and 5 form a triangle with shared connection 4.
19. (2, 6): No triangle formed as both nodes have equal connections.
20. (2, 9): Nodes 2 and 9 form a triangle with shared connection 1.
21. (2, 1): Nodes 1 and 2 form a triangle with shared connections 6 and 7.
22. (2, 7): Nodes 2 and 7 form a triangle with shared connection 0.
23. (0, 9): Nodes 0, 9, and 4 form a triangle.
24. (0, 4): Nodes 0 and 4 form a triangle with shared connection 5.
25. (0, 5): Nodes 0 and 5 form a triangle with shared connection 4.
26. (0, 7): No triangle formed as both nodes have equal connections.
27. (0, 3): Nodes 0 and 3 form a triangle with shared connection 7.
28. (7, 2): Nodes 2 and 7 form a triangle with shared connection 0.
29. (7, 0): No triangle formed as both nodes have equal connections.
30. (7, 3): Nodes 3 and 7 form a triangle with shared connections 1 and 0.
31. (7, 1): Nodes 1 and 7 form a triangle with shared connection 6.
32. (1, 6): Nodes 1 and 6 form a triangle with shared connections 7 and 2.
33. (1, 9): Nodes 1 and 9 form a triangle with shared connection 6.
34. (1, 4): Nodes 1 and 4 form a triangle with shared connections 6, 7, and 0.
35. (1, 2): Nodes 1 and 2 form a triangle with shared connections 6 and 7.
36. (1, 7): Nodes 1 and 7 form a triangle with shared connection 6.
37. (3, 6): No triangle formed as both nodes have equal connections.
38. (3, 4): Nodes 3 and 4 form a triangle with shared connections 7 and 0.
39. (3, 0): Nodes 0 and 3 form a triangle with shared connection 7.
40. (3, 7): Nodes 3 and 7 form a triangle with shared connections 1 and 0.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16], and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 7, 3>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 1, 7>, <2, 1, 9>, <2, 7, 0>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 7, 0>, <4, 1, 6>, <5, 4, 6>.
