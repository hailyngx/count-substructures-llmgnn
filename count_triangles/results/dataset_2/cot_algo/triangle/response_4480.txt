Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 5) (16, 1) (16, 18) (1, 16) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 9) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 9) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 0) (7, 1) (7, 14) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 0) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 15) (19, 13) (19, 17) (19, 6) (19, 9) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 14) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 17) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 12) (6, 19) (6, 14) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 6) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 19) (9, 4) (17, 19) (17, 4) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is constructed based on the provided information. The edges have been added accordingly. 

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort vertices by their degree (number of connections):
```
Node 16: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 18: 6 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 17: 2 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
```

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly based on degree (lower degrees get lower labels).

3. Check for triangles by examining edges between lower-degree nodes:
   - Triangles involving Node 1: (1, 16, 18), (1, 12, 0), (1, 7, 14), (1, 12, 4)

   - Triangles involving Node 3: (3, 0, 12)

   - Triangles involving Node 13: (13, 3, 19), (13, 19, 9)

   - Triangles involving Node 10: (10, 15, 5), (10, 2, 9)

   - Triangles involving Node 2: (2, 18, 16)

   - Triangles involving Node 18: (18, 0, 12), (18, 14, 7), (18, 14, 6)

   - Triangles involving Node 7: (7, 14, 6)

   - Triangles involving Node 12: (12, 0, 4)

   - Triangles involving Node 5: (5, 15, 14), (5, 4, 9)

   - Triangles involving Node 19: (19, 9, 4)

4. Count the total number of triangles and list them:
   
   Total number of triangles: [12]

   Unique triangles found:
   <1, 16, 18> <1, 12, 0> <1, 7, 14> <1, 12, 4> <3, 0, 12> <13, 3, 19> <13, 19, 9> <10, 15, 5> <10, 2, 9> <5, 15, 14> <5, 4, 9> <19, 9, 4>
