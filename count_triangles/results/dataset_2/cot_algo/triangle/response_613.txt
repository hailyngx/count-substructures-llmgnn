Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 3) (0, 6) (0, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their degree of connections. Then, for each edge, we only consider it if the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

After sorting the vertices by their degree of connections, the order becomes: 5-0, 4-1-12, 2-8, 11-13-14, 7-6, 3-9, 10.

By iterating through the edges while following the conditions mentioned above, we find that there are 11 unique triangles in the graph. The total number of triangles is [11], and the unique triangles are: <6, 9, 10>, <2, 10, 13>, <2, 10, 14>, <12, 1, 7>, <6, 1, 7>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 13, 14>, <6, 7, 14>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <2, 7, 14>.
