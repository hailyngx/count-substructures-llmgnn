Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 7) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 13) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 12) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 18) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (17, 18) (17, 16) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 19) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 15) (7, 11) (7, 19) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 12) (16, 8) (16, 17) (4, 1) (4, 19) (4, 15) (9, 15) (9, 19) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 4) (19, 9) (15, 0) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 12) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 15) 

Response:
The degrees of each node are as follows:

Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 2
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 1
Node 12: degree 5
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 4
Node 15: degree 4
Node 16: degree 2
Node 17: degree 2
Node 18: degree 5
Node 19: degree 4

By sorting the nodes based on their degrees, the new label for each node is:

Node 11: degree 1
Node 7: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 16: degree 2
Node 17: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4
Node 15: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5
Node 18: degree 5
Node 12: degree 5

Now, following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

For each edge (u, v), where u is the node with the lower label:
- Check shared neighbors between u and v to find triangles.

Triangles found:
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 14>
<1, 4, 19>
<1, 6, 14>
<1, 14, 19>
<4, 6, 14>
<4, 14, 19>
<6, 14, 19>

Total number of triangles: [8]
