Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 4) (16, 18) (15, 27) (15, 13) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 7) (27, 9) (27, 23) (27, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 20) (9, 11) (9, 27) (9, 6) (9, 18) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 29) (25, 13) (25, 4) (10, 12) (10, 1) (22, 26) (22, 14) (22, 17) (22, 12) (23, 27) (4, 11) (4, 25) (4, 18) (8, 27) (8, 20) (1, 10) (1, 26) (26, 22) (26, 1) (26, 28) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 22) (14, 0) (14, 24) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 17) (28, 26) (28, 2) (28, 20) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 5) (21, 20) (21, 2) (7, 11) (7, 27) (7, 13) (7, 17) (2, 6) (2, 28) (2, 5) (2, 21) (20, 6) (20, 8) (20, 28) (20, 21) (24, 14) (24, 17) (29, 3) (29, 13) (13, 15) (13, 25) (13, 7) (13, 29) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 22) (12, 18) (17, 22) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 7) (17, 24) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree of connections in ascending order. Let's relabel the nodes accordingly:

Node 0 has degree 4,
Node 1 has degree 2,
Node 2 has degree 4,
Node 3 has degree 3,
Node 4 has degree 4,
Node 5 has degree 3,
Node 6 has degree 3,
Node 7 has degree 4,
Node 8 has degree 3,
Node 9 has degree 4,
Node 10 has degree 2,
Node 11 has degree 3,
Node 12 has degree 5,
Node 13 has degree 4,
Node 14 has degree 3,
Node 15 has degree 3,
Node 16 has degree 2,
Node 17 has degree 5,
Node 18 has degree 5,
Node 19 has degree 1,
Node 20 has degree 4,
Node 21 has degree 2,
Node 22 has degree 5,
Node 23 has degree 2,
Node 24 has degree 3,
Node 25 has degree 3,
Node 26 has degree 4,
Node 27 has degree 5,
Node 28 has degree 3,
Node 29 has degree 2.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we traverse through each edge and count the number of triangles formed. Finally, we list the total number of triangles and the unique triangles found:

Total number of triangles = [38]
Unique triangles found:
