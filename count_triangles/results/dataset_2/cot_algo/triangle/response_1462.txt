Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 26) (5, 22) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 3) (2, 14) (2, 21) (29, 28) (29, 7) (29, 10) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 28) (22, 5) (22, 23) (22, 11) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 27) (10, 17) (10, 29) (10, 15) (10, 1) (12, 27) (12, 28) (12, 15) (27, 23) (27, 12) (27, 0) (7, 29) (7, 0) (7, 16) (0, 23) (0, 27) (0, 7) (28, 29) (28, 13) (28, 12) (4, 24) (4, 20) (4, 11) (3, 17) (21, 2) (21, 6) (21, 24) (15, 10) (15, 12) (15, 26) (15, 11) (19, 8) (19, 25) (19, 1) (19, 6) (26, 5) (26, 15) (26, 25) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 7) (16, 25) (6, 14) (6, 21) (6, 19) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 18) (24, 8) (24, 4) (24, 21) (24, 20) (20, 4) (20, 24) (11, 22) (11, 4) (11, 15) (11, 18) (25, 23) (25, 19) (25, 26) (25, 16) (18, 1) (18, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles:
- Sort the nodes by their degrees: (3, 4, 0, 18, 7, 1, 6, 28, 2, 14, 13, 8, 10, 5, 11, 15, 25, 24, 26, 21, 19, 16, 29, 23, 27, 12, 20, 22, 17).
- Relabel the nodes accordingly: 
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29).

Let's count the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 10>.
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 19>.
- Triangle 3: <0, 1, 23>.
- Triangle 4: <0, 1, 27>.
- Triangle 5: <0, 7, 27>.
- Triangle 6: <0, 7, 29>.
- Triangle 7: <0, 10, 17>.
- Triangle 8: <1, 10, 15>.
- Triangle 9: <1, 10, 19>.
- Triangle 10: <1, 11, 18>.
- Triangle 11: <1, 19, 25>.
- Triangle 12: <4, 11, 15>.
- Triangle 13: <6, 14, 21>.
- Triangle 14: <6, 14, 19>.
- Triangle 15: <7, 16, 23>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [15].
