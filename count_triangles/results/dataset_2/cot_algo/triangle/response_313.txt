Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. 

Relabelling the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices with degrees in increasing order: 6, 9, 1, 7, 5, 0, 8, 4, 3, 2.

Edges to consider based on the method:
(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 5), (2, 9), (3, 6), (3, 9).

Triangles found (in the format <vertex1, vertex2, vertex3>):
<0, 5, 2>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 6>, <1, 8, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 9, 6>.

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
