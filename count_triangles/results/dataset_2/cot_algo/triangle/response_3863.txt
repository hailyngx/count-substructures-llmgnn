Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (12, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 
Node 0: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 12: degree 5
Node 5: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 14: degree 5
Node 10: degree 6
Node 1: degree 6
Node 6: degree 6
Node 13: degree 6
Node 4: degree 6
Node 7: degree 6
Node 11: degree 7
Node 9: degree 7
Node 3: degree 8

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check for triangles:
1. Considering edge (5, 11) with nodes 5 and 11: Shared connections with 5 are 3 and 14, with 11 are 7 and 13. Triangle formed: <5, 11, 7>.
2. Considering edge (5, 4) with nodes 4 and 5: Shared connection with 4 is 13, with 5 is 3 and 14. No triangle formed.
3. Considering edge (5, 3) with nodes 3 and 5: Shared connection with 3 is 0, 9, 8, and 2, with 5 is 11 and 14. Triangles formed: <3, 5, 11> and <3, 5, 14>.
4. Considering edge (5, 14) with nodes 5 and 14: Shared connection with 5 is 3, with 14 is 0, 6. Triangle formed: <5, 14, 0>.

[Total number of triangles: [3]]
The unique triangles found are: <5, 11, 7>, <3, 5, 11>, <3, 5, 14>.
