Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 8) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 1) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 13) (15, 3) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 2) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 8) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 12) (13, 3) (19, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (17, 16) (17, 0) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 8) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 14) (14, 9) (14, 18) (14, 1) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 18) (8, 12) (7, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) from least to most. 

The vertices with their corresponding degrees are as follows:
0 (3), 7 (1), 13 (1), 19 (2),
3 (4), 5 (3), 15 (2), 17 (3),
6 (4), 14 (3), 2 (4), 18 (4),
9 (5), 4 (4), 10 (3), 11 (3),
1 (4), 16 (4), 12 (5), 8 (4).

Now, we will relabel the vertices according to their degree, starting from 0:
0: 0, 7: 1, 13: 2, 19: 3,
3: 4, 5: 5, 15: 6, 17: 7,
6: 8, 14: 9, 2: 10, 18: 11,
9: 12, 4: 13, 10: 14, 11: 15,
1: 16, 16: 17, 12: 18, 8: 19.

Next, we will go through each edge in the graph (based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections) and count the triangles formed by shared connections.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [28].
The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 10, 14>, <1, 14, 16>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 12, 16>, <1, 12, 18>, <1, 17, 16>, <1, 2, 12>, <1, 2, 14>, <1, 9, 14>, <1, 9, 18>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 13>, <4, 6, 18>, <4, 9, 12>, <4, 9, 14>, <4, 9, 18>, <4, 9, 8>, <6, 8, 14>, <9, 12, 14>, <9, 12, 18>, <9, 14, 18>, <10, 0, 17>, <10, 1, 17>, <10, 17, 16>, <14, 18, 8>, <14, 18, 9>, <16, 12, 8>.
