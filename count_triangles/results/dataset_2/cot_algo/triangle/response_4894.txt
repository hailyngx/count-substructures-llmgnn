Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by labeling the nodes based on their degree. 

The degrees of each node are:
Node 0: 6 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Ordering the nodes by degree:
Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 1, Node 5, Node 0

Now, we will only consider the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:
(2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 1), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 6), (4, 1), (6, 7), (6, 1), (7, 8), (7, 1), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 6), (9, 5), (9, 3)

Next, we will find the triangles:
- Triangle <2, 5, 8>
- Triangle <2, 5, 9>
- Triangle <2, 5, 0>
- Triangle <2, 8, 5>
- Triangle <2, 8, 6>
- Triangle <2, 1, 4>
- Triangle <3, 5, 9>
- Triangle <3, 5, 0>
- Triangle <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle <4, 6, 1>
- Triangle <6, 7, 8>
- Triangle <6, 7, 1>
- Triangle <7, 8, 5>
- Triangle <7, 8, 6>
- Triangle <8, 5, 9>
