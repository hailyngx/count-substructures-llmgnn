Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 6) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 5) (10, 2) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 12) 

Response:
I will now construct the graph with the provided edges and count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 12: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 11: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 13: 4 connections
Vertex 10: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 6 connections
Vertex 3: 6 connections
Vertex 6: 6 connections
Vertex 4: 6 connections
Vertex 14: 6 connections

The total number of triangles is: [18]

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 4, 12>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 10>
<0, 9, 14>
<1, 3, 14>
<1, 4, 12>
<2, 9, 10>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 10>
<3, 6, 14>
<3, 11, 14>
<4, 6, 12>
<5, 10, 2>
<6, 11, 14>
<6, 12, 4>
<7, 10, 14>
<7, 13, 6>
<8, 9, 0>
