Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 2) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (13, 6) (13, 2) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 10) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering for the given graph with 15 nodes is as follows:

Node 5: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 6
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 12: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 14: Degree 3
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 6
Node 10: Degree 5

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we will now count the triangles in the graph.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [16].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<5, 4, 8>
<5, 4, 12>
<5, 4, 0>
<5, 4, 3>
<5, 4, 10>
<9, 12, 2>
<9, 12, 4>
<9, 12, 6>
<6, 12, 4>
<1, 0, 6>
<1, 0, 4>
<3, 1, 11>
<3, 1, 14>
<3, 11, 2>
<4, 8, 3>
<10, 7, 2>
