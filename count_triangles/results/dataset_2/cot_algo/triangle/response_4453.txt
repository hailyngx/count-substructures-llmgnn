Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 15) (22, 13) (22, 28) (22, 21) (1, 21) (1, 20) (1, 28) (21, 22) (21, 1) (21, 29) (21, 4) (2, 29) (2, 0) (29, 21) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 16) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 3) (27, 11) (27, 16) (27, 8) (8, 27) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 25) (23, 8) (23, 16) (23, 10) (23, 20) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 24) (17, 29) (17, 26) (17, 4) (11, 27) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 6) (28, 22) (28, 1) (28, 9) (28, 10) (18, 26) (18, 9) (26, 17) (26, 18) (26, 7) (7, 26) (25, 8) (15, 13) (15, 19) (5, 12) (5, 11) (19, 11) (19, 15) (16, 29) (16, 27) (16, 23) (9, 14) (9, 28) (9, 18) (9, 3) (3, 12) (3, 9) (3, 6) (20, 1) (20, 23) (20, 10) (24, 8) (24, 14) (10, 12) (10, 23) (10, 28) (10, 20) (4, 13) (4, 21) (4, 17) (4, 6) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections).

Sorted vertices from least to most connections:
Node 7: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 18: Degree 3
Node 24: Degree 3
Node 25: Degree 3
Node 15: Degree 4
Node 19: Degree 4
Node 26: Degree 4
Node 27: Degree 4
Node 20: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 22: Degree 4
Node 28: Degree 4
Node 17: Degree 4
Node 21: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 14: Degree 5
Node 16: Degree 5
Node 0: Degree 5
Node 29: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 10: Degree 6
Node 12: Degree 6
Node 4: Degree 6
Node 6: Degree 6
Node 11: Degree 6
Node 13: Degree 6

Now, we can count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found:

Total number of triangles: [34]
