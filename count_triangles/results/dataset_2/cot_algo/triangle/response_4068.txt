Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's label the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 0: degree 5
Vertex 1: degree 3
Vertex 2: degree 4
Vertex 3: degree 3
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 5: degree 5
Vertex 6: degree 4
Vertex 7: degree 5
Vertex 8: degree 5
Vertex 9: degree 5

Sorting the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
Vertices in Degree-Based Ordering: 1, 3, 6, 2, 4, 0, 5, 7, 8, 9

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Start with the lowest degree node, which is Node 1 (degree 3).
- Check each edge involving Node 1 while ensuring the other vertex has a higher index.
  - (1, 9) has a common neighbor 9. (1, 9, 7) is a triangle.
  - (1, 8) has a common neighbor 8. (1, 8, 4) is a triangle.
- Move to the next lowest degree node, which is Node 3 (degree 3).
- Check each edge involving Node 3 while ensuring the other vertex has a higher index.
  - (3, 5) has a common neighbor 5. (3, 5, 7) is a triangle.
  - No other triangles involving Node 3.
- Continue this process for the remaining nodes.

Total number of triangles: [3]
