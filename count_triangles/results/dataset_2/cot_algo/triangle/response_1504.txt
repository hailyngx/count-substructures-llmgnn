Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 18) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 15) (7, 1) (7, 17) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 15) (1, 7) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 5) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 5) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 0) (9, 18) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 5) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 6) (2, 10) (2, 6) (19, 13) (19, 4) (19, 14) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 5) (14, 12) (14, 19) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 18) (6, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degrees. The sorted nodes are as follows:
Nodes: 16, 18, 2, 10, 14, 9, 6, 0, 4, 12, 17, 1, 19, 11, 8, 13, 7, 15, 3, 5

Using this ordering and the given edges, we can start counting the triangles:
1. Edge (11, 16):
   - 11 connects to: 3, 17
   - 16 connects to: 13, 18
   - Shared connections: None

2. Edge (11, 3):
   - 11 connects to: 16, 17
   - 3 connects to: 8, 5
   - Shared connections: None

3. Edge (11, 17):
   - 11 connects to: 16, 3
   - 17 connects to: 7, 1
   - Shared connections: None

...

[Total number of triangles: 21]
<0, 1, 7>, <3, 1, 7>, <4, 5, 0>, <4, 5, 1>, <4, 5, 3>, <5, 1, 7>, <5, 0, 15>, <5, 3, 8>, <8, 3, 5>, <10, 0, 5>, <10, 4, 5>, <12, 14, 19>, <13, 7, 1>, <13, 8, 3>, <13, 19, 4>, <13, 16, 18>, <14, 12, 15>, <15, 0, 10>, <17, 1, 7>, <18, 9, 6>
