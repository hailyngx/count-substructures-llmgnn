Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 14) (13, 0) (22, 19) (22, 6) (22, 10) (22, 3) (9, 26) (9, 25) (9, 20) (9, 1) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 10) (26, 2) (26, 3) (14, 13) (14, 17) (17, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (2, 26) (2, 29) (2, 20) (29, 2) (29, 3) (8, 28) (8, 1) (8, 7) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 20) (1, 25) (4, 16) (4, 20) (27, 11) (5, 13) (5, 23) (5, 21) (15, 23) (16, 4) (16, 21) (16, 7) (11, 27) (11, 23) (11, 21) (23, 5) (23, 15) (23, 11) (12, 24) (12, 0) (12, 19) (21, 5) (21, 16) (21, 11) (21, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 19) (19, 22) (19, 12) (19, 7) (19, 25) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 10) (10, 22) (10, 26) (10, 28) (3, 22) (3, 26) (3, 29) (6, 22) (6, 17) (24, 12) (25, 9) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 18) (20, 9) (20, 2) (20, 1) (20, 4) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 21) (0, 28) (18, 25) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: (13, 5), (13, 17), (13, 14), (13, 0), (22, 19), (22, 6), (22, 10), (22, 3), (9, 26), (9, 25), (9, 20), (9, 1), (9, 7), (26, 10), (26, 2), (14, 17), (17, 6), (2, 29), (8, 28), (8, 1), (8, 7), (1, 25), (4, 16), (27, 11), (5, 23), (5, 21), (16, 7), (11, 27), (11, 23), (11, 21), (12, 24), (12, 19), (21, 0), (7, 19), (28, 0), (28, 10), (3, 22), (6, 17), (18, 25)

Now, let's construct the degree-based ordering and count the number of triangles and list them:

Degree-Based Ordering:
0(4) < 4(4) < 15(0) < 24(1) < 18(1) < 12(2) < 21(3) < 27(2) < 11(3) < 28(3) < 6(3) < 16(3) < 5(3) < 23(3) < 22(4) < 3(4) < 10(4) < 9(5) < 26(4) < 2(4) < 29(2) < 1(4) < 8(3) < 7(4) < 20(4) < 25(4) < 19(4) < 17(3) < 14(2) < 13(4)

Triangles:
[<0, 21, 5>, <0, 21, 16>, <1, 9, 20>, <1, 25, 19>, <2, 26, 3>, <4, 20, 9>, <4, 7, 16>, <5, 21, 11>, <7, 19, 25>, <8, 1, 9>, <10, 22, 3>, <12, 0, 28>, <13, 14, 17>, <13, 0, 21>, <17, 13, 14>, <19, 12, 25>, <26, 9, 10>, <29, 2, 26>, <7, 16, 4>, <11, 21, 5>, <27, 11, 23>] 

Total number of triangles: [21]
