Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 11) (6, 10) (6, 3) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 19) (1, 17) (1, 9) (1, 0) (17, 1) (17, 4) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 19) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 11) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 4) (13, 16) (13, 9) (2, 15) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 16) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 3) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 4) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 19) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 0) (19, 4) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 11) (11, 5) (11, 15) (11, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) from least to most. Then, for each edge, we proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 19: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 5

Using this ordering, we can now count the triangles by checking the shared connections for each edge. After counting, the total number of triangles is [10], and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 14>, <0, 4, 19>, <0, 17, 4>, <0, 18, 5>, <1, 9, 13>, <1, 9, 11>, <4, 10, 15>, <4, 14, 16>, <4, 18, 14>, <7, 8, 12>.
