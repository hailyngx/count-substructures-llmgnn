Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows:
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 3
Node 0 has degree 5
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 6 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 6
Node 7 has degree 4

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Starting from the edge (1, 9), we skip it because 1 has a higher degree than 9.
2. Moving to the edge (1, 8), we skip it as well for the same reason.
3. Next is the edge (1, 0). Since 1 has a lower degree than 0, we proceed to check for shared connections of 1 and 0.
   The shared connections are 9 and 8, forming a triangle <1, 0, 9>.
4. Continuing to the edge (3, 4), we proceed to check for shared connections of 3 and 4.
   The shared connections are 0 and 6, forming a triangle <3, 4, 0>.
5. The remaining edges do not form any new triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
The unique triangles found are <1, 0, 9> and <3, 4, 0>.
