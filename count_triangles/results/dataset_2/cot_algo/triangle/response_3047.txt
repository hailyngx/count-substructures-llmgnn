Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 18) (2, 8) (2, 5) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 12) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 10) (0, 8) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 6) (19, 3) (19, 8) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 7) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 16) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (12, 15) (12, 18) (16, 14) (16, 9) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 16) (4, 14) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 10), (0, 15)
(1, 10), (1, 11)
(2, 5), (2, 8)
(3, 0), (3, 14), (3, 15), (3, 19), (3, 5)
(4, 6), (4, 14)
(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 15), (5, 18)
(6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 13)
(7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 8)
(8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 7), (8, 17), (8, 19)
(9, 10), (9, 14), (9, 16)
(10, 0), (10, 9), (10, 11)
(11, 1), (11, 10), (11, 13)
(12, 15), (12, 18)
(13, 6), (13, 11), (13, 17)
(14, 3), (14, 4), (14, 9), (14, 16)
(15, 0), (15, 3), (15, 5), (15, 12)
(16, 9), (16, 14)
(17, 8), (17, 13), (17, 18)
(18, 5), (18, 8), (18, 12)
(19, 3), (19, 8)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

Sorted vertices by their number of connections:
1. 1 (degree: 2)
2. 16, 11, 12, 9, 16, 10 (degree: 3)
3. 2, 6, 18, 4, 7, 13, 17, 19 (degree: 4)
4. 0, 5 (degree: 5)
5. 3, 8, 14, 15 (degree: 6)

Counting triangles: 
Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 15>
<0, 10, 15>
<0, 8, 15>
<3, 5, 15>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 10>
<8, 15, 19>
<3, 5, 18>
<4, 6, 14>
<6, 7, 13>
<9, 14, 16>
<10, 11, 13>
