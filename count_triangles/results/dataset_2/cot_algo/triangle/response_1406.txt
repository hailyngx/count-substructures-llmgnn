Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 23) (18, 26) (22, 14) (22, 28) (3, 17) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 4) (25, 3) (25, 12) (25, 10) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 12) (20, 0) (20, 29) (20, 7) (20, 19) (20, 11) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 28) (1, 27) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 4) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 28) (6, 21) (6, 13) (21, 6) (21, 24) (15, 14) (15, 1) (15, 8) (9, 29) (9, 4) (9, 2) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 5) (29, 11) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 12) (5, 26) (5, 29) (5, 8) (5, 27) (12, 25) (12, 0) (12, 2) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 5) (16, 17) (16, 23) (16, 10) (10, 25) (10, 16) (7, 3) (7, 20) (7, 23) (11, 20) (11, 29) (27, 1) (27, 5) (4, 3) (4, 26) (4, 9) (4, 13) (24, 0) (24, 21) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 23) (28, 22) (28, 1) (28, 19) (23, 17) (23, 16) (23, 7) (23, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then, relabel the vertices accordingly and proceed with counting triangles according to the given edges.

After arranging the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are:
0, 1, 5, 6, 9, 26, 24, 2, 8, 12, 29, 4, 13, 3, 15, 20, 16, 17, 19, 22, 25, 27, 7, 10, 11, 14, 18, 21, 23, 28.

After relabeling the vertices, the triangles found are:
<0, 2, 12>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 2, 25>
<0, 5, 15>
<0, 5, 29>
<0, 8, 19>
<0, 12, 2>
<1, 2, 28>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 27>
<2, 8, 19>
<3, 4, 13>
<3, 4, 23>
<3, 7, 20>
<4, 9, 29>
<5, 8, 19>
<5, 25, 12>
<6, 21, 24>
<7, 20, 19>
<13, 23, 6>
<13, 23, 7>
<14, 15, 17>
<14, 17, 22>
<15, 17, 22>
<15, 28, 1>
<17, 16, 23>
<20, 29, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [28].
