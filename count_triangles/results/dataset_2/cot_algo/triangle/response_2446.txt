Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 19) (9, 25) (9, 16) (4, 12) (7, 3) (7, 8) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 27) (22, 6) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 21) (23, 0) (10, 11) (10, 25) (10, 29) (11, 23) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (0, 23) (0, 20) (20, 0) (20, 29) (20, 2) (6, 5) (6, 22) (17, 28) (17, 8) (17, 26) (29, 10) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 3) (21, 22) (21, 23) (21, 13) (28, 17) (28, 24) (28, 25) (26, 22) (26, 17) (26, 8) (2, 20) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 3) (18, 13) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 29) (3, 18) (19, 5) (19, 29) (19, 12) (15, 14) (15, 24) (16, 9) (16, 24) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 13) (24, 28) (24, 15) (24, 16) (24, 14) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (25, 9) (25, 10) (25, 28) (13, 21) (13, 18) (13, 12) (13, 1) (14, 15) (14, 24) (27, 22) (27, 8) (8, 7) (8, 17) (8, 26) (8, 27) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be used to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Based on the edges provided, the sorted list of nodes based on their degrees is as follows:
Nodes: 16, 4, 5, 9, 19, 29, 0, 2, 7, 1, 15, 6, 23, 17, 27, 12, 8, 25, 20, 21, 14, 11, 3, 18, 13, 24, 10, 22, 26, 28 

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle <2, 20, 29> (shared connection with 0, forming a triangle)
- Triangle <28, 17, 26> (shared connection with 8, forming a triangle)
- Triangle <4, 12, 19>

So, the total number of triangles is [3].
