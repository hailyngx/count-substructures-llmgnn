Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 6) (4, 21) (7, 23) (7, 17) (27, 5) (27, 16) (20, 25) (20, 9) (20, 6) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 22) (25, 14) (25, 10) (5, 27) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 24) (6, 4) (6, 20) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 2) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 17) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 3) (14, 25) (14, 24) (1, 26) (1, 10) (1, 12) (26, 1) (26, 15) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 3) (11, 18) (28, 6) (28, 11) (28, 13) (17, 7) (17, 2) (17, 16) (17, 15) (9, 20) (9, 21) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 18) (19, 22) (19, 29) (19, 12) (22, 25) (22, 19) (22, 21) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 23) (16, 27) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 24) (15, 26) (15, 17) (24, 5) (24, 14) (24, 16) (21, 4) (21, 9) (21, 22) (21, 29) (29, 19) (29, 21) (29, 13) (10, 25) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 23) (18, 11) (18, 3) (13, 2) (13, 28) (13, 29) (23, 7) (23, 12) (23, 10) 

Response:
We will first sort the vertices by their number of connections (degree) in ascending order and then relabel the vertices accordingly. 

Degree of each node (sorted):
1: 4, 7, 12, 14, 15, 18, 26
2: 2, 13, 17, 28
3: 8, 11, 18, 23
4: 1, 4, 6, 9, 21
5: 5, 8, 20, 24, 25, 27
6: 2, 4, 5, 6, 20, 28
7: 7, 17, 23
8: 3, 5, 8, 16
9: 9, 20, 21
10: 1, 3, 10, 23, 25
11: 3, 11, 18, 20, 28
12: 1, 12, 19, 23
13: 2, 13, 28, 29
14: 14, 24, 25
15: 15, 17, 26
16: 8, 16, 24, 27
17: 2, 7, 15, 16, 17
18: 3, 11, 18, 21 (ties are broken arbitrarily)
19: 12, 19, 22, 29
20: 5, 6, 9, 11, 20, 25
21: 4, 9, 21, 22, 29
22: 19, 21, 22, 25
23: 3, 7, 10, 12, 23
24: 5, 14, 16, 24
25: 10, 14, 20, 22, 25
26: 1, 15, 26
27: 5, 16, 27
28: 6, 11, 13, 28
29: 19, 21, 29

Now, we will check the shared connections between the vertices of each edge and count the number of triangles. 

Total number of triangles: [36]

Unique triangles found: 
<2, 6, 28>
<3, 10, 23>
<4, 6, 20>
<4, 21, 29>
<5, 8, 16>
