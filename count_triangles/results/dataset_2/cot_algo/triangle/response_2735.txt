Node 7: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 29: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 15: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 18: degree 5
Node 20: degree 5
Node 22: degree 5
Node 21: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5
Node 11: degree 5
Node 25: degree 5
Node 23: degree 5
Node 9: degree 5
Node 13: degree 5
Node 27: degree 5
Node 26: degree 6
Node 16: degree 6
Node 28: degree 6
