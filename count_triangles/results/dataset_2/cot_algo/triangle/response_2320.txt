Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 8

Relabelling the vertices:
Node 6 (Degree 2) - Label 0
Node 2 (Degree 3) - Label 1
Node 4 (Degree 4) - Label 2
Node 7 (Degree 4) - Label 3
Node 1 (Degree 5) - Label 4
Node 3 (Degree 5) - Label 5
Node 8 (Degree 4) - Label 6
Node 9 (Degree 4) - Label 7
Node 0 (Degree 4) - Label 8
Node 5 (Degree 8) - Label 9

Following the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
Triangles found: 
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 2, 4>
3. <0, 3, 7>
4. <0, 4, 8>
5. <1, 2, 5>
6. <1, 4, 7>
7. <1, 5, 9>
8. <1, 6, 2>
9. <2, 3, 5>
10. <3, 4, 7>
11. <4, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [11]
