Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 8) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 11) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 10) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 1) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 4) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:

Nodes: (5, 9, 6, 8, 3, 2, 10, 12, 1, 4, 13, 7, 0, 14, 11)

2. Relabel the nodes accordingly: 
Node 0 -> 1, Node 1 -> 2, Node 2 -> 3, ... , Node 14 -> 15

After relabeling, the edges become:
(1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 13) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 4) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 4) (3, 8) (15, 2) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 7) (4, 12) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 8) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 15) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 10) (15, 3) (15, 11) (15, 12) (15, 14) (2, 9) (2, 15) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 2) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 10)

3. Count the triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles: [40]
