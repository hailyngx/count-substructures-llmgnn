Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows, where the edges are shown connecting the respective nodes:

```
0 -- 1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 5
|    |    |    |    |
7    6    8    9    |
                      4
```

The vertices sorted in ascending order by their number of connections are: 6, 7, 4, 9, 5, 0, 2, 6, 1, 3

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in this graph:

1. Starting with the edge (7, 0):
   - Vertex 7 has fewer connections than Vertex 0.
   - Shared connections with Vertex 0: 1, 5
  
2. Moving to the edge (7, 6):
   - Vertex 6 has fewer connections than Vertex 7.
   - Shared connections with Vertex 7: 0
  
3. Next, the edge (4, 9):
   - Vertex 4 has fewer connections than Vertex 9.
   - Shared connections with Vertex 9: 8
  
4. Considering the edge (5, 8):
   - Vertex 5 has fewer connections than Vertex 8.
   - Shared connections with Vertex 8: 0
  
5. Moving on to the edge (1, 7):
   - Vertex 1 has fewer connections than Vertex 7.
   - Shared connections with Vertex 7: 0

6. Next, the edge (1, 0):
   - Vertex 1 has fewer connections than Vertex 0.
   - Shared connections with Vertex 0: 5

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].

The unique triangles are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <1, 5, 7>.
