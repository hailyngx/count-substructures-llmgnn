Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The sorted nodes based on their degrees are: 

Node 9: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 8: degree 6
Node 0: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph:
- Consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Checking for triangles:
1. Edge: (5, 6)
    Shared connections with vertex 5: {4}
    Shared connections with vertex 6: {1, 3}
    Triangle formed: <4, 5, 6>

2. Edge: (5, 8)
    Shared connections with vertex 5: {4}
    Shared connections with vertex 8: {4}
    Triangle formed: <4, 5, 8>

3. Edge: (5, 4)
    Shared connections with vertex 5: {}
    Shared connections with vertex 4: {3}
    No triangle formed.

[Total number of triangles: 2]
Unique triangles found:
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 8>
