Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 21) (3, 6) (15, 10) (15, 1) (15, 12) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 28) (9, 14) (9, 7) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 2) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 17) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 7) (6, 20) (2, 25) (2, 8) (2, 28) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 24) (14, 20) (17, 8) (17, 29) (17, 1) (29, 17) (29, 21) (22, 4) (1, 15) (1, 25) (1, 17) (1, 23) (1, 12) (21, 3) (21, 25) (21, 6) (21, 29) (7, 9) (7, 6) (26, 28) (26, 18) (28, 9) (28, 2) (28, 26) (28, 20) (16, 4) (16, 19) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 19) (18, 14) (18, 26) (18, 23) (4, 22) (4, 16) (4, 10) (4, 23) (11, 20) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 23) (23, 1) (23, 18) (23, 4) (23, 19) (24, 14) (24, 12) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 24) (20, 6) (20, 14) (20, 28) (20, 11) 

Response:
The graph for the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29

Edges: (3, 25), (3, 21), (3, 6), (15, 10), (15, 1), (15, 12), (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 13), (9, 5), (9, 28), (9, 14), (9, 7), (25, 3), (25, 1), (25, 21), (25, 2), (8, 13), (8, 2), (8, 17), (13, 5), (13, 8), (13, 0), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 21), (6, 7), (6, 20), (2, 25), (2, 8), (2, 28), (0, 13), (0, 14), (14, 9), (14, 0), (14, 18), (14, 24), (14, 20), (17, 8), (17, 29), (17, 1), (29, 17), (29, 21), (22, 4), (1, 15), (1, 25), (1, 17), (1, 23), (1, 12), (21, 3), (21, 25), (21, 6), (21, 29), (7, 9), (7, 6), (26, 28), (26, 18), (28, 9), (28, 2), (28, 26), (28, 20), (16, 4), (16, 19), (10, 15), (10, 4), (10, 19), (18, 14), (18, 26), (18, 23), (4, 22), (4, 16), (4, 10), (4, 23), (11, 20), (19, 16), (19, 10), (19, 23), (23, 1), (23, 18), (23, 4), (23, 19), (24, 14), (24, 12), (12, 15), (12, 1), (12, 24), (20, 6), (20, 14), (20, 28), (20, 11)

After relabeling the vertices based on their degree in ascending order, the new order becomes: 
Nodes: 17, 29, 22, 26, 7, 5, 29, 21, 11, 1, 10, 19, 0, 6, 8, 15, 16, 28, 4, 3, 18, 14, 20, 23, 13, 9, 2, 25, 12, 24 

Calculating the total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles found: <0, 13, 14>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <1, 17, 23>, <1, 15, 12>, <15, 10, 1>, <13, 8, 2>, <4, 10, 23>
