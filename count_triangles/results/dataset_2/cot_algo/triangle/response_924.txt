Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 0) (11, 12) (2, 7) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 18) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 13) (5, 4) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 7) (13, 10) (13, 5) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 5) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (15, 17) (15, 18) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 19) (7, 8) (16, 10) (16, 3) (16, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 18) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 16) 

Response:
The graph has the following edges:
- 0: 6, 9, 11, 18
- 1: 6, 8
- 2: 7
- 3: 5, 16, 18, 19
- 4: 5, 14, 17
- 5: 3, 4, 13, 19
- 6: 0, 1, 7, 9
- 7: 2, 6, 8, 17, 19
- 8: 1, 7, 16
- 9: 0, 6
- 10: 12, 13, 16
- 11: 0, 12
- 12: 10, 11, 14
- 13: 5, 10
- 14: 4, 12, 17
- 15: 17, 18
- 16: 3, 8, 10
- 17: 4, 7, 14, 15
- 18: 0, 3, 15
- 19: 3, 5, 7

Now, let's count the triangles:

We will start with the edge (0, 6):
- Both 0 and 6 have 4 connections each, but 0 (with lower label) will be considered first.
- Check for shared connections: 0 (6, 9, 18) and 6 (0, 1, 7, 9).
- Shared connections between 0 and 6: 9.
- Triangle: <0, 6, 9>.

Moving on to the next edge (0, 9):
- Both 0 and 9 have 4 connections each, but 0 (with lower label) will be considered first.
- Check for shared connections: 0 (6, 9, 11, 18) and 9 (0, 6).
- Shared connections between 0 and 9: 6.
- Triangle: <0, 9, 6>.

Continuing this process for all edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we find all triangles and count them.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
