Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 17) (9, 23) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 20) (26, 16) (3, 14) (15, 27) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 2) (27, 1) (1, 27) (1, 20) (1, 7) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 20) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 17) (2, 27) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 17) (29, 2) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 23) (20, 26) (20, 1) (20, 10) (20, 0) (18, 2) (18, 21) (18, 8) (8, 18) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 7) (13, 26) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 28) (28, 26) (28, 13) (28, 4) (28, 24) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 22) (21, 18) (21, 14) (21, 24) (19, 24) (19, 16) (19, 23) (12, 13) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 14) (16, 26) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 25) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 21) (14, 12) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (4, 28) (4, 5) (6, 11) (25, 0) (25, 8) (25, 16) (25, 22) (22, 7) (22, 25) (24, 28) (24, 21) (24, 19) (23, 9) (23, 0) (23, 19) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
- 0-20, 0-23, 0-25
- 1-7, 1-20, 1-27
- 2-17, 2-18, 2-27, 2-29
- 3-14
- 4-5, 4-28
- 5-8, 5-12
- 6-11
- 7-8, 7-22
- 9-17, 9-23
- 10-11, 10-13, 10-20
- 12-13, 12-14, 12-16
- 13-26, 13-28
- 14-15, 14-21
- 15-27
- 16-19, 16-25
- 17-11
- 18-21
- 19-23, 19-24
- 21-24
- 22-25
- 24-28
- 26-16, 26-20, 26-28

Now, we will sort the nodes by their degree in ascending order:
Nodes by degree:
- Degree 1: 3, 6, 15, 27, 29
- Degree 2: 4, 5, 7, 8, 14, 21, 22
- Degree 3: 0, 1, 9, 12, 18, 19, 23, 24
- Degree 4: 10, 11, 13, 16, 20, 25
- Degree 5: 2, 17, 26
- Degree 6: 28

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Triangles: [42]
Unique triangles: <7, 8, 25>, <4, 5, 8>, <0, 20, 26>, <21, 24, 19>, <0, 20, 1>, <7, 22, 25>, <12, 14, 21>, <0, 25, 16>, <2, 17, 26>, <7, 8, 5>, <13, 26, 16>, <1, 20, 10>, <13, 28, 4>, <12, 16, 25>, <12, 16, 19>, <2, 17, 28>, <4, 28, 24>, <10, 13, 26>, <2, 18, 21>, <10, 20, 1>, <20, 10, 11>, <14, 12, 3>, <13, 12, 14>, <9, 17, 11>, <3, 14, 12>, <21, 14, 12>, <13, 12, 16>, <25, 0, 23>, <26, 16, 19>, <8, 5, 4>, <10, 11, 17>, <28, 26, 16>, <25, 16, 19>, <21, 24, 28>, <11, 17, 2>, <20, 0, 25>, <17, 9, 23>, <0, 20, 23>, <13, 10, 20>, <14, 3, 12>, <14, 21, 24>
