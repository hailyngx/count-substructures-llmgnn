Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 1) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (4, 13) (4, 14) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:

Node 5 has degree 4 \
Node 9 has degree 3 \
Node 8 has degree 4 \
Node 13 has degree 6 \
Node 6 has degree 2 \
Node 2 has degree 4 \
Node 0 has degree 3 \
Node 14 has degree 5 \
Node 7 has degree 5 \
Node 12 has degree 5 \
Node 10 has degree 3 \
Node 11 has degree 4 \
Node 3 has degree 4 \
Node 1 has degree 5 \
Node 4 has degree 2

Using the degree-based ordering method:

1. Consider edge (5, 9):
   Node 5 has connections with nodes 9, 2, 8, and 14
   Node 9 has connections with nodes 5, 10, and 1
   Shared connections between nodes 5 and 9: 1
   Triangle found: <5, 9, 1>

2. Consider edge (5, 2):
   Node 5 has connections with nodes 9, 2, 8, and 14
   Node 2 has connections with nodes 5, 8, 1, and 3
   Shared connections between nodes 5 and 2: 1
   Triangle found: <5, 2, 1>

3. Consider edge (5, 8):
   Node 5 has connections with nodes 9, 2, 8, and 14
   Node 8 has connections with nodes 5, 13, 2, 10, and 3
   Shared connections between nodes 5 and 8: 2
   Triangles found: <5, 8, 2>, <5, 8, 3>

4. Continue this process for all edges.

After considering all edges, the total number of triangles found is [11].
