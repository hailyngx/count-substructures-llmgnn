Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are: 9(2), 2(2), 7(3), 0(4), 5(5), 3(5), 4(5), 1(5), 8(6), 6(6)

The triangles in the graph are: 
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 3, 8>
<4, 1, 8>
<5, 7, 2>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 2, 7>

The total number of triangles is [9].
