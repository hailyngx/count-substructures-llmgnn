Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 27) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 4) (27, 16) (27, 10) (22, 5) (22, 28) (22, 10) (22, 17) (23, 6) (20, 15) (20, 7) (6, 23) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 12) (28, 22) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 4) (28, 14) (21, 28) (21, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 0) (26, 10) (26, 5) (26, 18) (26, 12) (4, 16) (4, 15) (4, 28) (4, 2) (1, 6) (1, 29) (1, 12) (9, 11) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 3) (7, 20) (7, 24) (25, 11) (25, 29) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 10) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 22) (10, 26) (10, 19) (17, 22) (17, 3) (17, 18) (3, 16) (3, 21) (3, 9) (3, 17) (24, 9) (24, 7) (29, 1) (29, 25) (29, 18) (0, 8) (5, 22) (5, 26) (5, 14) (14, 28) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 5) (12, 6) (12, 26) (12, 1) (18, 26) (18, 17) (18, 29) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 8 (degree 4) -> Node 24 (degree 4) -> Node 7 (degree 2) -> Node 17 (degree 4) -> Node 0 (degree 2) -> Node 20 (degree 2) -> Node 21 (degree 2) -> Node 23 (degree 2) -> Node 27 (degree 2) -> Node 29 (degree 4) -> Node 1 (degree 4) -> Node 5 (degree 4) -> Node 6 (degree 6) -> Node 18 (degree 4) -> Node 25 (degree 4) -> Node 2 (degree 2) -> Node 9 (degree 4) -> Node 10 (degree 6) -> Node 12 (degree 4) -> Node 15 (degree 4) -> Node 19 (degree 4) -> Node 22 (degree 4) -> Node 26 (degree 4) -> Node 3 (degree 6) -> Node 16 (degree 6) -> Node 4 (degree 6) -> Node 14 (degree 6) -> Node 11 (degree 6)

There are 17 unique triangles in the given graph:
<2, 8, 0>, <1, 6, 12>, <10, 26, 5>, <6, 23, 28>, <8, 19, 10>, <8, 14, 9>, <9, 3, 17>, <11, 25, 29>, <14, 9, 5>, <15, 20, 7>, <17, 18, 26>, <19, 11, 8>, <19, 10, 15>, <21, 3, 17>, <22, 5, 26>, <22, 10, 15>, <26, 12, 1>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
