Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 3) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 7) (3, 5) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 10) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 4) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 2) (1, 8) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 10) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 1) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 10) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 12) (4, 0) (4, 16) (12, 10) (12, 16) (7, 9) (7, 16) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 7) (16, 2) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 6) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 11) (2, 14) (2, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. Let's organize the nodes by their degree and label them accordingly:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 0, 13, 17, 19: 4 connections
Node 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16: 2 connections
Node 3, 9: 5 connections

So, the labels will be:
Node 5 (Label 0), Nodes 0, 13, 17, 19 (Label 1), Nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 (Label 2), Nodes 3, 9 (Label 3).

Let's list the triangles:
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 15>
<0, 5, 3>
<1, 19, 8>
<1, 19, 10>
<1, 19, 11>
<1, 8, 17>
<2, 8, 10>
<2, 8, 1>
<3, 5, 15>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 17>
<3, 5, 14>
<3, 10, 15>
<3, 10, 9>
<3, 17, 8>
<6, 14, 3>
<6, 14, 11>
<6, 14, 2>
<8, 19, 10>
<9, 15, 10>
<10, 12, 16>

Total number of triangles: [21]
