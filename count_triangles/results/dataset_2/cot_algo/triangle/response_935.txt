Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections they have in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly.

Let's first list the degrees of each node:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4

Based on the degrees, we can relabel the nodes:
Node 6 -> 0     (degree 3)
Node 1 -> 1     (degree 4)
Node 2 -> 2     (degree 4)
Node 8 -> 3     (degree 4)
Node 3 -> 4     (degree 4)
Node 4 -> 5     (degree 4)
Node 0 -> 6     (degree 4)
Node 7 -> 7     (degree 5)
Node 9 -> 8     (degree 4)
Node 5 -> 9     (degree 5)

Next, we will list the edges in the order of sorted labels:
(6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (9, 4) (9, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (0, 5) (0, 1)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the shared connection method:

Total number of triangles: [11]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
