Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The vertices can be relabeled based on their degree as follows:
- Node 0 (degree 3)
- Node 3 (degree 2)
- Node 1 (degree 4)
- Node 8 (degree 3)
- Node 2 (degree 5)
- Node 6 (degree 5)
- Node 4 (degree 4)
- Node 7 (degree 6)
- Node 9 (degree 5)
- Node 5 (degree 4)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and the provided edges, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

[Total number of triangles: 20]

Unique triangles:
