Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are:
Nodes: [3, 1, 8, 2, 6, 5, 7, 4, 9, 0]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 8>
<5, 8, 9>

The total number of triangles is [11].
