Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (22, 26) (22, 12) (3, 1) (3, 8) (15, 17) (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 20) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 19) (1, 0) (26, 22) (28, 14) (28, 20) (10, 21) (10, 9) (21, 10) (21, 0) (25, 27) (25, 0) (25, 4) (27, 25) (27, 7) (27, 23) (7, 16) (7, 27) (7, 29) (7, 20) (0, 1) (0, 21) (0, 25) (0, 4) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 4) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 18) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 29) (18, 8) (29, 7) (29, 18) (29, 19) (29, 23) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 14) (20, 16) (20, 28) (20, 7) (17, 15) (17, 16) (17, 4) (19, 1) (19, 29) (19, 2) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 28) (14, 2) (14, 24) (8, 3) (8, 18) (12, 22) (12, 18) (12, 24) (24, 14) (24, 12) (4, 25) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 23) (23, 27) (23, 29) (23, 4) (5, 11) (5, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Let's first calculate the degree of each node in the given graph:

Degree of each node:
Node 0: 5
Node 1: 5
Node 2: 3
Node 3: 2
Node 4: 5
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 3
Node 7: 4
Node 8: 2
Node 9: 3
Node 10: 2
Node 11: 4
Node 12: 3
Node 13: 3
Node 14: 5
Node 15: 1
Node 16: 6
Node 17: 3
Node 18: 4
Node 19: 3
Node 20: 3
Node 21: 2
Node 22: 2
Node 23: 3
Node 24: 2
Node 25: 4
Node 26: 2
Node 27: 3
Node 28: 2
Node 29: 4

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degree, starting from the node with the least degree:
Degree 1: 15
Degree 2: 3, 5, 8, 10, 21, 22, 24, 26, 28
Degree 3: 2, 6, 9, 12, 13, 17, 19, 20, 23, 27
Degree 4: 7, 11, 18, 25, 29
Degree 5: 0, 1, 4, 14
Degree 6: 16

Now, let's analyze the edges starting from the ones involving nodes with lower labels and count the number of triangles formed:

Triangles found: [26]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 14, 2>, <0, 14, 4>, <0, 25, 27>, <1, 6, 4>, <1, 13, 2>, <4, 17, 23>, <7, 16, 20>, <9, 10, 18>, <14, 24, 12>, <18, 29, 19>, <18, 29, 23>, <19, 2, 29>, <20, 7, 16>, <26, 12, 22>, <27, 25, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [26].
