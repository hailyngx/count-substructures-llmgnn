Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The given graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5

Now, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. First, sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
   Nodes by degree: 2, 3, 8, 0, 9, 1, 7, 4, 6, 5

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   New labels: 0 (2), 1 (3), 2 (8), 3 (0), 4 (9), 5 (1), 6 (7), 7 (4), 8 (6), 9 (5)

3. Now, we will analyze the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
   - For each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we check for shared connections to form triangles.

After analyzing the graph, we find that there are 17 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].

Unique triangles found in the graph are:
<2, 3, 5>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<6, 7, 8>
