Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 5) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 3) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 13) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 12) (3, 13) (3, 9) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 14) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 3 has degree 3
Vertex 7 has degree 4
Vertex 12 has degree 2
Vertex 5 has degree 3
Vertex 6 has degree 4
Vertex 13 has degree 3
Vertex 0 has degree 5
Vertex 4 has degree 5
Vertex 1 has degree 6
Vertex 14 has degree 4
Vertex 8 has degree 5
Vertex 2 has degree 6
Vertex 10 has degree 5
Vertex 11 has degree 5
Vertex 9 has degree 5

Based on the degree-based ordering, we have the following relabeled vertices:
Vertices: 3, 12, 5, 13, 7, 6, 8, 14, 10, 11, 0, 4, 9, 1, 2

Now, let's count the triangles:
We will only count triangles when the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections for each edge.

The total number of triangles is [24].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 0>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 7, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 9, 13>
<4, 9, 14>
<5, 6, 13>
<6, 10, 13>
<6, 13, 5>
<8, 9, 14>
<9, 10, 14>
<9, 13, 10>
