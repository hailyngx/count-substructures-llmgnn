Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges.

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3)
(9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0)
(6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2)
(4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2)
(7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8)
(8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3)
(1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0)
(3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8)
(2, 6) (2, 4)
(0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1)

Now, we sort the vertices based on the number of connections:
0 (Degree: 4), 2 (Degree: 2), 1 (Degree: 3), 6 (Degree: 3), 3 (Degree: 4), 8 (Degree: 4), 7 (Degree: 5), 9 (Degree: 5), 5 (Degree: 4), 4 (Degree: 6)

Using Degree-Based Ordering, we go through the edges considering only cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
