Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 3) (17, 16) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 15) (13, 6) (13, 19) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 18) (16, 17) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (2, 6) (2, 11) (8, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 19) (18, 3) (18, 7) (18, 11) (11, 15) (11, 2) (11, 18) (4, 1) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 13) (19, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. The sorted list of vertices is as follows:  

Node 5, 4, 8, 16, 20, 19, 0, 2, 10, 18, 12, 1, 17, 4, 3, 11, 14, 6, 13, 9, 7, 15 

Now, we will count the number of triangles based on the provided edges and the sorted vertices:

Number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 15>
<0, 6, 13>
<0, 6, 19>
<1, 15, 13>
<6, 13, 19>
