Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 6) (27, 26) (27, 13) (14, 28) (14, 19) (14, 4) (17, 19) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 2) (20, 5) (9, 15) (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 13) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 8) (11, 24) (11, 21) (28, 14) (28, 24) (28, 10) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 20) (7, 0) (7, 26) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 23) (29, 9) (2, 20) (2, 12) (2, 6) (18, 3) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 24) (12, 2) (12, 21) (12, 26) (10, 28) (10, 26) (10, 8) (26, 27) (26, 7) (26, 12) (26, 10) (24, 11) (24, 28) (24, 19) (24, 13) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 23) (21, 11) (21, 12) (21, 5) (21, 4) (3, 0) (3, 18) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 14) (4, 22) (4, 21) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 20) (5, 21) (5, 8) (8, 22) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 5) (23, 1) (23, 16) (13, 27) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 24) (13, 16) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently in a given graph. 

First, let's construct the graph with nodes and edges based on the provided information:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}
- Edges: 
{15, 20} {15, 1} {15, 9} {15, 6} {27, 26} {27, 13} {14, 28} {14, 19} {14, 4} {17, 19} 
{20, 7} {20, 2} {20, 5} {9, 22} {9, 29} {9, 13} {22, 4} {22, 8} {11, 24} {11, 21} 
{28, 24} {28, 10} {0, 7} {0, 3} {7, 26} {1, 16} {1, 23} {29, 9} {2, 12} {2, 6} 
{18, 3} {19, 17} {19, 24} {12, 21} {12, 26} {10, 8} {24, 13} {16, 23} {21, 5} {21, 4} 
{3, 18} {4, 6} {5, 8} {23, 16}

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes in increasing order of degrees: 
{25, 0, 7, 29, 5, 18, 3, 2, 27, 10, 19, 17, 1, 16, 12, 20, 21, 23, 24, 28, 11, 14, 4, 8, 6, 9, 22, 26, 13, 15}

Now, we will go through the list of edges and count the triangles:
Total number of triangles inside brackets []: [4]
Unique triangles found inside <>:
<4, 6, 21>
<4, 12, 26>
<5, 8, 21>
<13, 16, 24>
