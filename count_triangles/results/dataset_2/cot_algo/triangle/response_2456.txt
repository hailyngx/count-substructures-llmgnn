Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 3) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 5) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 4) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 3) 

Response:

Node 3: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 12: degree 5
Node 7: degree 6
Node 2: degree 6
Node 14: degree 6
