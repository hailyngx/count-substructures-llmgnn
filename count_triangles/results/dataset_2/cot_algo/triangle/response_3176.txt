Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 19) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 15) (0, 13) (0, 2) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 17) (10, 4) (10, 15) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 17) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 3) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 1) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (14, 1) (16, 18) (16, 13) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 15) (6, 8) (6, 13) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 14) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 6) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows after sorting the vertices based on their degree:

Nodes: 13, 2, 7, 6, 0, 10, 14, 5, 3, 8, 12, 18, 1, 4, 11, 15, 17, 9, 19, 16
Edges: 
(13, 6), (2, 7), (7, 6), (6, 0), (0, 10), (10, 14), (5, 3), (3, 8), (8, 12), (12, 18), (18, 1), (1, 4), (4, 11), (11, 15), (15, 17), (17, 9), (9, 19), (19, 16), (16, 13), (8, 3), (3, 12), (1, 18), (4, 8), (4, 1), (11, 4), (15, 11), (15, 4), (12, 8), (18, 12), (18, 3), (1, 18), (19, 9)

Number of triangles in the graph: [24]
Unique triangles found: 
<3, 8, 12>, <3, 12, 18>, <4, 8, 12>, <4, 12, 18>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 4, 12>, <1, 4, 18>, <1, 11, 15>, <1, 11, 4>, <1, 11, 4>, <1, 15, 17>, <1, 15, 4>, <1, 17, 15>, <12, 8, 3>, <12, 18, 1>, <12, 18, 3>, <4, 11, 15>, <4, 15, 17>, <4, 15, 11>, <4, 17, 15>, <11, 15, 4>, <15, 17, 4>, <18, 12, 3>
