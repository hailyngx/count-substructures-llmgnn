Response:
Let's start by constructing the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: (11, 16), (11, 0), (11, 5), (11, 26), (11, 2), (16, 11), (1, 21), (1, 29), (1, 14), (1, 19), (21, 1), (21, 23), (21, 18), (21, 25), (21, 22), (5, 11), (5, 9), (9, 5), (9, 15), (9, 17), (9, 10), (18, 21), (18, 12), (22, 21), (22, 17), (20, 25), (20, 0), (20, 29), (20, 4), (25, 21), (25, 20), (25, 6), (25, 28), (25, 24), (13, 26), (13, 12), (12, 18), (12, 13), (12, 27), (12, 28), (27, 12), (27, 14), (27, 3), (27, 23), (0, 11), (0, 20), (0, 3), (15, 9), (6, 25), (6, 7), (28, 25), (28, 12), (26, 11), (26, 13), (26, 10), (29, 1), (29, 20), (29, 24), (19, 1), (19, 2), (19, 7), (23, 21), (23, 27), (2, 11), (2, 19), (10, 9), (10, 26), (10, 4), (10, 14), (3, 27), (3, 0), (3, 17), (3, 14), (3, 4), (17, 9), (17, 22), (17, 3), (17, 4), (14, 1), (14, 27), (14, 10), (14, 3), (7, 6), (7, 19), (24, 25), (24, 29), (4, 20), (4, 10), (4, 3), (4, 17)

Next, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Sort the vertices based on the number of connections:
(15, 7), (16, 1), (13, 2), (24, 2), (5, 2), (26, 3), (22, 2), (23, 2), (27, 4), (17, 4), (18, 3), (19, 4), (21, 5), (28, 3), (29, 4), (6, 2), (2, 2), (25, 5), (0, 3), (12, 4), (3, 5), (20, 4), (9, 4), (14, 4), (4, 4), (7, 2), (10, 4), (11, 5)

2. Proceed with counting triangles:
- Count the triangles and list them in unique form:

Total number of triangles: [63]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 17>, <0, 4, 14>, <0, 4, 17>, <0, 10, 4>, <0, 10, 14>, <0, 11, 16>, <0, 11, 5>, <0, 11, 26>, <0, 14, 1>, <0, 15, 9>, <0, 17, 3>, <0, 17, 4>, <1, 14, 19>, <1, 19, 2>, <1, 19, 7>, <2, 11, 16>, <2, 19, 7>, <3, 10, 4>, <3, 10, 14>, <3, 12, 27>, <3, 14, 10>, <3, 14, 27>, <3, 17, 9>, <3, 17, 4>, <4, 10, 17>, <4, 10, 14>, <4, 12, 17>, <4, 12, 27>, <4, 17, 14>, <5, 11, 16>, <5, 9, 15>, <6, 25, 20>, <6, 25, 28>, <6, 7, 19>, <7, 19, 1>, <9, 15, 17>, <10, 14, 27>, <11, 16, 1>, <11, 16, 5>, <11, 16, 2>, <11, 16, 26>, <11, 5, 9>, <11, 5, 16>, <11, 26, 13>, <12, 17, 22>, <12, 17, 27>, <12, 18, 21>, <12, 18, 22>, <12, 18, 27>, <12, 27, 14>, <13, 26, 10>, <14, 1, 19>, <14, 1, 27>, <14, 3, 17>, <14, 10, 27>, <15, 17, 9>, <17, 9, 15>, <18, 12, 27>, <18, 21, 22>, <19, 1, 14>, <21, 22, 17>, <21, 22, 25>, <21, 23, 27>, <22, 17, 4>, <23, 27, 14>, <25, 20, 29>, <25, 24, 29>, <25, 28, 27>
