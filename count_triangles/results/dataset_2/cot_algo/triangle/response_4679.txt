Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 2) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 13) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph can be labeled as follows based on their degrees:
Node 1: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 12: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 13: Degree 5
Node 11: Degree 5
Node 10: Degree 6
Node 7: Degree 8

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

There are 11 triangles in total:
[11]

The unique triangles are:
<0, 7, 10>
<0, 7, 11>
<0, 7, 13>
<0, 10, 12>
<0, 11, 13>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 12>
<6, 10, 14>
<6, 11, 13>
<7, 10, 11>
<5, 12, 13>
