Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 8), (0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 0), (7, 1), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 1), (3, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 9), (3, 4), (4, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 1), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 9), (1, 4)

Now, let's list the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):

Nodes by degree: 
0 - degree 3
1 - degree 4
3 - degree 5
4 - degree 4
6 - degree 5
8 - degree 4
9 - degree 3
5 - degree 6
7 - degree 5
2 - degree 6

Next, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [10]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 7, 5>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 6, 5>
<4, 6, 5>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<5, 7, 6>
