Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 9) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 19) (4, 12) (18, 14) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (8, 15) (8, 14) (8, 10) (5, 15) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 17) (13, 5) (0, 16) (0, 17) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 10) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 19) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 8) (14, 11) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 9) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 5) (17, 0) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 19) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows these steps:
1. Sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections).
2. Relabel the nodes from 0 to 19 based on their sorted order.
3. For each edge, proceed only if the node with the lower label has fewer connections, which ensures each triangle is only counted once.
4. Check for shared connections between the two nodes of each edge to find triangles.

After sorting the nodes by degree, the updated edge list is as follows:
(3, 1) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 2) (1, 6) (7, 12) (12, 4) (18, 14) (19, 11) (17, 0)

Total number of triangles: [12]
Unique triangles found: <1, 2, 5>, <1, 6, 11>, <1, 6, 14>, <1, 14, 18>, <2, 5, 15>, <4, 12, 17>, <8, 10, 16>, <8, 14, 18>, <11, 12, 19>, <11, 14, 19>, <12, 4, 17>, <14, 18, 8>
