Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 2
Node 1: 3, 0, 8, 7
Node 2: 3, 8, 0
Node 3: 9, 1, 6, 2, 8
Node 4: 5, 9, 8, 0
Node 5: 9, 4, 7
Node 6: 3, 8, 7, 0
Node 7: 5, 1, 8, 6
Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 6, 2, 7
Node 9: 5, 4, 3
```

Calculating the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sorting the vertices by their number of connections:
```
Nodes by degree:
Node 0: 4
Node 2: 3
Node 5: 3
Node 7: 3
Node 4: 4
Node 6: 4
Node 1: 4
Node 8: 6
Node 3: 5
Node 9: 3
```

2. Counting the triangles by examining the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
   - Triangle <0, 1, 3> (shared connection at 1): (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 3)
   - Triangle <0, 4, 8> (shared connection at 0): (0, 4), (0, 8), (4, 8)
   - Triangle <0, 6, 8> (shared connection at 0): (0, 6), (0, 8), (6, 8)
   - Triangle <1, 3, 8> (shared connection at 1): (1, 3), (1, 8), (3, 8)
   - Triangle <3, 4, 5> (shared connection at 4): (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)
   - Triangle <3, 6, 8> (shared connection at 6): (3, 6), (3, 8), (6, 8)

Thus, the total number of triangles is [6].
