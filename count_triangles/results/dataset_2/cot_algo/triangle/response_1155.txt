Now, let's count the number of triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method: 

Vertices sorted by their number of connections: 
Node 10: 1 edge
Node 17: 2 edges
Node 6: 2 edges
Node 7: 2 edges
Node 0: 2 edges
Node 1: 2 edges
Node 20: 2 edges
Node 16: 4 edges
Node 24: 3 edges
Node 19: 3 edges
Node 21: 2 edges
Node 8: 3 edges
Node 28: 3 edges
Node 18: 3 edges
Node 29: 3 edges
Node 15: 2 edges
Node 5: 5 edges
Node 4: 2 edges
Node 25: 3 edges
Node 14: 3 edges
Node 26: 5 edges
Node 23: 3 edges
Node 3: 5 edges
Node 2: 4 edges
Node 22: 5 edges
Node 12: 4 edges
Node 9: 4 edges
Node 11: 3 edges
Node 13: 3 edges

Triangles: [<2, 16, 24>, <4, 22, 14>, <5, 10, 14>, <13, 11, 6>, <14, 6, 11>, <14, 5, 24>, <18, 3, 12>, <18, 3, 28>, <22, 4, 25>]

Total number of triangles: [9]
