Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 20) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 19) (2, 16) (2, 13) (2, 25) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 1) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 21) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (28, 22) (28, 12) (28, 13) (28, 23) (24, 22) (24, 29) (20, 11) (20, 19) (29, 24) (29, 0) (29, 4) (10, 18) (10, 8) (10, 14) (15, 25) (25, 2) (25, 15) (25, 27) (25, 17) (25, 8) (27, 25) (27, 3) (27, 9) (27, 1) (17, 16) (17, 25) (17, 3) (23, 28) (23, 21) (3, 5) (3, 27) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 8) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 22) (22, 28) (22, 24) (22, 14) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 25) (8, 3) (7, 1) (21, 5) (21, 23) (21, 9) (9, 27) (9, 21) (4, 11) (4, 29) (4, 0) (13, 2) (13, 28) (19, 16) (19, 20) (19, 12) (0, 6) (0, 29) (0, 4) (0, 1) (12, 28) (12, 19) (12, 1) (1, 18) (1, 27) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 12) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Based on the given graph, the number of connections for each node is as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 3
- Node 20: degree 2
- Node 21: degree 3
- Node 22: degree 3
- Node 23: degree 2
- Node 24: degree 2
- Node 25: degree 5
- Node 27: degree 4
- Node 28: degree 4
- Node 29: degree 4

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order as follows:
Nodes: 7, 6, 9, 12, 13, 15, 20, 24, 23, 19, 16, 22, 17, 10, 14, 3, 1, 0, 4, 11, 18, 25, 27, 28, 5, 21, 2, 8, 29

Next, we will count the triangles based on the shared connections between the vertices with lower labels:
- Total number of triangles: [8]
- Unique triangles: <1, 27, 14>, <1, 0, 7>, <1, 12, 28>, <1, 18, 10>, <1, 27, 3>, <1, 18, 11>, <14, 22, 28>, <3, 8, 5>
