Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 13) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 8) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (8, 11) (8, 12) (10, 9) (10, 1) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree from least to most are: 5, 10, 8, 14, 11, 0, 3, 1, 6, 2, 13, 12, 4, 7, 9.

Now, we will traverse each edge considering the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections.

After checking each edge, the total number of triangles found is 20.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [20].

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 4, 14>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 12>
<0, 3, 14>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 7, 14>
<2, 0, 11>
<2, 11, 12>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 13>
<4, 7, 13>
<6, 12, 13>
<7, 13, 9>
<8, 11, 12>
<9, 1, 10>
<9, 2, 7>
<9, 2, 13>
<9, 5, 6>
<10, 1, 9>
