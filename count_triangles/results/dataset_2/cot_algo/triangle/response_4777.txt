Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 23) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 2) (14, 28) (14, 16) (17, 20) (17, 23) (17, 11) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 27) (0, 27) (0, 29) (0, 19) (27, 1) (27, 0) (27, 19) (22, 23) (22, 26) (23, 3) (23, 17) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 10) (28, 14) (28, 8) (28, 12) (29, 0) (29, 5) (29, 10) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 21) (13, 1) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 6) (5, 29) (5, 13) (5, 11) (20, 17) (20, 9) (18, 26) (18, 9) (18, 8) (7, 25) (25, 7) (25, 21) (8, 3) (8, 28) (8, 18) (8, 19) (19, 0) (19, 27) (19, 8) (19, 10) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 4) (12, 1) (12, 28) (16, 14) (16, 9) (9, 20) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 2) (6, 15) (6, 13) (2, 15) (2, 9) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 11) (10, 23) (10, 29) (10, 13) (10, 19) (21, 26) (21, 25) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed based on the given nodes and edges. Here is the graph represented with nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: {(3, 15), (3, 1), (3, 23), (3, 8), (3, 4), (15, 6), (15, 4), (15, 2), (14, 28), (14, 16), (17, 20), (17, 11), (1, 13), (1, 12), (1, 27), (0, 29), (0, 19), (27, 19), (22, 26), (23, 17), (23, 22), (23, 26), (23, 10), (28, 12), (29, 5), (29, 10), (26, 13), (26, 18), (26, 21), (13, 5), (5, 11), (20, 9), (18, 9), (18, 8), (7, 25), (8, 18), (8, 19), (19, 10), (11, 4), (12, 28), (16, 9), (9, 2), (6, 13), (2, 9), (4, 11), (10, 29), (10, 19), (21, 25)}

After sorting the nodes based on their degrees, the new node order is as follows:
{7, 16, 2, 5, 7, 25, 0, 4, 6, 8, 11, 6, 6, 8, 12, 9, 1, 6, 15, 10, 13, 13, 7, 8, 13, 8, 10}

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Triangles:
[11]

Unique triangles:
<1, 8, 19>
