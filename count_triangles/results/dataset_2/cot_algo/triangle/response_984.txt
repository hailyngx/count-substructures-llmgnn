Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 13) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 2) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's first sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices:
0: degree 3
1: degree 3
5: degree 3
10: degree 2
6: degree 3
9: degree 4
11: degree 4
13: degree 3
3: degree 5
7: degree 5
12: degree 6
4: degree 5
8: degree 5
2: degree 6
14: degree 6

Now, we will label the vertices in ascending order of their degrees:
0: degree 3
1: degree 3
5: degree 3
10: degree 2
6: degree 3
9: degree 4
11: degree 4
13: degree 3
3: degree 5
7: degree 5
12: degree 6
4: degree 5
8: degree 5
2: degree 6
14: degree 6

Now, we will count the triangles using the sorted labels and the given edges. 

After calculating, the total number of triangles in the graph is [24].

The unique triangles found are:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 11>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 12>
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 7, 12>
<0, 10, 12>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 4, 13>
<1, 11, 2>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 13>
<3, 8, 2>
<4, 8, 2>
<2, 7, 11>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 12>
<7, 12, 2>
<7, 12, 14>
<10, 12, 14>
<7, 11, 2>
<7, 11, 14>
