Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph with the nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 7), (9, 5), (9, 2), (9, 3), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 2), (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 0), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 0), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 4), (7, 8), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 0), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 0), (0, 6), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 2), (0, 8)

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph. 

The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 3, 4, 9, 2, 7, 8, 0, 1, 6, 5

Now, we will check for triangles using the edges and the sorted vertices. 

Triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 0, 6>

Total number of triangles: [8]
