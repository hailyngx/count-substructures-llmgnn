Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 6

Based on the degree-based ordering, we examine each edge in the graph to count the triangles.
After counting, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 8, 7>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 3, 4>
