Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 2, 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 8, 0, 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 8, 0.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 0, 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 7, 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 5, 2, 0.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 2, 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 4, 2, 3.

Next, we sort the nodes by their degrees in non-decreasing order:
Nodes by degree: [1, 4, 3, 5, 8, 0, 9, 2, 7, 6]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we go through the edges in the order provided and count the triangles. 

After counting, the total number of triangles is found to be [28].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 2, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
