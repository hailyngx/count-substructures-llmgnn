Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph based on the provided edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8.

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 8 has degree 2.
- Node 2 has degree 3.
- Node 9 has degree 4.
- Node 1 has degree 4.
- Node 5 has degree 5.
- Node 3 has degree 4.
- Node 8 has degree 2.
- Node 6 has degree 4.
- Node 7 has degree 5.
- Node 0 has degree 4.

Now, we will consider the edges while ensuring that the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

- Investigating edge (1, 2): Triangle found <1, 2, 3>.
- Investigating edge (2, 3): Triangle found <1, 2, 3>.
- Investigating edge (3, 4): Triangle found <3, 4, 5>.
- Investigating edge (3, 5): Triangle found <3, 5, 0>.
- Investigating edge (4, 2): Triangle found <2, 4, 3>.
- Investigating edge (4, 3): Triangle found <2, 3, 4>.
- Investigating edge (4, 5): Triangle found <3, 4, 5>.
- Investigating edge (5, 0): Triangle found <0, 5, 3>.
- Investigating edge (5, 7): Triangle found <5, 7, 0>.
- Investigating edge (5, 8): Triangle found <5, 8, 9>.
- Investigating edge (6, 0): Triangle found <0, 6, 7>.
- Investigating edge (6, 1): Triangle found <1, 6, 7>.
- Investigating edge (6, 4): Triangle found <4, 6, 9>.
- Investigating edge (6, 7): Triangle found <6, 7, 0>.
- Investigating edge (7, 0): Triangle found <0, 7, 5>.
- Investigating edge (7, 1): Triangle found <1, 7, 6>.
- Investigating edge (7, 5): Triangle found <5, 7, 0>.
- Investigating edge (7, 9): Triangle found <7, 9, 1>.
- Investigating edge (8, 9): Triangle found <8, 9, 4>.
- Investigating edge (9, 1): Triangle found <1, 9, 7>.
- Investigating edge (9, 4): Triangle found <4, 9, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [20].
