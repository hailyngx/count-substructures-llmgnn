Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]

Edges:
- 0: [8, 16, 23, 28]
- 1: [7, 10, 16, 21, 27]
- 2: [18, 21]
- 3: [7, 12, 16, 20]
- 4: [8, 10, 15]
- 5: [5, 13, 15, 22, 25]
- 6: [6, 10, 14, 24]
- 7: [3, 7, 9, 20]
- 8: [0, 4, 13]
- 9: [7, 9, 23]
- 10: [1, 4, 6, 10, 11]
- 11: [10, 11, 12, 29]
- 12: [3, 11, 12, 27]
- 13: [5, 8, 13, 19]
- 14: [6, 14, 17]
- 15: [4, 5, 15, 19, 20, 25]
- 16: [1, 3, 7, 16, 23]
- 17: [14, 17]
- 18: [2, 18, 26]
- 19: [13, 15, 19, 24, 25]
- 20: [3, 7, 15, 20]
- 21: [1, 2, 21]
- 22: [5, 22]
- 23: [0, 9, 16, 23]
- 24: [6, 19, 24, 25, 28]
- 25: [5, 15, 19, 25]
- 26: [18, 26, 28, 29]
- 27: [1, 12, 27]
- 28: [0, 24, 26, 28]
- 29: [11, 26, 29]

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
[<2, 18, 26>, <3, 7, 20>, <3, 12, 27>, <3, 16, 23>, <4, 15, 19>, <5, 13, 15>, <6, 14, 17>, <6, 10, 11>, <7, 9, 23>, <13, 19, 25>, <19, 24, 25>, <26, 28, 29>]
Total number of triangles: [12]
