Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the number of triangles in the given graph.

The sorted vertices based on their degree are:
0 (degree 3)
3 (degree 3)
5 (degree 3)
7 (degree 4)
4 (degree 5)
6 (degree 4)
1 (degree 4)
2 (degree 5)
8 (degree 6)
9 (degree 6)

Based on the sorted vertices, we will go through each edge and check for shared connections to count the triangles:

Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 7, 8>
4. <0, 7, 6>
5. <1, 2, 9>
6. <1, 3, 4>
7. <1, 4, 8>
8. <1, 4, 5>
9. <1, 8, 9>
10. <2, 3, 9>
11. <2, 5, 9>
12. <3, 4, 8>
13. <4, 5, 8>
14. <5, 7, 8>
15. <6, 7, 9>
16. <7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [16]
