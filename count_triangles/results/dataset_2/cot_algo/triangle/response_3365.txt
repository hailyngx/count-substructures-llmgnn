Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: {(9, 15), (9, 23), (9, 19), (26, 13), (1, 3), (1, 24), (21, 7), (21, 11), (21, 14), (0, 28), (0, 4), (27, 12), (27, 25), (27, 18), (27, 17), (3, 1), (3, 25), (3, 7), (3, 18), (8, 13), (8, 28), (8, 14), (8, 11), (13, 26), (13, 8), (13, 12), (13, 10), (7, 21), (7, 3), (7, 19), (7, 28), (12, 27), (12, 13), (12, 19), (25, 27), (25, 3), (10, 13), (10, 11), (10, 18), (10, 23), (11, 21), (11, 8), (11, 10), (11, 29), (14, 21), (14, 8), (14, 16), (17, 27), (17, 6), (17, 5), (22, 4), (22, 15), (24, 1), (24, 6), (24, 29), (24, 20), (20, 24), (20, 29), (20, 2), (29, 11), (29, 24), (29, 20), (6, 17), (6, 24), (4, 0), (4, 22), (28, 0), (28, 8), (28, 7), (28, 2), (2, 20), (2, 28), (2, 16), (18, 27), (18, 3), (18, 10), (18, 15), (23, 9), (23, 10), (15, 9), (15, 22), (15, 18), (16, 14), (16, 2), (16, 19), (5, 17), (19, 9), (19, 7), (19, 12), (19, 16)}

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the nodes will be as follows:
{5, 17, 22, 10, 23, 15, 6, 20, 29, 0, 4, 2, 18, 26, 1, 24, 3, 25, 16, 14, 19, 13, 8, 7, 12, 27, 21, 11, 28, 9}

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method and counting the triangles formed by shared connections between vertices, the total number of triangles in the graph is [19].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 8, 28>, <1, 3, 25>, <2, 16, 24>, <2, 16, 19>, <3, 7, 21>, <3, 7, 28>, <3, 18, 27>, <4, 22, 15>, <6, 17, 24>, <7, 19, 12>, <8, 11, 21>, <8, 13, 12>, <8, 14, 21>, <10, 11, 29>, <10, 13, 27>, <10, 18, 27>, <14, 16, 19>, <16, 19, 9>, <18, 27, 12>
