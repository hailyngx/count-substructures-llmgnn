Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 9) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 9) (10, 6) (10, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 9) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 14) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective connections are as follows:
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 6 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 14: 5 connections

With the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start by relabeling the nodes according to their number of connections:
Node 4 -> Node 0
Node 10 -> Node 1
Node 14 -> Node 2
Node 0 -> Node 3
Node 11 -> Node 4
Node 1 -> Node 5
Node 12 -> Node 6
Node 2 -> Node 7
Node 6 -> Node 8
Node 7 -> Node 9
Node 8 -> Node 10
Node 9 -> Node 11
Node 13 -> Node 12
Node 3 -> Node 13
Node 5 -> Node 14

The edges to consider based on the method:
(4, 7), (4, 0), (7, 0), (7, 14), (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 2), (6, 10), (12, 8), (13, 11)

The total number of triangles in the graph: [10]
Unique triangles found: 
<0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 7, 14>, <0, 11, 13>, <4, 7, 14>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 10>, <5, 6, 13>, <5, 9, 13>, <6, 12, 8>
