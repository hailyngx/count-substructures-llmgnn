Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
The nodes and their connections sorted by their degree are:
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 8: 5 connections
- Node 3: 5 connections
- Node 2: 6 connections

Using the degree-based ordering method, we can analyze the edges to count the number of triangles.

The triangles found in the given graph are:
- <5, 2, 7>
- <5, 2, 0>
- <5, 2, 3>
- <5, 7, 2>
- <5, 7, 1>
- <5, 7, 9>
- <5, 7, 0>
- <5, 9, 7>
- <5, 9, 0>
- <5, 9, 8>
- <5, 9, 2>
- <5, 9, 7>
- <5, 9, 0>
- <5, 9, 7>
- <2, 6, 1>
- <2, 6, 3>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <2, 6, 1>
- <2, 6, 3>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <2, 6, 1>
- <2, 6, 3>
