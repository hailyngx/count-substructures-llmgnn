Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 5) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 19) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 18) (11, 8) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 5) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 7) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 17) (4, 10) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 18) (18, 11) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 6) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 17) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 2) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 7) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 5) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 17) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 7) (13, 18) (13, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

The edges are: 
(3, 1), (3, 5), (15, 7), (15, 9), (15, 6), (1, 3), (1, 14), (1, 19), (10, 4), (10, 2), 
(11, 18), (11, 8), (0, 14), (0, 17), (14, 1), (14, 0), (14, 5), (8, 11), (8, 9), 
(8, 7), (9, 15), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 17), (4, 10), (4, 12), (12, 4), (12, 16), 
(12, 18), (18, 11), (18, 12), (18, 19), (18, 13), (19, 1), (19, 18), (19, 16), 
(19, 6), (16, 12), (16, 19), (16, 17), (17, 0), (17, 9), (17, 16), (17, 2), 
(6, 15), (6, 19), (6, 7), (7, 15), (7, 8), (7, 6), (7, 13), (7, 5), (2, 10), 
(2, 9), (2, 17), (5, 3), (5, 14), (5, 7), (13, 18), (13, 7)

Now, let's find the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by their degrees:
Node 16: 2 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 13: 2 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 18: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 15: 5 connections
