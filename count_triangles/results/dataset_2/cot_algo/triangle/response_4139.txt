Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 8) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 0) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 6) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 12) (7, 11) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 12) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 6) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their number of connections and relabeling them accordingly. Let's do that for the given graph:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 3
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 13: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 5

After relabeling based on degree:
Node 7 (Degree 2) -> Node 0
Node 0 (Degree 3) -> Node 1
Node 2 (Degree 3) -> Node 2
Node 9 (Degree 3) -> Node 3
Node 14 (Degree 3) -> Node 4
Node 10 (Degree 4) -> Node 5
Node 5 (Degree 4) -> Node 6
Node 6 (Degree 4) -> Node 7
Node 12 (Degree 4) -> Node 8
Node 8 (Degree 4) -> Node 9
Node 11 (Degree 4) -> Node 10
Node 1 (Degree 5) -> Node 11
Node 4 (Degree 5) -> Node 12
Node 13 (Degree 5) -> Node 13
Node 3 (Degree 5) -> Node 14

Now, let's identify the triangles by examining the edges based on the relabeled nodes:
- Triangle <0, 1, 5> from edges: (10, 6), (10, 8), (6, 8)
- Triangle <0, 1, 12> from edges: (10, 6), (10, 8), (6, 4)
- Triangle <0, 1, 13> from edges: (10, 6), (10, 8), (6, 0)
- Triangle <0, 1, 14> from edges: (10, 6), (10, 8), (6, 13)
- Triangle <0, 3, 5> from edges: (10, 8), (10, 12), (8, 5)
- Triangle <0, 5, 6> from edges: (10, 6), (10, 8), (6, 4)
- Triangle <0, 5, 12> from edges: (10, 6), (10, 8), (6, 13)
- Triangle <0, 6, 12> from edges: (10, 6), (10, 8), (6, 13)
- Triangle <1, 5, 6> from edges: (10, 8), (10, 4), (8, 5)
- Triangle <1, 5, 12> from edges: (10, 8), (10, 4), (8, 5)
- Triangle <1, 5, 13> from edges: (10, 8), (10, 4), (8, 5)
- Triangle <1, 6, 12> from edges: (10, 8), (10, 4), (8, 5)
- Triangle <5, 8, 13> from edges: (8, 5), (8, 13), (5, 13)
- Triangle <6, 12, 13> from edges: (6, 10), (6, 4), (10, 12)

Total number of triangles: [14]
