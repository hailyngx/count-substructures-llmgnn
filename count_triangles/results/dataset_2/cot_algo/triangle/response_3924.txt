Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 10) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 2) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 15) (2, 13) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 18) (12, 8) (16, 8) (16, 18) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 15) (11, 1) (11, 4) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 8) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 19) (19, 1) (19, 15) (18, 12) (18, 16) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 2) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 16) (8, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
- 0: {1, 13, 14}
- 1: {11, 8, 19}
- 2: {6, 10, 13}
- 3: {7, 8, 14}
- 4: {11, 13}
- 5: {6, 9, 12}
- 6: {5, 7, 9, 10, 17}
- 7: {3, 6, 9, 15}
- 8: {1, 3, 8, 12, 16, 17}
- 9: {5, 6, 7, 9, 10}
- 10: {2, 6, 9}
- 11: {1, 4}
- 12: {5, 8, 18}
- 13: {2, 4, 8, 17}
- 14: {0, 3}
- 15: {7, 15, 17, 19}
- 16: {8, 18}
- 17: {6, 8, 13, 15}
- 18: {12, 16}
- 19: {1, 15}

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes Degree: 
- 0: 3
- 1: 3
- 2: 3
- 4: 2
- 3: 3
- 5: 3
- 10: 3
- 11: 2
- 12: 3
- 14: 2
- 6: 5
- 7: 4
- 15: 4
- 16: 2
- 8: 6
- 9: 5
- 17: 4
- 13: 4
- 18: 2
- 19: 2

Counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles is [27].
Unique triangles found: 
<1, 3, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 8, 13>, <1, 15, 19>, <1, 8, 17>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 8, 13>, <3, 7, 15>, <3, 14, 8>, <4, 8, 13>, <4, 11, 13>, <4, 8, 11>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 12, 18>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 10, 2>, <7, 9, 15>, <8, 12, 17>, <8, 16, 18>, <8, 17, 13>, <9, 10, 6>, <9, 7, 15>, <9, 10, 2>, <13, 8, 17>, <15, 7, 17>, <15, 17, 19>, <16, 18, 12>
