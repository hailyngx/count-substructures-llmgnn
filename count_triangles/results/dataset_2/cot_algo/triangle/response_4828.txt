Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 8) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 17) (5, 17) (5, 7) (0, 14) (0, 16) (14, 0) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 10) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 2) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 16) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 11) (8, 12) (16, 0) (16, 17) (10, 19) (10, 7) (10, 4) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 3) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 12) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 11) (3, 17) (3, 18) (1, 2) (1, 11) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 10) (12, 13) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 15) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
I will start constructing the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges based on the information provided. Then, I will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Let's represent the graph as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(6, 7), (6, 15), (6, 8), (9, 18), (9, 15), (9, 11), (9, 17), (5, 17), (5, 7), (0, 14), 
(0, 16), (14, 0), (19, 8), (19, 15), (19, 10), (13, 17), (13, 12), (13, 2), (17, 9),
(17, 5), (17, 13), (17, 3), (17, 16), (8, 6), (8, 19), (8, 11), (8, 12), (16, 0),
(16, 17), (10, 19), (10, 7), (10, 4), (18, 9), (18, 12), (18, 3), (15, 6), (15, 9),
(15, 19), (15, 12), (2, 13), (2, 1), (2, 11), (3, 17), (3, 18), (1, 2), (1, 11),
(11, 9), (11, 8), (11, 2), (11, 1), (11, 4), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 10), (12, 13),
(12, 8), (12, 18), (12, 15), (4, 10), (4, 11)

Now, we will calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

[Total number of triangles: 16]

Unique triangles:
<0, 6, 14>
<0, 6, 16>
<6, 8, 19>
<6, 8, 19>
<3, 12, 18>
<2, 11, 13>
<2, 11, 1>
<4, 10, 11>
<7, 10, 4>
<0, 14, 16>
<6, 7, 5>
<12, 15, 18>
<12, 8, 18>
<12, 15, 8>
<5, 7, 17>
<9, 11, 17>
