Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. 

The vertices in the graph along with their respective degrees are as follows:
- Vertex 0: Degree 3
- Vertex 1: Degree 5
- Vertex 2: Degree 2
- Vertex 3: Degree 4
- Vertex 4: Degree 3
- Vertex 5: Degree 4
- Vertex 6: Degree 4
- Vertex 7: Degree 3
- Vertex 8: Degree 3
- Vertex 9: Degree 2
- Vertex 10: Degree 2
- Vertex 11: Degree 1
- Vertex 12: Degree 3
- Vertex 13: Degree 2
- Vertex 14: Degree 4
- Vertex 15: Degree 4
- Vertex 16: Degree 4
- Vertex 17: Degree 2
- Vertex 18: Degree 5
- Vertex 19: Degree 3
- Vertex 20: Degree 3
- Vertex 21: Degree 4
- Vertex 22: Degree 3
- Vertex 23: Degree 5
- Vertex 24: Degree 3
- Vertex 25: Degree 3
- Vertex 26: Degree 2
- Vertex 27: Degree 3
- Vertex 28: Degree 1
- Vertex 29: Degree 2
