Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 8) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 11) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 14) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 2) (2, 3) (2, 1) (10, 6) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows: 

Node 2: degree 2
Node 10: degree 2
Node 5: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 8: degree 5
Node 14: degree 5
Node 12: degree 5
Node 6: degree 6
Node 4: degree 6
Node 9: degree 8

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now check the edges and count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [52]
