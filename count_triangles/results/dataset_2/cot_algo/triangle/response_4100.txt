Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 10) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 10) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 12) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 
(0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) 
(1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 10) 
(2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 7) 
(3, 10) (3, 12) 
(4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) 
(5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) 
(6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) 
(7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) 
(8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
(9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) 
(10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 12) 
(11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 7) 
(12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 10) 
(13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 11) 
(14, 1) (14, 4) 

Now, let's list the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order: 
Nodes by degree: 
3, 14, 8, 7, 10, 9, 1, 5, 13, 4, 2, 11, 0, 12, 6

Now, we will count the triangles:
