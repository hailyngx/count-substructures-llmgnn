Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 13) (10, 7) (10, 1) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 13) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 16) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 12) (0, 3) (0, 18) (16, 13) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 0) (7, 10) (7, 11) (14, 5) (14, 15) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 15) (4, 17) (4, 1) (4, 19) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 14) 

Response:
The vertices' degrees are as follows:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 2
Node 11: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 3
Node 16: degree 1
Node 17: degree 3
Node 18: degree 5
Node 19: degree 4

The vertices sorted by degree are: 16, 0, 7, 8, 10, 1, 2, 3, 6, 14, 15, 17, 9, 11, 12, 13, 4, 5, 19, 18

Counting the number of triangles:

- From vertices with degree 1 (node 16): no triangles possible
- From vertices with degree 2 (nodes 0, 7, 8, 10): no triangles possible
- From vertices with degree 3 (nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, 14, 15, 17): no triangles possible
- From vertices with degree 4 (nodes 9, 11, 12, 13, 4, 5, 19): triangles possible
- From vertex with degree 5 (node 18): triangles possible

Calculating the total number of triangles:
- Triangles involving vertices with degree 4: 8 triangles
- Triangles involving vertex 18 (degree 5): 9 triangles

Thus, the total number of triangles is [8 + 9 = 17].

The unique triangles found are: 
<4, 5, 13>, <4, 5, 18>, <4, 5, 14>, <4, 13, 16>, <4, 13, 9>, <4, 13, 11>, <4, 19, 15>, <4, 19, 12>, <4, 19, 18>, <5, 13, 16>, <5, 13, 9>, <5, 13, 11>, <13, 9, 11>, <13, 5, 18>, <13, 5, 14>, <19, 15, 14>, <19, 15, 2>.
