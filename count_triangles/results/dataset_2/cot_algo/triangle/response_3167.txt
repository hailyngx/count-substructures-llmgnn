Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 9), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 7), (1, 6), (1, 2), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 8), (2, 0), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 8), (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 7), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 4), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 3), (7, 0), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 4), (8, 2), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 7), (9, 0)

Now let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

0: degree 4
1: degree 2
3: degree 3
7: degree 4
6: degree 4
4: degree 4
8: degree 4
5: degree 5
2: degree 6
9: degree 5

Using the degree-based ordering, we rearrange the nodes as follows:
1 → 1
3 → 3
0 → 4
7 → 5
6 → 6
4 → 7
8 → 8
5 → 9
2 → 10
9 → 11

Now, let's count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 7]

<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 8, 4>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 8, 5>
<4, 5, 8>
