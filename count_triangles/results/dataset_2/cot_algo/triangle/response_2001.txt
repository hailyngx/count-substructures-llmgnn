Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Nodes sorted by their number of connections are: 
Node 9 (degree 7), Node 1 (degree 6), Node 4 (degree 5), Node 7 (degree 5), Node 2 (degree 4), Node 5 (degree 4), Node 6 (degree 3), Node 0 (degree 3), Node 8 (degree 3), Node 3 (degree 2).

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles forming from the given edges:

Triangles found: <1, 4, 9>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 1, 4>, <4, 5, 7>

Output: [7]
