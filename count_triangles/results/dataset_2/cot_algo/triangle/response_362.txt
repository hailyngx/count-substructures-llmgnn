Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
Following the instructions, let's sort the vertices by their degree:

Degree of each vertex:
0: 6 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 3 connections
3: 5 connections
4: 5 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 5 connections
8: 3 connections
9: 5 connections

Now, relabel the vertices accordingly:
0 → 2 connections
1 → 0 connections
2 → 0 connections
3 → 2 connections
4 → 2 connections
5 → 1 connection
6 → 1 connection
7 → 2 connections
8 → 0 connections
9 → 2 connections

Now, we will count the triangles:
- For the edge (0, 6), proceed as 0 < 6 and 0 has fewer connections. Shared connections: 0.
- For the edge (0, 9), proceed as 0 < 9 and 0 has fewer connections. Shared connections: 0.
- For the edge (0, 3), proceed as 0 < 3 and 0 has fewer connections. Shared connections: 0.
- For the edge (0, 4), proceed as 0 < 4 and 0 has fewer connections. Shared connections: 0.

So far, we have found 4 triangles with vertices {0, 6, 9}, {0, 3, 9}, {0, 3, 4}, and {0, 4, 6}.

After counting all triangles, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are: <0, 6, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 4>, and <0, 4, 6>.
