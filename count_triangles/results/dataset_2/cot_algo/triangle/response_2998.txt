Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows: 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 11), (9, 4), (9, 14), (9, 1), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 0), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 14), (1, 13), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (10, 0), (10, 8), (10, 7), (10, 13), (11, 5), (11, 7), (11, 0), (11, 8), (11, 4), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 12), (7, 14), (12, 7), (12, 2), (12, 13), (0, 6), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 14), (0, 13), (0, 2), (14, 9), (14, 1), (14, 7), (14, 0), (2, 6), (2, 3), (2, 12), (2, 0), (2, 8), (8, 5), (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 2), (4, 9), (4, 11), (13, 1), (13, 10), (13, 12), (13, 0)

Next, let's use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph.

Vertices sorted by degree (least to most):
Vertices with 1 connection: 4, 5, 12, 13
Vertices with 2 connections: 3, 7, 12, 14
Vertices with 3 connections: 2, 4, 8, 9, 10
Vertices with 4 connections: 0, 11
Vertices with 5 connections: 1, 6

Triangles found: 
[30]
Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 13>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 7, 11>, <0, 7, 14>, <0, 8, 11>, <0, 9, 14>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 11>, <1, 6, 3>, <1, 6, 13>, <1, 7, 11>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 8, 11>, <3, 6, 13>, <4, 9, 11>, <7, 11, 14>, <9, 13, 14>, <10, 13, 14>, <10, 11, 13>, <10, 0, 11>
