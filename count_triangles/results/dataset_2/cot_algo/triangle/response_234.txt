Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) 

Response:
Sorted vertices by their degrees are as follows:
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 5: 6 connections

With the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can list the triangles as follows:
