Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- 0: {3, 7, 8}
- 1: {4, 5, 8}
- 2: {5, 9}
- 3: {0, 6, 9}
- 4: {1, 6, 7}
- 5: {1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- 6: {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- 7: {0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- 8: {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}
- 9: {2, 3, 5, 7}

Degree-Based Ordering:
0: degree(3) <br>
1: degree(3) <br>
2: degree(2) <br>
3: degree(3) <br>
4: degree(3) <br>
5: degree(6) <br>
6: degree(5) <br>
7: degree(5) <br>
8: degree(5) <br>
9: degree(4) <br>
