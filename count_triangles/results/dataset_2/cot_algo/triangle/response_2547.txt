Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (7), (8), (5), (9)
- 1: (4), (3), (9)
- 2: (7), (3), (5), (9)
- 3: (1), (6), (9), (2), (5)
- 4: (7), (1)
- 5: (7), (3), (8), (2), (0)
- 6: (7), (3)
- 7: (4), (0), (6), (2), (5), (8)
- 8: (7), (9), (5), (0)
- 9: (1), (3), (8), (0), (2)

Now, by counting the connections for each node:
0 (4), 1 (3), 2 (4), 3 (5), 4 (2), 5 (5), 6 (2), 7 (6), 8 (4), 9 (5)

Reorder the nodes based on the number of connections:
Nodes in order: 4, 6, 1, 8, 0, 2, 9, 5, 3, 7

When examining the edges, we find the following triangles:
- <7, 0, 5>
- <7, 0, 8>
- <7, 2, 5>
- <7, 2, 9>

Total number of triangles: [4]
