Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 10) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 11) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 11) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 1) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding degrees are as follows:
0: 3
1: 4
2: 3
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 4
7: 4
8: 3
9: 6
10: 3
11: 5
12: 3
13: 4
14: 4

Now, by sorting the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order, we get the following relabeling:
0, 2, 8, 10, 12
1, 4, 6, 7, 13, 14
3, 11
5, 9

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in this graph:
The total number of triangles is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 4, 14>
<3, 7, 11>
<3, 10, 12>
<3, 11, 14>
<3, 11, 4>
<5, 6, 9>
