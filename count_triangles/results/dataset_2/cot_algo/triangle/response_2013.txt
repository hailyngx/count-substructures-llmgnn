Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 15) (9, 6) (9, 16) (9, 12) (4, 19) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 11) (0, 6) (0, 17) (0, 5) (14, 2) (14, 13) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 13) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 18) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 18) (17, 0) (17, 1) (19, 4) (19, 7) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 16) (7, 2) (16, 9) (16, 7) (16, 12) (12, 9) (12, 16) (10, 13) (10, 2) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 10) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are as follows:
Vertices: 5 1 10 4 19 12 17 0 8 6 16 18 3 2 14 7 9 11 13 15

The triangles in the graph are:
