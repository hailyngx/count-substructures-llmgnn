The sorted nodes based on their degrees are:   
Node 5: degree 2  
Node 19: degree 3   
Node 8: degree 3   
Node 7: degree 3    
Node 0: degree 3   
Node 12: degree 3   
Node 17: degree 3   
Node 6: degree 4   
Node 1: degree 4   
Node 4: degree 4   
Node 10: degree 4  
Node 18: degree 4  
Node 2: degree 4  
Node 3: degree 4  
Node 11: degree 4  
Node 13: degree 4  
Node 15: degree 4   
Node 14: degree 5   
Node 16: degree 5  
Node 9: degree 7
