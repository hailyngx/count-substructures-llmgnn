Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 11) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 8) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 14) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 8) (3, 10) (13, 11) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the nodes and edges provided. Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by degree:
(3) - 1 connection
(9) - 1 connection
(13) - 1 connection
(7) - 4 connections
(13) - 1 connection
(6) - 3 connections
(5) - 5 connections
(0) - 5 connections
(14) - 4 connections
(4) - 5 connections
(8) - 4 connections
(12) - 5 connections
(2) - 5 connections
(1) - 6 connections
(10) - 6 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check the edges considering the lower labeled vertex first.

Number of triangles [17]:
