Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 13) (5, 6) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 13) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows: 

Nodes: 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 
(6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 4), (6, 0), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 7), (1, 3), (1, 12), (1, 7), (3, 10), (10, 11), (10, 7), (11, 13), (5, 7), (0, 14), (0, 12), (0, 8), (14, 13), (2, 8), (2, 13), (2, 7), (8, 14), (8, 12), (4, 13), (7, 10)

Next, let's label the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order. 

Labeling: 
Node 5 (degree 2) -> Node 11 (degree 2) -> Node 2 (degree 3) -> Node 12 (degree 3) -> Node 13 (degree 3) -> Node 15 (degree 3) -> Node 0 (degree 4) -> Node 8 (degree 4) -> Node 10 (degree 4) -> Node 7 (degree 5) -> Node 1 (degree 5) -> Node 3 (degree 5) -> Node 9 (degree 5) -> Node 6 (degree 6) -> Node 4 (degree 6)

Now, we will calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. For each edge, we will consider only cases where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.
2. We will count the number of triangles formed.

After counting, we find that the total number of triangles in the given graph is [24].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 14>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 8, 14>, <0, 12, 1>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 10>, <2, 7, 13>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 13>, <4, 9, 3>, <4, 9, 7>, <6, 8, 12>, <7, 9, 10>, <7, 9, 13>, <7, 10, 13>, <8, 12, 0>, <8, 12, 14>.
