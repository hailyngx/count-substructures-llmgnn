Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 3) (4, 11) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 13) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```plaintext
0: [9, 11, 7, 14]
1: [11, 7, 12, 2, 8]
2: [9, 10, 8, 1, 14]
3: [6, 12, 13, 8, 14]
4: [11]
6: [9, 14, 10, 3, 12]
7: [10, 12, 0, 1, 8]
8: [11, 7, 2, 14, 3, 1]
9: [6, 2, 0]
10: [6, 11, 7, 2]
11: [10, 1, 0, 13, 8, 4]
12: [6, 7, 13, 1]
13: [11, 12, 3]
14: [6, 2, 8, 0, 3]
```

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <0, 2, 14>
3. <0, 7, 11>
4. <0, 7, 14>
5. <1, 2, 8>
6. <1, 7, 12>
7. <2, 8, 14>
8. <6, 9, 14>
9. <10, 11, 7>
10. <1, 8, 11>
11. <3, 8, 14>
12. <6, 10, 11>
13. <6, 10, 7>
14. <6, 12, 7>

Total number of triangles: [14]
