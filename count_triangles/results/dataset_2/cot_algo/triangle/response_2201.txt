Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 5) 

Response:
The graph with vertices labeled by their degrees is as follows:
Vertices: 6, 1, 9, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 2, 0
Degrees: 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4

After sorting the vertices by their degree-based ordering and relabeling them:
Vertices: 6, 1, 7, 8, 0, 4, 5, 2, 3, 9

Now, let's count the number of triangles by checking shared connections between edges:
1. (6, 1) - Shared connections: None
2. (6, 2) - Shared connections: None
3. (6, 0) - Shared connections: None
4. (9, 8) - Shared connections: None
5. (9, 4) - Shared connections: (4, 8)
6. (9, 3) - Shared connections: None
7. (9, 7) - Shared connections: None
8. (1, 6) - Shared connections: None
9. (1, 3) - Shared connections: None
10. (1, 2) - Shared connections: None
11. (3, 9) - Shared connections: None
12. (3, 7) - Shared connections: None
13. (3, 4) - Shared connections: (4, 7)
14. (4, 9) - Shared connections: None
15. (4, 7) - Shared connections: None
16. (4, 8) - Shared connections: None
17. (4, 5) - Shared connections: None
18. (7, 9) - Shared connections: None
19. (7, 3) - Shared connections: None
20. (7, 4) - Shared connections: None
21. (7, 0) - Shared connections: None
22. (8, 9) - Shared connections: None
23. (8, 4) - Shared connections: None
24. (8, 2) - Shared connections: None
25. (8, 5) - Shared connections: None
26. (5, 4) - Shared connections: (4, 8)
27. (5, 8) - Shared connections: None
28. (5, 2) - Shared connections: None
29. (5, 0) - Shared connections: None
30. (2, 6) - Shared connections: None
31. (2, 1) - Shared connections: None
32. (2, 3) - Shared connections: None
33. (2, 8) - Shared connections: None
34. (2, 5) - Shared connections: None
35. (0, 6) - Shared connections: None
36. (0, 7) - Shared connections: None
37. (0, 5) - Shared connections: None

Total number of triangles within brackets []: [2]
Unique triangles found inside <>: <3, 4, 5>, <4, 2, 8>
