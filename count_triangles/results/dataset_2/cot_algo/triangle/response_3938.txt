Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 16) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 17) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 3) (3, 8) (3, 5) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 19) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 1) (15, 7) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 12) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 18) (16, 4) (1, 2) (1, 19) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 1) (13, 14) (13, 9) (13, 18) (13, 6) (9, 13) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 6) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 18) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 13) (6, 12) (18, 16) (18, 13) (18, 17) (4, 16) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (0, 16), (1, 2), (1, 10), (1, 12), (1, 19), (2, 5), (2, 17), (3, 5), (3, 8), (4, 16), (5, 7), (6, 8), (6, 12), (6, 13), (7, 11), (7, 15), (8, 10), (9, 13), (10, 14), (10, 19), (11, 14), (11, 19), (11, 7), (12, 15), (13, 14), (13, 18), (15, 16), (16, 18), (16, 15), (16, 0), (17, 2), (17, 18)

We will now sort the nodes based on their degrees:

0: 1
9: 1
4: 1
12: 1
18: 3
19: 4
13: 4
3: 4
17: 3
14: 5
7: 5
5: 5
6: 5
15: 4
10: 5
2: 4
8: 4
11: 5
1: 5
16: 5

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 18]
<1, 10, 19>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 17>
<1, 12, 15>
<1, 12, 6>
<1, 12, 15>
<1, 13, 14>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 15, 16>
<2, 17, 18>
<5, 15, 16>
<5, 7, 11>
<5, 7, 15>
<5, 6, 13>
<7, 11, 15>
<10, 14, 11>
<10, 14, 13>
