Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 5) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 14) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 14) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: 10, 12, 5
- 1: 8, 12, 4
- 2: 10, 12, 4, 14
- 3: 11, 7, 5, 9
- 4: 13, 5, 2, 9, 1
- 5: 10, 13, 4, 0, 3
- 6: 8, 13
- 7: 11, 9, 3
- 8: 11, 13, 6, 1
- 9: 11, 7, 4, 14
- 10: 11, 0, 12, 2, 5, 14
- 11: 10, 3, 14, 9, 8
- 12: 10, 2, 0, 1
- 13: 8, 5, 4, 6
- 14: 10, 11, 2, 9

After sorting the nodes by their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes: 1, 6, 7, 0, 9, 13, 3, 4, 2, 8, 12, 5, 14, 10, 11

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can find the number of triangles in the graph. 

The total number of triangles is [56].

The unique triangles found are:
- <0, 2, 10>
- <0, 2, 12>
- <0, 2, 14>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 12>
- <0, 5, 10>
- <0, 5, 12>
- <0, 5, 13>
- <0, 10, 12>
- <0, 10, 14>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <2, 4, 13>
- <2, 4, 14>
- <2, 9, 11>
- <2, 9, 14>
- <2, 13, 14>
- <4, 5, 13>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <4, 9, 11>
- <4, 9, 14>
- <5, 10, 13>
- <5, 13, 14>
- <10, 11, 14>
- <10, 12, 14>
- <11, 13, 14>
