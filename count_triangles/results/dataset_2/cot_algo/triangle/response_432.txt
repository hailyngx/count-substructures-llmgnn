Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 10) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 2) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 13) 

Response:
The given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 10), (1, 13), (2, 14), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 13), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 11), (4, 14), (5, 7), (5, 10), (5, 11), (6, 8), (6, 10), (6, 11), (6, 12), (7, 8), (7, 10), (7, 3), (8, 14), (8, 3), (9, 10), (9, 12), (9, 13), (9, 14), (10, 12), (11, 13), (12, 6)

Next, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes sorted by degree: 2, 0, 5, 9, 12, 14, 6, 2, 11, 8, 1, 3, 13, 7, 4

Now, we'll label the nodes from 0 to 14 based on their positions in the sorted list.

Nodes with labels: 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Now, we will check for triangles where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 10>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 11>, <0, 4, 14>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 10>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 6, 10>, <1, 6, 11>, <1, 10, 12>, <2, 9, 14>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 13>, <3, 8, 14>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 10>, <4, 7, 3>, <4, 8, 14>, <4, 11, 13>, <6, 8, 10>, <6, 11, 13>

Total number of triangles: [25]
