Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 15) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 9) (3, 16) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (10, 12) (10, 19) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 12) (18, 4) (18, 0) (18, 12) (5, 16) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 16) (13, 5) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 19) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 9) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 18) (2, 14) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 6) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 6) (6, 14) (6, 0) (15, 16) (15, 0) (17, 8) (17, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to efficiently count triangles in a graph. Let's go through the process step by step.

**Step 1: Create the graph**
- Construct a graph with 20 nodes and the given 60 edges.

**Step 2: Sort vertices by their degree (number of connections)**
- List the vertices with their degrees:  
  (0: 6 connections),  
  (1: 3 connections),  
  (2: 2 connections),  
  (3: 6 connections),  
  (4: 4 connections),  
  (5: 4 connections),  
  (6: 2 connections),  
  (7: 2 connections),  
  (8: 5 connections),  
  (9: 4 connections),  
  (10: 3 connections),  
  (11: 2 connections),  
  (12: 4 connections),  
  (13: 3 connections),  
  (14: 4 connections),  
  (15: 3 connections),  
  (16: 7 connections),  
  (17: 2 connections),  
  (18: 4 connections),  
  (19: 5 connections).  

**Step 3: Relabel the vertices based on their degrees**
- The vertices will be relabeled as follows:  
  (0: 1),  
  (1: 5),  
  (2: 9),  
  (3: 2),  
  (4: 7),  
  (5: 8),  
  (6: 10),  
  (7: 11),  
  (8: 4),  
  (9: 6),  
  (10: 3),  
  (11: 12),  
  (12: 9),  
  (13: 11),  
  (14: 7),  
  (15: 10),  
  (16: 13),  
  (17: 12),  
  (18: 7),  
  (19: 4).

**Step 4: Count the triangles**
- Starting from the edge with the lower labeled vertex, we will count triangles formed by shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.
- After counting, the total number of triangles is found to be [5].

**Unique triangles found:**
<0, 3, 16>,  
<0, 4, 18>,  
<0, 6, 14>,  
<0, 8, 19>,  
<14, 6, 0>.
