Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 6) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 14) (9, 0) (9, 14) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 0) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 
- (4, 0), (4, 14), (4, 2), 
- (7, 11), (7, 10), (7, 5), (7, 8), 
- (1, 6), (1, 11), (1, 2), (1, 12), 
- (3, 0), (3, 14), (3, 13), (3, 5), (3, 8), 
- (8, 7), (8, 3), (8, 13), (8, 6), (8, 12), 
- (13, 3), (13, 8), (13, 2), (13, 6), 
- (10, 7), (10, 12), (10, 2), 
- (11, 7), (11, 1), (11, 6), 
- (5, 7), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 14), 
- (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 13), (6, 11), (6, 5), 
- (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 12), (0, 9), 
- (14, 4), (14, 3), (14, 5), (14, 9), (14, 2), 
- (2, 4), (2, 1), (2, 13), (2, 10), (2, 14), 
- (9, 0), (9, 14), 
- (12, 1), (12, 8), (12, 10), (12, 0)

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph.
