Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 12) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 14) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 5) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to determine the vertices with the least to most connections:

Vertices with their corresponding degrees:
0 (3), 1 (4), 2 (4), 3 (4), 4 (3), 5 (4), 6 (3), 7 (5), 8 (3), 9 (4), 10 (4), 11 (5), 12 (3), 13 (4), 14 (3)

Now, we will label the vertices in ascending order of degrees:
0 -> 0, 4 -> 1, 8 -> 2, 12 -> 3, 6 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6, 14 -> 7, 3 -> 8, 9 -> 9, 10 -> 10, 5 -> 11, 13 -> 12, 7 -> 13, 11 -> 14

Next, we will examine each edge by making sure the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

Triangles found by examining the edges:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 6, 10>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 13>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 6, 13>
<3, 8, 13>
<4, 5, 11>
<4, 9, 13>
<5, 7, 11>
<9, 10, 11>
<9, 11, 12>

Total number of triangles: [13]
