Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 14) (1, 3) (1, 16) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 19) (4, 2) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 17) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 16) (15, 8) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 14) (7, 16) (7, 17) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 10) (16, 7) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 19) (6, 2) (6, 17) (6, 0) (17, 18) (17, 7) (17, 6) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (12, 8) (12, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degrees. The sorted nodes and their degrees are as follows:
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 1
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 5
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 5

Now, we will count the triangles by considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
- <5, 16, 1>
- <9, 14, 11>
- <3, 8, 13>
- <3, 16, 1>
- <3, 16, 10>
- <8, 18, 19>
- <18, 19, 13>

Total number of triangles: [7]
