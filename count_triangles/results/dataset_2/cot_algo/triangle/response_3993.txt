Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 17) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 17) (9, 6) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 13) (5, 16) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 14) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 1) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 19) (13, 9) (13, 5) (19, 12) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 0) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 18) (1, 10) (14, 5) (10, 3) (10, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 17) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
(11, 16), (11, 7), (11, 1), (11, 6), (16, 1), (16, 5), 
(3, 15), (3, 7), (3, 10), (3, 6), (3, 2), (15, 17), 
(6, 9), (6, 17), (9, 5), (9, 18), (9, 13), (5, 13), 
(5, 8), (5, 14), (2, 18), (2, 0), (18, 1), (4, 8), 
(8, 7), (8, 12), (7, 12), (7, 19), (7, 3), (7, 10), 
(12, 19), (13, 19), (13, 5), (19, 17), (17, 0), 
(10, 1), (0, 17)

After sorting the nodes based on their degrees and relabeling them accordingly, the new ordering is:
0(3), 4(3), 10(3), 14(3), 19(4), 2(4), 5(5), 8(5), 12(5), 18(5), 1(5), 15(6), 16(6), 6(6), 9(6), 13(6), 3(6), 17(6), 11(6), 7(7)

Following the degree-based ordering method to count triangles, we proceed with the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

Calculating the number of triangles and listing unique triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 3]
<5, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <0, 2, 18>
