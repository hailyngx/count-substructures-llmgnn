Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows:
```
0----7----2
|\       |\
| \      | \
|  9--4--8 5
| /|     | /
|/ |     |/
3--1-----6
```

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their degrees:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 5

Based on the sorted vertices, we only proceed with edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. By doing so, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <0, 7, 4>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <2, 7, 4>
- <5, 8, 1>
- <5, 8, 2>
- <5, 8, 6>
- <7, 4, 9>
- <7, 4, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
