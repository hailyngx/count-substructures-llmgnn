Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and their connections based on the provided edges:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Node connections (Edges):
0: (1), (7)
1: (5), (3), (4), (0), (7)
2: (5), (6), (3), (4)
3: (6), (1), (4), (2)
4: (5), (9), (1), (3), (2)
5: (2), (8), (1), (4)
6: (9), (7), (3), (2), (8), (5)
7: (6), (1), (8), (0)
8: (5), (9), (6), (7)
9: (6), (8), (4)

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections):
Nodes sorted by degree:
0: deg(2)
7: deg(4)
9: deg(4)
2: deg(4)
8: deg(4)
5: deg(4)
3: deg(4)
1: deg(5)
4: deg(5)
6: deg(6)

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 6]

<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
