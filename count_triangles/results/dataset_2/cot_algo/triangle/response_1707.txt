Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently. First, let's organize the vertices based on their degrees. 

Vertex: 0, Degree: 2
Vertex: 1, Degree: 3
Vertex: 2, Degree: 2
Vertex: 3, Degree: 4
Vertex: 4, Degree: 5
Vertex: 5, Degree: 3
Vertex: 7, Degree: 4
Vertex: 8, Degree: 4
Vertex: 9, Degree: 3
Vertex: 10, Degree: 4
Vertex: 11, Degree: 4
Vertex: 12, Degree: 4
Vertex: 13, Degree: 3
Vertex: 14, Degree: 2
Vertex: 15, Degree: 2
Vertex: 16, Degree: 4
Vertex: 17, Degree: 4
Vertex: 18, Degree: 4
Vertex: 19, Degree: 5
Vertex: 20, Degree: 2
Vertex: 21, Degree: 3
Vertex: 22, Degree: 2
Vertex: 23, Degree: 4
Vertex: 24, Degree: 3
Vertex: 25, Degree: 4
Vertex: 26, Degree: 2
Vertex: 27, Degree: 4
Vertex: 28, Degree: 3
Vertex: 29, Degree: 4

Now, let's count the triangles by looking at the edges and the shared connections between vertices:
