Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 14) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (12, 3) (12, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 5 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 1
Node 9 has degree 7
Node 4 has degree 5
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 14 has degree 5
Node 0 has degree 5
Node 1 has degree 5
Node 3 has degree 6
Node 10 has degree 2
Node 11 has degree 5
Node 7 has degree 5
Node 8 has degree 5
Node 12 has degree 2
Node 13 has degree 4

Based on the sorting, the new labels for the nodes are:
Node 6 (degree 1) < Node 10 (degree 2) < Node 12 (degree 2) < Node 13 (degree 4) < Node 2 (degree 4) < Node 5 (degree 3) < Node 0 (degree 5) < Node 1 (degree 5) < Node 4 (degree 5) < Node 7 (degree 5) < Node 8 (degree 5) < Node 11 (degree 5) < Node 14 (degree 5) < Node 3 (degree 6) < Node 9 (degree 7)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

1. Edge (5, 9): Both nodes have higher degrees, so we proceed.
   They share Node 4 as a common neighbor, forming a triangle <4, 5, 9>.

2. Edge (5, 6): Node 5 has a higher degree, so we proceed.
   Node 6 has no common neighbors with Node 5, no triangle formed.

3. Edge (5, 4): Node 5 has a higher degree, so we proceed.
   They share Node 9 as a common neighbor, forming a triangle <4, 5, 9>.

(Counted 2 triangles so far)

4. Edge (9, 4): Both nodes have higher degrees, so we proceed.
   They share Node 5 as a common neighbor, forming a triangle <4, 5, 9>.

(Counted 3 triangles in total)

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are: <4, 5, 9>.
