Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
The graph based on the given edges is shown below: 

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
Edges: 
(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 4), (0, 1)
(1, 9), (1, 2), (1, 0)
(2, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4)
(3, 9), (3, 6), (3, 2), (3, 7), (3, 4)
(4, 9), (4, 6), (4, 2), (4, 0), (4, 3)
(5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 7)
(6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 0)
(7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 0), (7, 3)
(9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 1)

Next, we will apply Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles. 

Node degrees: 
0: 6
1: 3
2: 5
3: 5
4: 5
5: 4
6: 4
7: 4
9: 3

Sorted nodes based on their degrees: [1, 9, 5, 6, 7, 3, 4, 2, 0]

Triangles found: 
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 9>
