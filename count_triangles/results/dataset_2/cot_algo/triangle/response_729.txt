Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 22) (5, 21) (9, 5) (9, 11) (3, 28) (3, 2) (25, 17) (25, 26) (25, 16) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 22) (4, 20) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 29) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 15) (17, 25) (17, 29) (17, 23) (17, 18) (29, 8) (29, 17) (29, 6) (29, 16) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 14) (20, 4) (6, 29) (26, 25) (26, 28) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 27) (28, 3) (28, 26) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 27) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 21) (19, 18) (19, 13) (22, 5) (22, 4) (10, 7) (10, 26) (10, 27) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 26) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 1) (2, 3) (2, 24) (16, 25) (16, 29) (16, 24) (16, 0) (24, 2) (24, 16) (0, 28) (0, 16) (0, 1) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 21) (21, 5) (21, 4) (21, 18) (21, 13) (23, 17) (1, 28) (1, 14) (1, 0) (27, 26) (27, 28) (27, 10) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method works as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:

Vertices: 24, 10, 16, 19, 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 15, 20, 23, 7, 9, 14, 22, 3, 18, 21, 26, 28, 29, 4, 8, 17, 25, 27

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:  

24 -> 0, 10 -> 1, 16 -> 2, 19 -> 3, 0 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6, 5 -> 7, 6 -> 8, 11 -> 9, 12 -> 10, 13 -> 11, 15 -> 12, 20 -> 13, 23 -> 14, 7 -> 15, 9 -> 16, 14 -> 17, 22 -> 18, 3 -> 19, 18 -> 20, 21 -> 21, 26 -> 22, 28 -> 23, 29 -> 24, 4 -> 25, 8 -> 26, 17 -> 27, 25 -> 28, 27 -> 29

3. Check each edge and count triangles using the lower labeled vertex:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 10, 26>
<1, 15, 7>
<2, 16, 29>
<2, 3, 28>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 9, 11>
<5, 22, 4>
<6, 29, 16>
<10, 27, 26>
<11, 9, 12>
<12, 15, 14>
<13, 7, 15>
<17, 18, 21>
<17, 25, 16>
<18, 19, 13>
<20, 4, 21>
<28, 0, 1>
<28, 2, 3>

Total number of triangles: [19]
