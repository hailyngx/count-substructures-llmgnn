Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (6, 9) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 5) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 11) 

Response:
The graph with nodes and edges described is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (4, 0), (4, 3), (7, 12), (7, 11), (7, 10), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 12), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 14), (9, 10), (1, 11), (1, 14), (1, 10), (3, 4), (3, 11), (8, 13), (8, 2), (8, 14), (8, 10), (8, 0), (13, 8), (13, 12), (13, 2), (13, 10), (13, 14), (12, 7), (12, 6), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 0), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 13), (2, 5), (5, 2), (5, 10), (5, 14), (11, 7), (11, 1), (11, 3), (11, 0), (14, 9), (14, 1), (14, 8), (14, 13), (14, 12), (14, 5), (10, 7), (10, 9), (10, 1), (10, 8), (10, 13), (10, 5), (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 12), (0, 11)

Next, we will apply Degree-Based Ordering by sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

0(5), 1(3), 3(3), 5(3), 4(2), 6(2), 2(5), 7(4), 8(5), 9(6), 10(6), 11(4), 12(5), 13(5), 14(6)

Now, we will relabel the vertices in increasing order of their degrees:

0 -> 0(2), 1 -> 1(3), 3 -> 2(3), 5 -> 3(3), 4 -> 4(2), 6 -> 5(2), 2 -> 6(5), 7 -> 7(4), 8 -> 8(5), 9 -> 9(6), 10 -> 10(6), 11 -> 11(4), 12 -> 12(5), 13 -> 13(5), 14 -> 14(6)

Now, we will count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 6]
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 8, 13>, <7, 9, 6>, <9, 10, 8>, <9, 10, 14>, <13, 10, 14>
