Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 13) (14, 8) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
0: (9, 3, 14, 2, 13)
1: (3, 13, 4, 12)
2: (9, 4, 0)
3: (1, 11, 7, 0, 13, 12)
4: (1, 2)
5: (10, 8, 12)
6: (9, 7, 10, 13)
7: (6, 3, 10)
8: (11, 5, 14, 12)
9: (6, 2, 11, 0, 12)
10: (11, 7, 5, 6)
11: (9, 3, 10, 8, 12)
12: (3, 1, 11, 8, 5)
13: (6, 1, 3, 0)
14: (8, 0)

Now, by sorting the nodes based on the number of connections:
Nodes in ascending order based on connections:
1: 1
2: 4
3: 14
4: 14
5: 5
6: 2
7: 3
8: 4
9: 5
10: 4
11: 5
12: 6
13: 4
14: 3

Based on degree-based ordering, the possible triangles are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 3, 13>
<0, 9, 13>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 7, 10>
<3, 11, 12>
<3, 12, 14>
<4, 8, 12>
<5, 8, 12>
<5, 10, 12>
<6, 10, 13>
<9, 11, 12>
<11, 12, 14>

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in total, which are counted once each. Hence, the output is [15].
