Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 7) (15, 24) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 3) (27, 16) (8, 0) (13, 14) (23, 14) (23, 3) (23, 29) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 24) (12, 17) (12, 22) (12, 26) (6, 28) (6, 18) (6, 26) (6, 4) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 10) (28, 2) (4, 6) (4, 5) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 25) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 25) (17, 22) (2, 28) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 21) (22, 12) (22, 17) (22, 2) (22, 5) (22, 21) (25, 18) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 11) (11, 15) (11, 7) (11, 25) (14, 13) (14, 23) (14, 10) (1, 9) (29, 23) (9, 25) (9, 1) (9, 0) (19, 2) (0, 8) (0, 28) (0, 18) (0, 9) (0, 24) (20, 26) (20, 10) (26, 12) (26, 6) (26, 20) (26, 16) (21, 27) (21, 2) (21, 22) (24, 15) (24, 12) (24, 0) (5, 4) (5, 22) (3, 27) (3, 23) (16, 27) (16, 26) (10, 28) (10, 14) (10, 20) 

Response:
Given the graph with nodes and edges provided, the Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections in ascending order):

(8, 1) (13, 1) (29, 1) (1, 2) (4, 2) (5, 2) (18, 3) (19, 3) (20, 3) (21, 3) (3, 4) (16, 4) (24, 4) (10, 5) (14, 5) (22, 5) (25, 5) (26, 5) (2, 6) (12, 6) (17, 6) (23, 6) (9, 7) (27, 7) (28, 7) (0, 8) (6, 8) (7, 8) (11, 8) (15, 8)

2. Relabel the vertices according to their new order:

(0) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29)

3. Count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found:

Total number of triangles: [104]
