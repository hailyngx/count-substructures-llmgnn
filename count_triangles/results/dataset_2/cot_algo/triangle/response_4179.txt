Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 11) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 4) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 4) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 17) (16, 4) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (6, 13) (6, 1) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 15) (18, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 17) (9, 15) (9, 10) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 9) (17, 8) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 15) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: {(8, 13), (8, 2), (8, 19), (8, 14), (8, 17), (13, 1), (13, 0), (13, 6), (7, 12), (7, 14), (7, 18), (7, 5), (12, 4), (0, 14), (14, 0), (2, 10), (5, 11), (19, 5), (16, 4), (1, 6), (4, 15), (18, 7), (11, 5), (9, 15), (9, 10)}

Now, let's list the nodes based on their degrees:
Degree 1: {9, 16, 18}
Degree 2: {0, 1, 6, 10, 11, 12, 15}
Degree 3: {7, 13, 19}
Degree 4: {2, 4, 5, 14, 17}
Degree 5: {8}

Now, let's count the triangles:
