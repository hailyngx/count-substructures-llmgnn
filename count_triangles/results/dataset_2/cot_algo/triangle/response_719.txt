Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: 9, 4, 6, 3
- 1: 4, 6, 2
- 2: 9, 4, 6, 1, 8
- 3: 5, 9, 4, 8, 0
- 4: 7, 8, 0, 1, 3, 2
- 5: 9, 3
- 6: 7, 1, 2, 0
- 7: 4, 6
- 8: 9, 4, 2, 3
- 9: 5, 8, 2, 3, 0

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph using Degree-Based Ordering method.

Sorted vertices based on their degrees (connections):
Vertices: 1, 7, 5, 8, 0, 6, 2, 3, 4, 9

Number of triangles: [23]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 7, 6>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 4>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 8, 9>, <8, 9, 4>
