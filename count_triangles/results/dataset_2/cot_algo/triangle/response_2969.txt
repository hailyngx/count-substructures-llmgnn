Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (12, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 4) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 10) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are:  

Degree 2: 8, 12  
Degree 3: 12, 13  
Degree 4: 5, 7, 8, 12  
Degree 5: 10  
Degree 6: 0, 1, 4  
Degree 7: 14  
Degree 9: 6, 2  
Degree 10: 11  
Degree 11: 3  
Degree 12: 13  
Degree 13: 0, 8  
Degree 14: 9  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles.  

Number of triangles: [18]  
Unique triangles:  
<0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 11>, <0, 4, 14>, <0, 5, 10>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 3>, <0, 13, 10>, <1, 3, 11>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 10>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 11, 3>, <4, 5, 11>, <4, 14, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <8, 13, 10>
