Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 12) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 14) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 12) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Here are the vertices sorted by degree:
Vertices: 0, 4, 6, 5, 7, 13, 10, 12, 8, 11, 9, 1, 3, 14, 2

Now, we will analyze each edge starting from the one with the lower-labeled vertex having fewer connections:
<0, 3>: Forms triangles with vertices 7 and 11. <0, 3, 11>
<0, 7>: Forms triangles with vertices 1 and 14. <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 14>
<0, 11>: Forms triangles with vertices 1 and 3. <0, 11, 1>, <0, 11, 3>
<1, 7>: Forms a triangle with vertex 14. <1, 7, 14>
<1, 11>: Forms a triangle with vertex 3. <1, 11, 3>
<1, 14>: No triangles formed.
<2, 5>: Forms triangles with vertices 6 and 12. <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 12>
<2, 6>: No triangles formed.
<2, 10>: No triangles formed.
<3, 4>: Forms triangles with vertices 8 and 10. <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 10>
<3, 12>: Forms a triangle with vertex 14. <3, 12, 14>
<4, 8>: Forms a triangle with vertex 10. <4, 8, 10>
<4, 10>: No triangles formed.
<5, 8>: Forms a triangle with vertex 12. <5, 8, 12>
<5, 12>: No triangles formed.
<6, 13>: No triangles formed.
<7, 9>: Forms a triangle with vertex 14. <7, 9, 14>
<8, 13>: Forms a triangle with vertex 12. <8, 13, 12>
<9, 10>: No triangles formed.
<9, 14>: No triangles formed.
<10, 13>: No triangles formed.
<11, 12>: Forms a triangle with vertex 14. <11, 12, 14>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 3, 11>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 14>, <0, 11, 1>, <0, 11, 3>, <1, 7, 14>, <1, 11, 3>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 12>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 10>, <3, 12, 14>, <4, 8, 10>, <5, 8, 12>, <7, 9, 14>, <8, 13, 12>, <11, 12, 14>
