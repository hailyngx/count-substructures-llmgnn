Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first by listing the nodes and their connections:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 7), (6, 4), (2, 8), (2, 4), (2, 1), (2, 0), (8, 3), (8, 1), (0, 7), (0, 4), (7, 3), (1, 4), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 7), (4, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1).

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order:

Nodes in ascending order of degrees:
6, 1, 0, 8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 2, 9.

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles by considering the lower labeled vertex first:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 4>, 
<1, 2, 4>, 
<3, 5, 7>, 
<3, 7, 9>, 
<3, 4, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [5].
