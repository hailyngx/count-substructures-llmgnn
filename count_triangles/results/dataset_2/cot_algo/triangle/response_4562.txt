Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- 0: {3}
- 1: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- 2: {3, 4, 8, 9}
- 3: {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8}
- 4: {1, 2, 5}
- 5: {4, 7, 8}
- 6: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- 7: {1, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- 8: {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- 9: {1, 2, 7, 8}

To apply Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the nodes by degree in ascending order:
Node degrees: [(0,1), (5,3), (6,4), (2,4), (4,3), (9,4), (7,5), (1,4), (8,5), (3,6)]

After relabeling the nodes accordingly, the edges to consider based on the method are: 
- (0, 3)
- (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9)
- (4, 5), (4, 2)
- (5, 7), (5, 8)
- (6, 7), (6, 1)
- (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 8)
- (9, 8), (9, 2)

Counting the triangles formed by the shared connections between the two nodes of each edge, we find:
[Total number of triangles: 12]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 1>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
