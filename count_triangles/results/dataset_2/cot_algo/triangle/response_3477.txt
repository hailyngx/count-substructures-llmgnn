Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 14) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 7) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 16) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 7) (17, 6) (17, 0) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 19) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 11) (6, 4) (6, 17) (6, 0) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 2) (19, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 15) (7, 18) (7, 13) (15, 5) (15, 16) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 0) (10, 1) (0, 2) (0, 17) (0, 6) (0, 12) 

Response:
The degrees of the vertices are:
0: 5
1: 4
2: 4
3: 5
4: 4
5: 4
6: 3
7: 3
8: 2
9: 3
10: 1
11: 3
12: 4
13: 3
14: 3
15: 2
16: 4
17: 3
18: 2
19: 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, the vertices are relabeled as follows:
Node 10: 0
Node 8: 1
Node 15: 2
Node 18: 3
Node 7: 4
Node 6: 5
Node 17: 6
Node 13: 7
Node 12: 8
Node 0: 9
Node 4: 10
Node 11: 11
Node 14: 12
Node 5: 13
Node 3: 14
Node 1: 15
Node 16: 16
Node 2: 17
Node 9: 18
Node 19: 19

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the given edges and the relabeled vertices:
[Total number of triangles: 18]
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 10>
<0, 6, 12>
<0, 6, 14>
<1, 8, 16>
<2, 9, 16>
<3, 12, 14>
<3, 12, 19>
<3, 14, 16>
<4, 10, 12>
<4, 10, 14>
<6, 12, 14>
<7, 13, 18>
<7, 13, 19>
<12, 13, 19>
