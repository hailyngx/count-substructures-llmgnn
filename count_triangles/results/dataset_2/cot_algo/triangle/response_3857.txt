Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 12) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 4) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
The graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. Here is the list of edges provided:

(5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) 
(9, 5) (9, 12) 
(6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) 
(10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 14) 
(11, 13) (11, 4) 
(4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) 
(8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) 
(0, 10) (0, 13) 
(14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 4) 
(13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) 
(7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 2) 
(12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 3) 
(1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) 
(3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 2) 
(2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

After sorting the nodes based on their degrees, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
0(2), 9(2), 11(2), 1(3), 7(3), 13(3), 3(4), 8(4), 12(4), 2(5), 6(5), 10(5), 5(7), 14(4), 4(7)

By using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles and find the unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [28]

Unique triangles:
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 11>
<2, 4, 13>
<2, 7, 14>
<2, 7, 10>
<2, 7, 4>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 8, 12>
<3, 8, 4>
<3, 8, 12>
<3, 8, 4>
<4, 8, 12>
<4, 8, 7>
<4, 8, 12>
<4, 8, 7>
<5, 7, 10>
<5, 7, 14>
<5, 7, 10>

<5, 10, 14>
<5, 10, 5>
<5, 10, 14>
<5, 10, 5>
<7, 10, 14>
<7, 10, 5>
<7, 10, 14>
<7, 10, 5>
<8, 12, 4>
