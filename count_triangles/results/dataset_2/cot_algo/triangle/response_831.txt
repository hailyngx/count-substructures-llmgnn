Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 12) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 10) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 13) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 10) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 12) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 10) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 13) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 10) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 1)

Now, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices by degree: 8 < 1, 7, 14 < 0, 10 < 12, 6, 1, 11 < 3, 13, 4, 2 < 5, 9

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

Number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles: <4, 2, 9> <4, 6, 13> <2, 9, 5> <2, 4, 13> <1, 10, 12> <1, 12, 2> <0, 8, 2> <0, 11, 7> <0, 7, 9> <3, 13, 6>
