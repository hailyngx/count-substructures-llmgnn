Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 9) (17, 10) (17, 3) (1, 5) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 17) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 13) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (7, 14) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 15) (13, 11) (13, 16) (19, 4) (19, 12) (16, 5) (16, 13) (16, 4) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 12) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 4) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 9) (18, 1) (18, 15) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 19) (12, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can help us count the triangles in the given graph. Let's start by relabeling the vertices based on their degree in increasing order.

The degrees of the vertices are as follows:
0: 4
1: 4
2: 4
3: 5
4: 5
5: 5
6: 4
7: 5
8: 3
9: 6
10: 3
11: 3
12: 4
13: 3
14: 3
15: 4
16: 4
17: 2
18: 2
19: 2

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. (17, 10): No triangles
2. (17, 3): No triangles
3. (1, 5): No triangles
4. (1, 18): No triangles
5. (1, 8): No triangles
6. (3, 17): No triangles
7. (3, 11): Found triangle <3, 17, 10>
8. (3, 9): Found triangle <3, 17, 10>
9. (3, 12): Found triangle <3, 11, 13>
10. (10, 2): No triangles
11. (11, 13): No triangles
12. (5, 1): No triangles
13. (5, 6): Found triangle <5, 6, 7>
14. (5, 8): No triangles
15. (6, 7): Found triangle <6, 7, 14>
16. (6, 12): No triangles
17. (2, 10): No triangles
18. (2, 9): Found triangle <2, 10, 17>
19. (2, 4): No triangles
20. (8, 1): No triangles
21. (0, 14): No triangles
22. (0, 7): No triangles
23. (7, 14): No triangles
24. (7, 6): Found triangle <7, 14, 0>
25. (7, 15): Found triangle <7, 14, 0>
26. (13, 16): Found triangle <13, 11, 3>
27. (19, 4): No triangles
28. (16, 4): Found triangle <16, 4, 2>
29. (16, 13): No triangles
30. (15, 18): Found triangle <15, 18, 1>
31. (15, 12): Found triangle <15, 12, 19>
32. (9, 2): Found triangle <9, 2, 10>
33. (9, 15): Found triangle <9, 2, 10>
34. (9, 4): Found triangle <9, 4, 2>
35. (4, 19): No triangles
36. (4, 16): Found triangle <4, 16, 13>
37. (18, 15): Found triangle <18, 1, 5>
38. (12, 15): Found triangle <12, 15, 18>
