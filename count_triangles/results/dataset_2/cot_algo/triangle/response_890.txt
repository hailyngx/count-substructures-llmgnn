Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections).

After labeling the vertices from least to most connections, the vertices would be labeled as follows:
- Node 4 (Degree 7)
- Node 1 (Degree 4)
- Node 8 (Degree 4)
- Node 0 (Degree 4)
- Node 5 (Degree 4)
- Node 3 (Degree 4)
- Node 2 (Degree 5)
- Node 6 (Degree 3)
- Node 9 (Degree 3)
- Node 7 (Degree 2)

Now, we'll analyze the edges in ascending order based on the labels of the connected nodes with the lower labeled node listed first. 

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 2>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 4, 3>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <3, 5, 2>
- <4, 7, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
