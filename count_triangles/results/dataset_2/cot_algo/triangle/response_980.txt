Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 22) (3, 25) (3, 27) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 15) (25, 21) (20, 25) (20, 23) (0, 21) (0, 15) (0, 11) (4, 12) (4, 26) (4, 2) (18, 19) (18, 8) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 16) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 1) (28, 7) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 16) (26, 4) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 23) (24, 6) (24, 26) (24, 5) (24, 29) (1, 17) (1, 28) (1, 8) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 22) (5, 26) (5, 24) (5, 8) (5, 10) (2, 4) (23, 20) (23, 26) (23, 13) (23, 27) (16, 6) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 9) (7, 28) (7, 11) (11, 0) (11, 7) (8, 14) (8, 18) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 10) (21, 25) (21, 0) (21, 15) (21, 29) (15, 25) (15, 0) (15, 21) (15, 29) (9, 28) (9, 16) (9, 27) (10, 5) (10, 8) (22, 17) (22, 12) (27, 3) (27, 23) (27, 9) (13, 23) (29, 24) (29, 21) (29, 15) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges is constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
(14, 17), (14, 8), (17, 14), (17, 1), (17, 22), (3, 25), (3, 27), (25, 3), (25, 20), (25, 15), (25, 21), (20, 25), (20, 23), (0, 21), (0, 15), (0, 11), (4, 12), (4, 26), (4, 2), (18, 19), (18, 8), (6, 28), (6, 24), (6, 16), (28, 6), (28, 9), (28, 1), (28, 7), (19, 18), (19, 26), (19, 16), (26, 4), (26, 19), (26, 24), (26, 5), (26, 23), (24, 6), (24, 26), (24, 5), (24, 29), (1, 17), (1, 28), (1, 8), (12, 4), (12, 16), (12, 22), (5, 26), (5, 24), (5, 8), (5, 10), (2, 4), (23, 20), (23, 26), (23, 13), (23, 27), (16, 6), (16, 19), (16, 12), (16, 9), (7, 28), (7, 11), (11, 0), (11, 7), (8, 14), (8, 18), (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 10), (21, 25), (21, 0), (21, 15), (21, 29), (15, 25), (15, 0), (15, 21), (15, 29), (9, 28), (9, 16), (9, 27), (10, 5), (10, 8), (22, 17), (22, 12), (27, 3), (27, 23), (27, 9), (13, 23), (29, 24), (29, 21), (29, 15)

After sorting the nodes by their degree-based ordering, the new labels for the nodes are:

Nodes: 7, 13, 2, 3, 12, 6, 11, 22, 4, 5, 8, 1, 10, 21, 14, 20, 15, 0, 18, 17, 9, 25, 28, 16, 27, 23, 19, 24, 29, 26

Using these new labels, we can count the number of triangles and identify unique triangles.

[Number of triangles: 6]
Unique triangles: <1, 17, 28>, <1, 17, 8>, <1, 17, 22>, <6, 24, 26>, <8, 10, 5>, <15, 0, 21>
