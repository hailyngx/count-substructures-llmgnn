Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (3, 7) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections. The labels of nodes from 0 to 14 based on their degree are as follows:

Nodes with degree 2: 0, 3, 6, 14
Nodes with degree 3: 1, 4, 13
Nodes with degree 4: 2, 7, 9, 12
Nodes with degree 5: 5, 8
Nodes with degree 6: 11
Nodes with degree 7: 10

Now, we will count the triangles by looking at the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

There are 13 triangles in total: [13].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 11, 14>, <1, 4, 14>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 13>, <2, 9, 13>, <4, 10, 11>, <4, 11, 14>, <4, 6, 14>, <7, 10, 12>, <8, 10, 11>, <8, 10, 12>, <8, 10, 13>, <8, 11, 13>.
