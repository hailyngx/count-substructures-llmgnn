Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 12) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 14) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 14), (1, 7), (1, 9), (1, 10), (1, 11), (1, 14), 
(2, 3), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 11), 
(3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 10), 
(4, 6), (4, 9), (4, 12), 
(5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 14), 
(6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), 
(7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 8), (7, 12), 
(8, 2), (8, 7), (8, 14), 
(9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 14), 
(10, 1), (10, 3), (10, 11), (10, 12), 
(11, 1), (11, 2), (11, 10), (11, 12), (11, 14), 
(12, 4), (12, 7), (12, 10), (12, 11), 
(14, 0), (14, 1), (14, 5), (14, 8), (14, 9), (14, 11)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their degree:
Nodes in order of degree: 13, 0, 8, 4, 10, 12, 5, 6, 13, 9, 2, 1, 7, 3, 11

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:
Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 14>, <1, 7, 14>, <1, 9, 10>, <1, 9, 14>, <1, 10, 12>, <1, 10, 11>, <1, 11, 12>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 9, 14>
