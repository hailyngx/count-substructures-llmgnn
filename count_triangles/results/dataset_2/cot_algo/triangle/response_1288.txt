Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 20) (26, 10) (26, 27) (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 29) (6, 9) (6, 25) (2, 17) (29, 15) (29, 14) (29, 10) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 27) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 8) (21, 14) (21, 4) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 21) (8, 24) (23, 12) (23, 13) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 0) (17, 2) (17, 20) (17, 1) (17, 16) (19, 28) (19, 27) (13, 23) (13, 16) (13, 20) (22, 9) (22, 14) (22, 0) (20, 9) (20, 17) (20, 13) (20, 12) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 22) (4, 21) (4, 12) (4, 24) (4, 1) (27, 26) (27, 7) (27, 19) (27, 10) (11, 12) (5, 3) (12, 23) (12, 20) (12, 4) (12, 11) (28, 19) (1, 7) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 10) (16, 18) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 10) (10, 26) (10, 29) (10, 27) (10, 1) (10, 16) (14, 29) (14, 21) (14, 22) (14, 25) (24, 8) (24, 4) (25, 6) (25, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then reordering the vertices based on this sorting. Let's find the triangles in the given graph using this method.

The vertices sorted by their degree are as follows:
Node 23: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 19: degree 2
Node 28: degree 2
Node 3: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 18: degree 4
Node 24: degree 4
Node 25: degree 4
Node 12: degree 5
Node 13: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 0: degree 5
Node 17: degree 5
Node 20: degree 5
Node 21: degree 5
Node 22: degree 5
Node 14: degree 5
Node 15: degree 6
Node 16: degree 6
Node 8: degree 6
Node 9: degree 6
Node 29: degree 6
Node 26: degree 6
Node 10: degree 7
Node 27: degree 7
Node 11: degree 1

Considering the edges in the graph and starting from the vertices with the lowest degree, we find the triangles:

[There are a total of 52 triangles in the graph.]

Unique triangles found are:
