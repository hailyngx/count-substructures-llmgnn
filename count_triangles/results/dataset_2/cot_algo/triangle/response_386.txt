Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 19) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 17) (12, 19) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (14, 18) (4, 16) (4, 18) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 4) (13, 5) (13, 2) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 15) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 2) (17, 5) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 2) (19, 9) (19, 12) (19, 2) (2, 13) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 19) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (8, 16) (8, 3) (6, 15) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 17) 
(9, 10) (9, 19) (7, 17) (12, 19) (0, 1) (14, 18) (18, 4) (13, 2) (3, 17) (1, 15)
(15, 6) 

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles. 

After sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections), we obtain the following reordered nodes from least connected to most connected:
6, 12, 14, 0, 10, 7, 5, 13, 8, 2, 4, 19, 1, 18, 16, 11, 15, 9, 3, 17

Now, we will count the number of triangles:

The total number of triangles is [18]. 

Unique triangles found:
<2, 15, 17>
<3, 8, 16>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<3, 9, 10>
<2, 13, 15>
<4, 16, 18>
<3, 17, 2>
<1, 5, 13>
<9, 10, 3>
<1, 15, 11>
<4, 16, 9>
<2, 15, 6>
<13, 5, 17>
<3, 11, 9>
<2, 17, 5>
<0, 1, 15>
<11, 15, 1>
