Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves the following steps:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections from least to most.
   - Node 1 (degree 4)
   - Node 9 (degree 4)
   - Node 0 (degree 5)
   - Node 7 (degree 5)
   - Node 4 (degree 5)
   - Node 6 (degree 5)
   - Node 2 (degree 6)
   - Node 8 (degree 6)
   - Node 3 (degree 6)
   - Node 5 (degree 8)

2. Relabel the vertices based on their order:
   - Node 1 -> A
   - Node 9 -> B
   - Node 0 -> C
   - Node 7 -> D
   - Node 4 -> E
   - Node 6 -> F
   - Node 2 -> G
   - Node 8 -> H
   - Node 3 -> I
   - Node 5 -> J

3. Count triangles:

Triangles:
- <A, C, J>
- <A, C, I>
- <A, C, E>
- <A, C, D>
- <A, C, F>
- <A, C, G>
- <A, F, G>
- <A, G, J>
- <A, G, I>
- <A, I, D>
- <A, I, H>
- <B, E, F>
- <B, E, H>
- <B, F, G>
- <B, H, G>
- <E, H, G>
- <D, F, J>
- <D, F, I>
- <D, G, J>
- <D, G, I>
- <E, H, I>

Total number of triangles: [20]
