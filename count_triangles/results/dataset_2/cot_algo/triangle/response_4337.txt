Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 12) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections and then checking for shared connections.

After sorting the nodes by their degrees in non-decreasing order:
Nodes: 11, 3, 10, 7, 5, 14, 9, 0, 1, 4, 6, 12, 13, 2, 8

Based on the given edges and the ordering, we can count the number of triangles:

There are [33] triangles in the graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 8, 12>, <0, 8, 11>, <0, 8, 10>, <0, 12, 1>, <0, 12, 9>, <1, 12, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 13>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 4, 14>, <3, 11, 5>, <3, 11, 0>, <3, 11, 7>, <3, 13, 6>, <3, 13, 1>, <4, 6, 14>, <4, 6, 13>, <4, 6, 2>, <4, 9, 12>, <5, 10, 0>, <5, 10, 9>, <5, 14, 7>, <5, 14, 9>, <6, 12, 8>, <6, 12, 0>, <9, 10, 5>, <9, 10, 0>, <9, 14, 7>, <9, 14, 5>, <9, 14, 6>, <11, 0, 8>, <11, 7, 14>, <12, 0, 8>, <12, 1, 13>
