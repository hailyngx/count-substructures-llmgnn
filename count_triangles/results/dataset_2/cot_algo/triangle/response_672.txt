Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Nodes in the graph with their connections sorted in increasing order of degree:
0: [2, 3, 4, 8, 9]
1: [0, 2]
2: [0, 1, 6, 7, 8]
3: [0, 5, 6, 7]
4: [0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
5: [3, 4]
6: [2, 3, 4, 7]
7: [2, 3, 4, 6, 9]
8: [0, 2, 4, 9]
9: [0, 4, 7, 8]

Triangles in the graph:
[<0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 8>]

Total number of triangles: [10]
