Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 19) (22, 13) (22, 6) (22, 10) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 18) (27, 23) (27, 6) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 16) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 17) (4, 2) (6, 22) (6, 27) (28, 11) (28, 3) (28, 1) (19, 13) (19, 26) (19, 14) (19, 20) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 7) (11, 28) (3, 0) (3, 28) (3, 7) (9, 10) (29, 24) (2, 4) (2, 15) (17, 4) (17, 25) (17, 5) (25, 17) (25, 15) (25, 21) (25, 10) (23, 27) (23, 26) (16, 8) (16, 21) (16, 14) (21, 25) (21, 16) (21, 12) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 20) (10, 22) (10, 8) (10, 26) (10, 9) (10, 25) (7, 26) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 28) (1, 7) (1, 24) (20, 19) (20, 18) (20, 24) (12, 13) (12, 21) (24, 0) (24, 29) (24, 1) (24, 20) (24, 14) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 15) (15, 2) (15, 25) (15, 18) (15, 5) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 7) (14, 24) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: {9, 11, 29, 18, 20, 12, 21, 27, 2, 5, 1, 5, 1, 29, 9, 27, 14, 21, 18, 25, 10, 15, 12, 29, 25, 31, 19, 27, 4, 25, 20}

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges carefully to count the number of triangles.

After sorting and relabeling the vertices, the edges to consider are:
(9, 10) (9, 27) (11, 28) (18, 20), (18, 21), (18, 25) (20, 21) (20, 24) (20, 29) (21, 25) (21, 26) (25, 27) (25, 29) (27, 29)

This results in a total of [12] triangles.

The unique triangles found are: <18, 20, 21>, <20, 24, 29>, <18, 20, 29>, <10, 25, 27>, <9, 10, 27>, <9, 27, 29>, <21, 25, 27>, <21, 26, 25>, <25, 27, 29>, <11, 28, 1>, <11, 28, 7>, <1, 7, 24>
