Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections). Here is the sorted list of nodes with their degrees:  
Node 5: Degree 4  
Node 9: Degree 5  
Node 6: Degree 2  
Node 1: Degree 4  
Node 3: Degree 4  
Node 2: Degree 3  
Node 8: Degree 3  
Node 0: Degree 5  
Node 7: Degree 4  
Node 4: Degree 5  

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:

For edge (5, 9):
- Both nodes have degrees greater than 4, so we don't count any triangles.

For edge (5, 4):
- Both nodes have degrees greater than 4, so we don't count any triangles.

For edge (5, 3):
- Both nodes have degrees greater than 4, so we don't count any triangles.

For edge (5, 7):
- Both nodes have degrees greater than 4, so we don't count any triangles.

For edge (9, 6):
- Both nodes have degrees less than 5, and they share a connection with node 0, forming a triangle <0, 6, 9>.

For edge (9, 8):
- Both nodes have degrees less than 5, and they share a connection with node 1, forming a triangle <1, 8, 9>.

For edge (9, 4):
- Both nodes have degrees greater than 4, so we don't count any triangles.

For edge (9, 0):
- Both nodes have degrees less than 5, and they share a connection with nodes 6 and 7, forming two triangles <0, 6, 9> and <0, 7, 9>.

For the remaining edges, each one also contributes triangles:

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 8, 9>.
