Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 12) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 7) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 2) (17, 12) (17, 7) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 6) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 9) (4, 3) (4, 16) (18, 10) (18, 0) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 9) (8, 15) (8, 14) (8, 19) (9, 12) (9, 19) (9, 11) (16, 4) (16, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (11, 0) (11, 19) (11, 9) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 6) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 

0(6), 3(4), 4(2), 6(2), 16(2), 18(2), 1(3), 5(3), 7(3), 12(3), 14(4), 11(3), 15(3), 8(4), 9(3), 19(4), 2(4), 10(3), 13(2), 17(2).

The total number of triangles is [14].

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 11, 13>, <0, 11, 19>, <0, 13, 14>, <0, 14, 8>, <0, 16, 4>, <0, 16, 11>, <0, 16, 13>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 19>, <4, 0, 16>, <5, 2, 19>, <11, 0, 16>, <12, 3, 17>.
