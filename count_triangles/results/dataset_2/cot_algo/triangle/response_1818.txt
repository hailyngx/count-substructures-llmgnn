Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) 

Response:
Creating the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges:

```
Node 0: (9, 1, 4)
Node 1: (6, 9, 3, 5, 4, 0)
Node 2: (3, 5, 8, 6)
Node 3: (1, 2, 4)
Node 4: (1, 3, 8, 5, 0)
Node 5: (1, 4, 8, 2, 7)
Node 6: (9, 2, 1)
Node 7: (8, 5)
Node 8: (9, 4, 2, 5, 7)
Node 9: (6, 1, 8, 0)
```
