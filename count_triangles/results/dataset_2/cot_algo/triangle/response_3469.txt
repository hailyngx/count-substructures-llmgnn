Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 5) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (1, 17) (1, 2) (10, 4) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 0) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 17) (12, 16) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 17) (8, 15) (8, 14) (17, 1) (17, 7) (17, 4) (5, 15) (5, 2) (19, 9) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 13) (0, 16) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 14) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 16) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are:  
Node 17 - Degree: 3  
Node 18 - Degree: 3  
Node 1 - Degree: 2  
Node 4 - Degree: 3  
Node 10 - Degree: 2  
Node 12 - Degree: 1  
Node 19 - Degree: 1  
Node 0 - Degree: 4  
Node 5 - Degree: 2  
Node 8 - Degree: 2  
Node 16 - Degree: 4  
Node 7 - Degree: 4  
Node 14 - Degree: 5  
Node 11 - Degree: 4  
Node 13 - Degree: 4  
Node 2 - Degree: 4  
Node 6 - Degree: 4  
Node 9 - Degree: 3  
Node 3 - Degree: 4  
Node 15 - Degree: 4  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges between vertices starting from the vertex with the lower label when both vertices have the same degree or the number of connections.
