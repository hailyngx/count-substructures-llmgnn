Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently in the given graph.

Let's construct the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 1), (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 0), (4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 1), (4, 3), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 1), (3, 6), (3, 4), (3, 7), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (0, 6), (0, 2), (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 0), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 7)

Next, let's sort the vertices by the number of connections:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 9: 7 connections

Now, we can count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

After counting the triangles, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique triangles found are <1, 5, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 7>.
