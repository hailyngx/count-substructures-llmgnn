Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (2), (3), (1), (9)
- 1: (4), (8), (5), (6), (0), (9)
- 2: (4), (0)
- 3: (7), (8), (0), (9)
- 4: (7), (8), (1), (2)
- 5: (8), (6), (1)
- 6: (8), (5), (1)
- 7: (4), (3), (9)
- 8: (4), (9), (5), (6), (3), (1)
- 9: (7), (8), (0), (3), (1)

Now, applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Sorted nodes by degree:
- Node 2: Degree 2
- Node 5: Degree 2
- Node 6: Degree 2
- Node 7: Degree 3
- Node 0: Degree 4
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 6
- Node 4: Degree 4
- Node 8: Degree 6

Counting triangles:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 8>

Total number of triangles: [2]
