Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 3) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 10) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree.

The vertices with their corresponding degrees:
0: 4
1: 3
3: 4
4: 3
5: 6
6: 4
7: 3
8: 5
9: 5
10: 4
11: 4
12: 4
13: 4
14: 4

The edges should be considered based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. (3, 0) (3 and 0 share 6 as a mutual connection) <0, 3, 6>
2. (3, 6) (3 and 6 share 2, 12 as mutual connections) <2, 3, 12>
3. (6, 0) (6 and 0 share 2 as a mutual connection) <0, 2, 6>
4. (6, 11) (6 and 11 share 2 as a mutual connection) <2, 6, 11>
5. (11, 6) (11 and 6 share 2 as a mutual connection) <2, 6, 11>
6. (12, 3) (12 and 3 share 2 as a mutual connection) <2, 3, 12>
