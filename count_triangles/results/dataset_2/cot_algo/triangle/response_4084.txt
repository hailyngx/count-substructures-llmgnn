Vertex 16: degree 5
Vertex 17: degree 3
Vertex 19: degree 4
Vertex 20: degree 3
Vertex 21: degree 4
Vertex 22: degree 2
Vertex 23: degree 4
Vertex 24: degree 4
Vertex 25: degree 3
Vertex 26: degree 3
Vertex 27: degree 2

Vertex 29: degree 2

Based on the degree-based ordering, we can now analyze the edges to count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles is: [15]

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 13, 16>
<2, 7, 28>
<1, 4, 8>
<6, 20, 24>
<3, 7, 15>
<9, 0, 11>
<3, 7, 16>
<1, 4, 25>
<6, 10, 26>
<1, 4, 25>
<2, 14, 23>
<2, 14, 23>
<15, 16, 23>
<15, 16, 23>
<19, 21, 29>
