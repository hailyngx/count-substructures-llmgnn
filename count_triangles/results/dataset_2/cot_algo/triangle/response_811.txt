Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 2), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 5), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 0), (2, 1), (2, 9), (8, 3), (3, 8), (3, 0), (0, 9)

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes and their connections:
0: 4, 6, 9, 3
1: 2, 6
2: 4, 5, 6, 1, 9
3: 4, 7, 8, 0
4: 7, 9, 3, 5, 6, 2
5: 4, 7, 6, 2, 0
6: 4, 7, 5, 1, 2, 0
7: 4, 3, 6, 5
8: 3
9: 4, 2, 0
