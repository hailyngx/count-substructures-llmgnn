Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to first sort the nodes based on their degrees. Here is the list of nodes with their degrees in ascending order:

Node 5: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 4: degree 6

Now, we will go through each edge and check for shared connections to count the number of triangles. Here are the triangles found:

[Total number of triangles: 24]
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 8, 1>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 1>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 7, 3>, <4, 7, 6>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 9, 5>, <8, 9, 1>
