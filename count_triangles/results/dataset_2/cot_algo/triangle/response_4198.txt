Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 1) (6, 7) (6, 14) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 2) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 1) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles begins by sorting vertices based on their degree, i.e., the number of connections each vertex has. The sorted list of vertices along with their degrees is as follows:

0 (3), 9 (4), 2 (4), 6 (4), 1 (5), 3 (5), 8 (5), 13 (5), 7 (5), 12 (5), 11 (5), 14 (5), 5 (6), 10 (6), 4 (7)

Now, we proceed by examining each edge and checking for shared connections to count triangles. Going through the list of edges, the triangles formed are:

<0, 3, 14>
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 12>
<0, 3, 10>
<2, 1, 10>
<2, 1, 12>
<2, 14, 1>
<6, 7, 14>
<6, 7, 13>
<6, 14, 3>
<6, 14, 2>
<6, 7, 13>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 14, 3>
<6, 14, 2>
<7, 13, 1>
<7, 13, 11>
<7, 13, 8>
<7, 9, 5>
<7, 14, 4>
<7, 14, 6>
<7, 13, 11>
<7, 13, 8>
<7, 9, 5>
<7, 14, 4>
<7, 14, 6>
<14, 3, 4>
<14, 3, 10>
<14, 3, 2>
<14, 4, 5>
<14, 6, 7>
<14, 3, 10>
<14, 3, 2>
<14, 4, 5>
<14, 6, 7>
<1, 13, 8>
<1, 13, 11>
<1, 13, 7>
<1, 10, 3>
<1, 12, 9>
<1, 12, 10>
<13, 11, 4>
<13, 11, 8>
<13, 11, 7>
<13, 1, 8>
<13, 1, 10>
<8, 11, 4>
<8, 11, 13>
<8, 11, 7>
<8, 3, 0>
<8, 3, 10>
<9, 12, 1>
<9, 12, 10>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [54].
