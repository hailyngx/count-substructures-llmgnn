Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 16) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 13) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 23) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 24) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 18) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 19) (11, 23) (8, 9) (8, 29) (8, 26) (23, 3) (23, 5) (23, 11) (23, 14) (10, 16) (10, 14) (21, 20) (21, 12) (21, 22) (21, 24) (0, 16) (0, 22) (0, 2) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 0) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 17) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 19) (12, 21) (12, 13) (20, 21) (20, 29) (29, 8) (29, 20) (29, 1) (17, 4) (17, 19) (17, 24) (25, 9) (25, 1) (25, 22) (25, 14) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 27) (26, 8) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 24) (22, 21) (22, 0) (22, 25) (22, 27) (27, 1) (27, 22) (24, 9) (24, 21) (24, 17) (24, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 23) (14, 10) (14, 25) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}
Edges: 
(0, 2), (0, 16), (0, 22), 
(1, 25), (1, 27), (1, 29), 
(2, 3), (2, 19), 
(3, 7), (3, 15), (3, 23), 
(4, 7), (4, 14), (4, 17), (4, 18), 
(5, 6), (5, 9), (5, 23), 
(6, 15), (6, 18), 
(7, 13), 
(8, 9), (8, 26), (8, 29), 
(9, 24), (9, 25), 
(10, 14), (10, 16), 
(11, 23), 
(12, 13), (12, 21), 
(13, 24), 
(14, 23), (14, 25), 
(15, 16), 
(17, 19), 
(18, 19), 
(20, 21), (20, 29), 
(22, 27), 
(24, 17), 
(25, 22)

After sorting the nodes based on their degree:
{28} - 0 connections
{11, 26, 28} - 1 connection
{2, 5, 11, 19, 22} - 2 connections
{1, 6, 13, 17, 18, 20, 23, 27} - 3 connections
{4, 7, 14, 21, 24, 25, 29} - 4 connections
{3, 8, 9, 15, 16} - 5 connections
{10, 12} - 6 connections

Now, let's count the triangles:
Total number of triangles: [16]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 19>, <0, 10, 14>, <0, 10, 16>, <0, 14, 25>, <1, 25, 27>, <1, 25, 29>, <2, 3, 19>, <2, 19, 17>, <3, 7, 15>, <4, 7, 14>, <4, 14, 25>, <5, 6, 23>, <8, 9, 29>, <9, 24, 25>, <12, 13, 24>, <17, 19, 24>
