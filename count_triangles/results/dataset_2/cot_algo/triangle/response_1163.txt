Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
Reordering the nodes based on their degree:
```
Nodes: 0, 3, 9, 4, 6, 7, 5, 1, 8, 2
```
