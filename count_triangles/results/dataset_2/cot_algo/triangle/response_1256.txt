Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 11) (7, 23) (7, 8) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 26) (27, 10) (27, 13) (27, 8) (2, 12) (2, 18) (2, 17) (2, 21) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 13) (8, 7) (8, 27) (8, 15) (8, 26) (23, 7) (23, 1) (28, 29) (28, 9) (28, 25) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 22) (13, 27) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 9) (26, 12) (26, 8) (6, 15) (21, 2) (21, 3) (21, 11) (16, 24) (16, 25) (16, 3) (16, 9) (3, 12) (3, 21) (3, 16) (3, 0) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 15) (1, 12) (1, 23) (1, 20) (1, 19) (19, 29) (19, 1) (22, 29) (22, 24) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 10) (10, 27) (10, 0) (10, 24) (10, 5) (10, 14) (24, 16) (24, 22) (24, 10) (11, 7) (11, 21) (11, 5) (11, 20) (25, 28) (25, 16) (25, 9) (9, 28) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 25) (14, 10) (20, 1) (20, 11) (5, 18) (5, 10) (5, 11) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 17) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
   - Vertex 4 has 0 connections
   - Vertex 6 has 1 connection
   - Vertex 7 has 2 connections
   - Vertex 14 has 2 connections
   - Vertex 19 has 2 connections
   - Vertex 20 has 2 connections
   - Vertex 22 has 2 connections
   - Vertex 23 has 2 connections
   - Vertex 26 has 2 connections
   - Vertex 27 has 2 connections
   - Vertex 28 has 2 connections
   - Vertex 0 has 3 connections
   - Vertex 5 has 3 connections
   - Vertex 15 has 3 connections
   - Vertex 17 has 3 connections
   - Vertex 21 has 3 connections
   - Vertex 24 has 3 connections
   - Vertex 10 has 4 connections
   - Vertex 16 has 4 connections
   - Vertex 9 has 4 connections
   - Vertex 13 has 4 connections
   - Vertex 1 has 4 connections
   - Vertex 29 has 4 connections
   - Vertex 2 has 4 connections
   - Vertex 18 has 4 connections
   - Vertex 8 has 4 connections
   - Vertex 3 has 4 connections
   - Vertex 12 has 4 connections
   - Vertex 11 has 4 connections

2. Relabel the vertices based on the sorting.

3. Count the triangles:
   - The total number of triangles is [60].

   The unique triangles found are:
   - <0, 3, 20>
   - <0, 3, 21>
   - <0, 17, 20>
   - <0, 10, 24>
   - <0, 10, 5>
   - <11, 21, 20>
   - <11, 21, 5>
   - <11, 5, 20>
   - <1, 12, 26>
   - <1, 12, 8>
   - <3, 12, 21>
   - <3, 16, 24>
   - <3, 16, 9>
   - <3, 24, 22>
   - <3, 0, 17>
   - <5, 10, 11>
   - <5, 10, 15>
   - <5, 11, 20>
   - <9, 13, 28>
   - <9, 13, 16>
   - <9, 13, 25>
   - <9, 16, 24>
   - <15, 17, 8>
   - <16, 9, 25>
   - <16, 24, 22>
   - <18, 13, 17>
   - <20, 1, 11>
   - <20, 1, 19>
   - <22, 24, 10>
   - <24, 10, 25>
