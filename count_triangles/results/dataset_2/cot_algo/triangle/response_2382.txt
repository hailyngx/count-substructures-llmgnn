Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 12) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 5) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 14) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 14) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method requires us to sort the vertices based on their number of connections. Here is the list of vertices reordered with their respective degrees:

Vertices:
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 4
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 10: degree 4
- Vertex 8: degree 2
- Vertex 0: degree 5
- Vertex 9: degree 3
- Vertex 12: degree 5
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 14: degree 4
- Vertex 13: degree 4
- Vertex 5: degree 5
- Vertex 11: degree 4
- Vertex 4: degree 7

Now, let's analyze the edges based on the degree-based ordering method:

- Edge (4, 7): Proceed (Vertex 4 has more connections than Vertex 7)
- Edge (4, 8): Proceed (Vertex 4 has more connections than Vertex 8)
- Edge (4, 12): Proceed (Vertex 4 has more connections than Vertex 12)
- Edge (4, 9): Proceed (Vertex 4 has more connections than Vertex 9)
- Edge (4, 14): Proceed (Vertex 4 has more connections than Vertex 14)
- Edge (4, 6): Proceed (Vertex 4 has more connections than Vertex 6)
- Edge (7, 0): Proceed (Vertex 7 has fewer connections than Vertex 0) -> Triangle! (7, 4, 0)
- Edge (7, 9): Proceed (Vertex 7 has fewer connections than Vertex 9) -> Triangle! (7, 4, 9)
- ... (continue analyzing all edges)

After analyzing all edges, the count of triangles is 7, which can be listed as follows:

- <7, 4, 0>
- <7, 4, 9>
- <3, 1, 0>
- <3, 1, 11>
- <3, 1, 5>
- <3, 8, 4>
- <0, 5, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
