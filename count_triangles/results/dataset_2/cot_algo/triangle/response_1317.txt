Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 4) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 4) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 10) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 11) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 14) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 14), (9, 10), (9, 1), 
(6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 11), (6, 0), 
(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 12), (0, 13), 
(7, 6), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 14), (7, 1), 
(1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 11), (1, 8), 
(2, 9), (2, 12), (2, 13), 
(12, 0), (12, 2), (12, 10), 
(11, 6), (11, 1), (11, 13), (11, 8), 
(3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 10), (3, 4), 
(14, 9), (14, 7), (14, 8), (14, 4), 
(8, 1), (8, 11), (8, 14), (8, 10), 
(13, 0), (13, 2), (13, 11), 
(10, 9), (10, 12), (10, 3), (10, 8), 
(4, 5), (4, 3), (4, 14)

Next, we will label the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:

Nodes by degree:
1: 5, 2, 12, 13, 4, 10
2: 4, 7, 8, 11
3: 6, 3, 14
4: 0, 1, 9

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph:
Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles:
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 6, 3>
<0, 12, 2>
<6, 7, 1>
<6, 7, 3>
<6, 1, 7>
<6, 1, 11>
<6, 3, 7>
<7, 3, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 11>
