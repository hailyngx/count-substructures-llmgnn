Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 0) (26, 13) (26, 10) (0, 9) (0, 27) (0, 15) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 11) (6, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 15) (4, 7) (4, 28) (4, 16) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 23) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 10) (14, 21) (17, 1) (17, 8) (21, 14) (21, 8) (22, 9) (22, 14) (22, 19) (22, 5) (13, 26) (13, 29) (13, 1) (13, 23) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 8) (18, 20) (18, 12) (18, 25) (20, 18) (20, 29) (20, 10) (29, 13) (29, 20) (29, 8) (11, 27) (11, 23) (11, 25) (23, 7) (23, 13) (23, 11) (23, 3) (23, 12) (5, 22) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 22) (19, 5) (25, 18) (25, 11) (25, 24) (10, 26) (10, 14) (10, 20) (10, 5) (10, 12) (16, 4) (24, 7) (24, 25) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 12) (28, 4) (28, 14) (12, 18) (12, 23) (12, 10) (12, 15) (3, 6) (3, 23) (8, 17) (8, 21) (8, 1) (8, 29) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their number of connections and then relabeling them accordingly. Let's start this process for the graph you provided:

Nodes sorted by their number of connections:
1. Node 2: 0 connections
2. Node 16: 0 connections
3. Node 24: 0 connections
4. Node 18: 0 connections
5. Node 19: 1 connection
6. Node 5: 2 connections
7. Node 4: 3 connections
8. Node 7: 3 connections
9. Node 11: 3 connections
10. Node 21: 3 connections
11. Node 25: 3 connections
12. Node 17: 3 connections
13. Node 3: 3 connections
14. Node 27: 4 connections
15. Node 9: 4 connections
16. Node 22: 4 connections
17. Node 28: 4 connections
18. Node 20: 4 connections
19. Node 13: 4 connections
20. Node 29: 4 connections
21. Node 6: 5 connections
22. Node 15: 5 connections
23. Node 12: 5 connections
24. Node 10: 5 connections
25. Node 1: 6 connections
26. Node 8: 6 connections
27. Node 14: 6 connections
28. Node 23: 6 connections
29. Node 0: 6 connections
30. Node 26: 6 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we now label the nodes accordingly and count the triangles in the graph. 

The total number of triangles is [54]. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 9, 27>
<0, 9, 6>
<0, 9, 15>
<0, 22, 27>
<4, 7, 24>
<4, 14, 28>
<4, 14, 10>
<4, 15, 28>
<4, 16, 15>
<7, 14, 23>
<7, 14, 24>
<10, 14, 22>
<10, 14, 20>
<10, 14, 5>
<10, 20, 29>
<13, 20, 29>
<13, 20, 29>
<13, 1, 17>
<13, 1, 8>
<13, 1, 29>
<17, 1, 8>
<18, 12, 23>
<18, 12, 25>
<18, 20, 29>
<20, 29, 8>
<23, 12, 18>
<23, 12, 25>
<23, 13, 29>
<23, 7, 24>
<23, 3, 13>
<25, 24, 7>
<25, 12, 18>
