Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. Here is the sorted list:  

Node 8: 2 connections  
Node 2: 3 connections  
Node 1: 3 connections  
Node 5: 4 connections  
Node 3: 4 connections  
Node 0: 4 connections  
Node 9: 4 connections  
Node 7: 5 connections  
Node 4: 5 connections  
Node 6: 5 connections  

Using the method, we can now count the triangles in the graph.  

The total number of triangles is: [15]

The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 4, 6>  
<0, 4, 7>  
<0, 3, 4>  
<0, 3, 8>  
<1, 2, 4>  
<1, 2, 7>  
<3, 4, 9>  
<3, 8, 9>  
<4, 5, 6>  
<4, 5, 7>  
<4, 5, 2>  
<5, 7, 6>  
<5, 7, 2>  
<6, 7, 5>  
<6, 7, 9>
