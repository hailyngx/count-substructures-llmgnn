Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 11) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 12) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently. Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

The nodes are numbered as follows based on their degree (number of connections):
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 6
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 5
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 3

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:
1. (6, 9) has 4 shared connections (5, 7, 8, 4), so there are 4 triangles.
2. (6, 5) has 1 shared connection (8), so no triangle.
3. (6, 7) has 1 shared connection (0), so no triangle.
4. (6, 0) has 1 shared connection (5), so no triangle.
5. (9, 8) has 3 shared connections (4, 3, 5), so there are 3 triangles.

Calculating for all edges, the total number of triangles is 4 (from edge 1) + 3 (from edge 5) = 7 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].

The unique triangles found are: 
<6, 9, 8>
<6, 9, 4>
<6, 9, 3>
<6, 8, 3>
<9, 8, 4>
<9, 4, 3>
<9, 4, 12>
