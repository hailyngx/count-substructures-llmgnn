Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 0) (0, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) 

Response:
The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 5
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 6
Node 9: degree 5
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 5
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 5

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees and relabel them accordingly:
Node 6: degree 3 --> Node A
Node 1: degree 3 --> Node B
Node 12: degree 3 --> Node C
Node 5: degree 4 --> Node D
Node 10: degree 4 --> Node E
Node 0: degree 4 --> Node F
Node 2: degree 4 --> Node G
Node 3: degree 4 --> Node H
Node 13: degree 4 --> Node I
Node 4: degree 5 --> Node J
Node 11: degree 5 --> Node K
Node 14: degree 5 --> Node L
Node 7: degree 5 --> Node M
Node 9: degree 5 --> Node N
Node 8: degree 6 --> Node O

Next, we will count the triangles by checking for shared connections between edges. 

Triangles:
<F, G, I>
<D, G, H>
<D, H, J>
<E, G, H>
<E, G, K>
<E, H, K>
<B, C, M>
<A, B, C>
<J, L, M>
<J, M, N>
<J, N, L>
<J, K, L>

Total number of triangles: [12]
