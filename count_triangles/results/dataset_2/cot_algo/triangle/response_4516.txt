Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 4), (5, 0), (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 2), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 8), (1, 7), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 4), (3, 2), (3, 8), (4, 5), (4, 3), (4, 8), (4, 0), (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 4), (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 7), (6, 2), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 2), (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 7), (0, 5), (0, 4)

Now, we will sort the nodes by their number of connections (degree) from least to most:

Nodes' degrees in ascending order: 0(2), 7(2), 9(3), 6(3), 8(4), 1(4), 4(4), 5(4), 2(5), 3(6)

Now, we will relabel the nodes according to their degrees:

Nodes: 0(1), 7(2), 9(3), 6(3), 8(4), 1(5), 4(6), 5(7), 2(8), 3(9)

Next, we will check for triangles based on the given information using Degree-Based Ordering method.

Triangles: <1, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
