Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges can be represented as:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- 0: (1, 4, 8)
- 1: (0, 6)
- 2: (3, 4, 5, 7, 8)
- 3: (2, 7)
- 4: (0, 2, 6, 8, 9)
- 5: (2, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- 6: (1, 4, 5, 9)
- 7: (2, 5, 8)
- 8: (0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9)
- 9: (4, 5, 6, 8)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by degree (least to most):
1. 0 (3 connections)
2. 1 (2 connections)
3. 3 (2 connections)
4. 7 (3 connections)

Calculating triangles:
- For edge (0, 1): No triangles as 1 has fewer connections than 0.
- For edge (1, 6): No triangles as 6 has more connections than 1.
- For edge (2, 3): No triangles as 3 has fewer connections than 2.
- For edge (2, 4): Triangle formed: <2, 4, 8>.
- For edge (2, 5): No triangles as 5 has more connections than 2.
- For edge (2, 7): No triangles as 7 has fewer connections than 2.

Total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
Unique triangles found: <2, 4, 8>.
