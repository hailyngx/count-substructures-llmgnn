Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (10, 7) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (5, 9), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 0), (9, 12), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 0), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 14), (4, 1), (7, 4), (7, 12), (7, 11), (7, 10), (7, 14), (10, 7), (10, 3), (11, 7), (11, 3), (11, 13), (11, 8), (11, 2), (12, 9), (12, 4), (12, 7), (12, 2), (3, 10), (3, 11), (3, 14), (3, 13), (0, 9), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 1), (13, 11), (13, 3), (13, 14), (8, 9), (8, 11), (8, 0), (8, 1), (1, 6), (1, 4), (1, 0), (1, 8), (1, 2), (2, 11), (2, 12), (2, 1), (2, 14), (14, 4), (14, 7), (14, 3), (14, 13), (14, 2)

Next, let's sort the nodes by the number of connections (degree):

Nodes by degree: {5, 10, 13, 2, 9, 3, 8, 0, 12, 1, 6, 11, 7, 14, 4}

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

Triangles: 
[10]

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
