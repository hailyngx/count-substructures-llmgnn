Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, we get the following labels for the nodes:  
Node 0 has degree 2  
Node 9 has degree 2  
Node 8 has degree 3  
Node 6 has degree 4  
Node 1 has degree 4  
Node 7 has degree 4  
Node 4 has degree 4  
Node 2 has degree 5  
Node 5 has degree 6  
Node 3 has degree 7  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
1. Start with the lowest labeled vertex and check its connections: Node 0 (2 edges)
2. Next lowest is Node 9 (2 edges)
3. Node 8 (3 edges)
4. Node 6 (4 edges)
5. Node 1 (4 edges)
6. Node 7 (4 edges)
7. Node 4 (4 edges)
8. Node 2 (5 edges)
9. Node 5 (6 edges)
10. Node 3 (7 edges)

Now, let's count the triangles formed by the edges:

For the edge (0, 7): No triangles formed since both nodes have less than 4 connections.

For the edge (9, 5): Triangle <5, 9, 2>.

For the edge (8, 4): Triangles <8, 4, 2>, <8, 4, 6>, <8, 4, 3>.

For the edge (6, 8): Triangles <6, 8, 4>, <6, 8, 2>, <6, 8, 7>.

For the edge (1, 5): Triangle <1, 5, 2>.

For the edge (7, 0): No triangles formed since both nodes have less than 4 connections.

For the edge (4, 2): Triangle <4, 2, 6>.

For the edge (2, 5): Triangles <2, 5, 1>, <2, 5, 3>.

For the edge (6, 3): Triangles <6, 3, 4>, <6, 3, 2>, <6, 3, 0>, <6, 3, 7>.

For the edge (3, 9): Triangle <3, 9, 5>.

For the edge (3, 4): Triangles <3, 4, 2>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 0>, <3, 4, 7>.

For the edge (3, 7): Triangles <3, 7, 0>, <3, 7, 2>, <3, 7, 5>.

The total number of triangles and the unique triangles found are:
[14]
<5, 9, 2>, <8, 4, 2>, <8, 4, 6>, <8, 4, 3>, <6, 8, 4>, <6, 8, 2>, <6, 8, 7>, <1, 5, 2>, <4, 2, 6>, <2, 5, 1>, <2, 5, 3>, <6, 3, 4>, <6, 3, 2>, <6, 3, 0>, <6, 3, 7>.
