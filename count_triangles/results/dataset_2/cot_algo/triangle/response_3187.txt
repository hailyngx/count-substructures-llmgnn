The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 4) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 7) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 3) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 12) (2, 14) (2, 1) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: {(10, 11), (10, 0), (10, 6), (10, 7), (11, 14), (11, 1), (11, 6), (8, 0), (8, 12), (8, 1), (8, 7), (13, 12), (13, 4), (13, 9), (5, 6), (5, 12), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 3), (6, 4), (0, 8), (0, 4), (14, 3), (14, 9), (14, 2), (3, 7), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 3), (1, 2), (1, 9), (1, 12), (2, 14), (12, 5), (9, 13)}

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes by degree: [8, 14, 2, 3, 9, 13, 10, 11, 6, 0, 7, 1, 5, 12, 4]
Relabeled nodes: {0→4, 1→12, 2→2, 3→3, 4→14, 5→5, 6→10, 7→11, 8→6, 9→0,10→7, 11→1, 12→8, 13→13, 14→9}
