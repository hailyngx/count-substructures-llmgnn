Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 16) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 15) (8, 9) (8, 19) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 7) (13, 16) (13, 10) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 14) (9, 8) (9, 18) (17, 19) (17, 15) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 17) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 10) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 10) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 15) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 17) (15, 16) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections. 

Here is the sorted list of vertices with their degrees:
- Node 5 - Degree 2
- Node 9 - Degree 2
- Node 17 - Degree 2
- Node 19 - Degree 3
- Node 0 - Degree 4
- Node 6 - Degree 4
- Node 8 - Degree 2
- Node 13 - Degree 2
- Node 16 - Degree 4
- Node 18 - Degree 4
- Node 7 - Degree 5
- Node 10 - Degree 4
- Node 14 - Degree 3
- Node 2 - Degree 4
- Node 3 - Degree 5
- Node 4 - Degree 5
- Node 11 - Degree 4
- Node 1 - Degree 3
- Node 12 - Degree 4
- Node 15 - Degree 4

Next, we will count the number of triangles formed by these connections.

The total number of triangles is [78].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 3, 12>
<1, 3, 0>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 19, 8>
<3, 0, 5>
<3, 12, 2>
<6, 16, 13>
<2, 5, 0>
<2, 12, 16>
<8, 9, 18>
<4, 18, 7>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 7, 18>
<7, 11, 14>
<9, 18, 7>
<17, 19, 8>
<12, 10, 13>
<11, 14, 10>
<16, 15, 17>
<15, 7, 14>
