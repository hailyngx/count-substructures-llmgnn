Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 13) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 7) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 19) (15, 17) (15, 4) (15, 12) (15, 11) (19, 8) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 12) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 19) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 7) (6, 0) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 11) (11, 17) (11, 4) (11, 15) (11, 7) (11, 13) (0, 19) (0, 6) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 16) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (16, 18) (16, 10) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 13) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 12) 
(17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 7) (4, 5) (4, 12) 
(4, 11) (4, 15) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 6) (2, 8) 
(2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 19) 
(15, 17) (15, 4) (15, 12) (15, 11) (19, 8) (19, 6) 
(19, 0) (19, 12) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 19) 
(6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 7) (6, 0) (7, 17) (7, 6) 
(7, 11) (11, 17) (11, 4) (11, 15) (11, 7) (11, 13) 
(0, 19) (0, 6) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 3) 
(10, 16) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (16, 18) (16, 10)

After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, the relabeling is as follows:
Nodes: 1, 16, 0, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 10, 13, 7, 15, 19, 8, 11, 14, 9, 12, 17, 18

The triangles in the graph are:
[<4, 12, 15>, <4, 11, 15>, <4, 11, 17>, <4, 11, 7>, <13, 11, 17>, <13, 11, 15>, <13, 2, 8>, <16, 10, 3>, <12, 14, 18>, <0, 6, 19>, <0, 6, 7>, <2, 8, 19>]

The total number of triangles is [12].
