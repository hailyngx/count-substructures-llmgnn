Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 15) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 1) (17, 10) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 6) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 18) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 6) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 13) (4, 19) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 0) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 4) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 18) (0, 6) (0, 18) (0, 19) (19, 4) (19, 0) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 0) 

Response:
After constructing the graph and sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Vertex 0 -> Degree 4
- Vertex 4 -> Degree 4
- Vertex 19 -> Degree 4
- Vertex 11 -> Degree 3
- Vertex 16 -> Degree 3
- Vertex 5 -> Degree 3
- Vertex 9 -> Degree 3
- Vertex 2 -> Degree 3
- Vertex 1 -> Degree 3
- Vertex 14 -> Degree 3
- Vertex 10 -> Degree 3
- Vertex 8 -> Degree 3
- Vertex 13 -> Degree 3
- Vertex 6 -> Degree 3
- Vertex 3 -> Degree 2
- Vertex 7 -> Degree 5
- Vertex 12 -> Degree 2
- Vertex 15 -> Degree 4
- Vertex 17 -> Degree 1
- Vertex 18 -> Degree 5

By examining the edges and considering the lower labeled vertex when both vertices of the edge have the same degree, we can identify the following triangles: 
- <0, 6, 18>
- <0, 6, 19>
- <0, 18, 19>
- <4, 9, 2>
- <5, 1, 6>
- <5, 1, 14>
- <5, 9, 2>
- <5, 9, 15>
- <5, 14, 1>
- <9, 2, 4>
- <9, 2, 16>
- <9, 10, 15>
- <9, 13, 6>
- <9, 15, 10>
- <11, 14, 1>
- <16, 11, 14>
- <16, 2, 9>
- <16, 7, 8>
- <16, 7, 13>
- <17, 10, 15>
- <18, 7, 13>
- <18, 7, 16>
- <18, 10, 15>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 23. [23]
