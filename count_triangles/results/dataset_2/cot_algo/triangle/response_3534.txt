Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 19) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 17) (1, 3) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (14, 3) (14, 16) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 15) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 19) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 14) (16, 12) (16, 18) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 19) (19, 9) (19, 6) (19, 2) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 6) (15, 18) (18, 16) (18, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort the nodes by their degrees (number of connections).

Node 5: 2 connections
Node 1, 12, 18: 1 connection
Node 8, 10, 14: 2 connections
Node 0, 2, 11: 3 connections
Node 7, 13, 19: 4 connections
Node 3, 16: 5 connections
Node 6, 9, 15, 17: 6 connections
Node 4: 7 connections

2. Relabel the nodes accordingly:

Node 5: 0
Node 1, 12, 18: 1, 2, 3
Node 8, 10, 14: 4, 5, 6
Node 0, 2, 11: 7, 8, 9
Node 7, 13, 19: 10, 11, 12
Node 3, 16: 13, 14
Node 6, 9, 15, 17: 15, 16, 17, 18
Node 4: 19

3. Count the triangles.

Total triangles: [6]

Unique triangles are: <0, 2, 4>, <7, 11, 2>, <7, 11, 4>, <13, 15, 17>, <13, 15, 18>, <14, 16, 18>
