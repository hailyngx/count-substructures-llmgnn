Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 21) (5, 14) (9, 7) (27, 4) (27, 13) (27, 16) (27, 6) (20, 0) (20, 21) (20, 19) (25, 1) (25, 28) (0, 20) (0, 3) (0, 28) (0, 4) (28, 25) (28, 0) (28, 29) (28, 24) (29, 28) (29, 13) (17, 5) (17, 21) (2, 18) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 7) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 6) (22, 11) (22, 16) (26, 2) (26, 18) (26, 13) (26, 8) (13, 27) (13, 29) (13, 26) (13, 7) (4, 27) (4, 0) (4, 19) (4, 24) (8, 26) (8, 12) (10, 21) (10, 3) (10, 1) (21, 5) (21, 20) (21, 17) (21, 10) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 23) (3, 12) (6, 27) (6, 18) (6, 7) (14, 5) (14, 1) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 6) (19, 20) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 16) (1, 25) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 16) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 23) (11, 22) (16, 27) (16, 22) (16, 19) (16, 1) (24, 28) (24, 4) (23, 3) (23, 12) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. Now let's use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph.

Nodes sorted by their number of connections (degree):
Node 11 - Degree 0
Node 15 - Degree 0
Node 18 - Degree 0
Node 22 - Degree 0
Node 5 - Degree 4
Node 9 - Degree 1
Node 17 - Degree 2
Node 27 - Degree 4
Node 20 - Degree 3
Node 25 - Degree 2
Node 0 - Degree 4
Node 28 - Degree 4
Node 29 - Degree 2
Node 7 - Degree 4
Node 2 - Degree 4
Node 13 - Degree 4
Node 26 - Degree 4
Node 4 - Degree 4
Node 8 - Degree 2
Node 10 - Degree 2
Node 21 - Degree 4
Node 3 - Degree 3
Node 6 - Degree 3
Node 14 - Degree 2
Node 1 - Degree 3
Node 12 - Degree 2
Node 19 - Degree 4
Node 24 - Degree 2
Node 23 - Degree 2

Now, we will count the triangles by examining the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

Total number of triangles: [14]

Unique triangles:
<0, 5, 21>
<0, 4, 27>
<0, 19, 20>
<0, 19, 4>
<0, 28, 24>
<2, 7, 13>
<3, 10, 21>
<3, 12, 23>
<4, 13, 27>
<4, 19, 20>
<4, 24, 28>
<7, 13, 27>
<13, 26, 27>
<16, 19, 27>
