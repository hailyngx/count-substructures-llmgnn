Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 19) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 18) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 15) (14, 13) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 18) (15, 14) (15, 16) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 18) (17, 6) (17, 18) (16, 7) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 5) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 19) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 9) (6, 17) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 16) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 12) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 12) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 13) (18, 17) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Nodes with 0 connections: 6, 17
Nodes with 1 connection: 12
Nodes with 2 connections: 8, 15
Nodes with 3 connections: 2, 6, 12
Nodes with 4 connections: 0
Nodes with 5 connections: 7, 19
Nodes with 6 connections: 16
Nodes with 7 connections: 1, 11
Nodes with 8 connections: 15
Nodes with 9 connections: 3, 13
Nodes with 10 connections: 4
Nodes with 11 connections: 10
Nodes with 12 connections: 18
Nodes with 13 connections: 14

For each edge, we will only consider it if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

After checking all the conditions, the total number of triangles is [5].

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 4, 10>
<0, 4, 19>
<0, 9, 16>
<0, 9, 3>
<4, 16, 5>
