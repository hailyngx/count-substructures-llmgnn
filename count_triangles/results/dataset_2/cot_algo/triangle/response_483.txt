Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 10) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
Let's sort the nodes by their degree:

1. Node 3 has degree 5.
2. Node 12 has degree 4.
3. Nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, 10, and 13 have degree 4.
4. Nodes 5 and 8 have degree 4.
5. Nodes 1, 6, 9, and 14 have degree 3.
6. Node 11 has degree 3.

Next, we will follow the degree-based ordering method to count the triangles:

1. Consider the edge between nodes 4 and 7. Since node 4 has fewer connections than node 7, proceed.
   - Node 4 shares connections with nodes 2, 9, and 13, forming triangles <2, 4, 7> and <9, 4, 7>.

2. Consider the edge between nodes 4 and 12. Since node 4 has fewer connections than node 12, proceed.
   - Node 4 shares connections with nodes 2 and 13, forming a triangle <2, 4, 12>.

3. Consider the edge between nodes 4 and 9. Since node 4 has fewer connections than node 9, proceed.
   - Node 4 shares a connection with node 2, forming a triangle <2, 4, 9>.

4. Consider the edge between nodes 4 and 13. Since node 4 has fewer connections than node 13, proceed.
   - Node 4 shares a connection with node 2, forming a triangle <2, 4, 13>.

5. Consider the edge between nodes 4 and 2. Since node 4 has fewer connections than node 2, proceed.
   - Node 4 shares connections with nodes 9 and 13, forming a triangle <4, 2, 9> and <4, 2, 13>.

After examining all edges, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].

Unique triangles found:
1. <2, 4, 7>
2. <9, 4, 7>
3. <2, 4, 12>
4. <2, 4, 9>
5. <2, 4, 13>
