Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (12, 5) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 2) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 2) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 10) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 13) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 10) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
0: [3, 14, 4, 13, 9]
1: [3, 13, 8]
2: [14, 11, 4, 5, 13]
3: [1, 0, 6, 4]
4: [3, 0, 2]
5: [7, 12, 11, 2, 8]
6: [3, 14, 10, 8]
7: [10, 5, 8]
8: [1, 7, 6, 5, 10]
9: [0, 14, 11, 10]
10: [7, 6, 8, 9, 13]
11: [9, 13, 5, 2]
12: [5]
13: [1, 0, 11, 2, 10]
14: [0, 6, 9, 2]
```

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Sorting vertices by their degrees:
```
1111 0110 1101 1111 23
```

Relabelling the vertices:
```
0 -> 4
1 -> 6
2 -> 2
3 -> 3
4 -> 1
5 -> 5
6 -> 8
7 -> 10
8 -> 9
9 -> 7
10 -> 11
11 -> 12
12 -> 15
13 -> 13
14 -> 14
```

The edges to be considered based on the lower labelled vertex having fewer connections are:
```
(1, 3)
(1, 8)
(7, 10)
(0, 3)
(0, 13)
(14, 0)
(11, 9)
(4, 3)
(6, 3)
(2, 14)
(5, 7)
(8, 1) -> (1, 8)
(9, 0) -> (0, 13)
(13, 1) -> (1, 3)
```

Calculating the triangles:
1. Triangle: <1, 3, 8>
2. Triangle: <0, 3, 13>
3. Triangle: <0, 9, 14>
4. Triangle: <3, 4, 0>
5. Triangle: <3, 6, 14>
6. Triangle: <2, 5, 7>
7. Triangle: <1, 3, 13>

Hence, the total number of triangles is [7].
