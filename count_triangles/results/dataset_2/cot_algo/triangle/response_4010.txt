Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 19) (14, 15) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 8) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 1) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 1) (5, 17) (5, 18) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 16) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 11) (1, 13) (15, 14) (15, 13) (15, 12) (16, 18) (16, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 15) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 9) (9, 0) (9, 19) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 3) (13, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph. The vertices will be relabeled based on their number of connections. 

First, let's list the number of connections for each vertex:
- Vertex 0: Degree 2
- Vertex 1: Degree 5
- Vertex 2: Degree 2
- Vertex 3: Degree 2
- Vertex 4: Degree 4
- Vertex 5: Degree 4
- Vertex 6: Degree 4
- Vertex 7: Degree 2
- Vertex 8: Degree 4
- Vertex 9: Degree 2
- Vertex 10: Degree 3
- Vertex 11: Degree 4
- Vertex 12: Degree 3
- Vertex 13: Degree 4
- Vertex 14: Degree 2
- Vertex 15: Degree 3
- Vertex 16: Degree 3
- Vertex 17: Degree 4
- Vertex 18: Degree 3
- Vertex 19: Degree 4

Relabeling the vertices accordingly from least to most connections:
- Vertex 0 -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 1 -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 2 -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 3 -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 4 -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 5 -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 6 -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 7 -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 8 -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 9 -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 10 -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 11 -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 12 -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 13 -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 14 -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 15 -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 16 -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 17 -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 18 -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 19 -> Vertex 1

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
Within the list of edges, we will consider only those edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Calculating the number of triangles... 
[48] triangles are found.

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 11, 19>, <1, 13, 15>, <1, 13, 19>, <1, 15, 12>, <2, 1, 13>, <2, 10, 17>, <2, 12, 15>, <2, 16, 6>, <2, 18, 1>, <4, 8, 11>, <5, 0, 9>, <5, 17, 8>, <5, 17, 10>, <5, 17, 18>, <5, 18, 1>, <5, 18, 16>, <6, 10, 17>, <6, 7, 3>, <6, 16, 18>, <8, 4, 12>, <11, 1, 13>, <11, 4, 8>, <11, 19, 13>, <12, 4, 8>, <13, 1, 15>, <13, 1, 19>, <13, 3, 7>, <13, 3, 19>, <15, 12, 4>, <16, 6, 10>, <17, 1, 13>, <17, 5, 18>, <17, 8, 4>, <18, 1, 13>, <19, 9, 0>, <19, 9, 11>, <13, 1, 17>, <17, 5, 0>, <17, 5, 18>, <17, 8, 11>, <17, 10, 6>, <13, 3, 19>, <1, 13, 15>, <13, 3, 7>, <13, 1, 19>, <19, 9, 11>, <11, 4, 12>, <5, 0, 9>, <5, 18, 16>, <6, 7, 3>
