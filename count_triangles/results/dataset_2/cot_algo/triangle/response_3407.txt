Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. Let's do that first:

Vertices sorted by their degree:
1. Node 5: degree 2
2. Node 4: degree 2
3. Node 15: degree 3
4. Node 18: degree 4
5. Node 22: degree 4
6. Node 7: degree 4
7. Node 11: degree 4
8. Node 9: degree 4
9. Node 1: degree 4
10. Node 2: degree 4
11. Node 21: degree 4
12. Node 12: degree 4
13. Node 19: degree 4
14. Node 13: degree 4
15. Node 16: degree 4
16. Node 24: degree 4
17. Node 20: degree 4
18. Node 26: degree 4
19. Node 27: degree 4
20. Node 29: degree 4
21. Node 28: degree 4
22. Node 6: degree 4
23. Node 8: degree 4
24. Node 0: degree 4
25. Node 10: degree 5
26. Node 3: degree 5
27. Node 25: degree 5
28. Node 14: degree 5
29. Node 17: degree 5
30. Node 23: degree 5
