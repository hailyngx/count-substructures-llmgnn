Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 12) (5, 14) (18, 13) (18, 8) (1, 15) (1, 11) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 2) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 14) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (10, 7) (10, 2) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 12) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 11) (3, 17) (3, 8) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (8, 18) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 12) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 16) (14, 8) (13, 18) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 11) (2, 6) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 17) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph by listing the nodes and their connections:

- Node 0: 15, 2, 12, 19, 13
- Node 1: 15, 11
- Node 2: 6, 15, 10, 17
- Node 3: 17, 8
- Node 5: 14
- Node 6: 9, 17, 7, 2
- Node 7: 6, 16, 10, 14
- Node 8: 18, 3, 14, 12
- Node 9: 6, 12
- Node 10: 7, 2
- Node 11: 1, 17, 13
- Node 12: 9, 0, 19, 8
- Node 13: 18, 16, 0, 11
- Node 14: 5, 7, 16, 8
- Node 15: 1, 19, 0, 2
- Node 16: 7, 13, 14
- Node 17: 6, 3, 2, 11
- Node 18: 13, 8
- Node 19: 15, 0, 12

Next, let's sort the nodes by their degree from least to most frequent:
Nodes by degree: 5, 1, 3, 18, 10, 9, 4, 12, 19, 16, 0, 2, 11, 7, 14, 6, 8, 17, 13, 15

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
- Node 0 (degree 5): 5
- Node 1 (degree 1): 1
- Node 2 (degree 3): 3
- Node 3 (degree 18): 18
- Node 4 (degree 10): 10
- Node 5 (degree 9): 9
- Node 6 (degree 4): 4
- Node 7 (degree 12): 12
- Node 8 (degree 19): 19
- Node 9 (degree 16): 16
- Node 10 (degree 0): 0
- Node 11 (degree 2): 2
- Node 12 (degree 11): 11
- Node 13 (degree 7): 7
- Node 14 (degree 14): 14
- Node 15 (degree 6): 6
- Node 16 (degree 8): 8
- Node 17 (degree 17): 17
- Node 18 (degree 13): 13
- Node 19 (degree 15): 15

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method. After counting the triangles, we find that the total number of triangles is 39.

Therefore, the answer is: [39]
