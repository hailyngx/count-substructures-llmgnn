Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 0) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on the number of connections is as follows:
Nodes: 5, 8, 12, 13, 1, 10, 14, 0, 3, 2, 6, 4, 11, 9, 7

After relabeling the nodes accordingly, the edges we will consider based on the Degree-Based Ordering method are:
(5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 11), (8, 6), (8, 12), (12, 11), (13, 0), (13, 4), (13, 6), (1, 2), (10, 0), (14, 3), (0, 3), (3, 4), (3, 14)

Now, let's count the number of triangles:
[10]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 14>, <3, 4, 13>, <0, 13, 3>, <1, 5, 11>, <1, 2, 10>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 1, 11>, <6, 5, 8>, <6, 1, 5>, <6, 8, 5>
