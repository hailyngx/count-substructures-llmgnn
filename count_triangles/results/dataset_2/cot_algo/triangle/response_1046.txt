Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
Let's label the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:  

Node 3: degree 2  
Node 5: degree 2  
Node 9: degree 3  
Node 0: degree 4  
Node 7: degree 4  
Node 2: degree 4  
Node 8: degree 4  
Node 1: degree 5  
Node 6: degree 6  
Node 4: degree 6  

Now, let's list the triangles we find by following the degree-based ordering edge by edge:
