Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 5) (5, 14) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 13) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. List all vertices based on their degree in ascending order:
   Vertex 13: degree 2
   Vertex 0: degree 3
   Vertex 8: degree 3
   Vertex 12: degree 4
   Vertex 1: degree 4
   Vertex 6: degree 4
   Vertex 5: degree 5
   Vertex 3: degree 5
   Vertex 11: degree 5
   Vertex 10: degree 5
   Vertex 9: degree 5
   Vertex 2: degree 5
   Vertex 7: degree 6
   Vertex 4: degree 6
   Vertex 14: degree 7

2. Relabel the vertices according to their degree:
   13 -> 0
   0 -> 1
   8 -> 2
   12 -> 3
   1 -> 4
   6 -> 5
   5 -> 6
   3 -> 7
   11 -> 8
   10 -> 9
   9 -> 10
   2 -> 11
   7 -> 12
   4 -> 13
   14 -> 14

3. Calculate the number of triangles:
   Looking at the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
   - Edge (0, 1) forms one triangle <0, 1, 4>.
   - Edge (0, 12) forms one triangle <0, 12, 3>.
   - Edge (1, 4) forms one triangle <1, 4, 2>.
   - Edge (1, 9) forms one triangle <1, 9, 10>.
   - Edge (3, 10) forms one triangle <3, 10, 9>.
   - Edge (4, 11) forms one triangle <4, 11, 8>.
   - Edge (4, 14) forms one triangle <4, 14, 6>.
   - Edge (5, 6) forms one triangle <5, 6, 14>.
   - Edge (5, 13) forms one triangle <5, 13, 3>.
   - Edge (8, 11) forms one triangle <8, 11, 4>.

   Total number of triangles: [9]

Thus, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
