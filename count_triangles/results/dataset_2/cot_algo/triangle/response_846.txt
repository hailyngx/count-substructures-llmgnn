Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 4) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 2) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method as described. 

Firstly, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Degrees: 4, 3, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 6, 5, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4

Now, we relabel the nodes in ascending order of their degrees:
Nodes: 
0 → 1
1 → 4
2 → 0
3 → 2
4 → 3
5 → 12
6 → 13
7 → 5
8 → 9
9 → 6
10 → 11
11 → 7
12 → 8
13 → 10
14 → 14

Next, we will list the triangles by checking shared connections between the vertices of each edge:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 2>
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 7, 10>
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 4, 3>
<1, 7, 0>
<2, 3, 10>
<3, 4, 10>
<3, 10, 13>
<4, 10, 12>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14] as listed above.
