Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 15) (0, 18) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 22) (27, 18) (8, 13) (8, 20) (8, 25) (13, 8) (13, 23) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 23) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 19) (12, 9) (17, 29) (17, 28) (17, 26) (29, 17) (29, 1) (29, 15) (28, 17) (28, 1) (28, 4) (26, 17) (26, 10) (3, 16) (3, 23) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 20) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 19) (21, 10) (21, 25) (18, 0) (18, 27) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 24) (5, 16) (19, 12) (19, 6) (19, 15) (25, 27) (25, 8) (25, 21) (25, 22) (10, 26) (10, 21) (10, 2) (10, 14) (4, 28) (4, 11) (24, 5) (24, 2) (24, 23) (1, 29) (1, 28) (1, 23) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 24) (15, 0) (15, 29) (15, 19) (14, 6) (14, 10) (9, 12) (22, 27) (22, 25) (22, 20) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 20) (20, 8) (20, 11) (20, 22) (20, 16) (23, 13) (23, 7) (23, 3) (23, 24) (23, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). The vertices are then relabeled from least connected to most connected. 

Here is the sorted list of vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: 11, 9, 14, 21, 3, 24, 4, 26, 10, 12, 16, 28, 1, 29, 15, 22, 6, 7, 5, 19, 8, 13, 25, 2, 0, 17, 18, 27, 20, 23

Now, let's count the triangles by checking for shared connections between vertices starting from the least connected vertex:
Number of triangles: [44]

Unique triangles:
