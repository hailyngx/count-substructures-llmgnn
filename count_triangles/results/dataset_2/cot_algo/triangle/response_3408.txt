Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method works best when the vertices are labeled according to their degree in ascending order. Let's label the vertices accordingly:

Vertices:
0 - degree 4
1 - degree 3
2 - degree 3
3 - degree 3
4 - degree 4
5 - degree 6
6 - degree 4
7 - degree 3
8 - degree 3
9 - degree 6

Now, with the vertices labeled, we will count the triangles based on the provided edges by examining the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles: 
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 3>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 9, 1>
<5, 9, 1>
<5, 9, 3>
