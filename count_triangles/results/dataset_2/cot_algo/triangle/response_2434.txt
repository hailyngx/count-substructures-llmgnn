Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is as follows: 
Nodes with 2 connections: 10, 5, 4, 7, 2  
Nodes with 3 connections: 1  
Nodes with 4 connections: 12  
Nodes with 5 connections: 0, 8  
Nodes with 6 connections: 6  
Nodes with 7 connections: 3  
Nodes with 8 connections: 13  
Nodes with 9 connections: 9  
Nodes with 10 connections: 11  
Nodes with 12 connections: 14
