Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 15) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 21) (26, 7) (26, 17) (0, 27) (0, 29) (0, 1) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 18) (27, 17) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 22) (25, 27) (25, 3) (25, 2) (18, 27) (18, 22) (22, 3) (22, 18) (22, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 24) (1, 7) (28, 3) (28, 6) (28, 11) (29, 0) (29, 14) (29, 4) (29, 21) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 10) (6, 12) (11, 28) (11, 5) (11, 12) (21, 26) (21, 29) (21, 6) (21, 20) (21, 2) (17, 26) (17, 27) (20, 21) (20, 23) (19, 15) (19, 23) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 12) (15, 4) (7, 26) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (5, 11) (5, 16) (23, 9) (23, 20) (23, 19) (16, 5) (16, 4) (24, 1) (24, 14) (2, 0) (2, 25) (2, 1) (2, 21) (8, 22) (8, 7) (14, 29) (14, 15) (14, 24) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 15) (10, 6) (4, 29) (4, 15) (4, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree:
```
Vertex 9: degree 3
Vertex 26: degree 4
Vertex 0: degree 4
Vertex 27: degree 4
Vertex 3: degree 4
Vertex 25: degree 3
Vertex 18: degree 2
Vertex 22: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 28: degree 3
Vertex 29: degree 4
Vertex 6: degree 4
Vertex 11: degree 3
Vertex 21: degree 5
Vertex 17: degree 2
Vertex 20: degree 2
Vertex 19: degree 3
Vertex 15: degree 5
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 5: degree 2
Vertex 16: degree 2
Vertex 24: degree 2
Vertex 2: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 2
Vertex 14: degree 3
Vertex 12: degree 3
Vertex 10: degree 1
Vertex 4: degree 3
```

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
```
Vertex 10: degree 1
Vertex 18: degree 2
Vertex 20: degree 2
Vertex 8: degree 2
Vertex 5: degree 2
Vertex 16: degree 2
Vertex 24: degree 2
Vertex 17: degree 2
Vertex 19: degree 3
Vertex 14: degree 3
Vertex 5: degree 2
Vertex 28: degree 3
Vertex 11: degree 3
Vertex 12: degree 3
Vertex 22: degree 3
Vertex 4: degree 3
Vertex 29: degree 4
Vertex 6: degree 4
Vertex 0: degree 4
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 3: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 4
Vertex 27: degree 4
Vertex 15: degree 5
Vertex 21: degree 5
Vertex 26: degree 4
Vertex 9: degree 3
```

3. Count the number of triangles:
- Only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
