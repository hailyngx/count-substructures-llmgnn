Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 4) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 15) (14, 17) (14, 7) (17, 11) (17, 14) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (18, 5) (18, 2) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 6) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 1) (19, 2) (19, 10) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 12) (10, 5) (10, 19) (10, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 8) (15, 11) (15, 9) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 10) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
0: 1
1: 0, 8, 16
2: 13, 18, 19
3: 5, 6, 8
4: 10, 11, 16
5: 3, 6, 9, 18
6: 3, 5, 7, 9
7: 6, 12, 14, 16
8: 1, 3, 9
9: 5, 6, 8, 15
10: 4, 5, 19
11: 4, 13, 15, 16, 17
12: 7, 13
13: 2, 11, 12, 16
14: 7, 17
15: 9, 11
16: 1, 4, 7, 11, 13
17: 11, 14
18: 2, 5
19: 2, 10
```

Using Degree-Based Ordering, we can relabel the vertices as:
```
0(1), 8(2), 16(3), 13(4), 18(5), 19(6), 5(7), 3(8), 6(9), 9(10), 10(11), 4(12), 11(13), 15(14), 7(15), 12(16), 2(17), 14(18), 17(19)
```

Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph:

[7] triangles found: 
<5, 9, 6>, <5, 9, 18>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 3>, <6, 3, 5>, <13, 16, 11>, <4, 11, 16>
