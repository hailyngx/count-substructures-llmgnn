Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 29) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 27) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 4) (18, 0) (22, 26) (22, 15) (22, 7) (7, 22) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 27) (12, 8) (28, 6) (28, 8) (28, 25) (29, 5) (29, 23) (4, 6) (4, 21) (4, 24) (21, 6) (21, 4) (21, 23) (21, 2) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 16) (26, 17) (11, 7) (11, 14) (23, 29) (23, 21) (23, 1) (23, 3) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 19) (16, 26) (16, 0) (16, 15) (25, 28) (25, 27) (25, 17) (27, 9) (27, 7) (27, 25) (27, 8) (17, 5) (17, 26) (17, 25) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 24) (2, 21) (2, 19) (24, 4) (24, 14) (24, 19) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 0) (3, 14) (8, 12) (8, 28) (8, 27) (1, 23) (1, 13) (20, 26) (20, 10) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 24) (19, 10) (10, 20) (10, 19) (15, 5) (15, 22) (15, 16) (13, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections). Let's do that first.

Sorted vertices with their degrees:
Node 11: degree 2
Node 14: degree 3
Node 13: degree 2
Node 12: degree 1
Node 10: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4
Node 24: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 5: degree 6
Node 0: degree 6
Node 7: degree 6
Node 6: degree 6
Node 8: degree 4
Node 25: degree 3
Node 27: degree 4
Node 23: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4
Node 29: degree 3
Node 17: degree 4
Node 21: degree 5
Node 26: degree 5
Node 20: degree 2
Node 15: degree 3
Node 18: degree 1
Node 22: degree 4
Node 28: degree 4

Now, let's count the triangles by iterating through the edges and applying the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Number of triangles: 44]
