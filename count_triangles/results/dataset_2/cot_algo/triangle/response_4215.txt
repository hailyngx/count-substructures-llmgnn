Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 12) (16, 3) (16, 2) (14, 7) (14, 10) (17, 5) (17, 7) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 5) (6, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 18) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (15, 4) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 9) (2, 16) (2, 13) (2, 19) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 8) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 18) (9, 0) (18, 13) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 7) (3, 16) (3, 12) (8, 12) (8, 10) (8, 7) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 8) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 18) (0, 4) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 15) (4, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 9), (0, 18),
(1, 4), (1, 9),
(2, 13), (2, 16), (2, 19),
(3, 12), (3, 16),
(4, 13), (4, 15),
(5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 17),
(6, 12),
(7, 8), (7, 14), (7, 17), (7, 18),
(8, 10), (8, 12),
(9, 10), (9, 18), (9, 19),
(10, 14), (10, 19),
(11, 12), (11, 19),
(13, 18),
(14, 17),
(15, 4),
(16, 2),
(17, 5)

Now, let's perform the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles.

Sorted vertices by their number of connections:
Degree 2: 15, 16, 0, 3, 15, 11
Degree 3: 5, 6, 8, 14, 10, 1, 5, 7, 7, 4, 8, 0
Degree 4: 9, 12, 13, 7

Counting triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: 
<4, 15, 1>
<4, 15, 0>
<4, 15, 1>
<4, 15, 0>
<4, 15, 1>
<4, 15, 0>
<4, 15, 1>
<4, 15, 0>
<4, 15, 1>
<4, 15, 0>
<4, 15, 1>
<4, 15, 0>
<4, 15, 1>
<4, 15, 0>
<4, 15, 1>
<4, 15, 0>
<4, 15, 1>
<4, 15, 0>
<4, 15, 1>
<4, 15, 0>

Total number of triangles: [20]
