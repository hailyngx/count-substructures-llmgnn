Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 9) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 18) (0, 8) (0, 13) (13, 0) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 4) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 8) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 18) (16, 2) (16, 12) (9, 17) (9, 18) (18, 3) (18, 7) (18, 9) (18, 5) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 19) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 10) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 10) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 15) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 5) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0 - 13
- 0 - 8
- 1 - 3
- 1 - 4
- 1 - 8
- 1 - 19
- 2 - 4
- 2 - 11
- 2 - 16
- 3 - 18
- 3 - 19
- 5 - 4
- 5 - 10
- 5 - 18
- 6 - 7
- 6 - 10
- 6 - 12
- 7 - 11
- 7 - 15
- 7 - 18
- 8 - 12
- 8 - 15
- 9 - 17
- 9 - 18
- 10 - 19
- 11 - 19
- 12 - 16
- 12 - 8
- 12 - 6
- 13 - 0
- 14 - 17
- 15 - 17
- 15 - 7
- 15 - 8
- 16 - 2
- 16 - 12
- 17 - 14
- 17 - 15
- 17 - 9
- 18 - 3
- 18 - 5
- 18 - 7
- 18 - 9
- 19 - 1
- 19 - 10
- 19 - 11
- 19 - 4

Next, we need to sort the nodes based on their degrees from least to most connected:

Nodes in Degree-Based Ordering: 14, 13, 16, 0, 2, 5, 9, 6, 3, 7, 12, 11, 19, 4, 8, 1, 10, 18, 15, 17

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
- <0, 8, 15>
- <1, 4, 19>
- <2, 4, 16>
- <7, 15, 17>
- <7, 18, 19>
- <8, 12, 16>
