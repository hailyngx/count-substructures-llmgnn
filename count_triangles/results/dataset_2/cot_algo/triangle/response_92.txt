Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 
Vertex 3 has degree 2.  
Vertex 0, 7, 5, 13, 1, 14 have degree 3.  
Vertex 11, 12, 4 have degree 4.  
Vertex 2, 10, 8, 6, 9 have degree 5.

The triangles found in the graph are:  
<2, 4, 12>  
<2, 4, 7>  
<2, 4, 13>  
<2, 7, 9>  
<2, 7, 14>  
<2, 9, 14>  
<3, 1, 12>  
<0, 4, 8>  
<0, 4, 5>  
<0, 5, 8>  
<4, 11, 13>  
<5, 10, 11>  
<5, 10, 13>  
<6, 8, 10>  
<8, 9, 6>
