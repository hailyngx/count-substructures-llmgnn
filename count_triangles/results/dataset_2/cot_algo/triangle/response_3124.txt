Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 4) (27, 10) (27, 3) (27, 9) (27, 5) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 12) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 12) (8, 28) (8, 29) (23, 11) (23, 1) (10, 27) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 22) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 26) (26, 17) (26, 28) (26, 14) (28, 8) (28, 26) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 1) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 22) (2, 6) (22, 10) (22, 2) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 14) (14, 26) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 24) (12, 20) (12, 25) (12, 19) (9, 27) (9, 18) (18, 9) (18, 21) (18, 3) (4, 15) (29, 8) (29, 7) (29, 3) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 12) (1, 20) (1, 23) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 6) (5, 27) (5, 25) (5, 11) (5, 24) (3, 27) (3, 14) (3, 18) (3, 29) (0, 21) (0, 24) (21, 18) (21, 0) (24, 14) (24, 5) (24, 0) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 13) (13, 16) (13, 6) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the provided nodes and edges. 

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections (degrees):
Node 21: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 4: degree 2
Node 15: degree 2
Node 27: degree 6
Node 9: degree 2
Node 18: degree 3
Node 3: degree 5
Node 29: degree 4
Node 8: degree 3
Node 23: degree 2
Node 11: degree 5
Node 2: degree 3
Node 22: degree 2
Node 10: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 19: degree 5
Node 1: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 24: degree 3
Node 20: degree 3
Node 25: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 26: degree 4
Node 28: degree 3
Node 14: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 13: degree 2

Counting triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 48]
