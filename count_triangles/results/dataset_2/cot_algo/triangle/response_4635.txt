Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 6) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 11) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 14) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 18) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 9) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 12) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 10) (12, 16) (12, 10) (9, 7) (18, 6) (18, 17) (19, 15) (19, 4) (19, 0) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 18) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 0) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 2) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (13, 14) (0, 19) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we first need to sort the vertices by their degree.

The degree of each node is as follows:
Node 0: 4
Node 1: 3
Node 2: 3
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 3
Node 5: 3
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 4
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 1
Node 10: 4
Node 11: 3
Node 12: 2
Node 13: 1
Node 14: 4
Node 15: 3
Node 16: 3
Node 17: 3
Node 18: 2
Node 19: 3

Now, based on the degree-based ordering, the sorted vertices are:
Nodes 9, 12, 13, 18, 1, 2, 5, 4, 11, 15, 19, 0, 3, 6, 16, 7, 17, 14, 8, 10.

Next, we will count the triangles based on the given edges and the ordering of vertices. After counting, we find that the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].

The unique triangles found are:
<8, 14, 16>
<3, 11, 15>
<4, 8, 14>
<6, 15, 17>
<7, 10, 14>
<1, 6, 15>
<1, 5, 6>
<7, 10, 12>
<1, 5, 0>
<4, 8, 11>
<8, 11, 14>
<7, 10, 2>
<16, 7, 10>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<17, 6, 18>
