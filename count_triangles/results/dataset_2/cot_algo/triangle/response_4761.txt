Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 29) (13, 1) (13, 15) (22, 27) (22, 28) (22, 7) (6, 21) (6, 11) (6, 19) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 19) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 23) (21, 6) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 8) (21, 15) (8, 21) (8, 5) (8, 16) (23, 7) (23, 12) (23, 20) (1, 13) (1, 10) (26, 2) (0, 14) (0, 29) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 16) (14, 10) (4, 14) (4, 24) (4, 28) (18, 27) (18, 24) (18, 17) (28, 22) (28, 4) (17, 18) (20, 23) (20, 5) (10, 9) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 27) (2, 26) (2, 12) (2, 16) (12, 23) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 3) (5, 8) (5, 20) (5, 15) (29, 13) (29, 0) (29, 3) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 24) (16, 15) (24, 4) (24, 18) (24, 16) (11, 6) (11, 12) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 3) (27, 22) (27, 18) (27, 10) (27, 3) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 29) (3, 19) (3, 27) (15, 13) (15, 21) (15, 5) (15, 16) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on the number of connections is as follows (node: degree):
(26: 1), (0: 2), (2: 3), (5: 3), (18: 3), (8: 3), (1: 4), (4: 4), (12: 4), (20: 4), (24: 4), (11: 4), (19: 4), (27: 4), (3: 5), (14: 5), (23: 5), (29: 5), (7: 5), (6: 5), (17: 5), (9: 5), (28: 5), (15: 5), (21: 6), (10: 6), (22: 6), (16: 6), (13: 6)

Following the degree-based ordering method and looking at the given edges, we can count the triangles and output the results.

Total number of triangles: [24]
Unique triangles: <0, 14, 16>, <0, 14, 4>, <0, 14, 24>, <0, 29, 3>, <0, 29, 13>, <2, 12, 3>, <2, 12, 23>, <2, 12, 11>, <2, 16, 24>, <2, 16, 14>, <2, 16, 8>, <4, 24, 18>, <4, 24, 16>, <4, 24, 14>, <4, 28, 22>, <5, 15, 16>, <5, 15, 13>, <6, 11, 12>, <6, 11, 3>, <6, 21, 7>, <6, 21, 10>, <7, 21, 10>, <12, 3, 27>, <15, 5, 16>
