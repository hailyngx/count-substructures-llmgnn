Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph based on the given edges:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (5, 8), (5, 0), (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 1), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 0), (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 1), (7, 8), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 0), (8, 1), (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 8), (3, 6), (3, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (2, 9), (2, 4)

Next, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:

Degree of each node:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 2
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 5

Nodes sorted by degree:
0, 2, 3, 7, 5, 9, 1, 6, 4, 8

Now, let's count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- For each edge, we consider the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections:
   1. Edge (5, 8): shared connections: 6, 7
   2. Edge (5, 0): no triangles formed
   3. Edge (5, 7): shared connections: 6
   4. Edge (9, 6): shared connections: 1
   5. Edge (9, 4): shared connections: 1, 8
   6. Edge (9, 2): shared connections: none
   7. Edge (9, 1): shared connections: 6, 4
   8. Edge (6, 9): shared connections: 1, 4
   9. Edge (6, 1): shared connections: 9, 4
  10. Edge (6, 3): shared connections: none
  11. Edge (6, 8): shared connections: 5, 7
  12. Edge (6, 0): shared connections: 5
  13. Edge (4, 9): shared connections: 1, 8
  14. Edge (4, 7): shared connections: 6
  15. Edge (4, 8): shared connections: 1
  16. Edge (4, 3): shared connections: 6
  17. Edge (4, 1): shared connections: 9, 6
  18. Edge (4, 2): shared connections: none
  19. Edge (7, 5): shared connections: 6
  20. Edge (7, 4): shared connections: 6
  21. Edge (7, 1): shared connections: 9, 4
  22. Edge (7, 8): shared connections: 5
  23. Edge (8, 5): shared connections: 6, 7
  24. Edge (8, 6): shared connections: 5, 7
  25. Edge (8, 4): shared connections: 1
  26. Edge (8, 7): shared connections: 5
  27. Edge (8, 0): shared connections: 5
  28. Edge (8, 1): shared connections: 6, 4
  29. Edge (1, 9): shared connections: 4
  30. Edge (1, 6): shared connections: 9, 4
  31. Edge (1, 4): shared connections: 9, 6
  32. Edge (1, 7): shared connections: 4
  33. Edge (1, 8): shared connections: 6, 4
  34. Edge (3, 6): shared connections: none
  35. Edge (3, 4): shared connections: 6
  36. Edge (0, 5): no triangles formed
  37. Edge (0, 6): shared connections: 5
  38. Edge (0, 8): shared connections: 5
  39. Edge (2, 9): shared connections: none
  40. Edge (2, 4): shared connections: none

Total number of triangles: [9]

Unique triangles found: 
<6, 1, 4>, <6, 1, 9>, <6, 4, 8>, <6, 7, 5>, <6, 7, 8>, <4, 1, 9>, <4, 1, 8>, <4, 7, 5>, <5, 7, 8>
