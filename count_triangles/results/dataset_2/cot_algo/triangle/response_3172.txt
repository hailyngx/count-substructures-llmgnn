Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 7), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 0), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 2), (7, 5), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 1), (7, 8), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 2), (3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 8), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 2), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 3), (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 7)

To count triangles using Degree-Based Ordering, we first sort the nodes by their degree:

Nodes sorted by degree:
0 (degree 4)
1 (degree 4)
4 (degree 4)
2 (degree 5)
3 (degree 5)
7 (degree 5)
5 (degree 5)
8 (degree 3)
6 (degree 3)
9 (degree 3)

Considering edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we proceed as follows to count triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 3>
<3, 7, 1>

Total number of triangles: [10]
