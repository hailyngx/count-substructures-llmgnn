Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degree is as follows:  

0 : 2 connections  
7 : 3 connections  
0 : 4 connections  
9 : 4 connections  
1 : 4 connections  
6 : 4 connections   
4 : 5 connections  
8 : 5 connections   
3 : 5 connections   
5 : 6 connections  


With the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles is [13], and the unique triangles found are:  
<0, 1, 8>  
<0, 1, 9>  
<0, 2, 7>  
<0, 2, 9>  
<1, 3, 8>  
<1, 4, 8>  
<1, 4, 9>  
<2, 4, 9>  
<3, 4, 6>  
<3, 4, 8>  
<3, 5, 6>  
<4, 6, 7>  
<4, 6, 8>
