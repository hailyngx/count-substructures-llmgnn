Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 1) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 8) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 3) (14, 3) (12, 0) (12, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 12) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the vertices from least to most connections is:
(12) - 2 connections
(14) - 2 connections
(5) - 3 connections
(9) - 3 connections
(4) - 4 connections
(6) - 4 connections
(3) - 5 connections
(13) - 5 connections
(11) - 5 connections
(2) - 5 connections
(10) - 5 connections
(0) - 6 connections
(7) - 6 connections
(1) - 6 connections
(8) - 6 connections

Now, examining the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(12, 0)
(12, 8)
(14, 3)
(14, 12)
(5, 6)
(5, 13)
(9, 2)
(9, 10)
(4, 7)
(6, 5)
(3, 6)
(3, 2)
(13, 5)
(13, 9)
(11, 5)
(11, 7)
(11, 3)
(2, 9)
(10, 9)
(10, 4)
(0, 6)
(0, 8)
(0, 1)
(7, 4)

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 8, 12>
<3, 6, 2>
<5, 6, 13>
