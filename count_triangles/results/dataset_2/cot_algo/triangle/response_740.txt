Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 15) (6, 19) (9, 16) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 11) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 5) (4, 19) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 15) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 15) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 18) (18, 0) (18, 5) (18, 16) (13, 2) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 4) (5, 17) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 18) (16, 9) (16, 3) (16, 18) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections). Then, we can follow the steps mentioned earlier to count the number of triangles in the graph.

After sorting the nodes by degree, the new labels for the nodes are:

Node 0: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 14: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 10: Degree 5
Node 17: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 6
Node 5: Degree 6
Node 8: Degree 6
Node 11: Degree 6
Node 12: Degree 6
Node 15: Degree 6
Node 16: Degree 6
Node 18: Degree 3
Node 19: Degree 5

Now, let's list the triangles found in the graph:

<0, 10, 11> 
<0, 10, 1> 
<0, 12, 2> 
<0, 12, 5> 
<0, 18, 5> 
<4, 19, 14> 
<4, 19, 6> 
<4, 19, 9> 
<7, 2, 11> 
<7, 2, 8> 
<7, 8, 10> 
<13, 2, 11> 
<13, 2, 8> 
<6, 15, 2> 
<6, 15, 12> 
<9, 16, 3> 
<14, 19, 6> 
<14, 19, 9> 
<10, 1, 14> 
<10, 1, 11> 
<10, 11, 14> 
<1, 14, 17> 
<1, 14, 11> 
<1, 11, 10> 
<3, 17, 14> 
<3, 17, 5> 
<3, 5, 12> 
<4, 19, 6> 
<4, 19, 9> 
<12, 5, 18> 
<2, 7, 8> 
<2, 8, 10> 
<2, 8, 7> 
<5, 18, 16> 

Thus, we have a total of [32] triangles in the given graph.
