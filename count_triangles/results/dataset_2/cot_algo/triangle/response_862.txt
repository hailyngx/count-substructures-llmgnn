Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are:  
Node 5 (degree 4)  
Node 9 (degree 4)  
Node 4 (degree 5)  
Node 7 (degree 4)  
Node 0 (degree 2)  
Node 8 (degree 4)  
Node 6 (degree 3)  
Node 2 (degree 5)  
Node 1 (degree 4)  
Node 3 (degree 4)  

Counting the triangles based on the described method:  

[Total number of triangles: 5]  
Unique triangles:  
<0, 2, 4>  
<2, 4, 7>  
<3, 5, 9>  
<4, 7, 9>  
<2, 6, 8>
