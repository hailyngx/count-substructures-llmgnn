Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 14) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 8) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 18) (13, 17) (13, 8) (10, 15) (10, 14) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 16) (2, 0) (18, 8) (18, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (1, 15) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 6) (7, 16) (16, 2) (16, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 5) (19, 10) (19, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 6) (12, 3) (12, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their number of connections in increasing order:

Vertex 1: 0
Vertex 2: 1
Vertex 3: 2
Vertex 4: 2
Vertex 5: 3
Vertex 6: 3
Vertex 7: 4
Vertex 8: 4
Vertex 9: 5
Vertex 10: 5
Vertex 11: 5
Vertex 12: 5
Vertex 13: 5
Vertex 14: 5
Vertex 15: 6
Vertex 16: 6
Vertex 17: 6
Vertex 18: 6
Vertex 19: 6

2. List the edges considering only pairs where the lower label vertex has fewer connections:

Edge (3, 0)
Edge (14, 8)
Edge (14, 10)
Edge (8, 13)
Edge (10, 11)
Edge (5, 2)
Edge (5, 6)
Edge (16, 7)
Edge (0, 2)

3. Count the triangles formed by the shared connections of the above edges. 
This graph has 4 triangles.

The total number of triangles is [4]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 4>, <5, 6, 7>, and <8, 13, 17>.
