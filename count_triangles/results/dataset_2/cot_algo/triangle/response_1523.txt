Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 10) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 0) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 15
Edges: 60

Edges:
(5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) 
(9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) 
(4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) 
(7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) 
(1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) 
(3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) 
(8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) 
(13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 6) 
(12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 10) 
(2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) 
(11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 6) 
(0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 6) 
(10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 0) 
(14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 6) 
(6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14) 

Now, let's count the number of triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:

Sorted vertices by degree:
Node 2: 4 connections 
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 10: 5 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 1: 6 connections

Now, we iterate through the edges and count the triangles formed:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 14>
<8, 10, 13>
<5, 8, 13>

Total number of triangles: [3]
