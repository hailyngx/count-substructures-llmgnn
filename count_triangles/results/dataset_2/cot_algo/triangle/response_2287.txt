Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 14) (1, 5) (1, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 6) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 10) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 13), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 7), (9, 4), (9, 14), (1, 5), (1, 11), (3, 2), (3, 12), (7, 5), (7, 12), (7, 6), (7, 10), (12, 3), (12, 7), (12, 14), (12, 11), (2, 5), (2, 3), (2, 6), (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 0), (8, 6), (13, 5), (13, 11), (13, 10), (13, 0), (13, 6), (11, 1), (11, 12), (11, 8), (11, 13), (11, 14), (11, 0), (14, 9), (14, 12), (14, 11), (14, 10), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 8), (6, 13), (6, 10), (6, 4), (4, 9), (4, 6), (4, 0), (4, 10), (10, 7), (10, 8), (10, 13), (10, 14), (10, 6), (10, 4), (0, 8), (0, 13), (0, 11), (0, 4)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes by degree: 0 < 9 < 3 < 1 < 5 < 2 < 4 < 6 < 14 < 8 < 13 < 10 < 12 < 11 < 7

After relabeling the nodes based on their degree:
New node labels: 0 = A, 9 = B, 3 = C, 1 = D, 5 = E, 2 = F, 4 = G, 6 = H, 14 = I, 8 = J, 13 = K, 10 = L, 12 = M, 11 = N, 7 = O

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 9]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 6, 4>
<1, 5, 11>
<1, 7, 12>
<1, 11, 13>
<2, 3, 12>
<2, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 10>
<6, 7, 10>
<8, 10, 11>
