Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 25) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 17) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 19) (9, 12) (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 4) (0, 1) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 3) (27, 26) (7, 21) (7, 2) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 13) (21, 18) (21, 29) (20, 25) (20, 2) (25, 11) (25, 20) (25, 28) (25, 18) (25, 24) (26, 5) (26, 27) (26, 22) (17, 5) (17, 29) (17, 18) (17, 4) (29, 21) (29, 17) (22, 27) (22, 26) (22, 19) (22, 14) (22, 3) (10, 5) (10, 21) (10, 8) (19, 9) (19, 22) (14, 22) (14, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 28) (13, 21) (13, 12) (28, 0) (28, 25) (28, 1) (28, 23) (8, 10) (8, 6) (15, 6) (23, 28) (23, 6) (2, 7) (2, 20) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 24) (12, 3) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 4) (4, 0) (4, 17) (4, 24) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 23) (3, 27) (3, 22) (3, 12) (3, 18) (18, 21) (18, 25) (18, 17) (18, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. To count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 16 has 0 connections.
Nodes 0, 1, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 4, 6, 10, 12, 16, 23, 24, 29 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 2, 5, 9, 18 have 4 connections each.
Nodes 3, 21, 22 have 5 connections each.
Nodes 17, 27 have 6 connections each.
Nodes 25, 26, 28 have 7 connections each.

Now, we will proceed with counting the triangles based on the sorted vertices:

1. Edge (11, 25): No triangles formed.
2. Edge (5, 9): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (5, 26): Triangle <5, 9, 26>.
4. Edge (5, 17): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (5, 10): Triangle <5, 9, 10>.
6. Edge (9, 5): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (9, 19): No triangles formed.
8. Edge (9, 12): No triangles formed.
9. Edge (0, 27): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (0, 28): No triangles formed.
...

After counting all possible triangles, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [25].

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 9, 26>
<5, 9, 10>

Please note that each triangle is listed only once.
