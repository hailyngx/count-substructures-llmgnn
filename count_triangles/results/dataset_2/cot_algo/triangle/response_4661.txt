Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 17) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 18) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 17) (3, 9) (11, 4) (11, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 19) (10, 5) (10, 18) (10, 19) (15, 6) (15, 17) (15, 16) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 1) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 19) (14, 8) (14, 19) (17, 4) (17, 5) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 18) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (13, 4) (18, 6) (18, 10) (18, 17) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on the number of connections is as follows:

Vertices: (Degree)
8: 3
14: 2
5: 2
7: 2
6: 3
2: 2
3: 3
11: 2
0: 4
10: 3
15: 3
12: 3
16: 3
1: 4
9: 3
13: 1
17: 5
4: 5
18: 3
19: 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find:

Number of triangles: [16]

Unique triangles:
<0, 8, 14>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 10, 18>
<0, 10, 19>
<0, 7, 19>
<0, 7, 1>
<8, 4, 11>
<8, 14, 19>
<5, 17, 4>
<5, 17, 3>
<6, 3, 9>
<6, 3, 17>
<6, 15, 17>
<12, 16, 19>
<12, 1, 11>
