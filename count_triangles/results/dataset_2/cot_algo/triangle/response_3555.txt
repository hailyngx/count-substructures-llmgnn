Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 14) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 12) (10, 18) (10, 13) (12, 6) (12, 18) (12, 1) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 17) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 7) (17, 19) (2, 9) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 9) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 19) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 18) (18, 16) (18, 8) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections. Let's apply this method to the given graph:

The sorted list of vertices with their degrees is as follows:
(0: 2), (2: 1), (7: 3), (15: 1), (19: 4), (10: 2), (14: 3), (1: 4), (4: 3), (5: 4), (11: 2), (3: 3), (6: 4), (8: 4), (9: 4), (12: 3), (18: 5), (13: 3), (17: 4), (16: 4)

Now, we will go through each edge while ensuring that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. We will count the triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles: 
<0, 13, 4>
<0, 11, 16>
<1, 5, 17>
<1, 7, 19>
<3, 6, 5>
<3, 8, 4>
<3, 9, 19>
<3, 9, 16>
<4, 8, 6>
<5, 14, 18>
<6, 8, 18>
<7, 17, 19>
<8, 12, 18>
<9, 16, 11>
<10, 13, 0>
<12, 18, 14>
<13, 10, 0>
<14, 15, 18>
<16, 17, 5>
<16, 18, 14>

Total number of triangles: [20]
