Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 19) (15, 5) (15, 17) (27, 21) (27, 24) (27, 14) (27, 11) (2, 29) (2, 11) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 23) (29, 4) (29, 11) (6, 17) (6, 11) (9, 17) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 28) (13, 7) (22, 5) (22, 0) (23, 29) (0, 9) (0, 22) (0, 20) (20, 0) (20, 12) (20, 3) (20, 16) (17, 15) (17, 29) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 12) (24, 27) (24, 26) (24, 3) (24, 18) (24, 5) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 21) (7, 13) (7, 25) (25, 2) (25, 7) (25, 10) (10, 25) (10, 3) (10, 16) (21, 27) (21, 26) (3, 20) (3, 24) (3, 10) (3, 28) (28, 13) (28, 3) (28, 4) (5, 15) (5, 22) (5, 24) (5, 26) (11, 27) (11, 2) (11, 29) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 27) (14, 11) (14, 18) (19, 15) (18, 8) (18, 24) (18, 14) (12, 20) (12, 17) (12, 1) (4, 29) (4, 28) (1, 12) (1, 16) (16, 20) (16, 10) (16, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Let's relabel the nodes accordingly:

Node 0 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 2
Node 5 has degree 5
Node 6 has degree 3
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 2
Node 9 has degree 2
Node 10 has degree 3
Node 11 has degree 5
Node 12 has degree 3
Node 13 has degree 4
Node 14 has degree 3
Node 15 has degree 3
Node 16 has degree 3
Node 17 has degree 5
Node 18 has degree 3
Node 19 has degree 1
Node 20 has degree 4
Node 21 has degree 3
Node 22 has degree 2
Node 23 has degree 2
Node 24 has degree 5
Node 25 has degree 4
Node 26 has degree 3
Node 27 has degree 4
Node 28 has degree 3
Node 29 has degree 5

Now, we will count the triangles:
