Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 2)
- 1: (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 9), (8, 5), (8, 3), (8, 1)
- 2: (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 3)
- 3: (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 3), (2, 7)
- 4: (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 1), (0, 9)
- 5: (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 0), (7, 9), (7, 1)
- 6: (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 0), (9, 7), (9, 1)
- 7: (1, 8), (1, 6), (1, 0), (1, 7)
- 8: (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 6), (3, 2)

Now, let's label the vertices based on their degrees:
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 8: 6 connections
- Node 4: 6 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles by considering the edges starting from the vertices with lowest labels and fewer connections. 

Calculating the total number of triangles... 

Total number of triangles: [22]
