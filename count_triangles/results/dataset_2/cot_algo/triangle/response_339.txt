Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). 

Here is the list of vertices sorted by their degrees (from least to most connections):
Vertex 7 (Degree: 1)
Vertex 1 (Degree: 2)
Vertex 9 (Degree: 2)
Vertex 2 (Degree: 3)
Vertex 8 (Degree: 4)
Vertex 3 (Degree: 4)
Vertex 0 (Degree: 5)
Vertex 5 (Degree: 6)
Vertex 4 (Degree: 6)
Vertex 6 (Degree: 6)

Let's proceed to count the triangles based on the given edges:

Triangles found: [13]
