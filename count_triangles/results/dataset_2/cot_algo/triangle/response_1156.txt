Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Let's follow the method step by step:

Nodes sorted by their degrees:
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 6

Edges sorted according to the lower labeled vertex:
1. (0, 2) - forms a triangle with edge (0, 4) and (2, 3) - <0, 2, 3>
2. (0, 4) - already counted in 1
3. (0, 7) - no triangles
4. (0, 8) - forms a triangle with edge (8, 9) and (0, 9) - <0, 8, 9>
5. (1, 4) - forms a triangle with edge (1, 6) and (4, 6) - <1, 4, 6>
6. (2, 3) - already counted in 1
7. (2, 5) - forms a triangle with edge (5, 3) and (2, 7) - <2, 5, 3>
8. (2, 7) - already counted in 7
9. (3, 5) - already counted in 7
10. (3, 9) - forms a triangle with edge (9, 4) and (3, 5) - <3, 9, 4>
11. (4, 0) - already counted in 1
12. (4, 1) - already counted in 5
13. (4, 5) - forms a triangle with edge (5, 6) and (4, 6) - <4, 5, 6>
14. (4, 7) - already counted in 15
15. (4, 9) - already counted in 13
16. (5, 2) - already counted in 7
17. (5, 3) - already counted in 7
18. (5, 4) - already counted in 13
19. (5, 6) - forms a triangle with edge (6, 9) and (5, 9) - <5, 6, 9>
20. (6, 1) - already counted in 5
21. (6, 5) - already counted in 13
22. (6, 8) - forms a triangle with edge (8, 9) and (6, 9) - <6, 8, 9>
23. (6, 9) - already counted in 19
24. (7, 0) - already counted in 1
25. (7, 2) - already counted in 7
26. (7, 4) - already counted in 13
27. (7, 8) - forms a triangle with edge (8, 6) and (7, 6) - <7, 8, 6>
28. (8, 0) - already counted in 1
29. (8, 6) - already counted in 19
30. (8, 7) - already counted in 27
31. (8, 9) - already counted in 19
32. (9, 0) - already counted in 1
33. (9, 3) - already counted in 10
34. (9, 4) - already counted in 13
35. (9, 6) - already counted in 19
36. (9, 8) - already counted in 19

After going through all the edges, we have found the following unique triangles:
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <2, 5, 3>
- <3, 9, 4>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <6, 8, 9>
- <7, 8, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
