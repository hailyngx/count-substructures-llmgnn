Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 6) (22, 27) (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 25) (3, 28) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 20) (25, 16) (25, 12) (25, 4) (25, 21) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 18) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 10) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 20) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 29) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 24) (17, 16) (17, 24) (17, 15) (29, 0) (29, 15) (29, 4) (19, 13) (19, 26) (26, 19) (9, 13) (9, 12) (28, 3) (28, 27) (10, 3) (10, 23) (10, 21) (10, 7) (21, 25) (21, 10) (21, 15) (21, 4) (18, 8) (18, 20) (1, 6) (1, 2) (24, 14) (24, 17) (20, 3) (20, 6) (20, 18) (20, 27) (2, 11) (2, 1) (15, 23) (15, 17) (15, 29) (15, 21) (27, 22) (27, 28) (27, 20) (27, 7) (12, 25) (12, 6) (12, 9) (7, 10) (7, 27) (4, 25) (4, 5) (4, 29) (4, 21) 

Response:
Given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges:

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degree:

0: 3 connections
2: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
9: 2 connections
1: 2 connections
18: 2 connections
26: 1 connection
19: 2 connections
11: 3 connections
23: 3 connections
13: 3 connections
17: 3 connections
24: 2 connections
22: 1 connection
28: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
6: 5 connections
8: 4 connections
10: 4 connections
20: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
21: 4 connections
29: 3 connections
12: 3 connections
15: 4 connections
4: 5 connections
14: 4 connections
27: 4 connections

With the sorted nodes by degree, we can count the triangles:

1. (5, 11, 16)
2. (0, 8, 14)
3. (4, 21, 25)
4. (6, 12, 25)
5. (3, 10, 21)
6. (3, 14, 24)
7. (17, 15, 24)
8. (20, 21, 27)
9. (6, 20, 27)
10. (1, 2, 11)
11. (15, 21, 29)
12. (10, 21, 29)
13. (7, 10, 27)
14. (2, 6, 11)
15. (4, 5, 29)
16. (4, 21, 29)
17. (7, 27, 28)
18. (6, 12, 14)
19. (9, 12, 25)
20. (15, 17, 24)
21. (10, 15, 21)
22. (10, 23, 27)
23. (8, 14, 24)
24. (8, 18, 20)
25. (7, 27, 20)
26. (3, 20, 6)
27. (3, 10, 4)
28. (17, 15, 21)
29. (11, 16, 17)
30. (13, 19, 26)

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [30].
