Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
Let's first organize the graph with the nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3), 
(9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 7), 
(4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 3), 
(7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 8), 
(1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 8), 
(3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 2), 
(8, 9), (8, 7), (8, 1), (8, 6), 
(2, 3), 
(0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 6), 
(6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 0)

Now let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Degree-Based Ordering:
Node 2: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 6
Node 9: Degree 6

Triangles (in the format <a, b, c>):
<1, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 7, 4>, <8, 6, 4>, <8, 9, 7>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 2, 6>, <3, 2, 4>

Total number of triangles: [13]
