Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 28) (13, 9) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 21) (1, 14) (1, 24) (1, 23) (1, 27) (21, 22) (21, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 17) (12, 11) (12, 27) (27, 1) (27, 12) (5, 6) (5, 26) (6, 21) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 16) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 24) (19, 25) (19, 24) (26, 5) (26, 2) (17, 11) (17, 29) (17, 8) (29, 17) (29, 25) (29, 18) (28, 13) (28, 3) (28, 7) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 4) (8, 17) (8, 9) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 20) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 18) (3, 6) (3, 28) (3, 23) (18, 29) (18, 15) (18, 16) (25, 19) (25, 29) (2, 22) (2, 6) (2, 26) (4, 22) (4, 6) (4, 15) (7, 10) (7, 28) (7, 15) (7, 23) (20, 9) (23, 13) (23, 1) (23, 3) (23, 7) (24, 1) (24, 14) (24, 19) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will start by constructing the graph based on the given edges and then proceed to count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

### Graph Construction:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29
- Edges: 
(13, 22), (13, 16), (13, 28), (13, 9), (13, 23), (22, 2), (22, 4), (22, 21), (1, 14), (1, 24), (1, 23), (1, 27), (21, 6), (10, 11), (10, 0), (10, 7), (11, 12), (11, 17), (12, 27), (27, 1), (5, 6), (5, 26), (0, 14), (0, 16), (19, 25), (26, 2), (17, 29), (28, 3), (15, 18), (8, 20)

### Degree-Based Ordering:
1. Node 8 has 2 connections.
2. Node 29 has 3 connections. 
3. Node 20 has 4 connections.
4. Node 12 has 4 connections.
5. Node 5 has 4 connections.
6. Node 24 has 4 connections.
7. Node 10 has 4 connections.
8. Node 17 has 4 connections.
9. Node 7 has 4 connections.
10. Node 15 has 4 connections.
11. Node 1 has 4 connections.
12. Node 26 has 4 connections.
13. Node 18 has 4 connections.
14. Node 25 has 4 connections.
15. Node 0 has 4 connections.
16. Node 14 has 4 connections.
17. Node 27 has 4 connections.
18. Node 3 has 4 connections.
19. Node 6 has 5 connections.
20. Node 4 has 5 connections.
21. Node 9 has 5 connections.
22. Node 21 has 5 connections.
23. Node 11 has 5 connections.
24. Node 19 has 5 connections.
25. Node 28 has 5 connections.
26. Node 16 has 5 connections.
27. Node 22 has 5 connections.
28. Node 13 has 6 connections.
29. Node 2 has 6 connections.

### Counting Triangles:
Triplet (a, b, c) forms a triangle if a is connected to b, b to c, and c to a. 
From the list of edges:
- Node 8 and Node 29 can form a triangle with Node 20 or Node 9.
(By following the Degree-Based Ordering, we count each triangle only once)
  
Total number of triangles: [6]

### Unique Triangles:
<13, 9, 20>
<13, 9, 21>
<13, 9, 22>
<13, 9, 23>
<13, 9, 28>
<29, 8, 20>
