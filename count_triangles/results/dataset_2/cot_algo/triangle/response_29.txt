Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 4) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 4) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges as described, the degree-based reordering process is as follows:

Node 5 has degree 4.
Node 9 has degree 5.
Node 6 has degree 5.
Node 1 has degree 4.
Node 3 has degree 5.
Node 10 has degree 5.
Node 11 has degree 3.
Node 8 has degree 2.
Node 13 has degree 4.
Node 4 has degree 4.
Node 7 has degree 5.
Node 12 has degree 4.
Node 2 has degree 2.
Node 0 has degree 5.
Node 14 has degree 4.

After sorting the nodes based on their degree in ascending order, the reordered labels are as follows:
8, 2, 12, 14, 11, 5, 1, 13, 4, 0, 6, 9, 10, 7, 3

Now, considering the edges, we count the triangles formed by shared connections:

- <0, 5, 9>
- <0, 5, 1>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 3, 10>
- <1, 10, 4>
- <1, 10, 7>
- <1, 11, 3>
- <3, 4, 13>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <3, 6, 13>
- <3, 7, 10>
- <4, 7, 10>
- <4, 7, 12>
- <6, 9, 13>
- <7, 10, 12>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
