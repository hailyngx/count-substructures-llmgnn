Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 13) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 1) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 7) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 7) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 9: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 12: 6 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 11: 6 connections
Node 5: 6 connections
Node 10: 7 connections
Node 14: 7 connections

Then, going through the edges according to the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles. The total number of triangles in the graph is [9], and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 10>, <0, 1, 12>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 10>, <0, 8, 10>, <0, 8, 12>, <0, 12, 13>, <1, 10, 11>.
