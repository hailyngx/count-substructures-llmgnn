Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 8) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 14) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 

(0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 13), 
(1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 13), (1, 14), 
(2, 9), (2, 11), (2, 14), 
(3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 10), (3, 12), 
(4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 9), 
(5, 0), (5, 10), (5, 11), (5, 12), (5, 14), 
(6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 11), 
(7, 8), (7, 10), (7, 12), 
(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 7), (8, 12), (8, 14), 
(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 11), 
(10, 3), (10, 5), (10, 7), (10, 13), 
(11, 2), (11, 5), (11, 6), (11, 13), 
(12, 3), (12, 5), (12, 7), (12, 8), 
(13, 0), (13, 1), (13, 10), (13, 11), 
(14, 1), (14, 2), (14, 5), (14, 8)

After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for each node are:

Node 0 (Degree 3), 
Node 2 (Degree 3), 
Node 7 (Degree 3), 
Node 6 (Degree 3), 
Node 9 (Degree 4),
Node 4 (Degree 4), 
Node 13 (Degree 4), 
Node 10 (Degree 4), 
Node 12 (Degree 4), 
Node 14 (Degree 4), 
Node 8 (Degree 5), 
Node 11 (Degree 5), 
Node 1 (Degree 5), 
Node 3 (Degree 5), 
Node 5 (Degree 5)

By analyzing the edges and shared connections, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16]. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 3, 6>, 
<1, 3, 8>, 
<1, 3, 10>, 
<1, 3, 11>, 
<1, 4, 6>, 
<1, 4, 9>, 
<1, 4, 11>, 
<1, 8, 12>, 
<1, 9, 11>, 
<1, 11, 13>, 
<3, 4, 6>, 
<3, 4, 11>, 
<3, 8, 12>, 
<4, 6, 9>, 
<5, 10, 12>, 
<8, 12, 14>
