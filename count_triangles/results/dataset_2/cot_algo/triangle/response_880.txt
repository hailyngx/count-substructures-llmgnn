Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 20) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 23) (20, 4) (20, 25) (20, 3) (20, 28) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 26) (25, 2) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 8) (12, 27) (12, 14) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 9) (23, 7) (23, 18) (23, 2) (1, 8) (1, 26) (26, 25) (26, 1) (26, 17) (18, 27) (18, 23) (18, 0) (18, 29) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 16) (17, 26) (17, 10) (17, 21) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 8) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 0) (9, 27) (9, 29) (29, 18) (29, 9) (29, 6) (29, 24) (21, 10) (21, 17) (21, 11) (2, 25) (2, 23) (2, 3) (11, 8) (11, 21) (11, 14) (11, 24) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 28) (24, 7) (24, 29) (24, 11) (3, 7) (3, 20) (3, 2) (3, 16) (0, 18) (0, 19) (6, 29) (6, 15) (6, 16) (16, 20) (16, 10) (16, 3) (16, 6) (28, 20) (28, 14) (15, 5) (15, 6) 

Response:
Based on the provided graph, we can count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Let's first label the vertices from 0 to 29 based on their number of connections in ascending order:
Vertices: 
0: 4 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 5 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 3 connections
10: 4 connections
11: 4 connections
12: 3 connections
13: 2 connections
14: 3 connections
15: 2 connections
16: 4 connections
17: 3 connections
18: 4 connections
19: 4 connections
20: 5 connections
21: 3 connections
22: 0 connections
23: 4 connections
24: 4 connections
25: 3 connections
26: 4 connections
27: 3 connections
28: 2 connections
29: 4 connections

Next, we will analyze each edge by considering the vertex with the lower label to have fewer connections. Then, we will check for shared connections between the two vertices to find triangles.

Count of triangles inside brackets []:
[<12, 14, 28>, <6, 15, 16>, <19, 23, 27>, <1, 11, 24>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
