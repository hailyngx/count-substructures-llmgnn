Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- 0: {6, 7}
- 1: {6, 7, 9}
- 2: {6, 8, 9, 7, 0, 3, 5}
- 3: {4, 9, 2}
- 4: {6, 9, 8, 3}
- 5: {0, 2, 1}
- 6: {9, 7, 4, 8, 0}
- 7: {6, 0, 2, 1}
- 8: {6, 9, 4}
- 9: {6, 7, 8, 4, 2, 3, 1}

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Sorted nodes by the number of connections:
Nodes: {5, 1, 3, 8, 7, 4, 0, 2, 6, 9}

Triangles:
- There are 4 triangles in total: [8]
- Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 7>
