Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 14) (4, 19) (4, 13) (8, 5) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 10) (18, 15) (18, 7) (1, 17) (1, 7) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 11) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 1) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 16) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 12) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 3) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 5) (11, 0) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 12) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 16) (10, 14) (10, 16) (16, 13) (16, 5) (16, 10) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 15) (12, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Nodes sorted by degree: [2, 8, 10, 18, 1, 16, 7, 5, 19, 4, 8, 6, 9, 13, 3, 11, 0, 12, 17, 15]
Assigning new labels based on the ordering: 
- Node 2 is now labeled as 0
- Node 8 is now labeled as 1
- Node 10 is now labeled as 2
- Node 18 is now labeled as 3
- Node 1 is now labeled as 4
- Node 16 is now labeled as 5
- Node 7 is now labeled as 6
- Node 5 is now labeled as 7
- Node 19 is now labeled as 8
- Node 4 is now labeled as 9
- Node 8 is now labeled as 10
- Node 6 is now labeled as 11
- Node 9 is now labeled as 12
- Node 13 is now labeled as 13
- Node 3 is now labeled as 14
- Node 11 is now labeled as 15
- Node 0 is now labeled as 16
- Node 12 is now labeled as 17
- Node 17 is now labeled as 18
- Node 15 is now labeled as 19

After relabeling the nodes, we will proceed to count the triangles using the given method. 

Total number of triangles: [10]
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 15, 17>, <5, 6, 16>, <5, 7, 16>, <6, 9, 12>, <6, 12, 13>, <9, 12, 14>, <15, 17, 19>, <3, 11, 19>
