Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 19) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 15) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (18, 19) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 17) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 14) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 16) (14, 13) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 15) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 17) (15, 9) (15, 11) (15, 6) (17, 19) (17, 7) (17, 4) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 7) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 4) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 16) 

Response:
The nodes and their connections based on the given edges are as follows:

Node 0: {12, 3, 13}
Node 1: {8, 2}
Node 2: {12, 1, 13, 14, 16}
Node 3: {0, 14, 6, 4}
Node 4: {10, 3, 17, 16}
Node 5: {9}
Node 6: {3, 7, 15}
Node 7: {6, 13, 17}
Node 8: {9, 10, 1}
Node 9: {5, 8, 15, 19}
Node 10: {8, 4, 13}
Node 11: {15}
Node 12: {2, 0}
Node 13: {10, 2, 0, 14, 7}
Node 14: {2, 3, 13, 16}
Node 15: {11, 9, 6}
Node 16: {2, 14, 4}
Node 17: {19, 7, 4}
Node 18: {19}
Node 19: {18, 9, 17}

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the nodes can be relabeled as follows:
Node 0 -> 2
Node 1 -> 1
Node 2 -> 4
Node 3 -> 3
Node 4 -> 6
Node 5 -> 0
Node 6 -> 5
Node 7 -> 7
Node 8 -> 8
Node 9 -> 9
Node 10 -> 10
Node 11 -> 11
Node 12 -> 12
Node 13 -> 13
Node 14 -> 14
Node 15 -> 15
Node 16 -> 16
Node 17 -> 17
Node 18 -> 18
Node 19 -> 19

By following the method, we find that there are [39] triangles in the graph. 
The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 14>
<2, 4, 14>
<3, 4, 14>
<3, 4, 16>
<3, 7, 13>
<3, 7, 14>
<4, 7, 17>
<4, 10, 13>
<4, 13, 14>
<6, 7, 17>
<8, 9, 15>
<9, 15, 19>
<12, 14, 16>
<13, 14, 16>
<13, 14, 7>
<13, 16, 4>
<13, 16, 14>
<14, 16, 4>
<15, 17, 19>
<17, 19, 18>
