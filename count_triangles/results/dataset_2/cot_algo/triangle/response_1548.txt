Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's construct the graph based on the given edges:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 7, 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 8, 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, 8, 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 8.

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):
Nodes in ascending order based on degree: [2, 6, 7, 9, 0, 1, 4, 8, 3, 5]

Now, let's relabel the nodes accordingly:
New node labels: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5, 6: 6, 7: 7, 8: 8, 9: 9}

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [8]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <0, 1, 5>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 8>
