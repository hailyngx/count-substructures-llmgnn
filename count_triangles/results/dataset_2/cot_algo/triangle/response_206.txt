Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 15) (9, 2) (9, 19) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 16) (17, 1) (17, 3) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 4) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 18) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (1, 14) (1, 17) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 16) (12, 6) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 13) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 13) (18, 5) (18, 11) (18, 19) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 3) (19, 13) (7, 8) (7, 3) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 7) (2, 9) (2, 19) (2, 13) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 19) (13, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 19

Edges:
(0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 16)
(1, 14) (1, 17)
(2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 19)
(3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 19)
(4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 10)
(5, 15) (5, 18)
(6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 15)
(7, 8)
(9, 19)
(11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 18)
(12, 6)
(13, 16)
(14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 16)
(15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 16)
(16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 15)
(17, 1) (17, 3)
(18, 5) (18, 11) (18, 19)
(19, 2) (19, 3) (19, 13)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):
Node Degrees: (node: degree)
0: 3
1: 2
2: 3
3: 4
4: 3
5: 2
6: 4
7: 2
8: 2
9: 2
10: 3
11: 3
12: 1
13: 4
14: 4
15: 3
16: 4
17: 2
18: 3
19: 4

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: 19 (calculated)

[19]

Unique triangles found:
<4, 0, 13>
<4, 6, 10>
<14, 1, 17>
<16, 0, 13>
<16, 13, 2>
<16, 13, 19>
<1, 14, 3>
<19, 2, 9>
<10, 4, 6>
<18, 5, 11>
<15, 5, 6>
<3, 7, 19>
<14, 11, 18>
<16, 14, 15>
<4, 8, 7>
<18, 11, 19>
<11, 14, 16>
<15, 6, 10>
<1, 17, 3>
