Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges can be visualized as follows:

```
0 --- 5 --- 1 --- 6
|     |     |     |
|     |     |     |
4 --- 9 --- 8     2
|     |   / |     |
|     | /   |     |
7 --- 3 --- 6 --- 2
```

Now, let's label the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):

0 -> degree 4  
1 -> degree 3  
2 -> degree 4  
3 -> degree 3  
4 -> degree 4  
5 -> degree 4  
6 -> degree 5  
7 -> degree 2  
8 -> degree 4  
9 -> degree 5  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and looking at the given edges, we can count the number of triangles:

1. For edge (5, 9): Shared connections with 5: {1, 0, 3}
2. For edge (5, 1): Shared connections with 5: {0}
3. For edge (5, 0): Shared connections with 5: {4}
4. For edge (5, 3): Shared connections with 5: {9, 6}
5. For edge (9, 6): Shared connections with 9: {8, 3}
6. For edge (9, 8): Shared connections with 9: {6, 4}
7. For edge (9, 4): Shared connections with 9: {8}
8. For edge (9, 2): No shared connections
9. For edge (6, 1): Shared connections with 6: {8}
10. For edge (6, 3): Shared connections with 6: {9}
11. For edge (6, 2): Shared connections with 6: {8}
12. For edge (6, 8): Shared connections with 6: {9}
13. For edge (4, 9): Shared connections with 4: {8}
14. For edge (4, 8): Shared connections with 4: {9}
15. For edge (4, 0): Shared connections with 4: {5}
16. For edge (8, 9): No shared connections
17. For edge (8, 6): Shared connections with 8: {9}
18. For edge (8, 0): Shared connections with 8: {5}
19. For edge (8, 1): Shared connections with 8: {6}
20. For edge (1, 5): Shared connections with 1: {6}
21. For edge (1, 6): Shared connections with 1: {8}
22. For edge (3, 5): Shared connections with 3: {9}
23. For edge (3, 9): Shared connections with 3: {6}
24. For edge (3, 6): Shared connections with 3: {9}

Counting the total number of triangles, we get:
Total number of triangles: [6]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 3>, <4, 9, 8>, <6, 1, 8>, <6, 3, 9>, <6, 2, 8>
