Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 14) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 2) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 12) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and then relabeling them. Let's follow these steps:

1. Count the number of connections for each node:
- Node 0: 5 connections
- Node 1: 5 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 5 connections
- Node 5: 5 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 9: 5 connections
- Node 10: 4 connections
- Node 11: 5 connections
- Node 12: 4 connections
- Node 13: 5 connections
- Node 14: 3 connections

2. Sort the nodes based on the number of connections in ascending order:
- Nodes in order: 2, 3, 7, 14, 6, 10, 8, 12, 0, 1, 4, 9, 11, 5, 13

3. Relabel the nodes accordingly:
- Node 2: 0 connections
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 14: 3 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 10: 5 connections
- Node 8: 6 connections
- Node 12: 7 connections
- Node 0: 8 connections
- Node 1: 9 connections
- Node 4: 10 connections
- Node 9: 11 connections
- Node 11: 12 connections
- Node 5: 13 connections
- Node 13: 14 connections

4. Count the number of triangles formed:
- There are a total of 50 triangles in the graph.

5. List the unique triangles found:
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 1, 11>
- <0, 1, 10>
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 2, 13>
- <0, 6, 4>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <0, 7, 1>
- <0, 7, 3>
- <0, 9, 5>
- <0, 9, 8>
- <0, 10, 14>
- <0, 11, 6>
- <0, 11, 12>
- <0, 11, 1>
- <0, 12, 13>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 2, 13>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 6, 0>
- <1, 7, 3>
- <1, 7, 8>
- <1, 9, 5>
- <1, 9, 11>
- <1, 9, 0>
- <1, 10, 14>
- <1, 11, 12>
- <1, 11, 0>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <2, 4, 13>
- <4, 6, 0>
- <7, 8, 3>
- <7, 8, 9>
- <9, 11, 1>
- <9, 11, 12>
- <9, 11, 0>
- <10, 14, 0>
- <11, 12, 13>
- <11, 12, 0>
- <12, 13, 0>
- <12, 14, 10>
- <13, 14, 5> 

6. The total number of triangles in the given graph is [50].
