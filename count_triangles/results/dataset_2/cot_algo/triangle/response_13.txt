Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 13) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 22) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 24) (15, 3) (15, 5) (4, 8) (4, 12) (7, 16) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 22) (6, 18) (6, 23) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 27) (9, 23) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 22) (8, 18) (5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 25) (5, 0) (5, 10) (17, 3) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 27) (29, 17) (29, 1) (29, 21) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 10) (26, 20) (28, 19) (28, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 27) (2, 20) (24, 11) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 21) (19, 28) (19, 20) (14, 22) (14, 27) (22, 16) (22, 6) (22, 8) (22, 14) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 19) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 24) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 13) (27, 9) (27, 17) (27, 2) (27, 14) (25, 11) (25, 5) (10, 5) (10, 1) (13, 11) (13, 28) (13, 18) (23, 6) (23, 9) (23, 21) (21, 29) (21, 24) (21, 23) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections to other nodes. Then, each edge is checked to count triangles. Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph.

To organize the vertices based on their degrees:
- Node 26 and Node 28 have 1 edge each.
- Nodes 1, 10, 12, 14, and 15 have 2 edges each.
- Nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, 13, 19, 21, and 25 have 3 edges each.
- Nodes 3, 9, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23, and 24 have 4 edges each.
- Nodes 5, 6, and 29 have 5 edges each.
- Node 8 has 6 edges.
- Node 11 and Node 27 have the highest number of edges - 7 each.

After relabeling the vertices according to their degrees:
- Nodes 26 and 28 are assigned labels 1 and 2, respectively.
- Nodes 1, 10, 12, 14, and 15 are assigned labels 3 and 4.
- Nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, 13, 19, 21, and 25 are assigned labels 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.
- Nodes 3, 9, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23, and 24 are assigned labels 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21.
- Nodes 5, 6, and 29 are assigned labels 22, 23, and 24.
- Node 8 is assigned label 25.
- Nodes 11 and 27 are assigned labels 26 and 27.

Next, we count the triangles based on the sorted vertices and provided edges. After calculations, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [72].

The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<11, 13, 28>
<0, 13, 28>
<1, 10, 29>
<0, 2, 26>
<2, 13, 27>
<2, 14, 27>
<6, 8, 22>
<3, 13, 23>
<9, 13, 27>
