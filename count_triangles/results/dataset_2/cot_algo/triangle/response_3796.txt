Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 19) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 15) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 1) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 17) (12, 17) (12, 3) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 3) (18, 14) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 3) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 6) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 3) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 6) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 6) (15, 9) (15, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be used to count the triangles in the given graph. 
Let's start by sorting the nodes based on their degree, i.e., the number of connections each node has:

Nodes in ascending order of degree:
3 (degree 5) <br>
1 (degree 4) <br>
18 (degree 2) <br>
16 (degree 2) <br>
12 (degree 2) <br>
5 (degree 3) <br>
9 (degree 2) <br>
19 (degree 3) <br>
7 (degree 3) <br>
2 (degree 3) <br>
0 (degree 4) <br>
8 (degree 3) <br>
4 (degree 4) <br>
6 (degree 5) <br>
13 (degree 3) <br>
17 (degree 4) <br>
14 (degree 4) <br>
11 (degree 4) <br>
15 (degree 2) <br>

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
<0, 1, 5> <br>
<0, 4, 7> <br>
<0, 4, 14> <br>
<0, 5, 11> <br>
<0, 7, 17> <br>
<0, 14, 18> <br>
<1, 5, 8> <br>
<1, 6, 17> <br>
<1, 8, 14> <br>
<2, 3, 4> <br>
<2, 3, 14> <br>
<3, 6, 14> <br>
