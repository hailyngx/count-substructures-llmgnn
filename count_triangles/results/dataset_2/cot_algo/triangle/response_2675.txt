Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (2, 9) (2, 11) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 11) (1, 9) (1, 17) (17, 1) (17, 5) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 5) (15, 8) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 5) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 16) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 5) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 16) (12, 13) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 18) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 19) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 18) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 13) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 14) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 7: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 3: degree 2
Node 16: degree 3
Node 18: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 17: degree 2
Node 10: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 15: degree 4
Node 11: degree 5
Node 2: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 14: degree 3
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 5

Edges in degree-based order:
(7, 0) (7, 3) (0, 4) (16, 18) (18, 13) (18, 15) (4, 13) (4, 19) (4, 19) (19, 8) (19, 16) (19, 8) (1, 17) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 15) (17, 5) (10, 5) (10, 15) (10, 6) (6, 13) (6, 8) (6, 10) (3, 7) (3, 7) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 8) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 19) (18, 16) (18, 16) (18, 13) (0, 7) (0, 4) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 15) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 5) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 13) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 11) (2, 9) (2, 11) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 6) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 14)

The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are: 
<12, 16, 18>
<4, 13, 18>
<10, 15, 5>
<14, 12, 5>
<10, 15, 8>
<6, 13, 8>
<6, 13, 10>
<8, 6, 15>
