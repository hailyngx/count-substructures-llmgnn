Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 0) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 0) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 11) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
The graph constructed according to the given edges is as follows:
Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
Edges: (6, 9), (6, 11), (6, 13), (9, 8), (9, 10), (9, 3), (1, 3), (1, 14), (1, 4), (1, 8), (3, 7), (4, 12), (4, 13), (4, 10), (8, 9), (8, 1), (5, 2), (7, 12), (7, 14), (0, 11), (0, 13), (10, 0), (11, 2)

Now, we will sort the vertices based on the number of connections:
Nodes (sorted): [5, 2, 10, 12, 14, 0, 11, 6, 4, 8, 7, 13, 1, 3, 9]

Let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 10>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 13>
<4, 8, 1>
<4, 12, 10>
