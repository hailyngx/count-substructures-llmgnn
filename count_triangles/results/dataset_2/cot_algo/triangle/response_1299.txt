Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7), 
(9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 0), 
(4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 7), 
(7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 8), 
(1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 8), 
(3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 2), 
(6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 0), 
(8, 7), (8, 1), (8, 6), (8, 2), (8, 0), 
(2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 8), 
(0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 6), (0, 8)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Degree of each node:
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 7 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 3 connections

Now, relabel the nodes based on their degrees (from least to most):
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 2: 0 connections
Node 9: 0 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 5: 7 connections

Let's count the triangles:
- (1, 3) and (1, 8) share 0 common connections.
- (2, 1) and (2, 3) share 0 common connections.
- (9, 5) and (9, 4) share 0 common connections.
- (4, 7) and (4, 9) share 0 common connections.
- (6, 5) and (6, 3) share 0 common connections.
- (7, 5) and (7, 4) share 0 common connections.
- (8, 7) and (8, 1) share 0 common connections.
- (3, 7) and (3, 1) share 0 common connections.
- (0, 5) and (0, 9) share 0 common connections.
