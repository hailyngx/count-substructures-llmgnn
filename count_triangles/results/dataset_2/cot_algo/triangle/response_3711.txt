Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 18) (4, 13) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 18) (3, 5) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 2) (8, 10) (8, 16) (13, 4) (13, 2) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 7) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 14) (17, 4) (17, 3) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 2) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 2) (6, 15) (6, 1) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 12) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 12) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 0) (19, 3) (19, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 18) (16, 5) (16, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. Let's sort the vertices by their degree: 

Vertices in ascending order of degree: 
Node 11: degree 1
Node 7: degree 1
Node 10: degree 2
Node 12: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 17: degree 5
Node 18: degree 5
Node 15: degree 5

Now, we will only consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
