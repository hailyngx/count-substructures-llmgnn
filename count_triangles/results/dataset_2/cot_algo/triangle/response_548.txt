Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree.

The degrees of the vertices are as follows:
Node 0: degree 5
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 3

Sorted vertices (labels):
Node 9: label 0
Node 3: label 1
Node 2: label 2
Node 1: label 3
Node 4: label 4
Node 7: label 5
Node 8: label 6
Node 0: label 7
Node 5: label 8
Node 6: label 9

Now, we will check the edges based on the labels to count the triangles:
Triangles: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 8>

Total number of triangles: [2]
