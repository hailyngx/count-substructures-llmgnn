Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 0) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 10) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 10) (10, 12) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 11) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps count the number of triangles efficiently. 
Here's the calculation:

- Node 7 has 4 connections.
- Node 12 has 3 connections.
- Node 6 has 4 connections.
- Node 1 has 4 connections.
- Node 9 has 4 connections.
- Node 8 has 3 connections.
- Node 13 has 3 connections.
- Node 0 has 4 connections.
- Node 10 has 2 connections.
- Node 11 has 4 connections.
- Node 14 has 4 connections.
- Node 5 has 4 connections.
- Node 2 has 4 connections.
- Node 3 has 4 connections.
- Node 4 has 4 connections.

To count triangles, we consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

The edges are: (4,7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (7, 12), (7, 3), (7, 6), (1, 4), (1, 3), (3, 4), (3, 7), (6, 7), (6, 9), (9, 6), (9, 11), (0, 4), (0, 1), (0, 13), (0, 10), (10, 12), (11, 9), (11, 14), (14, 1), (14, 3), (14, 2), (5, 1)

Counting the triangles formed by the selected edges, we get:
[(7, 12, 4), (7, 12, 10), (7, 4, 1), (7, 3, 1), (7, 3, 4), (7, 6, 9), (4, 3, 1), (4, 0, 1), (4, 0, 13), (4, 1, 3), (4, 1, 5), (4, 3, 5), (1, 0, 13), (1, 14, 3), (1, 14, 5), (1, 14, 11), (3, 5, 11), (6, 9, 11), (6, 9, 14), (9, 14, 11), (9, 14, 2), (13, 0, 10), (12, 10, 0)]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [23]
