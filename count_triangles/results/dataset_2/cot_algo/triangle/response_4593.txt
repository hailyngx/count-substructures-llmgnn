Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 8) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (15, 18) (15, 8) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 8) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 9) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 5) (6, 13) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 16) (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 6) (5, 3) (5, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 7) (14, 5) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 15) (8, 18) (16, 18) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(10, 8), (10, 14), (17, 3), (17, 0), (17, 8), (1, 0), (1, 12), (1, 8), (15, 18), (15, 8),
(18, 15), (18, 19), (18, 16), (18, 8), (19, 18), (19, 11), (19, 2), (2, 19), (2, 12), (2, 11),
(12, 1), (12, 2), (12, 13), (12, 14), (0, 17), (0, 1), (0, 9), (7, 11), (7, 14), (7, 13),
(11, 19), (11, 2), (11, 7), (11, 9), (3, 17), (3, 16), (3, 13), (3, 5), (6, 13), (9, 0),
(9, 11), (9, 16), (13, 12), (13, 7), (13, 3), (13, 6), (5, 3), (5, 14), (14, 10), (14, 12),
(14, 7), (14, 5), (8, 10), (8, 17), (8, 1), (8, 15), (8, 18), (16, 18), (16, 3), (16, 9)

Next, we will perform degree-based ordering by sorting the nodes based on their degrees.
Nodes sorted by their degrees in ascending order: 5, 6, 9, 15, 16, 2, 7, 10, 0, 1, 17, 4, 11, 13, 14, 3, 19, 18, 12, 8

After relabeling the nodes based on their degrees, we can start counting the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [19]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 12>, <0, 1, 14>, <0, 1, 17>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 7, 14>, <0, 7, 13>, <1, 2, 12>, <1, 2, 11>, <1, 2, 19>, <1, 12, 14>, <1, 12, 13>, <1, 12, 2>, <1, 14, 10>, <2, 11, 19>, <2, 12, 13>, <3, 16, 18>, <11, 9, 16>, <13, 7, 14>
