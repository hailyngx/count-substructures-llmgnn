Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) 
(9, 8) (9, 0) 
(1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) 
(3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) 
(4, 7) (4, 8) 
(7, 2) (7, 5) 
(8, 0) 
(5, 7) (5, 0) 
(0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
(2, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 0: 6 connections
Vertex 5: 6 connections
Vertex 6: 6 connections

Triangles:
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 7, 3>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 1>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 7>
<3, 7, 4>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 4>
<5, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [22]
