Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Vertex 6 has 2 connections.
Vertex 8 has 2 connections.
Vertex 0 has 3 connections.
Vertex 12 has 3 connections.
Vertex 14 has 3 connections.
Vertex 5 has 5 connections.
Vertex 7 has 5 connections.
Vertex 10 has 5 connections.
Vertex 1 has 6 connections.
Vertex 11 has 6 connections.
Vertex 13 has 6 connections.
Vertex 9 has 7 connections.
Vertex 2 has 8 connections.
Vertex 3 has 8 connections.
Vertex 4 has 8 connections.

By observing the edges and following the Degree-Based Ordering method mentioned earlier, we find the following triangles:
1. <1, 5, 9>
2. <1, 5, 13>
3. <1, 5, 11>
4. <1, 9, 13>
5. <1, 9, 5>
6. <1, 13, 11>
7. <4, 5, 7>
8. <4, 5, 11>
9. <4, 5, 14>
10. <4, 7, 6>
11. <4, 7, 3>
12. <4, 7, 2>
13. <4, 14, 6>
14. <7, 3, 2>
15. <7, 3, 13>
16. <7, 6, 14>
17. <10, 2, 12>
18. <10, 2, 8>
19. <10, 2, 3>
20. <10, 12, 3>
21. <12, 3, 2>
22. <14, 6, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [22].
