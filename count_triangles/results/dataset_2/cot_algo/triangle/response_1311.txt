Vertex 12: Degree 4
Vertex 18: Degree 5
Vertex 19: Degree 4
Vertex 11: Degree 4
Vertex 13: Degree 4
Vertex 14: Degree 4
Vertex 2: Degree 4
Vertex 0: Degree 3
Vertex 15: Degree 4
Vertex 9: Degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method with the given edges and sorted vertices, the total number of triangles and the unique triangles are as follows:

Total number of triangles: [48]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 10>, <0, 7, 18>, <1, 3, 12>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 3, 14>, <1, 13, 15>, <1, 13, 19>, <2, 6, 12>, <2, 6, 16>, <2, 7, 10>, <2, 7, 16>, <2, 10, 12>, <2, 10, 16>, <2, 12, 16>, <3, 12, 19>, <3, 13, 19>, <5, 8, 17>, <5, 9, 11>, <5, 9, 18>, <5, 9, 15>, <5, 9, 16>, <5, 11, 13>, <5, 14, 16>, <6, 7, 10>, <9, 11, 13>, <9, 11, 19>, <9, 15, 19>, <9, 15, 18>, <9, 16, 18>, <10, 12, 16>, <11, 13, 15>, <11, 13, 18>, <11, 13, 19>, <12, 13, 14>, <12, 13, 16>, <13, 14, 16>, <13, 15, 18>, <13, 15, 19>, <16, 13, 14>, <16, 13, 15>, <16, 13, 18>
