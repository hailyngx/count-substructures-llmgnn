Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The graph vertices sorted by their degrees are:  
Vertex 0 (degree 3)  
Vertex 8 (degree 2)  
Vertex 5 (degree 2)  
Vertex 8 (degree 2)  
Vertex 3 (degree 4)  
Vertex 6 (degree 4)  
Vertex 1 (degree 4)  
Vertex 7 (degree 5)  
Vertex 2 (degree 5)  
Vertex 9 (degree 6)  

Counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following:  
Total number of triangles: [24]  
Unique triangles found: <1, 6, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 7, 3>, <3, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 4>.
