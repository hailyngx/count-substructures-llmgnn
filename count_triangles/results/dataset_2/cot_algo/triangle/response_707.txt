Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 13) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 4) (3, 6) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. The sorted vertices are: 

Node 5: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 5
Node 14: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 6
Node 4: Degree 6
Node 11: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 2

Next, we will process the edges based on the vertices' labels and count the triangles. 

The total number of triangles is [19].

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 4, 12>
<1, 4, 11>
<1, 4, 12>
<0, 1, 13>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 9, 13>
<0, 6, 14>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 12>
<1, 9, 13>
<1, 10, 11>
<1, 10, 14>
<3, 4, 6>
<6, 10, 14>
<7, 10, 11>
<7, 11, 14>
<7, 12, 14>
<11, 12, 14>
