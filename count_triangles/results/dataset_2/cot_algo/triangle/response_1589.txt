Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
0-4, 0-7, 0-3
1-5, 1-9, 1-7, 1-3, 1-8
2-5, 2-6, 2-7, 2-3
3-5, 3-9, 3-1, 3-0, 3-2, 3-8
4-6, 4-8, 4-0
5-9, 5-6, 5-2, 5-1, 5-3
6-9, 6-5, 6-2, 6-4
7-0, 7-2, 7-1
8-4, 8-1, 8-3
9-5, 9-6, 9-3, 9-1

Now, we will list the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:
0 (Degree: 3)
7 (Degree: 3)
4 (Degree: 3)
8 (Degree: 3)
6 (Degree: 4)
2 (Degree: 4)
1 (Degree: 5)
9 (Degree: 5)
3 (Degree: 6)
5 (Degree: 5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles. 

Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 7>
