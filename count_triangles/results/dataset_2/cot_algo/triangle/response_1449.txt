Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 4) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (12, 8) (12, 3) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 4) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. Let's start by sorting the vertices based on their degrees and then proceed to count the triangles.

Vertices sorted by their degrees:
```
4: 5 connections
0: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
10: 4 connections
13: 4 connections
3: 3 connections
7: 3 connections
9: 3 connections
1: 2 connections
2: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
11: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
12: 2 connections
14: 2 connections
```

Now, let's count the triangles:
```
Total number of triangles: [13]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 6, 3>
<0, 10, 13>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 12>
<3, 6, 4>
<3, 7, 12>
<4, 6, 7>
<1, 10, 13>
