Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 2) (8, 17) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 1) (0, 19) (3, 12) (11, 7) (5, 12) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 14) (4, 13) (4, 15) (4, 17) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 15) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 16) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 16) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 17) (15, 0) (15, 4) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 18) (19, 0) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 10) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 14) (16, 1) (16, 6) (10, 19) (10, 18) (10, 14) (18, 15) (18, 10) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. We then proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The sorted vertices with their respective degrees are:
(2:4), (8:3), (0:4), (13:4), (3:1), (11:1), (5:1), (4:3), (12:4), (1:3), (6:3), (7:4), (15:5), (19:4), (17:5), (9:3), (16:2), (10:3), (18:2), (14:3)

Now, we go through the edges:

1. Edge (2, 8) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

2. Edge (2, 0) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

3. Edge (2, 9) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

4. Edge (2, 13) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

5. Edge (8, 17) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

6. Edge (0, 15) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

7. Edge (0, 1) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

8. Edge (0, 19) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

9. Edge (3, 12) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

10. Edge (11, 7) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

11. Edge (5, 12) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

12. Edge (13, 4) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: 15

13. Edge (13, 14) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

14. Edge (4, 15) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: 0, 12, 17

15. Edge (1, 6) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

16. Edge (1, 16) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

17. Edge (7, 11) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

18. Edge (7, 19) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

19. Edge (15, 18) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

20. Edge (19, 10) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

21. Edge (17, 6) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

22. Edge (9, 14) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: 13

23. Edge (16, 6) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

24. Edge (10, 18) - Proceed.
    Shared connections: None

The total number of triangles is [8], and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 15>, <2, 13, 4>, <6, 16, 1>, <9, 14, 13>, <12, 17, 4>, <12, 17, 15>, <12, 15, 4>, <17, 6, 1>.
