Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 11) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 0) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 1) (3, 12) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 11) (10, 4) (10, 14) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 9, 13, 14, 5
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 11, 2, 14
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 11
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 13, 1, 12
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 12, 0, 10, 1
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 0
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 11, 12
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 6, 2, 5
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 5, 11, 12
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 11, 0
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 4, 14
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 8, 1, 14, 2
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, 13, 3
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 12, 3, 0
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 0, 11, 10

Now, let's perform the Degree-Based Ordering as described earlier:

Nodes sorted by the number of connections (from least to most):
2, 9, 10, 5, 0, 8, 14, 6, 1, 3, 12, 11, 13, 4, 7

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 12>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 13, 3>
<1, 4, 12>
<1, 4, 11>
<3, 7, 12>
