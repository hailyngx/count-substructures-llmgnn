Response:
The graph you provided has 30 nodes and 90 edges.

Let's construct the graph with the given edges and then count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. (13, 22), (13, 21), (22, 13), (22, 27), (22, 21), (3, 1), (3, 5)
2. (15, 8), (15, 5), (15, 28), (6, 9), (6, 7), (9, 6), (9, 29), (9, 4), (9, 27), (1, 3), (1, 24), (1, 8), (14, 7), (14, 12), (14, 24), (14, 20), (17, 29), (17, 5), (17, 11), (29, 9), (29, 17), (29, 7)
3. (21, 13), (21, 22), (21, 19), (7, 6), (7, 14), (7, 29), (7, 25), (25, 7), (25, 26), (25, 16), (25, 18), (10, 18), (10, 23), (16, 25), (16, 28), (16, 19), (28, 15), (28, 16), (28, 8), (11, 17), (11, 23), (11, 27), (23, 10), (23, 11), (23, 18), (23, 2), (26, 25), (26, 8), (8, 15), (8, 1), (8, 28), (8, 26), (24, 1), (24, 14), (24, 12), (2, 23), (2, 19), (2, 4), (18, 25), (18, 10), (18, 23), (18, 27), (18, 20), (19, 21), (19, 16), (19, 2), (4, 9)
4. (4, 2), (27, 22), (27, 9), (27, 11), (27, 18), (20, 14), (20, 18), (20, 5), (12, 14), (12, 24), (5, 3), (5, 15), (5, 17), (5, 20)

By ordering the vertices based on their degree, the resulting graph vertices are as follows: <13, 3, 15, 6, 21, 22, 1, 9, 14, 17, 16, 28, 7, 25, 10, 11, 23, 26, 2, 4, 18, 19, 5, 29, 24, 12, 20, 8, 27>.

After identifying and counting the triangles, we find:
Total number of triangles: [18]
Unique triangles found: <1, 8, 15>, <1, 8, 28>, <1, 24, 14>, <1, 24, 12>, <3, 5, 15>, <4, 2, 9>, <4, 2, 27>, <6, 7, 29>, <6, 9, 29>, <8, 15, 28>, <10, 18, 23>, <11, 17, 29>, <11, 23, 18>, <14, 20, 18>, <16, 19, 2>, <16, 19, 21>, <18, 20, 5>, <25, 16, 28>.
