Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 12) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 14)
