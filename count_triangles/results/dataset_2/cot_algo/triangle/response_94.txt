Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 28) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 16) (0, 27) (0, 9) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 11) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 21) (20, 29) (20, 12) (20, 19) (20, 23) (8, 2) (8, 28) (8, 24) (22, 15) (22, 26) (22, 19) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 14) (11, 2) (11, 28) (28, 15) (28, 8) (28, 11) (28, 18) (24, 27) (24, 8) (24, 26) (24, 17) (4, 6) (5, 19) (5, 23) (5, 25) (5, 10) (19, 20) (19, 22) (19, 5) (23, 20) (23, 5) (23, 12) (14, 26) (14, 3) (14, 16) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 16) (17, 2) (17, 24) (17, 6) (7, 9) (3, 14) (12, 20) (12, 23) (12, 21) (12, 9) (16, 27) (16, 14) (16, 6) (16, 10) (10, 5) (10, 16) (10, 9) (18, 28) (18, 1) (18, 21) (18, 13) (25, 15) (25, 5) (21, 29) (21, 12) (21, 18) (13, 18) (13, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 13) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degree is as follows:
Nodes: 7, 1, 4, 3, 13, 10, 11, 28, 26, 8, 22, 18, 6, 25, 2, 15, 21, 3, 14, 20, 5, 12, 0, 27, 17, 19, 16, 24, 29, 9

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
[22, 26, 28] 
[18, 21, 28] 
[10, 12, 21] 
[9, 10, 12] 
[9, 9, 13] 
[0, 9, 27] 
[0, 9, 12] 
[0, 12, 27] 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
