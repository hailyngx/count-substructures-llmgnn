Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 4) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 4) (15, 2) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 2) (13, 14) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 1) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 12) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 14) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 4) (17, 16) (17, 7) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 7) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 5) (1, 10) (1, 18) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 7) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 18) (4, 16) (4, 15) (4, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. List the nodes and their corresponding degrees:
   - Node 0: degree 3
   - Node 1: degree 2
   - Node 2: degree 3
   - Node 3: degree 4
   - Node 4: degree 4
   - Node 5: degree 3
   - Node 6: degree 3
   - Node 7: degree 3
   - Node 8: degree 2
   - Node 9: degree 2
   - Node 10: degree 3
   - Node 11: degree 3
   - Node 12: degree 3
   - Node 13: degree 2
   - Node 14: degree 3
   - Node 15: degree 5
   - Node 16: degree 4
   - Node 17: degree 2
   - Node 18: degree 3
   - Node 19: degree 4

2. Sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
   - Nodes in order: 1, 8, 9, 13, 17, 0, 5, 6, 10, 2, 7, 12, 4, 14, 18, 3, 11, 15, 16, 19

3. Relabel the nodes accordingly:
   - New labels: 
     - Node 1 (old label 1) -> Node 0
     - Node 8 (old label 8) -> Node 1
     - Node 9 (old label 9) -> Node 2
     - Node 13 (old label 13) -> Node 3
     - Node 17 (old label 17) -> Node 4
     - Node 0 (old label 0) -> Node 5
     - Node 5 (old label 5) -> Node 6
     - Node 6 (old label 6) -> Node 7
     - Node 10 (old label 10) -> Node 8
     - Node 2 (old label 2) -> Node 9
     - Node 7 (old label 7) -> Node 10
     - Node 12 (old label 12) -> Node 11
     - Node 4 (old label 4) -> Node 12
     - Node 14 (old label 14) -> Node 13
     - Node 18 (old label 18) -> Node 14
     - Node 3 (old label 3) -> Node 15
     - Node 11 (old label 11) -> Node 16
     - Node 15 (old label 15) -> Node 17
     - Node 16 (old label 16) -> Node 18
     - Node 19 (old label 19) -> Node 19

4. Analyze the edges based on the relabeled nodes:
   - Edges: (5, 6), (5, 0), (5, 15), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 11), (8, 6), (8, 12), (12, 8), (12, 19), (12, 5), (13, 3), (13, 14), (17, 18), (17, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (0, 1), (0, 15), (0, 10), (10, 0), (10, 8), (10, 9), (19, 12), (19, 15), (19, 18), (19, 14), (14, 13), (14, 19), (14, 12), (16, 18), (16, 17), (2, 15), (2, 13), (2, 10), (7, 18), (7, 17), (11, 6), (11, 16), (3, 13), (3, 15), (3, 19), (15, 2), (15, 3), (15, 19), (18, 16), (18, 1), (18, 7), (4, 14), (4, 17)
   
5. Count the triangles based on shared connections:
   There are [17] triangles.
   
6. Unique triangles:
   - <1, 0, 15>
   - <1, 0, 10>
   - <1, 2, 15>
   - <5, 6, 8>
   - <5, 0, 15>
   - <5, 6, 11>
   - <8, 6, 12>
   - <12, 8, 19>
   - <12, 19, 15>
   - <13, 3, 14>
   - <17, 18, 16>
   - <2, 15, 3>
   - <7, 18, 16>
   - <11, 6, 5>
   - <3, 13, 14>
   - <3, 15, 19>
   - <4, 14, 19>
