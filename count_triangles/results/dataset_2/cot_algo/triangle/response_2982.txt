Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 3) (16, 26) (16, 10) (16, 20) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 18) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 2) (27, 28) (18, 15) (18, 14) (18, 17) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 3) (23, 29) (23, 21) (23, 12) (10, 16) (10, 17) (17, 18) (17, 10) (17, 20) (2, 27) (2, 5) (2, 4) (28, 27) (28, 29) (28, 0) (29, 23) (29, 28) (29, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 22) (6, 29) (6, 19) (6, 4) (13, 25) (13, 1) (26, 16) (26, 25) (24, 7) (24, 9) (24, 19) (24, 21) (20, 16) (20, 17) (20, 12) (7, 24) (7, 25) (7, 9) (25, 13) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 8) (8, 11) (8, 25) (8, 12) (9, 24) (9, 7) (4, 11) (4, 27) (4, 2) (4, 6) (21, 22) (21, 23) (21, 24) (0, 15) (0, 28) (0, 3) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 24) (1, 13) (3, 16) (3, 23) (3, 0) (14, 18) (12, 23) (12, 5) (12, 20) (12, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree.

Here is the list of vertices sorted by their degree:
1. 1: degree 1
2. 9: degree 2
3. 13: degree 2
4. 14: degree 2
5. 15: degree 4
6. 24: degree 4
7. 28: degree 4
8. 29: degree 4
9. 5: degree 4
10. 7: degree 4
11. 18: degree 4
12. 2: degree 4
13. 20: degree 4
14. 6: degree 4
15. 17: degree 4
16. 10: degree 4
17. 12: degree 4
18. 19: degree 3
19. 8: degree 3
20. 25: degree 4
21. 27: degree 4
22. 0: degree 3
23. 4: degree 5
24. 23: degree 5
25. 3: degree 3
26. 21: degree 4
27. 11: degree 2
28. 16: degree 5
29. 26: degree 2
30. 22: degree 3

Now, we will count the triangles by examining each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
After analyzing all the edges, the total number of triangles found is: [4]

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 27, 2>
<12, 23, 29>
<12, 20, 17>
<15, 18, 14>
