Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 6) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their degree (number of connections) from least to most. The sorted order of vertices in this case is:
0(3) < 1(3) < 8(3) < 4(3) < 5(4) < 14(4) < 7(4) < 3(4) < 12(4) < 6(5) < 13(5) < 10(6) < 2(6) < 11(6) < 9(6)

Following the method described, we will now count the triangles in the graph:

1. Consider edge (4, 12):
   Both 4 and 12 are neighbors of 10, forming a triangle <4, 10, 12>.

2. Consider edge (4, 10):
   Both 4 and 10 are neighbors of 5, forming a triangle <4, 5, 10>.

3. Consider edge (4, 5):
   Both 4 and 5 are neighbors of 10, forming a triangle <4, 5, 10>.

4. Consider edge (7, 6):
   No triangles formed.

5. Consider edge (7, 9):
   No triangles formed.

6. Consider other edges following the method:
   Only the above triangles are found using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets [] in the given graph is [3].
