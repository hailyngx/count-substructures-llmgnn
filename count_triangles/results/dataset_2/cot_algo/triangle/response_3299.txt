Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in increasing order. Then, we relabel the nodes based on this sorting.

Let's calculate the number of connections for each node first:  
Node 0: 3 connections  
Node 1: 4 connections  
Node 2: 3 connections  
Node 3: 3 connections  
Node 4: 4 connections  
Node 5: 6 connections  
Node 6: 5 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 8: 5 connections  
Node 9: 4 connections  

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:  
Node 0 -> Node 2  
Node 1 -> Node 3  
Node 2 -> Node 0  
Node 3 -> Node 0  
Node 4 -> Node 3  
Node 5 -> Node 1  
Node 6 -> Node 4  
Node 7 -> Node 3  
Node 8 -> Node 4  
Node 9 -> Node 3  

Now, we will list the edges considering only the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections than the other:

Edges:  
Node 0 -> Node 2  
Node 0 -> Node 1  
Node 0 -> Node 3  
Node 1 -> Node 0  
Node 1 -> Node 3  
Node 2 -> Node 0  
Node 3 -> Node 0  
Node 3 -> Node 0  
Node 3 -> Node 1  
Node 4 -> Node 6  
Node 4 -> Node 8  

Now, let's check for shared connections to find the triangles:  
Triangles:  
<0, 1, 3>  
<0, 2, 1>  
<0, 3, 1>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
