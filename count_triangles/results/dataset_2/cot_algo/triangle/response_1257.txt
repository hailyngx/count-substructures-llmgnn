The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (9, 28) (9, 11) (26, 19) (26, 27) (0, 24) (0, 11) (0, 19) (27, 26) (27, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 22) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 20) (3, 4) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 18) (23, 18) (23, 17) (15, 8) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 14) (20, 3) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 10) (19, 26) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 25) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (21, 11) (21, 22) (7, 6) (7, 17) (25, 19) (25, 24) (29, 9) (29, 22) (14, 15) (14, 18) (28, 9) (28, 3) (28, 13) (28, 18) (17, 23) (17, 7) (17, 4) (2, 27) (2, 22) (2, 24) (22, 1) (22, 21) (22, 29) (22, 2) (5, 1) (16, 13) (16, 4) (24, 0) (24, 25) (24, 2) (18, 8) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 28) (18, 12) (12, 20) (12, 18) (13, 1) (13, 28) (13, 16) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 21) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 16) (4, 10) (10, 20) (10, 4) 

Response:
The graph contains the following nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: (9, 29), (9, 28), (9, 11), (26, 19), (26, 27), (0, 24), (0, 11), (0, 19), (27, 26), (27, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 13), (1, 22), (3, 1), (3, 28), (3, 20), (3, 4), (8, 15), (8, 11), (8, 6), (8, 18), (23, 18), (23, 17), (15, 8), (15, 20), (15, 19), (15, 14), (20, 3), (20, 15), (20, 12), (20, 10), (19, 26), (19, 0), (19, 15), (19, 25), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 7), (21, 11), (21, 22), (7, 6), (7, 17), (25, 19), (25...

After sorting the nodes based on their degrees, the new order is:

Nodes: 5, 4, 16, 25, 24, 10, 7, 2, 12, 23, 21, 13, 17, 20, 22, 26, 27, 0, 29, 14, 3, 18, 1, 15, 19, 11, 6, 8, 9, 28
