Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. Here are the degrees of each vertex in ascending order:

Node 4: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 0: Degree 5

Based on these degrees, we will start with the edge (1, 2) since node 1 has the lowest degree among the two. We will proceed through all the edges in the order given.

After counting the triangles, we find that there are:
[12] triangles in the graph.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 2, 5>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 8>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 8, 2>
<6, 8, 2>
