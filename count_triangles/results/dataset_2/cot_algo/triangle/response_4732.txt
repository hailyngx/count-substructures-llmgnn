Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 13) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 13) (18, 19) (18, 10) (22, 2) (22, 21) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 29) (20, 3) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 2) (12, 27) (12, 28) (8, 26) (23, 15) (23, 17) (23, 14) (15, 20) (15, 23) (15, 11) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 13) (6, 21) (6, 10) (6, 26) (6, 4) (21, 27) (21, 22) (21, 6) (21, 29) (29, 20) (29, 21) (29, 5) (29, 10) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (2, 22) (2, 25) (2, 16) (19, 18) (19, 20) (19, 28) (16, 2) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 26) (7, 17) (11, 0) (11, 15) (11, 9) (5, 25) (5, 29) (3, 0) (3, 20) (3, 4) (3, 14) (24, 17) (24, 28) (14, 23) (14, 3) (26, 8) (26, 6) (26, 7) (10, 18) (10, 6) (10, 29) (10, 7) (1, 7) (1, 13) (17, 23) (17, 9) (17, 7) (17, 24) (13, 0) (13, 27) (13, 9) (13, 1) (28, 12) (28, 19) (28, 24) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
- 0: 3, 11, 4, 13
- 1: 13, 7
- 2: 22, 25, 16
- 3: 0, 20, 4, 14
- 4: 0, 6, 3
- 5: 25, 29
- 6: 21, 10, 26, 4
- 7: 10, 1, 26, 17
- 8: 26
- 9: 11, 17, 13, 1
- 10: 18, 6, 29, 7
- 11: 0, 15, 9
- 12: 27, 28
- 13: 0, 27, 9, 1
- 14: 23, 3
- 15: 20, 23, 11
- 16: 2
- 17: 23, 9, 7, 24
- 18: 19, 10
- 19: 18, 20, 28
- 20: 25, 15, 29, 3, 19
- 21: 27, 22, 6, 29
- 22: 2, 21
- 23: 15, 17, 14
- 24: 17, 28
- 25: 20, 2, 5
- 26: 8, 6, 7
- 27: 12, 21, 13
- 28: 12, 19, 24
- 29: 20, 21, 5, 10

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method by sorting the nodes based on their degree, we get the following labels:
8, 0, 16, 14, 5, 22, 3, 4, 1, 11, 18, 24, 28, 9, 13, 6, 7, 19, 25, 12, 26, 29, 15, 17, 20, 2, 10, 23, 27

Now, counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find:
Total number of triangles: [12]
Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 4>
<4, 6, 21>
<4, 6, 10>
<4, 6, 26>
<4, 6, 29>
<0, 3, 20>
<0, 13, 27>
<0, 13, 1>
<0, 11, 15>
<0, 11, 9>
<3, 14, 23>
<17, 24, 28>
