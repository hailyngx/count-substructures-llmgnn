Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 18) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 0) (8, 14) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 19) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 17) (17, 13) (17, 9) (6, 8) (6, 14) (16, 3) (16, 7) (14, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 6) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 19) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 9) (12, 11) (12, 10) (10, 4) (10, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 0 has degree 5
Vertex 1 has degree 3
Vertex 2 has degree 3
Vertex 3 has degree 5
Vertex 4 has degree 5
Vertex 5 has degree 2
Vertex 6 has degree 3
Vertex 7 has degree 5
Vertex 8 has degree 2
Vertex 9 has degree 4
Vertex 10 has degree 2
Vertex 11 has degree 3
Vertex 12 has degree 2
Vertex 13 has degree 2
Vertex 14 has degree 4
Vertex 15 has degree 2
Vertex 16 has degree 2
Vertex 17 has degree 2
Vertex 18 has degree 4
Vertex 19 has degree 3

We will use this ordering to count the triangles:

Triangles: [24]
Triangles found: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 11>, <0, 2, 18>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 14>, <0, 4, 19>, <0, 7, 11>, <0, 14, 18>, <0, 18, 2>, <0, 18, 7>, <0, 18, 14>, <1, 3, 11>, <1, 7, 11>, <2, 18, 14>, <4, 7, 11>, <4, 9, 19>, <4, 14, 18>, <7, 16, 18>, <9, 17, 19>, <9, 19, 4>, <10, 12, 4>, <14, 6, 8>, <14, 5, 6>
