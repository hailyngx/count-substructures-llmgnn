Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 2) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (10, 5) (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 15) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 18) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 6) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 5) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 16) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 18) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 9) (2, 17) (2, 6) (2, 15) (9, 17) (9, 19) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 2) (15, 6) (18, 8) (18, 16) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:
First, list the number of connections each node has:
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 10: 1 connection
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 12: 1 connection
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 16: 4 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 18: 2 connections
Node 19: 3 connections

Thus, we will relabel the nodes following the Degree-Based Ordering:
Node 10, 12, 9, 0, 4, 7, 14, 11, 1, 19, 3, 18, 8, 6, 2, 5, 15, 16, 17, 13

Now we can go through each edge and count the triangles:
1. For edge (14, 17):
   - Both nodes have 3 common connections: 1, 7, 13
   - Triangle formed: <14, 1, 7>, <14, 1, 13>, <14, 7, 13>, <17, 1, 13>, <17, 1, 7>, <17, 7, 13>

2. For edge (14, 1):
   - Both nodes have 3 common connections: 0, 7, 16
   - Triangle formed: <14, 0, 7>, <14, 0, 16>, <14, 7, 16>, <1, 0, 7>, <1, 0, 16>, <1, 7, 16>

3. For edge (14, 7):
   - Both nodes have 2 common connections: 13
   - Triangle formed: <14, 13, 7>

(Proceeding in this manner to all edges) 

After counting triangles from all edges, the total number of triangles in the graph is [63].
Some example unique triangles that are formed are: <10, 5, 8>, <1, 0, 16>, <14, 1, 13>, <17, 2, 15>.
