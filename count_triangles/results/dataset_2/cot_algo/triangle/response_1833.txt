Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 13) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
Let's first list the nodes with their corresponding connections:

0: 6, 10, 3, 13
1: 7, 10, 3, 5
2: 11, 3, 8, 12, 5
3: 1, 0, 2
4: 6, 7, 8, 5
5: 4, 1, 2
6: 9, 14, 12, 4, 0, 13
7: 4, 12, 11, 10, 1
8: 4, 2
9: 6, 14, 13
10: 7, 11, 0, 1
11: 7, 10, 14, 2
12: 6, 7, 2, 14
13: 6, 9, 0, 14
14: 6, 9, 11, 12, 13

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degree in ascending order:

1, 8, 9, 13, 0, 5, 2, 3, 10, 11, 4, 14, 12, 6, 7

Next, we scan the edges based on the sorted nodes:

1 (1, 7)
8 (8, 2)
9 (9, 6) (9, 14)
13 (13, 6) (13, 9)
0 (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 13)
5 (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2)
2 (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 8)
3 (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2)
10 (10, 7) (10, 11)
11 (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14)
4 (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5)
14 (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 13)
12 (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14)

There are 19 triangles in total.
