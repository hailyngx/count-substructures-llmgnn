Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 12) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 4) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 4) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 6) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: <br>
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 14), (9, 14), (9, 7), (9, 13), (9, 12), (8, 13), (13, 3), (13, 10), (13, 7), (7, 12), (12, 0), (12, 6), (2, 1), (2, 11), (2, 4), (0, 3), (14, 12), (3, 11), (11, 1), (1, 10), (6, 10), (6, 4)

Next, we sort the nodes based on their degree: <br>
0(2), 1(3), 2(3), 10(3), 4(3), 6(3), 5(4), 8(2), 9(5), 14(4), 3(3), 7(5), 12(6), 11(5), 13(5)

Now, we count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering method:

Triangles: 15

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
