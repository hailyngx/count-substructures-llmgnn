Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 2)
(1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 7)
(2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 0)
(3, 9), (3, 0), (3, 2)
(4, 5), (4, 2), (4, 1)
(5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 4)
(6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 2)
(7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 8)
(8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 7), (8, 0)
(9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 1)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

Nodes by degree:
1: 4 connections (Node 3)
2: 5 connections (Node 4, Node 6, Node 8)
3: 6 connections (Node 0, Node 1, Node 7)
4: 7 connections (Node 9, Node 2)
5: 8 connections (Node 5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Start with the edge (9, 5) since Node 9 has fewer connections than Node 5.
  - Shared connections: (9, 8), (5, 4)
- Continue with the edge (9, 6) since Node 9 has fewer connections than Node 6.
  - Shared connections: (9, 8), (6, 7)
- Continue with the edge (9, 8) since Node 9 has fewer connections than Node 8.
  - Shared connections: (9, 5), (9, 6)
- Continue with the edge (9, 3) since Node 9 has fewer connections than Node 3.
  - Shared connections: None

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles:
<9, 8, 5>, <9, 8, 6>, <9, 5, 4>
