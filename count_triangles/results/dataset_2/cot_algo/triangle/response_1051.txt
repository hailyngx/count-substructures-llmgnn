Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 18) (13, 8) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 18) (14, 0) (14, 5) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 19) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 16) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 19) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 2) (16, 1) (16, 15) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 5) (6, 15) (6, 2) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 6) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 15) (5, 4) (12, 11) (12, 8) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 20 nodes and the given 60 edges:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(1, 3) (1, 16) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 4) 
(10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) 
(8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 18) (13, 8) 
(17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 7) 
(0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 18) (14, 0) 
(14, 5) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 5) 
(9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 19) 
(15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 16)
(18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 19) 
(19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 2) 
(16, 1) (16, 15) 
(4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 5) 
(6, 15) (6, 2) 
(2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 6) 
(5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 15) (5, 4) 
(12, 11) (12, 8)
```

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 12 has degree 2
- Node 13 has degree 2
- Node 14 has degree 2
- Node 16 has degree 3
- Node 18 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 5
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 4
- Node 11 has degree 4
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 10 has degree 4
- Node 17 has degree 4
- Node 19 has degree 3
- Node 15 has degree 5

Next, we will list the triangles and count the number of unique triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 14>
<0, 7, 17>
<0, 14, 5>
<2, 6, 15>
<3, 4, 11>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<5, 4, 9>
<7, 17, 3>
<8, 9, 4>
<8, 12, 11>
<8, 12, 18>
<9, 4, 11>
<10, 11, 4>
<10, 11, 17>
<10, 15, 0>
<11, 4, 9>
<15, 16, 1>
<15, 5, 4>

Total number of triangles: [20]
