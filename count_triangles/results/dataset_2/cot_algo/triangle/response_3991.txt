Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 4) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 5) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 1) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the nodes by their number of connections from least to most and then checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge. Let's start by constructing the graph.

The 15 nodes are labeled from 0 to 14. The edges in the graph are:
(0, 14), (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 9)
(1, 11), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9)
(2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 4)
(3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 10), (3, 13), (3, 4)
(4, 12), (4, 14), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 10), (4, 1)
(5, 12), (5, 0), (5, 10), (5, 1)
(7, 12), (7, 3), (7, 13)
(8, 12), (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 11), (8, 3)
(9, 0), (9, 14), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 13)
(10, 3), (10, 4), (10, 5)
(11, 8), (11, 1), (11, 13)
(12, 7), (12, 4), (12, 5), (12, 14), (12, 8)
(13, 7), (13, 14), (13, 3), (13, 11), (13, 9)

Let's sort the nodes by their degrees:
Node 6: degree 0
Nodes 0, 1, 2, 10, 11: degree 1
Nodes 5, 7, 13: degree 2
Nodes 3, 9: degree 4
Nodes 4, 8, 12: degree 5
Node 14: degree 6

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. <5, 4, 12> and <3, 4, 13> are the only unique triangles formed:
Total number of triangles: [2]
