Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and relabelling them accordingly. 

Here is the list of vertices sorted by their degree:
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 6
Node 2: Degree 6
Node 5: Degree 6

Now, we will check each edge based on the degree of the vertices:

Edges involving Node 9: (5, 9), (9, 5), (9, 2), (9, 0)
Edges involving Node 7: (4, 7), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 1)
Edges involving Node 6: (4, 6), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 3)
Edges involving Node 8: (5, 8), (8, 5), (8, 2), (8, 6)
Edges involving Node 0: (9, 0), (0, 9), (0, 7), (0, 2), (0, 3)
Edges involving Node 4: (7, 4), (4, 7), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 3)
Edges involving Node 1: (5, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7)
Edges involving Node 3: (4, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (0, 3), (6, 3), (3, 6)
Edges involving Node 2: (5, 2), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 2)
Edges involving Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 3), (3, 5)

Now, we count the number of triangles:
- There are 2 triangles: <5, 2, 9> and <4, 1, 7>.

The total number of triangles is [2].
