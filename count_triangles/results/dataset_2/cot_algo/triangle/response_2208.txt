Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
Node 0: degree 5
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 6
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4

Based on the degree-based ordering method, we will relabel the nodes as follows:
Node 0 -> 1
Node 1 -> 6
Node 2 -> 5
Node 3 -> 2
Node 4 -> 4
Node 5 -> 8
Node 6 -> 0
Node 7 -> 3
Node 8 -> 7
Node 9 -> 9

Now, starting with the edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:
(0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 3) (3, 8) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 8)

Counting the triangles formed by shared connections:
<0, 2, 5>
<3, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
