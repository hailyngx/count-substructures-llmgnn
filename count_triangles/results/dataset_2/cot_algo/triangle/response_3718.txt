Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 11) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 3) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 14) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 1) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the number of triangles in this graph. 

By sorting the nodes based on their degree of connections in ascending order, we assign the following labels to the nodes:
0 - degree 4
1 - degree 4
2 - degree 3
3 - degree 5
4 - degree 5
5 - degree 4
6 - degree 3
7 - degree 5
8 - degree 5
9 - degree 5
10 - degree 3
11 - degree 4
12 - degree 5
13 - degree 5
14 - degree 4

Now, let's go through each edge and count the number of triangles:

For edge (0, 3):
Node 0 has fewer connections so we proceed.
Shared connections with node 3: 7
Triangle found: <0, 3, 7>

For edge (0, 7):
Node 0 has fewer connections so we proceed.
Shared connections with node 7: 12
Triangle found: <0, 7, 12>

For edge (0, 9):
Node 0 has fewer connections so we proceed.
Shared connections with node 9: None

For edge (1, 8):
Node 1 has fewer connections so we proceed.
Shared connections with node 8: 4
Triangle found: <1, 8, 4>

For edge (2, 10):
Node 2 has fewer connections so we proceed.
Shared connections with node 10: None

For edge (3, 11):
Node 3 has fewer connections so we proceed.
Shared connections with node 11: 0
Triangle found: <3, 11, 0>

There are no more edges to go through, and the triangles found are:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 7, 12>
<1, 8, 4>
<3, 11, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
