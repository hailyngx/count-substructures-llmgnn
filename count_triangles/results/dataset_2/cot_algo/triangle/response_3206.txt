Now, let's identify the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Relabel the vertices by the number of connections in increasing order:

- Nodes with 1 connection: 1, 5, 8
- Nodes with 2 connections: 2
- Nodes with 3 connections: 9, 22
- Nodes with 4 connections: 6, 8, 11, 16
- Nodes with 5 connections: 3, 4, 10
- Nodes with 6 connections: 0, 23
- Nodes with 7 connections: 13, 14, 17
- Nodes with 8 connections: 12, 15
- Nodes with 9 connections: 18, 19, 20, 21, 26, 27, 28, 29

2. Check for shared connections between vertices with lower labels:

- Node 5 (1 connection) can't form triangles.
- Node 8 (1 connection) can't form triangles.
- Node 22 (3 connections) connects with 10, 20, so <10, 20, 22> is a triangle.

Counting the triangles found:
There is only 1 unique triangle found, thus the total number of triangles is [1].
