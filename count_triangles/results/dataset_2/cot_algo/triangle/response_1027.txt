Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 26) (11, 4) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 22) (2, 24) (29, 17) (29, 7) (0, 15) (27, 12) (27, 10) (27, 23) (22, 16) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 8) (23, 27) (23, 22) (23, 18) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 15) (1, 26) (1, 7) (1, 19) (26, 11) (26, 1) (26, 20) (17, 29) (17, 15) (28, 14) (28, 5) (7, 29) (7, 1) (7, 25) (7, 14) (7, 13) (25, 7) (25, 19) (3, 20) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (21, 16) (21, 13) (4, 11) (4, 22) (4, 3) (10, 27) (10, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (8, 22) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 17) (19, 1) (19, 25) (19, 9) (24, 16) (24, 2) (24, 13) (13, 7) (13, 21) (13, 6) (13, 24) (13, 18) (18, 23) (18, 13) (20, 11) (20, 26) (20, 3) (20, 9) (20, 5) (9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 20) (9, 14) (5, 12) (5, 28) (5, 3) (5, 20) (5, 14) (14, 28) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves:
1. Sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most.
2. Relabelling the vertices accordingly.

Below is the list of vertices sorted by degree:
- Node 0: 1 connection
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 10: 2 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 28: 2 connections
- Node 29: 2 connections
- Node 27: 3 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 25: 2 connections
- Node 18: 2 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 26: 4 connections
- Node 19: 3 connections
- Node 23: 3 connections
- Node 21: 2 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 7: 5 connections
- Node 22: 4 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 24: 4 connections
- Node 5: 5 connections
- Node 11: 4 connections
- Node 15: 3 connections
- Node 13: 5 connections
- Node 16: 4 connections
- Node 14: 4 connections
- Node 12: 3 connections
- Node 20: 5 connections
- Node 17: 2 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [158].

Here are some of the unique triangles found:
- <0, 15, 17>
- <1, 9, 19>
- <3, 5, 20>
- <4, 3, 22>
- <7, 9, 14>
