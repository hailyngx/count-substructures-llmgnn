Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 14) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 15) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 3) (7, 10) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 18) (16, 7) (2, 3) (12, 14) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 1) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 6) (1, 18) (1, 6) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 14) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 15) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 13) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 15) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 19. By sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, we get the following new labels for the nodes: 

Node 0 -> Degree 3
Node 1 -> Degree 2
Node 2 -> Degree 2
Node 16 -> Degree 2
Node 5 -> Degree 2
Node 12 -> Degree 2
Node 9 -> Degree 2
Node 3 -> Degree 4
Node 11 -> Degree 4
Node 14 -> Degree 4
Node 6 -> Degree 4
Node 13 -> Degree 4
Node 7 -> Degree 4
Node 15 -> Degree 4
Node 8 -> Degree 5
Node 17 -> Degree 5
Node 19 -> Degree 5
Node 4 -> Degree 6
Node 18 -> Degree 6
Node 10 -> Degree 6

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [59].
