Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 28) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 14) (9, 23) (20, 26) (20, 6) (20, 28) (25, 6) (25, 29) (25, 4) (25, 21) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 19) (28, 5) (28, 20) (28, 29) (28, 12) (28, 27) (29, 9) (29, 25) (29, 28) (29, 8) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 27) (26, 20) (26, 19) (26, 3) (26, 0) (22, 7) (1, 15) (1, 16) (15, 1) (15, 4) (15, 21) (10, 2) (10, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 23) (13, 7) (17, 13) (17, 4) (17, 7) (0, 26) (6, 20) (6, 25) (6, 2) (6, 24) (6, 4) (24, 6) (24, 23) (11, 23) (23, 9) (23, 13) (23, 24) (23, 11) (8, 29) (8, 3) (8, 27) (21, 25) (21, 15) (21, 14) (27, 28) (27, 19) (27, 8) (16, 1) (16, 10) (12, 28) (3, 26) (3, 13) (3, 8) (7, 22) (7, 13) (7, 17) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 21) (4, 25) (4, 2) (4, 15) (4, 17) (4, 6) 

Response:
Nodes: 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 28), (9, 5), (9, 29), (9, 14), (9, 23), (20, 26), (20, 6), (20, 28), (25, 6), (25, 29), (25, 4), (25, 21), (2, 18), (2, 6), (2, 10), (2, 14), (2, 4), (18, 2), (18, 19), (28, 5), (28, 20), (28, 29), (28, 12), (28, 27), (29, 9), (29, 25), (29, 28), (29, 8), (19, 18), (19, 26), (19, 27), (26, 20), (26, 19), (26, 3), (26, 0), (22, 7), (1, 15), (1, 16), (15, 1), (15, 4), (15, 21), (10, 2), (10, 16), (13, 17), (13, 3), (13, 23), (13, 7), (17, 13), (17, 4), (17, 7), (0, 26), (6, 20), (6, 25), (6, 2), (6, 24), (6, 4), (24, 6), (24, 23), (11, 23), (23, 9), (23, 13), (23, 24), (23, 11), (8, 29), (8, 3), (8, 27), (21, 25), (21, 15), (21, 14), (27, 28), (27, 19), (27, 8), (16, 1), (16, 10), (12, 28), (3, 26), (3, 13), (3, 8), (7, 22), (9, 14), (14, 21), (4, 25), (4, 15), (4, 17)

By sorting the nodes based on the number of connections in ascending order, we get:
[11, 22, 0, 16, 19, 27, 1, 10, 21, 12, 7, 24, 8, 15, 20, 29, 5, 17, 18, 6, 13, 2, 14, 4, 25, 9, 23, 28, 3, 26]

In this case, we need to check each edge to see how many triangles they form based on the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Triangles:
[<2, 6, 20>, <2, 6, 25>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 6, 24>, <2, 6, 14>, <6, 20, 28>, <6, 20, 25>, <6, 20, 4>, <6, 20, 24>, <6, 25, 29>, <6, 4, 25>, <6, 4, 24>, <20, 26, 28>, <20, 26, 19>, <20, 26, 3>, <20, 6, 25>, <20, 6, 24>, <20, 28, 29>, <20, 28, 12>, <6, 25, 29>, <6, 25, 21>, <6, 25, 4>, <6, 25, 24>, <6, 14, 2>, <24, 6, 23>, <24, 23, 11>, <23, 9, 29>, <23, 9, 14>, <23, 9, 13>, <23, 13, 3>, <23, 13, 7>, <23, 13, 24>, <23, 24, 11>, <23, 24, 6>, <23, 24, 13>, <23, 11, 24>, <23, 24, 6>, <4, 25, 21>, <4, 25, 15>, <4, 25, 17>]
