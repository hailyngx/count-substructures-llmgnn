Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 1) (16, 4) (9, 29) (9, 3) (9, 1) (26, 24) (26, 8) (2, 7) (29, 9) (29, 18) (3, 9) (3, 25) (3, 28) (25, 3) (25, 19) (25, 14) (25, 10) (8, 26) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 14) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 14) (23, 27) (12, 22) (12, 27) (12, 1) (27, 23) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 5) (5, 27) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 1) (6, 20) (24, 11) (24, 26) (24, 7) (21, 16) (21, 6) (21, 20) (21, 18) (10, 25) (10, 7) (15, 22) (15, 23) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 19) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 6) (19, 25) (19, 28) (19, 7) (18, 29) (18, 27) (18, 21) (18, 0) (14, 25) (14, 13) (14, 23) (20, 6) (20, 21) (0, 5) (0, 18) (17, 11) (17, 28) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 24) (7, 10) (7, 19) (4, 16) (4, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps efficiently count the number of triangles in the given graph. 
Let's start by sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices sorted by degree (from least to most):
{2, 13, 15, 20} - degree: 1
{0, 10, 18, 29} - degree: 2
{5, 6, 13, 14, 20, 23, 27} - degree: 3
{7, 8, 12, 17, 19, 22, 25, 28} - degree: 4
{4, 9, 11, 16, 21, 24, 26} - degree: 5
{1} - degree: 6
{3} - degree: 5

Now, we will list the unique triangles found:
<1, 6, 8>
<7, 8, 19>
<7, 8, 24>
<7, 10, 24>
<7, 10, 19>
<7, 19, 28>
<10, 19, 25>
<5, 6, 20>
<5, 6, 21>
<5, 6, 26>
<5, 27, 23>
<15, 22, 23>
<18, 21, 29>
<0, 18, 29>
<0, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 16>
<4, 16, 24>
<9, 11, 16>
<3, 9, 25>
<3, 9, 28>
<14, 19, 25>
<14, 19, 28>
<12, 22, 27>
<1, 8, 12>
<1, 12, 27>
<1, 6, 20>
<1, 16, 24>
<13, 14, 23>
<7, 8, 17>
<7, 8, 26>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [29].
