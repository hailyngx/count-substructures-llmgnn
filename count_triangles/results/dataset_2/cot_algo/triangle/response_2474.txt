Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 5) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 1) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (5, 16) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 17) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 0) (8, 6) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 13) (12, 16) (12, 1) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 19) (1, 15) (1, 12) (1, 19) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: 17, 18, 14, 13
- 1: 15, 12, 19
- 2: 3, 18, 19
- 3: 11, 15, 7, 2
- 5: 16, 9, 18, 17
- 6: 9, 10, 19, 8
- 7: 16, 3, 17, 13
- 8: 6
- 9: 6, 5, 14, 10
- 10: 6, 9, 17
- 11: 3
- 12: 16, 1
- 13: 0, 7, 19
- 14: 9, 0
- 15: 3, 1
- 16: 7, 12, 5
- 17: 5, 10, 0, 7
- 18: 5, 2, 19, 0
- 19: 6, 2, 18, 13, 1

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Vertices sorted by degree: 8, 1, 2, 11, 15, 10, 12, 14, 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, 3, 16, 17, 18, 19

Triangles found:
1. <17, 0, 7>
2. <9, 6, 10>
