Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 13) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. 
Here are the steps to follow:

1. Sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):
   Node 11 -> Node 8 -> Node 6 -> Node 13 -> Node 3 -> Node 12 -> Node 4 -> Node 7 -> Node 0 -> Node 1 -> Node 2 -> Node 9 -> Node 10 -> Node 5 -> Node 14

2. Count the triangles by checking for shared connections for each edge:
   - Triangles involving Node 11: None
   - Triangles involving Node 8: None
   - Triangles involving Node 6: <1, 6, 10>
   - Triangles involving Node 13: None
   - Triangles involving Node 3: <0, 3, 7> <3, 7, 13> <3, 2, 13>
   - Triangles involving Node 12: <1, 12, 14> <2, 12, 13>
   - Triangles involving Node 4: None
   - Triangles involving Node 7: <0, 7, 13> <7, 2, 13>
   - Triangles involving Node 0: <1, 0, 6> <1, 0, 14> <0, 2, 7> <0, 3, 8> <0, 7, 14>
   - Triangles involving Node 1: <9, 1, 6> <1, 12, 14>
   - Triangles involving Node 2: <7, 2, 13> <2, 12, 13>
   - Triangles involving Node 9: <1, 9, 12>
   - Triangles involving Node 10: <1, 6, 10> <10, 11, 2>

3. Total number of triangles: [18]
