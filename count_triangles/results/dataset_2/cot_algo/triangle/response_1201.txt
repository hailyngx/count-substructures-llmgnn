Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 11) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 6) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on the number of connections they have. Let's relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertices with the least connections:
Node 0: 1 edge
Node 5: 3 edges
Node 11: 3 edges
Node 13: 3 edges
Node 8: 4 edges
Node 1: 4 edges
Node 6: 4 edges

Vertices with the most connections:
Node 2: 5 edges
Node 10: 5 edges
Node 12: 5 edges
Node 14: 5 edges
Node 3: 6 edges
Node 4: 6 edges
Node 7: 6 edges
Node 9: 6 edges

Let's count the number of triangles based on this relabeling. 

Total number of triangles: [10]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 11>, <0, 10, 12>, <0, 10, 3>, <1, 13, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 13>, <3, 10, 12>, <4, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 11>, <6, 12, 10>
