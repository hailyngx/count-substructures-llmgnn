Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 16) (6, 16) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 13) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 7) (18, 8) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 2) (14, 0) (5, 15) (5, 19) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 1) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 16) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 19) (7, 18) (7, 19) (7, 16) (16, 15) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 7) (8, 10) (8, 18) (8, 0) (8, 17) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and their connections based on the provided edges:

0: [3, 14, 8]
1: [9, 13, 19]
2: [15, 14, 17]
3: [15, 0, 10, 9]
4: [10, 13, 12]
5: [15, 19]
6: [16]
7: [18, 19, 16]
8: [10, 18, 0, 17]
9: [3, 11, 1]
10: [3, 4, 8]
11: [9, 13]
12: [13, 4, 16]
13: [11, 4, 1, 12]
14: [2, 0]
15: [3, 5, 2, 16]
16: [6, 12, 7, 15]
17: [2, 19, 8]
18: [7, 8]
19: [5, 7, 17, 1]
