Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes 0 to 9 have the following number of connections:
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges and count triangles:

1. Edge (2, 9):
   - Node 2 has 5 connections, Node 9 has 4 connections.
   - Triangle formed with shared connections: <2, 9, 7>

2. Edge (1, 8):
   - Node 1 has 4 connections, Node 8 has 6 connections.
   - Triangle formed with shared connections: <1, 8, 4>

3. Edge (3, 1):
   - Node 3 has 4 connections, Node 1 has 4 connections.
   - Triangle formed with shared connections: <3, 1, 4>

4. Edge (4, 1):
   - Node 4 has 4 connections, Node 1 has 4 connections.
   - Triangle formed with shared connections: <4, 1, 3>

5. Edge (8, 2):
   - Node 8 has 6 connections, Node 2 has 5 connections.
   - Triangle formed with shared connections: <8, 2, 4>

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: <2, 9, 7>, <1, 8, 4>, <3, 1, 4>, <4, 1, 3>, <8, 2, 4>
