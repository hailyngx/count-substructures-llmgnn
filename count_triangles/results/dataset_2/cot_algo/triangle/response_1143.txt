Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree of connections are: 

Node 1: 1 connection  
Node 6: 2 connections  
Node 8: 2 connections  
Node 9: 3 connections  
Node 0: 4 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 3: 4 connections  
Node 2: 6 connections  
Node 5: 6 connections  
Node 4: 6 connections  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles now:

Triangles:
