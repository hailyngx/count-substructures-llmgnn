Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 12) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Nodes sorted by degree: 
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections

Following the method of connecting nodes with lower labels to nodes with higher labels, the triangles and their counts are as follows:

[Total number of triangles: 24]
