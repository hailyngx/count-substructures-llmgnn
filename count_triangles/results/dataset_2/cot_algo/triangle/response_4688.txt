Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves the following steps:
1. Sort vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order.
2. Relabel the vertices based on the sorted order.
3. For each edge, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
4. Check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to find triangles.

Given the graph information, let's first list the nodes with their degrees:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 5

Based on the sorted order of degrees, we will relabel the nodes: {0: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 7: 4, 8: 5, 4: 6, 1: 7, 9: 8, 6: 9, 5: 10}

Now, we consider the edges while applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles efficiently:
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in total, and they are represented by the unique combinations provided. Hence, the output will be: [12].
