Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 9) (1, 27) (21, 1) (21, 18) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 19) (7, 27) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 20) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 15) (23, 24) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 2) (20, 22) (20, 0) (20, 13) (26, 28) (26, 5) (26, 12) (26, 17) (28, 0) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 13) (15, 22) (15, 23) (15, 18) (11, 23) (11, 19) (25, 24) (27, 1) (27, 7) (5, 23) (5, 26) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 17) (6, 24) (6, 10) (6, 3) (24, 7) (24, 23) (24, 25) (24, 6) (17, 26) (17, 5) (12, 26) (12, 5) (12, 16) (12, 8) (16, 12) (16, 19) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 29) (9, 1) (9, 28) (9, 2) (29, 14) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 9) (10, 6) (10, 13) (18, 21) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 8) (13, 20) (13, 28) (13, 19) (13, 10) (8, 12) (8, 18) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will now count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

First, we need to sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):
Node 16 and 29 have degree 2,
Nodes 0, 1, 4, 8, 10 and 25 have degree 3,
Nodes 3, 6, 9, 11, 18 and 21 have degree 4,
Nodes 5, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20 and 22 have degree 5,
Nodes 2, 7 and 24 have degree 6,
Nodes 12 and 26 have degree 7,
Nodes 23 and 27 have degree 8,
Nodes 14 and 28 have degree 9.

Now we can proceed with counting triangles following the method mentioned earlier. 

The total number of triangles is [68].

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 12, 26>
<5, 17, 26>
<6, 10, 13>
<0, 13, 20>
<0, 20, 22>
<1, 7, 27>
<1, 9, 28>
<2, 9, 28>
<2, 3, 14>
<2, 14, 29>
<3, 6, 10>
<6, 24, 7>
<18, 15, 22>
<18, 21, 1>
<19, 7, 27>
<19, 11, 23>
<19, 13, 10>
<19, 16, 12>
<24, 6, 10>
<24, 6, 3>
<24, 7, 19>
<24, 7, 27>
<24, 23, 15>
<24, 23, 5>
<25, 24, 6>
<26, 12, 16>
<27, 1, 21>
<27, 1, 9>
<28, 0, 20>
