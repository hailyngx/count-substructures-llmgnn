Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 14) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 9) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) 

Response:
The graph described has the following connections:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 5, 12, 10, 9.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 2, 9.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 3, 10.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 14, 6, 2.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 2.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 0, 10, 14.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 8, 14.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 0, 11, 10, 1.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 11, 6.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 0, 11.
Node 10 is connected to nodes 7, 13, 5, 0, 2, 14.
Node 11 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 13, 9.
Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 13, 0.
Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 12, 11, 10.
Node 14 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 10.

Now, let's rearrange the nodes based on the number of connections:
Nodes in decreasing order of connections:
11, 10, 7, 13, 0, 4, 14, 1, 5, 2, 3, 12, 9, 6, 8.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph. 

There are a total of [23] triangles.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 5, 10>
<0, 9, 1>
<3, 2, 4>
<3, 6, 14>
<7, 10, 13>
<7, 10, 0>
<7, 11, 13>
<7, 1, 4>
<10, 14, 5>
<11, 7, 10>
<12, 13, 7>
<12, 13, 5>
<13, 11, 7>
<14, 3, 6>
