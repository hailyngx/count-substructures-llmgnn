Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 19) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 13) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 3) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 9) (5, 10) (5, 3) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 15) (13, 17) (13, 0) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (6, 18) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (15, 19) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 6) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 14) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires arranging the nodes in order of their degrees. Let's calculate the degree of each node in the given graph:

- Node 0: degree=6
- Node 1: degree=3
- Node 2: degree=4
- Node 3: degree=5
- Node 4: degree=2
- Node 5: degree=2
- Node 6: degree=2
- Node 7: degree=3
- Node 8: degree=5
- Node 9: degree=3
- Node 10: degree=2
- Node 11: degree=3
- Node 12: degree=4
- Node 13: degree=2
- Node 14: degree=3
- Node 15: degree=2
- Node 16: degree=3
- Node 17: degree=4
- Node 18: degree=4
- Node 19: degree=3

Arranging the nodes in non-decreasing order of their degrees: 4-5-6-10-13-15-0-1-5-9-16-7-14-3-2-17-18-11-12-19

After relabeling the nodes accordingly, we can now count the triangles:

Identifying the triangles:
- <0, 2, 14>
- <0, 2, 1>
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 2, 12>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 3, 18>
- <0, 3, 12>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 1, 13>
- <2, 1, 9>
- <2, 1, 14>
- <2, 1, 12>

Total number of triangles: [14]
