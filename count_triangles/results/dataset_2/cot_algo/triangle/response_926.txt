Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 6) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 13) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 3), (5, 14), 
(9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 11), (9, 10), 
(4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 3), 
(7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 8), (7, 1), 
(3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 14), (3, 2), (3, 12), 
(11, 9), (11, 6), (11, 8), 
(0, 7), (0, 12), (0, 13), (0, 2), 
(8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 7), (8, 11), 
(1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 14), (1, 10), (1, 13), 
(6, 11), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 12), (6, 13), 
(2, 3), (2, 0), (2, 6), (2, 14), 
(12, 3), (12, 0), (12, 6), 
(10, 9), (10, 1), (10, 13), 
(14, 5), (14, 3), (14, 1), (14, 2), 
(13, 0), (13, 1), (13, 6), (13, 10)

Next, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

The vertex degrees are:
0: 4
1: 5
2: 4
3: 5
4: 3
5: 4
6: 5
7: 4
8: 4
9: 5
10: 3
11: 3
12: 3
13: 4
14: 4

Now, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices in ascending order of degrees: 4, 10, 11, 12, 0, 2, 5, 7, 13, 8, 14, 3, 6, 1, 9

Now, we will find the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 14]

<0, 2, 6>, <1, 7, 13>, <1, 7, 14>, <1, 13, 10>, <1, 13, 6>, <2, 0, 12>, <3, 7, 1>, <3, 7, 4>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 12, 6>, <4, 3, 7>, <5, 9, 8>, <5, 9, 3>, <6, 12, 0>
