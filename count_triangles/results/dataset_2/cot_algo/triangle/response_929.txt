Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be constructed based on the provided edges as follows:

```
0 --- 1 --- 8
|     |     |
3 --- 2 --- 9
|     |     |
4 --- 8 --- 7
|           |
5 --- 6 --- 7
```

Now, let's perform the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Count the degrees of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 5
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 3

2. Order the nodes based on their degrees:  
<1, 5, 6, 9, 3, 7, 8, 2, 4, 0>

3. Reconstruct the graph with the ordered nodes:
```
1 --- 0 --- 8
|     |     |
5 --- 2 --- 9
|     |     |
6 --- 3 --- 7
|           |
4 --- 8 --- 7
```

Now, we will check for triangles.  

The triangles found are:
<0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
