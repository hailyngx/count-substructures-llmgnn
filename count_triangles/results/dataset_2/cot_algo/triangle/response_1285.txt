This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (12, 6) (12, 3) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 14) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 13) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be constructed as follows: 

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 10, 13.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 10, 5, 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 7, 14, 13.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 14, 1.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 10, 8, 1, 14.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 12.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 1, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 11, 5, 14, 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 2, 3, 0.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 0, 3, 1, 5.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 3, 13, 8.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 3.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 11, 3, 0, 2.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, 2.

Next, we will sort the vertices based on the number of connections: 

1. Node 4 - Degree 2
2. Node 6 - Degree 2
3. Node 12 - Degree 2
4. Node 7 - Degree 4
5. Node 5 - Degree 4
6. Node 13 - Degree 4
7. Node 1 - Degree 5
8. Node 14 - Degree 5
9. Node 0 - Degree 4
10. Node 3 - Degree 5
11. Node 11 - Degree 4
12. Node 10 - Degree 5
13. Node 8 - Degree 6
14. Node 2 - Degree 5
15. Node 9 - Degree 4
