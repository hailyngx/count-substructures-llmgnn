Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph you provided has 10 nodes and 40 edges. 

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 3 connections.
Node 2 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 3 connections.
Node 4 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 5 connections.
Node 0 has 5 connections.
Node 8 has 5 connections.

Now, we will label the vertices accordingly based on their degree:

Node 7 is labeled as 0.
Node 5 is labeled as 1.
Node 9 is labeled as 2.
Node 2 is labeled as 3.
Node 6 is labeled as 4.
Node 4 is labeled as 5.
Node 3 is labeled as 6.
Node 1 is labeled as 7.
Node 0 is labeled as 8.
Node 8 is labeled as 9.

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 6]

<7, 0, 4>
<1, 0, 8>
<8, 0, 4>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<1, 5, 6>
