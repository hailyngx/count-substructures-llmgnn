Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. Once the vertices are relabeled accordingly, we can start counting the triangles in the graph.

The vertices with their corresponding degrees are:
- Node 0: degree 6
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 4

Using this information, let's start counting the triangles. 

Triangles:
1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <0, 4, 8>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <0, 5, 8>
5. <1, 4, 7>
6. <1, 7, 8>
7. <2, 5, 8>
8. <4, 7, 8>
9. <4, 8, 5>
10. <5, 0, 7>

Total number of triangles: [10]
