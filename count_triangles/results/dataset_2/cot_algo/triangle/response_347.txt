Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 12) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 12) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:  
Node 10: degree 3  
Node 11: degree 2  
Node 12: degree 4  
Node 3: degree 3  
Node 7: degree 3  
Node 8: degree 4  
Node 0: degree 5  
Node 1: degree 4  
Node 2: degree 4  
Node 14: degree 4  
Node 4: degree 5  
Node 6: degree 5  
Node 5: degree 5  
Node 9: degree 4  
Node 13: degree 6
