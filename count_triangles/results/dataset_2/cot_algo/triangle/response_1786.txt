Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 5}

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes sorted by degree: [2, 5, 7, 0, 8, 3, 7, 4, 9, 1]

Triangles:
- <0, 4, 8>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <3, 4, 6>

Total number of triangles: [4]
