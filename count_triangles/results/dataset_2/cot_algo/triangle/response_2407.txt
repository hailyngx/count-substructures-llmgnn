Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 2) (27, 2) (27, 9) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 24) (14, 29) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 18) (17, 21) (10, 11) (10, 20) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 24) (11, 29) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 26) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 12) (6, 13) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 7) (28, 13) (28, 15) (19, 5) (19, 18) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 20) (8, 16) (9, 27) (9, 8) (23, 11) (23, 24) (23, 12) (15, 28) (15, 16) (15, 22) (15, 4) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 15) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 1) (26, 5) (26, 3) (25, 17) (24, 14) (24, 11) (24, 23) (24, 4) (3, 26) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (7, 28) (7, 3) (7, 20) (4, 15) (4, 24) (4, 3) (12, 6) (12, 23) (20, 10) (20, 8) (20, 7) (1, 18) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 27) (2, 1) (29, 14) (29, 11) (22, 15) (13, 14) (13, 6) (13, 28) (13, 3) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is as follows:
Vertices: 4, 22, 5, 9, 25, 1, 2, 18, 20, 10, 16, 27, 0, 8, 23, 12, 26, 7, 15, 19, 21, 28, 24, 3, 6, 29, 11, 13, 17, 14

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now identify the triangles in the graph:

[Total number of triangles: 8]
Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 27>
<2, 13, 14>
<4, 15, 24>
<7, 13, 28>
<10, 11, 14>
<13, 21, 28>
<14, 17, 21>
<14, 24, 29>
