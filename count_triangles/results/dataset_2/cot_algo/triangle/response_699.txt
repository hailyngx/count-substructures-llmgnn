Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method solution is as follows:
Vertices sorted by their degree: 5(3), 3(2), 7(3), 0(2), 4(4), 1(4), 8(4), 6(5), 2(6), 9(8).
