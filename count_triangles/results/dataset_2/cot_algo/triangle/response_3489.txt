Response:
The nodes can be represented with their corresponding connections as follows:
- Node 0: 11, 18, 1, 13
- Node 1: 0, 15, 19
- Node 2: 17, 12, 13
- Node 3: 11, 10, 16
- Node 4: 17, 19, 15
- Node 5: 9, 11, 10
- Node 6: 14, 18, 11
- Node 7: 13
- Node 8: 17, 16
- Node 9: 5, 14
- Node 10: 5, 14, 3
- Node 11: 5, 6, 3, 0
- Node 12: 14, 2, 16, 19
- Node 13: 7, 2, 0
- Node 14: 9, 6, 12, 10
- Node 15: 4, 1
- Node 16: 8, 3, 12, 18
- Node 17: 8, 2, 4
- Node 18: 6, 0, 16
- Node 19: 4, 1, 12

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are renumbered as follows:
- 7, 15, 17, 9, 1, 6, 18, 0, 16, 2, 10, 19, 14, 4, 5, 13, 3, 12, 8, 11
