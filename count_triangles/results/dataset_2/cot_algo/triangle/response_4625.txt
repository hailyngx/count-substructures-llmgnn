Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and counting triangles, we find the total number of triangles to be [16].
The unique triangles found are <2, 13, 6>, <0, 12, 13>, <1, 2, 6>, <0, 13, 14>, <0, 3, 12>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 6, 13>, <10, 11, 14>, <10, 12, 14>, <10, 3, 11>, <11, 12, 13>, <3, 6, 11>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 13>.
