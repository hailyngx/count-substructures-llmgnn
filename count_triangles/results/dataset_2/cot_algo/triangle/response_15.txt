Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 17) (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 7) (14, 5) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 0) (10, 3) (10, 4) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 6) (7, 9) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 19) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 18) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 18) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 2) (19, 12) (19, 4) (19, 16) (6, 11) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 4) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 19) (4, 1) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 15) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 16) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(3, 10), (15, 0), (15, 18), (15, 17), (5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 16), (5, 14), (9, 7), (14, 11), (14, 8), (17, 0), (17, 14), (10, 4), (11, 13), (11, 6), (12, 2), (12, 19), (2, 8), (2, 0), (13, 4), (0, 15), (0, 17), (19, 16), (6, 11), (1, 16)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes by degree: 6 < 7 < 10 < 12 < 16 < 18 < 19 < 15 < 1 < 13 < 3 < 4 < 9 < 11 < 0 < 2 < 5 < 8 < 14 < 17

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

[Total number of triangles: 19]
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 12>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 16>
<1, 4, 13>
<1, 4, 10>
<2, 8, 14>
<2, 12, 19>
<4, 10, 13>
<4, 10, 3>
<4, 13, 11>
<5, 14, 17>
<5, 9, 7>
<8, 14, 17>
<8, 14, 11>
<13, 11, 6>
