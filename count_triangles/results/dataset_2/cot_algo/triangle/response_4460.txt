Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 11) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 3) (10, 8) (10, 18) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 2) (7, 11) (7, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 3) (4, 12) (4, 18) (4, 15) (4, 2) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 15) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 19) (13, 5) (13, 19) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 19) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 8) (19, 15) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 19) (1, 5) (1, 2) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: (0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 14), (0, 19), (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 11), (3, 6), (3, 12), (4, 12), (4, 15), (4, 18), (5, 1), (5, 9), (5, 13), (6, 3), (6, 9), (6, 17), (7, 0), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 14), (8, 19), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 19), (10, 8), (10, 18), (11, 2), (11, 7), (11, 17), (12, 3), (12, 4), (12, 14), (13, 5), (13, 19), (14, 0), (14, 8), (14, 12), (14, 17), (15, 4), (15, 18), (15, 19), (17, 6), (17, 11), (17, 14), (18, 4), (18, 10), (18, 15), (19, 0), (19, 8), (19, 13), (19, 15)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node degrees:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 2
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 2
Node 14: degree 4
Node 15: degree 3
Node 16: degree 0
Node 17: degree 3
Node 18: degree 3
Node 19: degree 4

Vertices sorted by degree:
Nodes in order: 16, 1, 13, 7, 2, 10, 17, 18, 6, 15, 11, 12, 5, 3, 8, 4, 0, 14, 9, 19

Now, we count the triangles formed by each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 12>
<3, 6, 17>
<4, 12, 18>
<8, 10, 18>
<8, 14, 19>
