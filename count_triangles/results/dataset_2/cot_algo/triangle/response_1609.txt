Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 14) (15, 10) (15, 7) (7, 15) (7, 16) (7, 13) (7, 8) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 18) (19, 4) (19, 14) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 13) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 11) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 11) (4, 19) (4, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (2, 6) (2, 17) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 18) (0, 5) (11, 17) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 13) (3, 12) (18, 16) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 11) (14, 10) (14, 19) (14, 4) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(10, 15), (10, 8), (10, 1), (10, 9), (10, 14), (15, 7), (7, 16), (7, 13), (7, 8), (16, 18),
(19, 4), (19, 14), (6, 17), (6, 2), (6, 13), (17, 11), (5, 12), (5, 0), (8, 11), (4, 18),
(9, 12), (12, 3), (1, 18)
```

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method and add labels based on the number of connections:
```
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 19: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 16: Degree 2
Node 18: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 17: Degree 3
Node 11: Degree 3
Node 12: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 15: Degree 2
Node 10: Degree 6
Node 14: Degree 2
```

Now, let's count the total number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
```
Total number of triangles: [14]

Unique triangles:
<7, 10, 15>
<1, 10, 15>
<1, 10, 8>
<11, 16, 17>
<1, 10, 14>
<1, 10, 9>
<5, 9, 12>
<17, 11, 13>
<16, 8, 11>
<6, 2, 17>
<1, 18, 11>
<1, 12, 3>
<1, 5, 0>
<4, 14, 19>
