Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 2) (7, 26) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 14) (23, 11) (23, 24) (17, 29) (17, 27) (17, 2) (29, 7) (29, 17) (29, 25) (29, 18) (28, 21) (28, 13) (28, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (11, 23) (11, 24) (11, 0) (11, 5) (13, 28) (13, 25) (13, 15) (14, 21) (14, 26) (26, 7) (26, 14) (26, 4) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 27) (18, 29) (18, 19) (19, 18) (19, 22) (19, 6) (4, 9) (4, 26) (4, 22) (4, 3) (22, 19) (22, 4) (22, 10) (22, 3) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 5) (24, 23) (24, 11) (24, 12) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 9) (2, 25) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 20) (6, 19) (6, 27) (27, 17) (27, 16) (27, 6) (12, 21) (12, 24) (12, 1) (20, 5) (20, 3) (15, 13) (15, 25) (25, 29) (25, 13) (25, 2) (25, 15) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 22) (3, 20) (10, 28) (10, 22) (10, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles efficiently in this graph. 

First, let's count the degree of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 3
- Node 10 has degree 3
- Node 11 has degree 4
- Node 12 has degree 3
- Node 13 has degree 3
- Node 14 has degree 2
- Node 15 has degree 2
- Node 16 has degree 3
- Node 17 has degree 3
- Node 18 has degree 2
- Node 19 has degree 3
- Node 20 has degree 2
- Node 21 has degree 4
- Node 22 has degree 4
- Node 23 has degree 2
- Node 24 has degree 3
- Node 25 has degree 4
- Node 26 has degree 3
- Node 27 has degree 3
- Node 28 has degree 3
- Node 29 has degree 4

Now we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:
- Node 18 (degree 2)
- Node 23 (degree 2)
- Node 1 (degree 2)
- Node 14 (degree 2)
- Node 15 (degree 2)
- Node 6 (degree 2)
- Node 12 (degree 3)
- Node 0 (degree 3)
- Node 9 (degree 3)
- Node 16 (degree 3)
- Node 17 (degree 3)
- Node 10 (degree 3)
- Node 24 (degree 3)
- Node 27 (degree 3)
- Node 28 (degree 3)
- Node 13 (degree 3)
- Node 19 (degree 3)
- Node 20 (degree 2)
- Node 3 (degree 3)
- Node 7 (degree 5)
- Node 2 (degree 4)
- Node 29 (degree 4)
- Node 25 (degree 4)
- Node 4 (degree 4)
- Node 26 (degree 3)
- Node 22 (degree 4)
- Node 11 (degree 4)
- Node 5 (degree 4)
- Node 8 (degree 0) (Not connected to any other node)

Now, let's count the triangles in the graph:
- Total triangles: [60]

Unique triangles:
- <0, 5, 11>
- <0, 11, 23>
- <0, 11, 24>
- <0, 5, 20>
- <1, 12, 21>
- <2, 7, 17>
- <2, 7, 29>
- <2, 17, 29>
- <2, 25, 29>
- <3, 4, 22>
- <3, 4, 26>
- <3, 20, 22>
- <4, 22, 26>
- <5, 10, 20>
- <5, 11, 20>
- <6, 19, 27>
- <7, 21, 28>
- <9, 1, 12>
- <9, 2, 25>
- <11, 23, 24>
- <13, 15, 25>
- <13, 25, 29>
- <14, 21, 26>
- <17, 27, 29>
- <18, 19, 29>
- <20, 22, 3>
- <22, 3, 4>
- <28, 10, 13>
- <28, 10, 22>
- <29, 18, 19>
