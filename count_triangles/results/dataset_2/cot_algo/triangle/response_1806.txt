Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (15, 4) (15, 11) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 18) (1, 19) (1, 8) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 7) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 6) (7, 2) (7, 12) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 8) (16, 12) (16, 9) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 19) (19, 1) (19, 8) (0, 11) (0, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 10) (11, 15) (11, 0) (9, 14) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 10) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 4) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 13) (13, 2) (13, 10) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 10) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph and count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 16: 2 connections
Vertex 19: 2 connections
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 11: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 13: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 18: 5 connections
Vertex 12: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 17: 5 connections
Vertex 14: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 10: 5 connections
Vertex 15: 2 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles.

[Total number of triangles: 12]
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 10>
<0, 6, 10>
<0, 6, 18>
<1, 8, 19>
<2, 6, 18>
<2, 6, 10>
<2, 11, 15>
<2, 13, 10>
<4, 14, 17>
<4, 14, 12>
<8, 12, 14>
