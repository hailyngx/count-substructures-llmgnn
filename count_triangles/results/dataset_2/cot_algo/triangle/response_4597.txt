Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted vertices are as follows:
Node 2: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 6
Node 4: Degree 6

Next, we will count the triangles by examining the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections. 

After counting, the total number of triangles is [12].
The unique triangles found are as follows:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<2, 8, 1>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 7, 4>
<3, 7, 5>
<4, 5, 1>
<4, 7, 1>
<4, 7, 5>
