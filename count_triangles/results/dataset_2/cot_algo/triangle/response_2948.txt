Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 19) (5, 0) (9, 15) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (1, 11) (1, 3) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 13) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 2) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 8) (18, 4) (18, 10) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 17) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 19) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 15) (6, 0) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 8) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 17) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 15) (13, 4) (13, 3) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(11, 16), (11, 3), (11, 14), (11, 1), (16, 0), (16, 2), (16, 19), (5, 0), (9, 15), (4, 7), 
(4, 18), (4, 13), (4, 14), (7, 12), (1, 3), (3, 13), (10, 17), (10, 8), (10, 18), (10, 19), 
(17, 0), (17, 12), (12, 8), (0, 6), (19, 15), (6, 0), (2, 17), (13, 4)

After sorting the nodes based on their degrees, we get:
Nodes: 5, 9, 2, 6, 1, 18, 7, 9, 13, 2, 8, 12, 15, 5, 7, 17, 0, 17, 4, 19

Using Degree-Based Ordering to count triangles:  
Triangles: [<3, 11, 1>, <0, 17, 2>]

Total number of triangles: [2]
