Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then analyzing edges accordingly.

Here are the nodes sorted by their degrees:
Node 2 (Degree 2)
Node 1 (Degree 3)
Node 8 (Degree 4)
Node 6 (Degree 4)
Node 5 (Degree 5)
Node 3 (Degree 5)
Node 7 (Degree 5)
Node 9 (Degree 5)
Node 4 (Degree 6)
Node 0 (Degree 7)

By following the rule that for each edge, the vertex with the lower label must have fewer connections, we can count the triangles.

The total number of triangles is [8].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 0>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
<2, 9, 0>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
