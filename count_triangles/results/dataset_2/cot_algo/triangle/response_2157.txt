Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their number of connections.

Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 6
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 6
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (8, 3) (9, 8) (2, 6) (4, 6) (7, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9)

By examining the shared connections between the vertices connected by each edge, we find the following triangles:
<1, 3, 5>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
