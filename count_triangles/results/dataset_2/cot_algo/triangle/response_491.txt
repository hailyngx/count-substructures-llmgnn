Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 1) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 3) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 11) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 14) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. Then, we will relabel the vertices accordingly and identify the triangles formed by shared connections between the vertices of each edge.

After sorting the vertices, the new labels with their respective connections are as follows:
- Node 0 (degree 3)
- Node 1 (degree 3)
- Node 2 (degree 3)
- Node 3 (degree 3)
- Node 5 (degree 3)
- Node 6 (degree 3)
- Node 8 (degree 2)
- Node 12 (degree 3)
- Node 14 (degree 3)
- Node 7 (degree 4)
- Node 13 (degree 5)
- Node 9 (degree 5)
- Node 4 (degree 6)
- Node 11 (degree 6)
- Node 10 (degree 6)

Now, we will check the edges and count the triangles. The total number of triangles is [18].

The unique triangles found are:
- <4, 2, 5>
- <4, 2, 6>
- <4, 2, 10>
- <4, 2, 11>
- <4, 3, 12>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 10>
- <4, 6, 10>
- <4, 7, 5>
- <4, 9, 10>
- <2, 5, 12>
- <2, 6, 12>
- <8, 6, 12>
- <0, 13, 1>
- <0, 13, 9>
- <13, 5, 12>
- <13, 10, 0>
- <9, 11, 1>
