Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (27, 28) (27, 9) (27, 26) (27, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (21, 20) (21, 22) (21, 17) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 13) (11, 29) (11, 20) (8, 1) (8, 23) (8, 26) (23, 8) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 25) (26, 27) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 16) (22, 21) (22, 4) (28, 27) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 24) (5, 24) (13, 27) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (16, 26) (16, 28) (16, 6) (18, 19) (18, 13) (18, 6) (7, 3) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 9) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 25) (0, 10) (0, 17) (3, 7) (3, 24) (3, 9) (6, 16) (6, 18) (6, 7) (6, 2) (17, 21) (17, 0) (17, 2) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 24) (20, 21) (20, 11) (20, 7) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 3) (24, 14) (24, 2) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 17) (2, 24) (25, 19) (25, 4) (25, 12) (12, 14) (12, 25) (29, 11) (9, 27) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees and relabeling them accordingly. The list of vertices with their degrees is as follows:

(0: 2), (1: 2), (2: 4), (3: 4), (4: 4), (5: 2), (6: 6), (7: 6), (8: 4), (9: 4), (10: 4), (11: 6), (12: 3), (13: 4), (14: 3), (16: 4), (17: 4), (18: 4), (19: 4), (20: 4), (21: 4), (22: 3), (23: 2), (24: 5), (25: 3), (26: 4), (27: 4), (28: 4), (29: 2)

Based on the list above, we start with the vertex with the least connections, that is, vertices 0, 1, 5, and 29. 

After labeling the vertices accordingly, we list out the triangles found:

- Triangles involving vertex 0: <0, 10, 17>, <0, 10, 14>, <0, 17, 21>
- Triangles involving vertex 1: <1, 9, 27>, <1, 8, 26>
- Triangles involving vertex 5: <5, 24, 28>
- Triangles involving vertex 29: None

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
