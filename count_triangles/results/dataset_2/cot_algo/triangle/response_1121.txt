Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 10) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 3) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 12) (11, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 2) (7, 1) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 18) (14, 6) (14, 13) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 15) (17, 0) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 19) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 17) (15, 7) (15, 16) (18, 5) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 17) (4, 11) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will start by ordering the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 4: degree 1
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 2
Node 10: degree 2
Node 15: degree 2
Node 9: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 0: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 17: degree 5
Node 19: degree 5
Node 11: degree 5
Node 18: degree 5

Edges to consider for counting triangles:

(5, 9) - Proceeding (5 has lower degree than 9):
Shared connections with (5, 9): None

(9, 0) - Proceeding (0 has lower degree than 9):
Shared connections with (9, 0): {17}

(9, 19) - Proceeding (9 has lower degree than 19):
Shared connections with (9, 19): {2, 7, 17}

(6, 1) - Proceeding (1 has lower degree than 6):
Shared connections with (6, 1): None

(6, 14) - Proceeding (6 has lower degree than 14):
Shared connections with (6, 14): None

(2, 8) - Proceeding (2 has lower degree than 8):
Shared connections with (2, 8): None

(2, 1) - Proceeding (1 has lower degree than 2):
Shared connections with (2, 1): {7}

(2, 19) - Proceeding (2 has lower degree than 19):
Shared connections with (2, 19): {7, 17}
