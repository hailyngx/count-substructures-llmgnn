Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 7), 
(9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), 
(4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), 
(7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 1), 
(8, 1), 
(0, 3), (0, 6), 
(1, 2), 
(6, 0), 
(2, 3)

Next, let's sort the nodes by their degree:
0 - degree 3
6 - degree 2
3 - degree 2
1 - degree 3
8 - degree 3
7 - degree 4
2 - degree 3
9 - degree 4
4 - degree 4
5 - degree 5

Now, we will check for triangles:
Triangles:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [18]
