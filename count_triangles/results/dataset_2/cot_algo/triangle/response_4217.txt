Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 3), (5, 7), 
(9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0), 
(4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 3), 
(8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 6), (8, 3), 
(6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 7), 
(2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 1), (2, 7), (2, 0), 
(1, 9), (1, 2), (1, 0), (1, 7), 
(3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 8), 
(7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 1), 
(0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 2), (0, 1)

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degree from least to most connections:
Nodes in order: 6, 7, 4, 1, 0, 9, 3, 2, 8, 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles in the graph.

[Total number of triangles: 10]

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 1, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<4, 3, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
