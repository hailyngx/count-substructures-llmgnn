Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 14) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 11) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 1) (4, 5) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (11, 2) (11, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is used to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is: 

Vertices: 11, 4, 8, 14, 0, 1, 6, 10, 2, 12, 5, 7, 9, 3, 13

After reordering the vertices, the graph becomes: 

Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

The total number of triangles in the graph is [16].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 13>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 13>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 9, 10>
<0, 9, 13>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 11>
<1, 7, 10>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 13>
<3, 7, 13>
<5, 7, 12>
<8, 9, 14>
<10, 7, 13>
