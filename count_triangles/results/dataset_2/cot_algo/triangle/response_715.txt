Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 14) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 10) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices based on their degree. Here is the sorted list of vertices:

Vertex 0 has degree 3
Vertex 1 has degree 3
Vertex 2 has degree 4
Vertex 3 has degree 4
Vertex 5 has degree 4
Vertex 6 has degree 5
Vertex 9 has degree 4
Vertex 11 has degree 4
Vertex 12 has degree 3
Vertex 13 has degree 4
Vertex 4 has degree 6
Vertex 7 has degree 5
Vertex 8 has degree 3
Vertex 10 has degree 5
Vertex 14 has degree 4

Using the sorted order, we will check the edges between vertices only proceeding if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

After counting the triangles, the total number of triangles is [16].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 14>
<1, 6, 13>
<2, 4, 11>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 10>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 9, 10>
<3, 9, 11>
<3, 10, 12>
<3, 10, 14>
<4, 5, 7>
<6, 8, 14>
<6, 13, 12>
<10, 12, 7>
