Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 12) (15, 0) (15, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18) (2, 10) (2, 13) (18, 8) (18, 5) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 16) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 19) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 9) (16, 13) (16, 17) (16, 19) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 19) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 9) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 14) (19, 1) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (1, 19) (1, 12) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 18) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(3, 0), (3, 17), (3, 12), (15, 0), (15, 5), (10, 11), (10, 6), (10, 2), (11, 10), (11, 14), (11, 13), 
(4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 5), (8, 4), (8, 0), (8, 12), (8, 18), (2, 10), (2, 13), 
(18, 8), (18, 5), (13, 11), (13, 2), (13, 16), (17, 3), (17, 16), (17, 19), 
(7, 6), (7, 14), (7, 9), (16, 13), (16, 17), (16, 19), (14, 11), (14, 7), (14, 19),
(0, 3), (0, 15), (0, 8), (0, 9), (19, 17), (19, 16), (19, 14), (19, 1), 
(6, 10), (6, 7), (6, 12), (1, 19), (1, 12), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 0), 
(5, 15), (5, 4), (5, 18), (12, 3), (12, 8), (12, 6), (12, 1)

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degree from least connected to most connected:
Vertices by degree: (1) - 16, 18, 1, 19; (2) - 9, 2, 5, 6; (3) - 4, 7, 13, 14, 15; (4) - 3, 10, 12, 17; (5) - 0, 8, 11

Counting the number of triangles:
[]
<7, 14, 19>
<0, 3, 17>
<0, 8, 12>
<0, 9, 4>
<4, 9, 7>
<4, 5, 18>
<8, 4, 5>
<12, 8, 4>
<13, 2, 10>
<13, 16, 17> 

Total number of triangles: [10]
