Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 9) (3, 14) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree:

Node 5: degree 2
Node 9: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 10: degree 2
Node 11: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 13: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 0: degree 4
Node 14: degree 3
Node 3: degree 2
Node 7: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 12: degree 4

Now, we can relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 5: 0
Node 9: 1
Node 6: 2
Node 10: 3
Node 11: 4
Node 8: 5
Node 13: 6
Node 4: 7
Node 2: 8
Node 0: 9
Node 14: 10
Node 3: 11
Node 7: 12
Node 1: 13
Node 12: 14

Using the relabeled nodes, we can count the number of triangles formed:

Total number of triangles: [14]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 7, 13>
<1, 7, 13>
<3, 7, 13>
