Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (14, 9) (14, 11) (17, 16) (17, 12) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 3) (4, 19) (4, 15) (18, 0) (18, 3) (3, 13) (3, 18) (3, 16) (3, 19) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 16) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 15) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 2) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 6) (19, 4) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 2) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves the following steps:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order.
2. Relabel the vertices accordingly.
3. For each edge, consider only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has a degree less than the vertex with the higher label.
4. Find shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to identify triangles.

Given the edges provided, we'll start by constructing the graph with the vertices and their connections sorted by their degree:

Vertices by degree:
(4: 2)  (1: 2)  (7: 2)  (5: 2)  (17: 2)  (18: 2)  (6: 4)  (16: 4)  (13: 4)  (14: 4)  (15: 4)  (0: 5)  (3: 5)  (9: 5)  (12: 5)  (10: 5)  (2: 5)  (11: 5)  (8: 5)  (19: 5)

Now, we'll identify the triangles based on the shared connections:

Triangles:
<[2, 5, 10]>  <[3, 16, 6]>  <[3, 19, 6]>  <[4, 15, 6]>  <[4, 15, 2]>  <[6, 7, 0]>  <[6, 7, 16]>  <[6, 15, 2]>  <[8, 13, 3]>  <[8, 13, 12]>  <[8, 13, 3]>  <[8, 12, 2]>  <[8, 12, 17]>  <[8, 12, 0]>  <[8, 12, 2]>  <[9, 8, 11]>  <[9, 8, 11]>  <[9, 8, 11]>  <[9, 8, 14]>  <[9, 14, 11]>  <[10, 11, 14]>  <[10, 11, 14]>  <[10, 11, 14]>  <[11, 10, 14]>
