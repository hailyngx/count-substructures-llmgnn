Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 17) (16, 18) (26, 18) (2, 24) (2, 14) (2, 7) (29, 20) (29, 3) (20, 29) (20, 21) (20, 6) (25, 17) (25, 15) (25, 18) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 21) (8, 27) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 7) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 20) (6, 28) (6, 27) (28, 8) (28, 6) (21, 20) (21, 8) (21, 24) (21, 4) (24, 2) (24, 21) (24, 3) (24, 27) (24, 19) (4, 21) (4, 27) (4, 1) (4, 17) (27, 8) (27, 6) (27, 24) (27, 4) (18, 16) (18, 26) (18, 25) (5, 10) (17, 16) (17, 25) (17, 4) (17, 23) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 23) (14, 19) (22, 10) (22, 15) (15, 25) (15, 13) (15, 22) (15, 19) (19, 24) (19, 14) (19, 15) (19, 23) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 23) (0, 1) (3, 29) (3, 24) (3, 0) (23, 17) (23, 14) (23, 19) (23, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 10) (10, 5) (10, 22) (10, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their degree (number of connections). Let's first calculate the degree of each node:

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 4
- Node 20: degree 4
- Node 21: degree 4
- Node 22: degree 2
- Node 23: degree 4
- Node 24: degree 4
- Node 25: degree 4
- Node 26: degree 1
- Node 27: degree 4
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 29: degree 2

Now, we'll relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:

- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 26: degree 1
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 22: degree 2
- Node 29: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 4
- Node 20: degree 4
- Node 21: degree 4
- Node 23: degree 4
- Node 24: degree 4
- Node 25: degree 4
- Node 27: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 4

Next, we will go through each edge, and for edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we will check for shared connections to find triangles.

Based on this method, the total number of triangles is [4]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 14>.
