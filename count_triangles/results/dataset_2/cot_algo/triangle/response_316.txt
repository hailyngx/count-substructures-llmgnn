Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The relabeling of nodes based on their degrees is as follows:
Node 1 (degree 2) <---> Node 7 (degree 2)
Node 2 (degree 2) <---> Node 8 (degree 3)
Node 3 (degree 3) <---> Node 6 (degree 4)
Node 4 (degree 4) <---> Node 9 (degree 5)
Node 5 (degree 6) <---> Node 10 (degree 6)

Using the relabeled nodes, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph:
1. Triangles involving Node 1 (1, 5, 8), (1, 5, 9)
2. Triangles involving Node 2 (2, 4, 6)
3. Triangles involving Node 3 (3, 4, 6), (3, 6, 8)
4. Triangles involving Node 4 (4, 6, 7)
5. Triangles involving Node 5 (5, 8, 9)

Count of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 8>
