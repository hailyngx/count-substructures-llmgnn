Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are as follows:

0(3), 4(3), 8(3), 3(4), 5(4), 2(5), 7(5), 1(6), 9(6), 6(7)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's count the triangles:

Considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(0, 3) - Shared connection with 2: <0, 2, 3>
(0, 2) - Shared connections with 3 and 6: <0, 2, 3> and <0, 2, 6>
(3, 5) - Shared connections with 1 and 2: <3, 1, 5> and <3, 2, 5>
(5, 7) - Shared connections with 1, 2, and 4: <5, 1, 7>, <5, 2, 7>, <5, 4, 7>

The total number of triangles is [7].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 6>
<3, 1, 5>
<3, 2, 5>
<5, 1, 7>
<5, 2, 7>
<5, 4, 7>
