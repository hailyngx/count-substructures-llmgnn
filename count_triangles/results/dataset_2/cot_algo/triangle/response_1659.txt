Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 17) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 18) (18, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 6) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 13) (0, 6) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 1) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 3) (15, 4) (15, 0) (3, 10) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 3) (16, 17) (16, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 16) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 0) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are:  
Node 16 has 1 edge.  
Node 18 has 1 edge.  
Node 19 has 2 edges.  
Node 8 has 2 edges.  
Node 12 has 3 edges.  
Node 15 has 3 edges.  
Node 7 has 4 edges.  
Node 0 has 4 edges.  
Node 6 has 4 edges.  
Node 14 has 4 edges.  
Node 2 has 4 edges.  
Node 11 has 4 edges.  
Node 1 has 5 edges.  
Node 9 has 5 edges.  
Node 5 has 5 edges.  
Node 3 has 5 edges.  
Node 17 has 5 edges.  
Node 4 has 5 edges.  
Node 13 has 5 edges.  
Node 10 has 5 edges.  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles in the graph.  

The total number of triangles is [28].  

The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 2, 6>  
<0, 2, 12>  
<0, 2, 14>  
<0, 3, 7>  
<0, 3, 14>  
<0, 6, 14>  
<1, 5, 7>  
<1, 5, 13>  
<2, 6, 11>
