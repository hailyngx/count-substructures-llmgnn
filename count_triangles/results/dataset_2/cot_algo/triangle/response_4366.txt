Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 3) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) 

Response:
Graph construction:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges:
- 0: (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 9), (3, 6), (3, 5), (6, 4)
- 1: (9, 2), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 1), (2, 4), (2, 3), (4, 5)
- 2: (3, 2), (1, 2)
- 3: (5, 8), (5, 4)
- 4: (9, 8), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 7)
- 5: (8, 1), (8, 9)
- 6: (0, 7), (0, 9), (0, 6)
- 7: (9, 4)
- 8: (5, 3)

Degree-Based Ordering (Vertices sorted by the number of connections):
Nodes: 2, 5, 1, 8, 0, 6, 3, 4, 7, 9

Counting triangles:
Triangles: [<3, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 5>]

Final output:
Total number of triangles: [3]
