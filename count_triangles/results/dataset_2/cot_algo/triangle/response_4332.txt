Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 18) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 15) (8, 10) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 15) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (15, 4) (15, 14) (15, 2) (15, 5) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 9) (16, 7) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 19) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 2) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 18) (19, 4) (19, 6) (19, 17) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 11) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 7) (12, 0) (13, 1) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 5)
