Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph based on the provided edges and calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

```
Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges:
0: (9), (5), (8)
1: (4), (5)
2: (4), (3), (6), (9), (5)
3: (4), (6), (2), (5), (8)
4: (7), (1), (3), (2)
5: (1), (3), (6), (2), (8), (0)
6: (3), (5), (2), (8)
7: (4), (8)
8: (7), (3), (6), (9), (5), (0)
9: (8), (2), (0)

Degree-Based Ordering:
0 (3), 1 (2), 7 (2), 9 (2), 7 (2), 3 (5), 6 (4), 4 (4), 5 (6), 2 (5)

Triangles:
Total number of triangles: [12]
Unique triangles: <0, 8, 5>, <0, 9, 8>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 5, 2>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 8, 5>, <2, 9, 8>, <3, 4, 2>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 5>, <5, 6, 8>
