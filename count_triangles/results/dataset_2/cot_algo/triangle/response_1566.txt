Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 13) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 6) (2, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) from least to most. Here are the vertices labeled accordingly: 
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 0: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 6
- Node 10: degree 5
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 3

Now, we will check the edges in the order of the nodes and count the triangles that form:
1. (5, 6): No triangle formed
2. (5, 2): No triangle formed
3. (5, 0): No triangle formed
4. (9, 8): No triangle formed
5. (9, 1): No triangle formed
6. (9, 7): No triangle formed
7. (9, 12): No triangle formed
8. (1, 9): No triangle formed
9. (1, 3): No triangle formed
10. (1, 13): No triangle formed
11. (1, 0): Triangle formed: <1, 0, 5>
12. (1, 8): Triangle formed: <1, 8, 9>
13. (3, 1): No triangle formed
14. (3, 7): No triangle formed
15. (3, 12): No triangle formed
16. (3, 8): Triangle formed: <3, 8, 9>
17. (10, 11): No triangle formed
18. (10, 8): Triangle formed: <10, 8, 9>
19. (10, 7): No triangle formed
20. (10, 4): No triangle formed
21. (10, 13): No triangle formed
22. (11, 10): No triangle formed
23. (11, 14): No triangle formed
24. (11, 0): Triangle formed: <11, 0, 1>
25. (11, 6): No triangle formed
26. (6, 5): No triangle formed
27. (6, 11): No triangle formed
28. (6, 7): Triangle formed: <6, 7, 9>
29. (6, 13): No triangle formed
30. (0, 5): No triangle formed
31. (0, 1): Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>
32. (0, 11): Triangle formed: <0, 11, 14>
33. (0, 14): Triangle formed: <0, 14, 4>
34. (0, 4): Triangle formed: <0, 4, 10>
35. (0, 8): Triangle formed: <0, 8, 9>
36. (14, 11): No triangle formed
37. (14, 0): Triangle formed: <14, 0, 1>
38. (14, 4): Triangle formed: <14, 4, 10>
39. (13, 1): Triangle formed: <13, 1, 8>
40. (13, 10): No triangle formed
41. (13, 6): No triangle formed
42. (8, 9): No triangle formed
43. (8, 1): Triangle formed: <8, 1, 0>
44. (8, 3): Triangle formed: <8, 3, 1>
45. (8, 10): Triangle formed: <8, 10, 4>
46. (8, 0): Triangle formed: <8, 0, 1>
47. (8, 12): No triangle formed
48. (4, 10): No triangle formed
49. (4, 0): Triangle formed: <4, 0, 1>
50. (4, 14): No triangle formed
51. (4, 12): No triangle formed
52. (12, 9): No triangle formed
53. (12, 3): No triangle formed
54. (12, 8): No triangle formed
55. (12, 4): No triangle formed
56. (7, 9): No triangle formed
57. (7, 3): No triangle formed
58. (7, 10): No triangle formed
59. (7, 6): Triangle formed: <7, 6, 5>
60. (2, 5): No triangle formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10] and they are: <1, 0, 5>, <1, 8, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <10, 8, 9>, <11, 0, 1>, <6, 7, 9>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 11, 14>, <0, 14, 4>, <0, 4, 10>.
