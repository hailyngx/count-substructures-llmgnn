Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 7) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 13) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 14) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 3) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 14), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 7), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 11), (10, 0), (10, 12), (10, 8), (10, 7), (11, 6), (11, 1), (11, 13), (4, 9), (4, 12), (4, 13), (4, 14), (8, 10), (8, 14), (12, 10), (12, 4), (12, 13), (12, 1), (1, 6), (1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 14), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 0), (0, 5), (0, 10), (0, 1), (0, 2), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 14), (3, 13), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 3), (14, 5), (14, 4), (14, 8), (14, 1), (14, 3), (13, 11), (13, 4), (13, 12), (13, 3)

Next, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles in the graph. 

Vertices (Nodes) in increasing order of degree:
Nodes: 2, 6, 8, 3, 4, 0, 10, 1, 7, 11, 13, 9, 5, 12, 14

Now, let's count the triangles:
Total number of triangles: 7

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 12>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 13>, <4, 12, 13>, <8, 10, 14> 

The result is [7].
