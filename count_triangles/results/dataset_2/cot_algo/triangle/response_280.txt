Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 3) (27, 17) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 22) (14, 13) (14, 21) (17, 27) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 23) (2, 15) (2, 29) (29, 2) (29, 5) (29, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 27) (3, 1) (3, 16) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 23) (28, 6) (28, 7) (28, 20) (20, 28) (20, 13) (20, 22) (20, 4) (6, 28) (9, 18) (9, 19) (22, 14) (22, 20) (22, 24) (4, 27) (4, 20) (4, 26) (18, 9) (18, 26) (26, 4) (26, 18) (26, 0) (5, 29) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 5) (11, 1) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 25) (23, 17) (23, 10) (23, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 24) (24, 22) (24, 16) (25, 11) (25, 8) (8, 14) (8, 25) (8, 21) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 28) (7, 5) (7, 8) (12, 10) (0, 29) (0, 26) (0, 11) (13, 14) (13, 20) (21, 14) (21, 8) 

Response:
First, we construct the graph based on the given information:

    Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 29}
    Edges: (15, 27), (15, 19), (15, 2), (27, 4), (27, 3), (27, 17), (14, 17), (14, 8), (14, 22), (14, 13), (14, 21), (2, 29), (29, 5), (1, 3), (1, 11), (1, 16), (1, 10), (1, 7), (10, 12), (28, 6), (28, 7), (28, 20), (20, 13), (20, 22), (20, 4), (9, 18), (22, 24), (4, 26), (18, 26), (26, 0), (5, 7), (11, 25), (16, 24), (25, 8), (8, 21)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:

0(3) < 9(2) < 5(3) < 6(1) < 19(3) < 13(3) < 16(3) < 18(2) < 25(2) < 2(3) < 3(3) < 1(5) < 23(3) < 26(3) < 27(4) < 28(3) < 4(4) < 20(4) < 7(4) < 12(1) < 24(2) < 29(2) < 8(4) < 14(5) < 21(2) < 10(4) < 22(3) < 11(3) < 15(3) < 17(4)

Now, according to the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the count of triangles:

Triangles: [15]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15]. 
The unique triangles found are: <0, 26, 4>, <0, 26, 18>, <0, 26, 5>, <10, 23, 11>, <0, 26, 5>, <10, 23, 11>, <1, 7, 5>, <2, 29, 5>, <4, 20, 22>, <7, 28, 5>, <4, 27, 3>, <8, 25, 11>, <10, 17, 14>, <14, 17, 27>, <14, 22, 20>
