Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 13) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 12) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 12) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:  
Vertex 4: 1 connection  
Vertex 13: 2 connections  
Vertex 10: 3 connections  
Vertex 9: 4 connections  
Vertex 7: 4 connections  
Vertex 6: 4 connections  
Vertex 12: 6 connections  
Vertex 1: 6 connections  
Vertex 0: 6 connections  
Vertex 11: 6 connections  
Vertex 14: 6 connections  
Vertex 2: 7 connections  
Vertex 3: 7 connections  
Vertex 8: 7 connections  
Vertex 5: 8 connections  

Following the method of Degree-Based Ordering, we will now count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles is: [18]

The unique triangles found are:  
<2, 6, 11>  
<2, 6, 14>  
<2, 11, 14>  
<5, 6, 0>  
<5, 6, 3>  
<5, 6, 2>  
<0, 6, 12>  
<0, 12, 1>  
<0, 12, 10>  
<0, 12, 13>  
<7, 10, 14>  
<7, 10, 12>  
<7, 10, 14>  
<7, 12, 10>  
<9, 12, 0>  
<9, 12, 1>  
<9, 12, 13>  
<3, 12, 13>
