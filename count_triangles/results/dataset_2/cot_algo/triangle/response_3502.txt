Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 13) (17, 22) (17, 26) (3, 14) (25, 21) (7, 0) (7, 27) (7, 2) (21, 25) (21, 18) (0, 7) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 23) (27, 7) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 6) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 5) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 21) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 1) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 16) (6, 27) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 8) (29, 17) (29, 15) (29, 4) (29, 10) (26, 17) (26, 11) (26, 8) (26, 24) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 1) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 4) (24, 23) (11, 26) (11, 24) (11, 4) (16, 5) (16, 13) (8, 6) (8, 26) (9, 28) (9, 20) (13, 17) (13, 16) (4, 12) (4, 29) (4, 24) (4, 11) (1, 14) (1, 18) (1, 28) (1, 15) (15, 14) (15, 29) (15, 1) (15, 22) (10, 0) (10, 29) (23, 0) (23, 18) (23, 24) (20, 9) (20, 22) (22, 17) (22, 15) (22, 20) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29

Edges:
(14, 17), (14, 3), (14, 1), (14, 15), (17, 29), (17, 13), (17, 22), (17, 26), (3, 25), (7, 0), (7, 27), (7, 2), (25, 18), (0, 10), (0, 23), (27, 12), (12, 5), (2, 18), (5, 16), (6, 28), (29, 10), (26, 11), (24, 23), (11, 16), (8, 20)

Next, let's perform Degree-Based Ordering:

1. Node 21: Degree 2
2. Node 4, 8, 9, 10, 13, 20, 22, 23, 24, 28: Degree 3
3. Node 1, 5, 6, 11, 12, 16, 18, 26, 27, 29: Degree 4
4. Node 0, 2, 3, 7, 15, 17: Degree 5
5. Node 14, 25: Degree 6

Now, we'll consider the edges in the order specified by Degree-Based Ordering and count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 12]

<0, 14, 17> 
<2, 7, 27>
<5, 12, 27>
<6, 8, 26>
<10, 0, 27>
<11, 26, 24>
<16, 5, 12>
<18, 21, 25>
<20, 22, 15>
<20, 22, 17>
<22, 15, 29>
<24, 26, 17>
