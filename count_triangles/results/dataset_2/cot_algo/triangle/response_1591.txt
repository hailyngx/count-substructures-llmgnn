Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following edges:
- (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 7)
- (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 0)
- (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 2)
- (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1)
- (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 2)
- (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 2), (3, 8)
- (6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 0)
- (8, 9), (8, 3), (8, 2)
- (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 8)
- (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 6)

Let's reorder the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes: 0 8 5 9 1 6 4 2 7 3
Degrees: 3 3 3 3 4 4 5 6 6 6

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- For edge (0, 9), proceed because node 0 has fewer connections.
  Shared connections: 4, 6
- For edge (0, 4), proceed because node 0 has fewer connections.
  Shared connections: 6
- For edge (9, 6), proceed because node 6 has fewer connections.
  Shared connections: 4

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 6>
