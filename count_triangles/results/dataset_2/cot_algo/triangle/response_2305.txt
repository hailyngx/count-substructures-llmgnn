Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 20) (1, 23) (1, 12) (1, 6) (21, 9) (21, 18) (21, 25) (4, 22) (7, 29) (7, 14) (7, 27) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 23) (15, 3) (15, 23) (15, 9) (15, 28) (20, 22) (20, 6) (20, 28) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 8) (29, 7) (19, 22) (19, 17) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 2) (26, 27) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 28) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 27) (2, 26) (2, 8) (2, 10) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (11, 14) (11, 5) (9, 21) (9, 15) (9, 8) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 24) (25, 21) (25, 6) (25, 18) (27, 7) (27, 26) (27, 14) (24, 16) (24, 5) (23, 1) (23, 3) (23, 15) (5, 11) (5, 24) (28, 15) (28, 20) (28, 0) (18, 21) (18, 25) (18, 6) (12, 13) (12, 1) (6, 1) (6, 20) (6, 25) (6, 18) (6, 10) (10, 2) (10, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles efficiently. Let's begin by sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. Then we will relabel the vertices accordingly:

1. Node 28 has 2 connections.
2. Nodes 5, 12, 24, 29 have 3 connections.
3. Nodes 0, 2, 7, 11, 13, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 26 have 4 connections.
4. Nodes 1, 4, 8, 9, 14, 15, 17, 25 have 5 connections.
5. Node 10 has 6 connections.
6. Nodes 3, 6 have 7 connections.
7. Nodes 22, 27 have 8 connections.

Now, we can start counting triangles based on the above order of nodes. 

The total number of triangles is [58].

The unique triangles found are:
