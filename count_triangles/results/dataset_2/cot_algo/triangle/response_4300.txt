Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 2) (2, 17) (2, 1) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 0) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 8) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 11) (5, 15) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 19) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 10) (0, 18) (0, 16) (0, 13) (8, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (19, 6) (19, 3) (16, 0) (16, 13) (11, 18) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 9) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 19) (9, 11) (9, 15) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 9) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 8) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Here is the sorted list of vertices with their degrees:

Vertex 17: Degree 3
Vertex 18: Degree 3
Vertex 2: Degree 3
Vertex 0: Degree 3
Vertex 12: Degree 3
Vertex 1: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 4
Vertex 19: Degree 2
Vertex 16: Degree 2
Vertex 9: Degree 2
Vertex 15: Degree 3
Vertex 5: Degree 3
Vertex 6: Degree 3
Vertex 11: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 4
Vertex 4: Degree 4
Vertex 13: Degree 4
Vertex 10: Degree 5
Vertex 14: Degree 3

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This ensures that each triangle is counted only once.

After examining the edges, we find the following triangles <1, 10, 12>, <1, 10, 8>, <1, 2, 17>, <9, 11, 8>, <3, 5, 10>, <3, 6, 15>, <3, 13, 4>, <3, 14, 4>, <4, 11, 8>, <12, 8, 10>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
