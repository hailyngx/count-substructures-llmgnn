Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 6) (15, 2) (15, 11) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 16) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 13) (17, 10) (17, 7) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 9) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 16) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 12) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 5) (19, 10) (19, 7) (19, 13) (2, 15) (2, 16) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 18) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 19) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 9) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 1) (13, 6) (6, 3) (6, 13) (5, 16) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, and then relabeling them accordingly. 

Here are the nodes sorted by their degrees in ascending order:
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 19: 3 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 15: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 17: 2 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 10: 5 connections
Node 11: 6 connections
Node 16: 6 connections

Now, let's consider the edges starting from the ones that involve nodes with the lowest degree and only proceed when the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Edges to consider:
(5, 16) -> Node 5 has 1 connection, Node 16 has 6 connections
(1, 9) -> Node 1 has 2 connections, Node 9 has 3 connections
(2, 15) -> Node 2 has 2 connections, Node 15 has 2 connections
(18, 12) -> Node 18 has 3 connections, Node 12 has 3 connections
(19, 10) -> Node 19 has 3 connections, Node 10 has 5 connections
(0, 14) -> Node 0 has 3 connections, Node 14 has 4 connections
(6, 13) -> Node 6 has 3 connections, Node 13 has 4 connections
(4, 8) -> Node 4 has 3 connections, Node 8 has 3 connections
(3, 7) -> Node 3 has 2 connections, Node 7 has 4 connections
(17, 7) -> Node 17 has 2 connections, Node 7 has 4 connections
