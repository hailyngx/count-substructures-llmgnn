Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 12) (2, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 3) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
   - Vertices 1, 2, 12, 5, 13, 2 have 1 connection each.
   - Vertices 7, 9 have 2 connections each.
   - Vertices 10, 14 have 3 connections each.
   - Vertices 6 has 4 connections.
   - Vertices 0, 3, 11, 8 have 5 connections each.
   - Vertex 4 has 6 connections.

2. Relabel the vertices according to their sorted order:
   - Vertex 1 -> A
   - Vertex 2 -> B
   - Vertex 12 -> C
   - Vertex 5 -> D
   - Vertex 13 -> E
   - Vertex 2 -> F
   - Vertex 7 -> G
   - Vertex 9 -> H
   - Vertex 10 -> I
   - Vertex 14 -> J
   - Vertex 6 -> K
   - Vertex 0 -> L
   - Vertex 3 -> M
   - Vertex 11 -> N
   - Vertex 8 -> O
   - Vertex 4 -> P

3. Count the total number of triangles using the given edges based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
   - Triangle 1: <A, D, G>
   - Triangle 2: <A, D, L>
   - Triangle 3: <A, G, L>
   - Triangle 4: <B, M, N>
   - Triangle 5: <B, M, C>
   - Triangle 6: <B, N, C>
   - Triangle 7: <D, G, L>
   - Triangle 8: <E, M, N>
   - Triangle 9: <E, M, F>
   - Triangle 10: <E, N, F>
   - Triangle 11: <I, K, N>
   - Triangle 12: <I, K, J>
   - Triangle 13: <I, N, J>
   - Triangle 14: <K, L, N>
   - Triangle 15: <O, L, N>
   - Triangle 16: <O, L, F>
   - Triangle 17: <O, N, F>
   - Triangle 18: <P, G, L>
   - Triangle 19: <P, G, O>
   - Triangle 20: <P, L, O>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [20].
