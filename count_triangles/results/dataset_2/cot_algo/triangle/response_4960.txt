Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 19) (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 15) (9, 5) (1, 13) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 19) (18, 17) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 14) (19, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 15) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 13) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 19) (13, 1) (13, 15) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method as described. 

Let's first sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):
- Node 18 and Node 1 have 0 connections.
- Node 9, Node 3, Node 0, and Node 13 have 1 connection.
- Node 16, Node 10, Node 2, and Node 18 have 2 connections.
- Node 7 and Node 1 have 3 connections.
- Node 5 and Node 6 have 4 connections.
- Node 14 has 5 connections.
- Node 12 has 6 connections.
- Node 8 has 7 connections.
- Node 15 has 8 connections.
- Node 17 has 9 connections.
- Node 4 has 10 connections.
- Node 11 and Node 19 have 12 connections.

Next, we will label the nodes accordingly:
- Node 18 and Node 1 → Label 0
- Node 9, Node 3, Node 0, and Node 13 → Label 1
- Node 16, Node 10, Node 2, and Node 18 → Label 2
- Node 7 and Node 1 → Label 3
- Node 5 and Node 6 → Label 4
- Node 14 → Label 5
- Node 12 → Label 6
- Node 8 → Label 7
- Node 15 → Label 8
- Node 17 → Label 9
- Node 4 → Label 10
- Node 11 and Node 19 → Label 12

Now, we will count the triangles based on the sorted labels and edges. Upon analyzing, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].

The unique triangles found are:
- <12, 0, 6>
- <12, 0, 4>
- <12, 6, 4>
- <1, 13, 15>
- <1, 13, 5>
- <1, 13, 15>
- <2, 6, 4>
- <7, 15, 6>
- <11, 16, 19>
