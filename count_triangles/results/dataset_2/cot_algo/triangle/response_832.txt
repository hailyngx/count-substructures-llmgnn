Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 4) (5, 9) (5, 29) (5, 11) (5, 24) (6, 17) (6, 10) (3, 21) (3, 10) (25, 15) (25, 0) (18, 27) (18, 10) (18, 20) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 28) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 12) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 20) (2, 21) (29, 5) (29, 2) (29, 28) (0, 25) (0, 24) (0, 1) (20, 9) (20, 18) (20, 2) (28, 22) (28, 29) (28, 15) (8, 2) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 7) (15, 25) (15, 28) (27, 9) (27, 18) (27, 14) (1, 26) (1, 0) (1, 8) (21, 3) (21, 2) (16, 24) (16, 17) (16, 14) (11, 5) (11, 23) (4, 26) (4, 22) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 16) (24, 5) (24, 0) (24, 16) (24, 7) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 12) (12, 23) (12, 19) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 7) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 14) (7, 8) (7, 24) (7, 13) (14, 27) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 13) (14, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles requires us to first sort the nodes based on their degrees. Here is the sorted list of nodes with their corresponding degrees:

Node 27: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 6: degree 2
Node 11: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 9: degree 4
Node 26: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 29: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 15: degree 3
Node 18: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 0: degree 3
Node 20: degree 4
Node 28: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 25: degree 2
Node 21: degree 2
Node 23: degree 3
Node 22: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 16: degree 3
Node 24: degree 4
Node 12: degree 2
Node 19: degree 4
Node 13: degree 3

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Triangle <5, 9, 24>
2. Triangle <2, 20, 28>
3. Triangle <8, 1, 26>
4. Triangle <5, 9, 20>
5. Triangle <5, 9, 27>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
