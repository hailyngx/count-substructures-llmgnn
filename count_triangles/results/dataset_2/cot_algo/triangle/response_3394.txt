Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). The vertices are then relabeled accordingly. 

The sorted vertices with their degrees are:
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections

Using the method of considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will count the triangles.

The total number of triangles is: [9]

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 8, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<2, 3, 7>
