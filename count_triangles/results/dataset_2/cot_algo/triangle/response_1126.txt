Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 7) (5, 10) (5, 7) (13, 3) (0, 19) (0, 9) (16, 17) (16, 6) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 2) (6, 17) (6, 16) (6, 7) (6, 15) (1, 2) (1, 19) (19, 0) (19, 11) (19, 1) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 12) (7, 17) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 18) (4, 15) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 18) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 12) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 3) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 3) (18, 17) (18, 7) (18, 15) 

Response:
The nodes can be represented as follows based on their degrees:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 1
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 3
- Node 10 has degree 3
- Node 11 has degree 4
- Node 12 has degree 3
- Node 13 has degree 1
- Node 14 has degree 5
- Node 15 has degree 4
- Node 16 has degree 3
- Node 17 has degree 5
- Node 18 has degree 3
- Node 19 has degree 3

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given graph and using the provided edges, we can count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles is: [17]

The unique triangles found are:
- <2, 9, 3>
- <2, 11, 19>
- <3, 9, 10>
- <3, 9, 12>
- <3, 10, 5>
- <3, 10, 14>
- <3, 12, 8>
- <5, 10, 14>
- <6, 7, 17>
- <6, 7, 18>
- <6, 15, 4>
- <7, 17, 14>
- <7, 17, 18>
- <8, 12, 14>
- <9, 10, 14>
- <9, 12, 3>
- <10, 14, 17>
