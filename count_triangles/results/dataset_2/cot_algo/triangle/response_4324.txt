Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (4, 2), (2, 7), (7, 0), (4, 0)
- 1: (5, 9), (9, 1), (6, 1), (1, 5), (1, 6), (9, 5)
- 2: (6, 2), (8, 2), (2, 8), (2, 0), (2, 7)
- 3: (5, 3), (6, 3), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 7)
- 4: (5, 4), (9, 4), (6, 4), (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 0)
- 5: (9, 5), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 3)
- 6: (9, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 4), (1, 6), (3, 6), (6, 9), (2, 6)
- 7: (9, 7), (3, 7), (8, 7), (7, 2), (7, 0)
- 8: (3, 8), (4, 8), (8, 3), (2, 8), (8, 2)
- 9: (5, 9), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 1), (9, 7), (6, 9), (7, 9)

Next, we will label the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Node degrees:  
0: 4,  
1: 6,  
2: 5,  
3: 5,  
4: 7,  
5: 4,  
6: 9,  
7: 5,  
8: 5,  
9: 7

Labelling Nodes:  
Node 0: 0,  
Node 5: 1,  
Node 2: 2,  
Node 3: 3,  
Node 7: 4,  
Node 1: 5,  
Node 8: 6,  
Node 4: 7,  
Node 9: 8,  
Node 6: 9

Now, we will count the number of triangles and list them as unique triangles (in ascending order):

Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles:
<2, 4, 7>,  
<0, 2, 4>,  
<2, 4, 6>,  
<1, 4, 5>,  
<1, 5, 9>,  
<0, 4, 7>,  
<3, 4, 7>,  
<2, 6, 8>,  
<1, 4, 9>,  
<3, 6, 9>,  
<2, 4, 8>,  
<1, 5, 8>
