Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering is as follows:
Node 3: degree 2
Node 5: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5

By following the degree-based ordering, we count the triangles and find the unique triangles: 
Total number of triangles: [11]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 9>
