Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {3, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {9, 7, 1}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 1, 0}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 5, 3}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 1, 8, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 3, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 1, 5}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 4, 2}

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 3, 5} -> Node 0 (degree 4)
- Node 1: {3, 2, 5, 8} -> Node 1 (degree 4)
- Node 2: {9, 7, 1} -> Node 2 (degree 3)
- Node 3: {4, 7, 1, 0} -> Node 3 (degree 4)
- Node 4: {9, 7, 5, 3} -> Node 2 (degree 4)
- Node 5: {4, 7, 1, 8, 0} -> Node 5 (degree 5)
- Node 6: {9, 8, 0} -> Node 6 (degree 3)
- Node 7: {4, 0, 3, 2, 5} -> Node 7 (degree 5)
- Node 8: {6, 9, 1, 5} -> Node 6 (degree 4)
- Node 9: {6, 8, 4, 2} -> Node 7 (degree 4)

Now, we will count the triangles:
- For each edge, we will only consider cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 5, 7>

Total number of triangles: [7]
