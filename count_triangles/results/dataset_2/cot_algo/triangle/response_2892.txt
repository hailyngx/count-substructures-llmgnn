Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 3), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 0), (1, 5), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 8), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 4), (3, 2), (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 8), (4, 0), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 7), (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 0), (2, 3), (2, 6), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 6), (7, 8), (7, 6)
