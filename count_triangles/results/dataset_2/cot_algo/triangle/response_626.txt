Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the graph. 

After sorting the vertices based on the number of connections from least to most:
Node 9 is connected to 2 other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to 3 other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to 4 other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to 4 other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to 4 other nodes.
Node 0 is connected to 4 other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to 5 other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to 6 other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to 6 other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to 6 other nodes.

Now, following the method for each edge, we will identify the triangles:
1. (6, 5):
    - Shared connections: 1, 3, 7
    - Triangles: <1, 3, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <3, 5, 7>
2. (6, 1):
    - Shared connections: 3, 4, 7
    - Triangles: <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 1, 7>
3. (6, 7):
    - Shared connections: 1, 3, 5
    - Triangles: <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 3>, <3, 5, 7>
4. (9, 4):
    - Shared connections: 0, 1
    - Triangle: <0, 1, 4>
5. (9, 0):
    - No triangles (degree-based ordering not applicable due to equal degrees)

Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles: <1, 3, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 1, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <0, 1, 4>.
