Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 1) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 5) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree.

Here is the list of vertices with their degrees:
Vertex 0: degree 4
Vertex 1: degree 6
Vertex 2: degree 3
Vertex 3: degree 3
Vertex 4: degree 5
Vertex 5: degree 2
Vertex 6: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 2
Vertex 8: degree 4
Vertex 9: degree 5
Vertex 10: degree 6
Vertex 11: degree 6
Vertex 12: degree 5
Vertex 13: degree 3
Vertex 14: degree 6

Now, let's identify the triangles formed by the edges in the graph:

1. Vertex 6, Vertex 1, Vertex 10 <6, 1, 10>
2. Vertex 1, Vertex 4, Vertex 10 <1, 4, 10>
3. Vertex 1, Vertex 10, Vertex 11 <1, 10, 11>
4. Vertex 1, Vertex 0, Vertex 6 <1, 0, 6>
5. Vertex 1, Vertex 7, Vertex 4 <1, 7, 4>
6. Vertex 1, Vertex 11, Vertex 4 <1, 11, 4>
7. Vertex 1, Vertex 2, Vertex 10 <1, 2, 10>
8. Vertex 0, Vertex 5, Vertex 14 <0, 5, 14>
9. Vertex 0, Vertex 1, Vertex 5 <0, 1, 5>
10. Vertex 0, Vertex 8, Vertex 9 <0, 8, 9>
11. Vertex 0, Vertex 1, Vertex 6 <0, 1, 6>
12. Vertex 9, Vertex 11, Vertex 10 <9, 11, 10>
13. Vertex 11, Vertex 12, Vertex 10 <11, 12, 10>
14. Vertex 11, Vertex 8, Vertex 9 <11, 8, 9>
15. Vertex 11, Vertex 3, Vertex 10 <11, 3, 10>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
