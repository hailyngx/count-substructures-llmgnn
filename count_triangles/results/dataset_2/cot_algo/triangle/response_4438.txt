Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph described can be represented as follows:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 7), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 7), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 9), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 2), (8, 7), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Next, we will sort the nodes by their degrees (number of connections):

Nodes by degree: [0(2), 4(4), 8(2), 6(4), 7(4), 5(4), 9(5), 3(4), 1(5), 2(5)]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles:

Triangles: [23]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 8, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 4, 9>
<7, 8, 2>
<7, 9, 1>
<8, 2, 0>
