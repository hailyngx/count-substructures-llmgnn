Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 20) (16, 29) (16, 22) (16, 15) (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 21) (26, 9) (26, 14) (26, 10) (26, 29) (14, 26) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 28) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 22) (8, 20) (8, 1) (8, 18) (13, 25) (13, 1) (10, 26) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 12) (2, 12) (18, 8) (18, 20) (6, 21) (6, 23) (21, 9) (21, 6) (29, 16) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 19) (19, 29) (19, 15) (19, 25) (23, 6) (23, 4) (23, 25) (23, 0) (25, 13) (25, 19) (25, 23) (27, 5) (0, 10) (0, 23) (0, 3) (12, 10) (12, 2) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 5) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 20) (7, 14) (7, 24) (7, 28) (7, 1) (20, 11) (20, 8) (20, 18) (20, 3) (24, 7) (24, 28) (24, 5) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (4, 23) (4, 28) (22, 16) (22, 17) (22, 28) (28, 14) (28, 7) (28, 24) (28, 4) (28, 22) (5, 27) (5, 15) (5, 24) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph. 

The sorted vertices along with their degrees are as follows:
0 (4), 2 (1), 5 (4), 6 (2), 11 (1), 4 (2), 8 (4), 13 (2), 16 (4), 18 (3), 27 (1), 1 (6), 7 (5), 12 (2), 17 (4), 3 (4), 9 (4), 19 (3), 21 (2), 22 (3), 23 (4), 24 (3), 26 (4), 28 (6), 10 (4), 14 (5), 15 (3), 25 (4), 29 (4).

Now we will count the triangles:
1. Triangles connected to node 2: None
2. Triangles connected to node 5: None
3. Triangles connected to node 6: None
4. Triangles connected to node 11: None
5. Triangles connected to node 4: None
6. Triangles connected to node 13: None
7. Triangles connected to node 18: None
8. Triangles connected to node 27: None
9. Triangles connected to node 3: None
10. Triangles connected to node 21: None
11. Triangles connected to node 12: None
12. Triangles connected to node 19: None
13. Triangles connected to node 22: None
14. Triangles connected to node 24: None
15. Triangles connected to node 15: None
16. Triangles connected to node 25: None
17. Triangles connected to node 29: None
18. Triangles connected to node 16: None
19. Triangles connected to node 0: <0, 10, 3>
20. Triangles connected to node 8: None
21. Triangles connected to node 7: None
22. Triangles connected to node 10: <10, 0, 12>, <10, 26, 17>, <10, 6, 21>
23. Triangles connected to node 14: <14, 17, 10>, <14, 1, 7>, <14, 26, 10>, <14, 28, 7>, <14, 21, 9>
24. Triangles connected to node 1: <1, 14, 7>, <1, 14, 13>, <1, 7, 24>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 14, 28>, <1, 8, 18>
25. Triangles connected to node 17: <17, 14, 10>, <17, 22, 28>, <17, 3, 0>, <17, 14, 26>
26. Triangles connected to node 20: <20, 18, 8>, <20, 3, 0>, <20, 3, 17>, <20, 18, 8>
27. Triangles connected to node 28: <28, 22, 17>, <28, 4, 24>, <28, 7, 24>, <28, 1, 14>, <28, 14, 7>, <28, 22, 17>
28. Triangles connected to node 6: None
29. Triangles connected to node 9: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [18].
