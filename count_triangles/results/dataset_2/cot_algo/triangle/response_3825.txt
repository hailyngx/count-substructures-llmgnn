Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (3, 1) (3, 4) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 12) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 19) (8, 5) (8, 15) (13, 17) (13, 0) (6, 7) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 19) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 9) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 9) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 5) (14, 19) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 15) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (12, 18) (12, 14) (12, 15) (9, 7) (9, 16) (9, 11) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Let's apply the method to the given graph:

First, we'll list the nodes based on the number of connections they have in ascending order:  
0: 4 connections  
1: 2 connections  
3: 2 connections  
6: 2 connections  
8: 2 connections  
13: 2 connections  
14: 4 connections  
17: 5 connections  
10: 2 connections  
16: 4 connections  
12: 3 connections  
9: 3 connections  
15: 3 connections  
18: 4 connections  
7: 4 connections  
2: 5 connections  
5: 4 connections  
4: 3 connections  
11: 4 connections  
19: 4 connections  

Then, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.  

The triangles found using the Degree-Based Ordering method are:  
<0, 13, 19>  
<0, 11, 14>  
<0, 11, 19>  
<0, 13, 17>  
<2, 5, 10>  
<2, 5, 11>  
<2, 7, 16>  
<4, 2, 5>  
<4, 2, 19>  
<4, 3, 19>  
<4, 11, 14>  
<5, 8, 15>  
<7, 9, 11>  
<7, 9, 16>  
<12, 14, 15>  
<14, 11, 15>  
<16, 7, 9>  

Therefore, there are 16 triangles in the given graph.  
The total number of triangles is [16].
