Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 3) (2, 13) (2, 25) (29, 15) (29, 24) (8, 23) (8, 7) (23, 8) (23, 5) (23, 19) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 25) (27, 21) (27, 28) (27, 16) (5, 23) (5, 6) (5, 25) (5, 4) (5, 20) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 1) (6, 7) (10, 28) (22, 14) (22, 26) (22, 11) (22, 20) (26, 22) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 21) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 26) (13, 25) (21, 14) (21, 27) (21, 6) (21, 26) (18, 26) (18, 20) (15, 29) (15, 16) (15, 24) (16, 27) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 19) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 3) (1, 6) (1, 16) (25, 17) (25, 2) (25, 12) (25, 5) (25, 13) (9, 24) (9, 3) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 9) (11, 22) (11, 0) (19, 23) (19, 16) (19, 0) (7, 8) (7, 6) (20, 5) (20, 22) (20, 18) (0, 11) (0, 19) (28, 27) (28, 10) (28, 24) (24, 29) (24, 15) (24, 9) (24, 28) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree of connections in ascending order. Then, the nodes are relabeled accordingly. 

After relabeling the nodes, the sorted list is as follows:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 10: Degree 2
Node 18: Degree 2
Node 20: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 17: Degree 3
Node 19: Degree 3
Node 26: Degree 3
Node 29: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 21: Degree 4
Node 22: Degree 4
Node 25: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 5: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 13: Degree 5
Node 15: Degree 5
Node 23: Degree 5
Node 12: Degree 6
Node 4: Degree 7
Node 16: Degree 7
Node 27: Degree 7
Node 24: Degree 7
Node 14: Degree 8

For counting triangles, we follow the rule that for each edge, we proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles in this graph is [32].
Unique triangles found are:
