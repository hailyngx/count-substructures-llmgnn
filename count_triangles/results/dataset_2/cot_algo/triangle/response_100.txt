Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) 

Response:
The degree distribution for the vertices in the given graph is as follows:
Node 0: Degree 5, Node 1: Degree 4, Node 2: Degree 3, Node 3: Degree 4, Node 4: Degree 4, Node 5: Degree 4, Node 6: Degree 5, Node 7: Degree 3, Node 8: Degree 4, Node 9: Degree 3.

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices can be relabeled as follows:
Node 2: 0, Node 7: 1, Node 9: 2, Node 8: 3, Node 3: 4, Node 5: 5, Node 1: 6, Node 4: 7, Node 0: 8, Node 6: 9.

The sorted edges based on the new labels are as follows: (2, 0), (2, 1), (7, 1), (1, 0), (0, 3), (0, 8), (1, 3), (3, 4), (3, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 5), (8, 5), (5, 7), (5, 9), (5, 6), (6, 9), (7, 8), (9, 7), (9, 8).

By examining shared connections between vertices connected by edges, we find the following triangles:
<0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 8, 5>, <1, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 7>, <5, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
