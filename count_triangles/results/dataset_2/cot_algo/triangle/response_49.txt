Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 16) (22, 13) (22, 6) (22, 12) (22, 1) (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 13) (16, 11) (16, 20) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 22) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 27) (3, 26) (9, 18) (9, 2) (26, 3) (26, 28) (26, 23) (12, 22) (12, 10) (12, 23) (27, 3) (27, 21) (27, 24) (27, 6) (0, 2) (0, 15) (2, 14) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (28, 26) (28, 19) (28, 5) (28, 10) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 8) (21, 27) (21, 29) (23, 26) (23, 12) (23, 25) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 29) (15, 4) (19, 14) (19, 28) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 29) (29, 21) (29, 15) (29, 7) (29, 8) (29, 5) (20, 16) (20, 10) (25, 13) (25, 23) (24, 27) (10, 12) (10, 28) (10, 20) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 28) (5, 29) (5, 4) (6, 22) (6, 27) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 29) (4, 15) (4, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method consists of sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections), from least to most connections, and then assigning labels based on this ordering. Let's apply this method to the given graph:

Vertices sorted by degree (least to most):
Vertex 3 - Degree 3
Vertex 4 - Degree 3
Vertex 14 - Degree 3
Vertex 16 - Degree 3
Vertex 20 - Degree 3
Vertex 21 - Degree 3
Vertex 24 - Degree 3
Vertex 9 - Degree 4
Vertex 0 - Degree 4
Vertex 6 - Degree 4
Vertex 12 - Degree 4
Vertex 19 - Degree 4
Vertex 1 - Degree 5
Vertex 2 - Degree 5
Vertex 10 - Degree 5
Vertex 15 - Degree 5
Vertex 17 - Degree 5
Vertex 22 - Degree 5
Vertex 25 - Degree 5
Vertex 8 - Degree 6
Vertex 11 - Degree 6
Vertex 23 - Degree 6
Vertex 26 - Degree 6
Vertex 5 - Degree 7
Vertex 7 - Degree 7
Vertex 29 - Degree 7
Vertex 18 - Degree 8
Vertex 27 - Degree 8
Vertex 28 - Degree 8
Vertex 13 - Degree 9

Now, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles by examining shared connections:

Triangles:
<2, 7, 18>
<23, 26, 28>
<5, 11, 29>
<12, 22, 25>
<3, 1, 5>
<27, 6, 22>
<16, 11, 5>
<18, 8, 11>
<9, 2, 7>
Total number of triangles: [9]
