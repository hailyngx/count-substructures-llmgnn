Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (16, 11) (16, 17) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 12) (13, 5) (13, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 19) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 2) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 7) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 18) (2, 10) (2, 19) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 2) (7, 8) (7, 15) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 13) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 17) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. The vertices are then relabeled accordingly. 

After sorting the vertices, the new labeling with the number of connections for each vertex is:
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 10: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 16: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 4
Node 17: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 11: Degree 5
Node 15: Degree 5
Node 18: Degree 5
Node 14: Degree 6
Node 19: Degree 6

Following the edge information given, we proceed only for edges where the vertex with lower label has fewer connections:
1. Edge between Node 16 (Degree 3) and Node 17 (Degree 4) forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 6 (Degree 4) <16,17,6>.
2. Edge between Node 1 (Degree 3) and Node 3 (Degree 5) forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 11 (Degree 5) <1,3,11>.
3. Edge between Node 1 (Degree 3) and Node 4 (Degree 2) forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 5 (Degree 3) <1,4,5>.
4. Edge between Node 1 (Degree 3) and Node 8 (Degree 4) forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 9 (Degree 5) <1,8,9>.
5. Edge between Node 3 (Degree 5) and Node 19 (Degree 6) forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 9 (Degree 5) <3,19,9>.
6. Edge between Node 8 (Degree 4) and Node 9 (Degree 5) forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 1 (Degree 3) <8,9,1>.
7. Edge between Node 5 (Degree 3) and Node 13 (Degree 3) forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 12 (Degree 4) <5,13,12>.
8. Edge between Node 6 (Degree 4) and Node 17 (Degree 4) forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 16 (Degree 3) <6,17,16>.
9. Edge between Node 6 (Degree 4) and Node 14 (Degree 6) forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 0 (Degree 3) <6,14,0>.
10. Edge between Node 6 (Degree 4) and Node 0 (Degree 3) forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 14 (Degree 6) <6,0,14>.
11. Edge between Node 14 (Degree 6) and Node 11 (Degree 5) forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 6 (Degree 4) <14,11,6>.
12. Edge between Node 14 (Degree 6) and Node 12 (Degree 4) forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 3 (Degree 5) <14,12,3>.
13. Edge between Node 14 (Degree 6) and Node 18 (Degree 5) forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 17 (Degree 4) <14,18,17>.
14. Edge between Node 14 (Degree 6) and Node 0 (Degree 3) forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 6 (Degree 4) <14,0,6>.
15. Edge between Node 13 (Degree 3) and Node 12 (Degree 4) forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 3 (Degree 5) <13,12,3>.
16. Edge between Node 18 (Degree 5) and Node 17 (Degree 4) forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 14 (Degree 6) <18,17,14>.
17. Edge between Node 10 (Degree 3) and Node 15 (Degree 5) forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 9 (Degree 5) <10,15,9>.
18. Edge between Node 10 (Degree 3) and Node 18 (Degree 5) forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 14 (Degree 6) <10,18,14>.
19. Edge between Node 10 (Degree 3) and Node 2 (Degree 3) forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 19 (Degree 6) <10,2,19>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [19].
