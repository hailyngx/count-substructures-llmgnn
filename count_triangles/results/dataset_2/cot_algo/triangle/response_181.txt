Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 5) 

Response:
The nodes and edges in the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 2), (7, 6), (7, 9), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 0), (9, 2), (9, 1), (1, 9), (1, 0), (3, 9), (8, 5), (2, 5), (5, 0)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order:

Nodes with degrees:
0: 3
1: 3
5: 3
8: 3
3: 4
9: 4
2: 4
7: 4
6: 5
4: 6

Next, we will check each edge and count the triangles. We will only count a triangle if the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

After counting all possible triangles, we find that the total number of triangles is [11], and the unique triangles are <3, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 8>.
