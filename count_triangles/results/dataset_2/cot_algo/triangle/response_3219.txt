Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 18) (21, 3) (21, 9) (21, 12) (15, 0) (15, 4) (27, 14) (3, 21) (3, 25) (3, 16) (3, 19) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 23) (4, 15) (8, 9) (8, 26) (17, 25) (17, 29) (17, 6) (17, 2) (29, 17) (29, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 26) (28, 11) (28, 23) (22, 26) (22, 0) (22, 24) (26, 8) (26, 6) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 7) (11, 28) (11, 2) (5, 29) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 20) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 0) (20, 5) (20, 10) (18, 1) (18, 26) (18, 5) (19, 1) (19, 3) (9, 21) (9, 25) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 16) (12, 21) (12, 14) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 7) (24, 23) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 24) (16, 2) (14, 27) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 2) (7, 26) (7, 24) (0, 15) (0, 22) (0, 13) (0, 9) (23, 25) (23, 28) (23, 24) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 20) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then, we relabel the vertices according to this ordering.

Here is the list of vertices sorted by their degrees:
Vertex 11: degree 2
Vertex 13: degree 2
Vertex 20: degree 2
Vertex 4: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 2
Vertex 10: degree 2
Vertex 5: degree 3
Vertex 12: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 19: degree 3
Vertex 21: degree 3
Vertex 28: degree 3
Vertex 0: degree 4
Vertex 3: degree 4
Vertex 14: degree 4
Vertex 15: degree 4
Vertex 22: degree 4
Vertex 24: degree 4
Vertex 27: degree 4
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 4
Vertex 9: degree 5
Vertex 29: degree 5
Vertex 2: degree 5
Vertex 17: degree 5
Vertex 26: degree 6
Vertex 25: degree 6
Vertex 16: degree 6
Vertex 18: degree 6
Vertex 23: degree 6

Now, we can count the triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 10]
<0, 15, 4>
<0, 15, 9>
<0, 13, 10>
<0, 13, 5>
<3, 25, 17>
<3, 25, 9>
<3, 16, 2>
<9, 21, 3>
<9, 21, 12>
<14, 6, 17>
