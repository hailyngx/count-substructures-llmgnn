Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 29) (15, 17) (15, 24) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 19) (7, 21) (7, 8) (21, 7) (21, 8) (21, 25) (12, 27) (12, 16) (12, 28) (12, 23) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (13, 26) (13, 19) (26, 13) (26, 11) (26, 8) (17, 15) (17, 20) (17, 24) (20, 17) (20, 9) (20, 23) (20, 16) (11, 26) (11, 23) (11, 2) (23, 12) (23, 20) (23, 11) (23, 25) (23, 3) (9, 20) (9, 2) (9, 28) (29, 15) (29, 8) (29, 22) (29, 18) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 19) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (16, 12) (16, 20) (16, 3) (3, 23) (3, 16) (3, 22) (19, 27) (19, 13) (19, 1) (19, 4) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 1) (4, 1) (4, 19) (25, 21) (25, 23) (18, 29) (18, 0) (28, 12) (28, 9) (14, 10) (24, 15) (24, 17) (8, 7) (8, 21) (8, 26) (8, 29) (8, 22) (22, 29) (22, 3) (22, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph using the provided edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
- 0-6, 0-10, 0-18
- 1-2, 1-4, 1-6, 1-19
- 2-9, 2-11
- 3-16, 3-22, 3-23
- 4-19
- 5-6
- 6-10
- 7-8, 7-21
- 8-21, 8-22, 8-26, 8-29
- 9-20, 9-28
- 10-14
- 11-23, 11-26
- 12-16, 12-23, 12-27, 12-28
- 13-19, 13-26
- 14-10
- 15-17, 15-24, 15-27, 15-29
- 16-20
- 17-20
- 18-29
- 19-27
- 20-23
- 21-25
- 22-29
- 23-25
- 24-17
- 25-21

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Node 5 has 1 connection
- Node 13 has 2 connections
- Node 4, 14, 18, 26 have 3 connections
- Node 0, 7 have 4 connections
- Node 1, 2, 3, 9 have 5 connections
- Node 10, 11, 16, 24 have 6 connections
- Node 8, 20 have 7 connections
- Node 6, 12, 15, 17, 22, 28 have 8 connections
- Node 19, 23, 25, 27, 29 have 9 connections
- Node 21 has 10 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using this ordering. After going through all edges while following the rule that the lower labeled vertex must have fewer connections, we find that there are:
- 8 triangles (total number of triangles) inside brackets [ ].
- <1, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 11>, <1, 6, 19>, <2, 9, 20>, <2, 11, 23>, <3, 16, 23>, <8, 21, 25>, <15, 17, 24> inside brackets < >.
