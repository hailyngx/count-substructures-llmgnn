Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Edges: 
- 0: [5, 9, 6, 4, 8]
- 1: [9, 6, 3]
- 2: [3, 8]
- 3: [5, 6, 1, 2, 8]
- 4: [5, 7, 0]
- 5: [4, 0, 3, 7]
- 6: [9, 1, 7, 3, 0]
- 7: [5, 6, 4, 8]
- 8: [9, 7, 3, 2, 0]
- 9: [6, 8, 1, 0]

Now, we can count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [5, 0, 3] <5, 4, 7> <5, 7, 8> <5, 9, 6> <5, 0, 9> <5, 4, 0> <5, 3, 0> <5, 4, 0> <5, 3, 8> <0, 9, 8> <0, 6, 9> <0, 6, 7> <3, 6, 1> <3, 1, 9> <3, 1, 6> <3, 1, 6> <3, 1, 9> <3, 9, 8> <4, 7, 8> <4, 7, 6> <4, 7, 6> <4, 7, 8> <7, 6, 8> <7, 6, 8> <9, 6, 1> <9, 6, 7> <9, 1, 6> <6, 1, 7>]

Total number of triangles: [27]
