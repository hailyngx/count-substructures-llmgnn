Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 13) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 14) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 10) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 1) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, let's construct the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (5, 9), (5, 0), (5, 10), (5, 7)
- 1: (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 11), (9, 3), (9, 13)
- 2: (6, 9), (6, 14), (6, 3), (6, 13)
- 3: (8, 13), (8, 11), (8, 3), (8, 1)
- 4: (13, 9), (13, 6), (13, 8), (13, 14)
- 5: (4, 12), (4, 2), (4, 1)
- 6: (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 2)
- 7: (7, 5), (7, 0), (7, 11), (7, 14)
- 8: (12, 4), (12, 2), (12, 10)
- 9: (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 0), (2, 12), (2, 10)
- 10: (11, 9), (11, 8), (11, 7), (11, 14), (11, 1)
- 11: (14, 6), (14, 13), (14, 7), (14, 11), (14, 1)
- 12: (1, 8), (1, 4), (1, 11), (1, 14)
- 13: (10, 5), (10, 12), (10, 2)
- 14: (3, 9), (3, 6), (3, 8)

Next, sort the nodes based on their degree:
Node Degree: 0(3), 1(4), 2(5), 3(3), 4(3), 5(4), 6(4), 7(4), 8(4), 9(6), 10(3), 11(5), 12(3), 13(4), 14(5)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 16]

<0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 10>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 7, 11>, <1, 4, 12>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 8, 11>, <2, 4, 12>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 9, 11>, <2, 9, 13>, <3, 8, 13>, <6, 9, 13>, <6, 9, 14>, <7, 11, 14>
