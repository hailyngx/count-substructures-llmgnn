Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 15) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 8) (17, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 10) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (15, 14) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 18) (16, 15) (16, 18) (16, 4) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 1) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 7) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 16) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 3) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 4) (12, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (4, 17) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections each vertex has:

Vertices sorted by degree (least to most):
Vertex 12: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 19: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 18: 4 connections
Vertex 16: 4 connections
Vertex 13: 4 connections
Vertex 11: 4 connections
Vertex 12: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 15: 5 connections
Vertex 18: 5 connections
Vertex 14: 5 connections
Vertex 0: 6 connections
Vertex 8: 6 connections
Vertex 17: 6 connections
Vertex 10: 7 connections

Now let's count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 12]

Unique triangles:
<4, 13, 16>
<2, 4, 16>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 10>
<13, 15, 18>
<4, 16, 18>
<3, 7, 19>
<10, 11, 13>
<0, 10, 17>
<0, 8, 17>
<0, 10, 14>
<9, 15, 18>
