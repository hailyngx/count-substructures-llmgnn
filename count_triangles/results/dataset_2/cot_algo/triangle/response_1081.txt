Response:
The graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges is as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}
Edges: (18, 22), (18, 23), (18, 12), (18, 29), (22, 18), (12, 18), (12, 27), (27, 12), (27, 1), (27, 13), (27, 23), (0, 20), (0, 3), (0, 21), (0, 17), (20, 0), (20, 6), (17, 0), (17, 15), (17, 7), (29, 18), (29, 4), (19, 26), (19, 2), (19, 28), (19, 10), (26, 19), (26, 25), (26, 4), (1, 27), (1, 15), (1, 25), (15, 17), (15, 1), (15, 25), (3, 0), (3, 24), (21, 0), (21, 23), (21, 5), (21, 14), (4, 29), (4, 26), (4, 23), (4, 25), (10, 19), (10, 2), (10, 14), (8, 28), (8, 5), (8, 25), (8, 6), (8, 7), (28, 19), (28, 8), (6, 20), (6, 8), (6, 14), (5, 21), (5, 8), (5, 24), (5, 14), (14, 21), (14, 10), (14, 6), (14, 5), (14, 16), (23, 18), (23, 27), (23, 21), (23, 4), (23, 2), (24, 3), (24, 5), (24, 9), (25, 26), (25, 1), (25, 15), (25, 4), (25, 8), (2, 19), (2, 10), (2, 23), (16, 14), (16, 13), (13, 27), (13, 16), (9, 24), (7, 17), (7, 8)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by degree (from least connected to most connected):
Vertices: [9, 22, 7, 3, 16, 20, 10, 1, 2, 5, 0, 6, 29, 13, 28, 12, 27, 19, 17, 21, 26, 4, 23, 14, 24, 8, 15, 25, 18]

Total number of triangles: [34]
