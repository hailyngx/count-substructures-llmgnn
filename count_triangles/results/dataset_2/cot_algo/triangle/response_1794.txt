Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 11) (1, 21) (1, 10) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 29) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 4) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 23) (17, 15) (17, 7) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 9) (18, 27) (7, 17) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 19) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 16) (6, 27) (4, 14) (8, 29) (8, 26) (8, 3) (0, 20) (0, 29) (20, 14) (20, 0) (20, 19) (11, 22) (11, 12) (11, 28) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 9) (16, 13) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 15) (19, 14) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 20) (19, 24) (26, 18) (26, 8) (26, 3) (25, 27) (25, 23) (25, 24) (27, 13) (27, 18) (27, 6) (27, 25) (27, 23) (3, 21) (3, 8) (3, 26) (9, 18) (9, 28) (15, 17) (15, 16) (15, 29) (10, 1) (10, 24) (10, 29) (29, 21) (29, 8) (29, 0) (29, 15) (29, 10) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 27) (24, 19) (24, 25) (24, 10) 

Response:
The given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
(13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 27) 
(22, 11) 
(1, 21) (1, 10) 
(21, 3) (21, 29) 
(14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 4) (14, 20) 
(17, 23) (17, 15) (17, 7) 
(2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 5) 
(18, 26) (18, 9) (18, 27) 
(7, 17) 
(12, 11) (12, 19) 
(5, 19) (5, 16) 
(6, 27) 
(8, 29) (8, 26) (8, 3) 
(0, 20) (0, 29) 
(11, 28) 
(28, 16) (28, 9) 
(19, 24) 
(26, 8) (26, 3) 
(25, 24) 
(27, 6) (27, 25) 
(3, 21) 
(9, 28) 
(15, 29) 
(10, 24)

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The sorted vertices based on the number of connections are:
6 < 7 < 0 < 5 < 4 < 16 < 21 < 15 < 10 < 20 < 3 < 25 < 9 < 26 < 12 < 23 < 27 < 18 < 24 < 14 < 22 < 1 < 2 < 13 < 28 < 29 < 11 < 19 < 17 < 8

Calculating the number of triangles, we get:

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 16, 28>
<13, 16, 28>
<0, 20, 24>
<10, 24, 29>
<19, 24, 25>
<17, 23, 25>
<7, 17, 23>
<2, 5, 19>
<14, 17, 23>
<15, 17, 23>
<2, 18, 26>
<3, 8, 29>
