Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 19) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 7) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 15) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 15) (4, 10) (4, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 2) (15, 9) (15, 13) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 7) (19, 16) (19, 3) (19, 0) (0, 6) (0, 19) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 7) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 19) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 18) (18, 11) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 7) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) and relabeling them. Let's label the vertices based on their degree:

- Vertex 19 (degree 4)
- Vertex 4 (degree 4)
- Vertex 0 (degree 4)
- Vertex 2 (degree 4)
- Vertex 9 (degree 2)
- Vertex 6 (degree 3)
- Vertex 3 (degree 5)
- Vertex 10 (degree 5)
- Vertex 18 (degree 5)
- Vertex 5 (degree 5)
- Vertex 7 (degree 5)
- Vertex 14 (degree 5)
- Vertex 1 (degree 4)
- Vertex 8 (degree 4)
- Vertex 13 (degree 4)
- Vertex 15 (degree 3)
- Vertex 17 (degree 3)
- Vertex 11 (degree 4)
- Vertex 16 (degree 4)
- Vertex 12 (degree 3)

Now, we will count the triangles by examining the edges based on the relabeled vertices:

- Triangle <3, 4, 7> (shared connection: 17)
- Triangle <3, 4, 10> (shared connection: 1)
- Triangle <5, 7, 18> (shared connection: 14)
- Triangle <6, 7, 10> (shared connection: 7)
- Triangle <6, 7, 18> (shared connection: 7)
- Triangle <7, 10, 18> (shared connection: 5)
- Triangle <1, 2, 13> (shared connection: 16)
- Triangle <8, 12, 10> (shared connection: 14)
- Triangle <11, 12, 18> (shared connection: 11)

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
