Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to find the number of triangles in the graph. Let's proceed step by step:

1. List the number of connections for each node:
   - Node 0: 2 connections
   - Node 1: 4 connections
   - Node 2: 6 connections
   - Node 3: 3 connections
   - Node 4: 4 connections
   - Node 5: 6 connections
   - Node 6: 4 connections
   - Node 7: 4 connections
   - Node 8: 4 connections
   - Node 9: 4 connections

2. Sort the nodes based on their number of connections (in increasing order):
   - Node 0: 2 connections
   - Node 3: 3 connections
   - Node 1: 4 connections
   - Node 4: 4 connections
   - Node 6: 4 connections
   - Node 7: 4 connections
   - Node 8: 4 connections
   - Node 9: 4 connections
   - Node 2: 6 connections
   - Node 5: 6 connections

3. Relabel the nodes based on the sorted order:
   - Node 0: 0
   - Node 3: 1
   - Node 1: 2
   - Node 4: 3
   - Node 6: 4
   - Node 7: 5
   - Node 8: 6
   - Node 9: 7
   - Node 2: 8
   - Node 5: 9

4. Check each edge and count the triangles:
   - Triangles: <2, 1, 3>, <2, 1, 4>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <4, 6, 7>
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
