Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 14) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 6) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 0) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a visual representation of the graph using the provided edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (2, 6), (6, 12), (9, 10)
- 1: (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (4, 11), (4, 1), (4, 3), (6, 10), (6, 12), (6, 1), (6, 14), (7, 11), (7, 12), (7, 14), (7, 5), (7, 1), (12, 7), (12, 13), (12, 6), (12, 1), (2, 8), (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 0), (8, 3)
- 2: (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 9), (3, 8)
- 3: (4, 3), (3, 10), (3, 12)
- 4: (1, 4)
- 5: (7, 5), (5, 13), (5, 14)
- 6: (0, 6), (6, 2), (6, 12), (6, 14), (6, 1)
- 7: (1, 7), (7, 11), (7, 14), (7, 5), (7, 12)
- 8: (2, 8), (3, 8)
- 9: (0, 10), (9, 13), (1, 9), (9, 0)
- 10: (0, 10), (3, 10), (10, 9)
- 11: (4, 11), (11, 14), (7, 11), (13, 11)
- 12: (7, 12), (12, 13), (12, 6), (12, 1), (3, 12)
- 13: (12, 13), (5, 13), (9, 13), (13, 11)
- 14: (11, 14), (7, 14), (14, 5), (14, 6)

Next, let's sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:
Nodes: 0, 8, 5, 4, 10, 9, 3, 2, 14, 1, 13, 11, 12, 7, 6

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [22]

Unique triangles:
<1, 4, 11>
<1, 4, 3>
<1, 4, 12>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 6, 12>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 14>
<2, 6, 12>
<2, 6, 3>
<2, 6, 1>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 11>
<3, 4, 12>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 12, 7>
<4, 7, 11>
<6, 12, 7>
<6, 12, 13>
<7, 12, 13>
