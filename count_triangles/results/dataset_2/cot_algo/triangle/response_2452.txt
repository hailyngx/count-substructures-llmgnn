Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: 9, 7, 1, 8
- 1: 5, 9, 3, 2, 0
- 2: 5, 4, 1
- 3: 4, 7, 1, 6
- 4: 5, 7, 3, 6, 2
- 5: 9, 2, 1, 4, 7
- 6: 4, 3, 8
- 7: 5, 4, 0, 3
- 8: 9, 6, 0
- 9: 5, 8, 1, 0

Now, we can count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [<0, 1, 5>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 6>]

[Total number of triangles: 6]
