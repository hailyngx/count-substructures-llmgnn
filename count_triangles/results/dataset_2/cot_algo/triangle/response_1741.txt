Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 12) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 19) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 2) (18, 17) (4, 11) (17, 18) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 14) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 8) (7, 5) (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 6) (19, 1) (19, 2) (9, 15) (9, 17) (12, 15) (12, 13) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (14, 2) (14, 5) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 5) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(3, 1), (3, 16), (3, 6), (3, 18), 
(15, 10), (15, 9), (15, 18), (15, 12), 
(1, 3), (1, 10), (1, 19), 
(8, 2), (8, 10), (8, 0), 
(13, 5), (13, 12), (13, 11), 
(2, 8), (2, 18), (2, 19), (2, 6), (2, 14), 
(18, 3), (18, 15), (18, 2), (18, 17), 
(4, 11), 
(17, 18), (17, 16), (17, 0), (17, 9), 
(5, 13), (5, 0), (5, 16), (5, 7), (5, 14), 
(10, 15), (10, 1), (10, 8), 
(7, 5), 
(11, 13), (11, 4), 
(16, 3), (16, 17), (16, 5), (16, 6), 
(19, 1), (19, 2), 
(9, 15), (9, 17),

(6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 16), 
(14, 2), (14, 5), 
(0, 8), (0, 17), (0, 5)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

Node 4: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 1
Node 19: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 14: Degree 2
Node 12: Degree 2
Node 11: Degree 2
Node 18: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 4
Node 16: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 0: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 17: Degree 5
Node 5: Degree 6
Node 3: Degree 6
Node 15: Degree 6

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method:
