Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6)
