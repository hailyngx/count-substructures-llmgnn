Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 12) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 13) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 13) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) 

Response:
The nodes are as follows: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

After sorting the nodes based on the number of connections in ascending order, we get the new labels: 7, 5, 8, 1, 4, 6, 0, 9, 2, 3, 10, 11, 13, 12, 14.

The graph with the new labels is as follows:
(0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 12) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 13) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 12) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 9) (13, 2) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 13).

Now, let's count the triangles:
Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 12>, <0, 9, 12>, <1, 3, 14>, <2, 4, 12>, <2, 8, 9>, <4, 10, 14>.
