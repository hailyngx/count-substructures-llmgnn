Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) 

Response:
The given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 6), (7, 2), (7, 1), (1, 0), (3, 8), (8, 2), (6, 4), (0, 1)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

Nodes sorted by degree:
1. Node 8 - Degree 2
2. Node 6 - Degree 2
3. Node 0 - Degree 3
4. Node 1 - Degree 3
5. Node 3 - Degree 3
6. Node 7 - Degree 3
7. Node 2 - Degree 4
8. Node 4 - Degree 4
9. Node 9 - Degree 5
10. Node 5 - Degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Starting with the lower degree nodes with edges to higher degree nodes, we have:
  (8, 2), (6, 4), (0, 1)

Based on shared connections, the triangles formed are:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 8>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
