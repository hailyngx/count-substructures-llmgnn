Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (26, 23) (26, 3) (5, 6) (5, 29) (5, 11) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 28) (17, 21) (0, 27) (0, 22) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 1) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 29) (6, 13) (28, 17) (28, 6) (28, 16) (28, 24) (28, 2) (2, 28) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 21) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 21) (7, 2) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 4) (1, 17) (1, 27) (1, 20) (1, 22) (16, 28) (16, 8) (16, 3) (20, 1) (20, 19) (29, 5) (29, 14) (29, 6) (4, 12) (4, 10) (23, 26) (23, 0) (11, 5) (11, 25) (19, 20) (19, 25) (19, 10) (25, 11) (25, 19) (25, 21) (25, 18) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 21) (22, 0) (22, 1) (22, 3) (24, 28) (24, 13) (18, 14) (18, 25) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 3) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 18) (3, 26) (3, 16) (3, 22) (3, 18) (13, 6) (13, 24) (21, 17) (21, 2) (21, 8) (21, 25) (21, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then, we'll relabel the vertices accordingly.

Here is the sorted list of vertices with labels:
- Vertex 7: Degree 2
- Vertex 12: Degree 2
- Vertex 0: Degree 3
- Vertex 8: Degree 3
- Vertex 4: Degree 3
- Vertex 5: Degree 4
- Vertex 13: Degree 4
- Vertex 10: Degree 4
- Vertex 1: Degree 4
- Vertex 24: Degree 4
- Vertex 26: Degree 4
- Vertex 19: Degree 4
- Vertex 20: Degree 4
- Vertex 2: Degree 5
- Vertex 27: Degree 5
- Vertex 16: Degree 5
- Vertex 3: Degree 5
- Vertex 22: Degree 5
- Vertex 14: Degree 5
- Vertex 15: Degree 5
- Vertex 25: Degree 5
- Vertex 18: Degree 6
- Vertex 28: Degree 6
- Vertex 6: Degree 6
- Vertex 17: Degree 6
- Vertex 21: Degree 6
- Vertex 29: Degree 6
- Vertex 11: Degree 6
- Vertex 9: Degree 0

Now, we will count the number of triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

After counting, the total number of triangles is [14], and the unique triangles found are <0, 17, 22>, <1, 17, 27>, <2, 8, 16>, <2, 21, 28>, <2, 21, 25>, <3, 16, 28>, <4, 10, 18>, <4, 10, 19>, <5, 6, 29>, <5, 14, 29>, <5, 11, 25>, <13, 6, 24>, <14, 15, 21>, <17, 21, 25>.
