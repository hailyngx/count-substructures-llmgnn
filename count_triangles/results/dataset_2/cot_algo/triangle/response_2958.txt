Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

Vertex 5: 1 connection  
Vertex 9: 2 connections  
Vertex 2: 3 connections  
Vertex 6: 3 connections  
Vertex 5: 4 connections  
Vertex 1: 5 connections  
Vertex 8: 5 connections  
Vertex 0: 6 connections  
Vertex 4: 6 connections  
Vertex 3: 6 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine the edges based on the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections:

1. Edge (4, 7): Both vertices have 6 connections, so don't count a triangle.
2. Edge (4, 5): Vertex 5 has 1 connection, there is no triangle.
3. Edge (4, 6): Vertex 6 has 3 connections, there is no triangle.
4. Edge (4, 3): Vertex 3 has 6 connections, there is no triangle.
5. Edge (7, 4): Already counted in step 1.
6. Edge (7, 0): Vertex 7 has 5 connections, there is no triangle.
7. Edge (7, 3): Already counted in step 4.
8. Edge (7, 2): Vertex 2 has 3 connections, there is no triangle.
9. Edge (7, 1): Vertex 1 has 5 connections, there is no triangle.
10. Edge (6, 4): Already counted in step 3.
11. Edge (6, 1): Already counted in step 9.
12. Edge (6, 8): Vertex 6 has 3 connections, there is no triangle.
13. Edge (9, 8): Vertex 9 has 2 connections, there is no triangle.
14. Edge (9, 2): Already counted in step 8.
15. Edge (9, 0): Vertex 0 has 6 connections, there is no triangle.
16. Edge (1, 7): Already counted in step 1.
17. Edge (1, 6): Already counted in step 3.
18. Edge (1, 3): Already counted in step 4.
19. Edge (1, 5): Already counted in step 2.
20. Edge (1, 0): Already counted in step 6.
21. Edge (3, 4): Already counted in step 4.
22. Edge (3, 7): Already counted in step 4.
23. Edge (3, 1): Already counted in step 4.
24. Edge (3, 5): Already counted in step 2.
25. Edge (3, 8): Already counted in step 4.
26. Edge (8, 6): Already counted in step 3.
27. Edge (8, 9): Already counted in step 13.
28. Edge (8, 3): Already counted in step 4.
29. Edge (8, 0): Already counted in step 6.
30. Edge (5, 4): Already counted in step 2.
31. Edge (5, 1): Already counted in step 2.
32. Edge (5, 3): Already counted in step 2.
33. Edge (2, 7): Already counted in step 1.
34. Edge (2, 9): Already counted in step 13.
35. Edge (2, 0): Already counted in step 6.
36. Edge (0, 7): Already counted in step 1.
37. Edge (0, 9): Already counted in step 13.
38. Edge (0, 1): Already counted in step 6.
39. Edge (0, 8): Already counted in step 6.
40. Edge (0, 2): Already counted in step 6.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are:  
<1, 4, 7>  
<0, 7, 9>  
<0, 2, 7>
