Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 1) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 7) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 12) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are:  

Vertex 0: degree 2  
Vertex 7: degree 3  
Vertex 5: degree 3  
Vertex 12: degree 3  
Vertex 2: degree 3  
Vertex 3: degree 4  
Vertex 11: degree 4  
Vertex 4: degree 5  
Vertex 14: degree 5  
Vertex 10: degree 5  
Vertex 6: degree 6  
Vertex 9: degree 6  
Vertex 8: degree 6  
Vertex 1: degree 7  
Vertex 13: degree 7  

Now, we will count the triangles:  

Only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.  

Triangles:  
<1, 6, 9>  
<1, 6, 13>  
<6, 9, 4>  
<6, 9, 10>  
<6, 9, 13>  
<6, 10, 0>  
<6, 10, 13>  
<9, 4, 3>  
<9, 4, 11>  
<9, 10, 13>  
<9, 13, 1>  
<2, 14, 8>  
<2, 14, 11>  
<2, 8, 1>  
<2, 8, 14>  
<3, 4, 5>  
<4, 5, 12>  
<4, 11, 7>  
<5, 7, 12>  
<5, 12, 2>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [19].
