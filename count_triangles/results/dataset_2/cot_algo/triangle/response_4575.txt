Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
Following the given graph and list of edges, the nodes can be represented as follows:

Nodes:
0 - degree 5
1 - degree 3
2 - degree 5
3 - degree 4
4 - degree 5
5 - degree 5
6 - degree 4
7 - degree 4
8 - degree 5
9 - degree 5

Now, we sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes in Degree-Based Ordering:
1 - degree 3
3 - degree 4
6 - degree 4
7 - degree 4
0 - degree 5
2 - degree 5
4 - degree 5
5 - degree 5
8 - degree 5
9 - degree 5

Next, we go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed:

Triangles:
[21]

Triangles found:
<3, 0, 5>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 2>
<3, 4, 5>
<6, 9, 7>
<6, 0, 9>
<6, 0, 5>
<7, 9, 2>
<1, 8, 4>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 9, 5>
<9, 2, 4>
<9, 2, 7>
<4, 8, 5>
<4, 2, 8>
<4, 2, 7>
<5, 8, 4>
