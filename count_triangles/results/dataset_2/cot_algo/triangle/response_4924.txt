Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 24) (26, 21) (5, 13) (5, 19) (3, 27) (3, 2) (15, 20) (15, 23) (15, 0) (15, 13) (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 10) (22, 20) (22, 7) (22, 21) (23, 15) (23, 8) (23, 13) (23, 19) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 7) (20, 15) (20, 22) (20, 2) (20, 28) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 7) (6, 10) (28, 20) (28, 6) (28, 12) (21, 26) (21, 22) (21, 18) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 23) (13, 12) (1, 11) (1, 29) (17, 0) (17, 27) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 23) (19, 4) (7, 22) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 25) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 24) (27, 3) (27, 17) (27, 25) (27, 2) (4, 16) (4, 19) (12, 28) (12, 13) (24, 9) (24, 6) (24, 25) (24, 14) (24, 29) (10, 16) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 2) (18, 9) (18, 21) (29, 1) (29, 24) (0, 15) (0, 17) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 20) (2, 27) (2, 10) (14, 24) 

Response:
Let's start by constructing the graph with 30 nodes and the given 90 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(9, 18), (9, 24), (26, 21), (5, 13), (5, 19), (3, 27), (3, 2), (15, 20), (15, 23), (15, 0), (15, 13), (11, 16), (11, 1), (11, 2), (16, 11), (16, 4), (16, 19), (16, 10), (22, 20), (22, 7), (22, 21), (23, 15), (23, 8), (23, 13), (23, 19), (8, 23), (8, 10), (8, 7), (20, 15), (20, 22), (20, 2), (20, 28), (6, 28), (6, 24), (6, 7), (6, 10), (28, 20), (28, 6), (28, 12), (21, 26), (21, 22), (21, 18), (13, 5), (13, 15), (13, 23), (13, 12), (1, 11), (1, 29), (17, 0), (17, 27), (19, 5), (19, 16), (19, 23), (19, 4), (7, 22), (7, 8), (7, 6), (7, 25), (25, 7), (25, 27), (25, 24), (27, 3), (27, 17), (27, 25), (27, 2), (4, 16), (4, 19), (12, 28), (12, 13), (24, 9), (24, 6), (24, 25), (24, 14), (24, 29), (10, 16), (10, 8), (10, 6), (10, 2), (18, 9), (18, 21), (29, 1), (29, 24), (0, 15), (0, 17), (2, 3), (2, 11), (2, 20), (2, 27), (2, 10), (14, 24)

Next, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
The degree of each node (in parentheses) is as follows:
0(4), 1(2), 2(6), 3(2), 4(2), 5(2), 6(4), 7(4), 8(3), 9(2), 10(4), 11(3), 12(2), 13(4), 14(1), 15(4), 16(4), 17(2), 18(2), 19(5), 20(4), 21(3), 22(3), 23(4), 24(6), 25(3), 26(1), 27(4), 28(3), 29(2)

Now, let's count the number of triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total Number of Triangles: 32]
<0, 2, 15>, <0, 2, 20>, <0, 15, 23>, <0, 15, 28>, <1, 11, 16>, <2, 20, 28>, <2, 3, 27>, <2, 10, 16>, <2, 10, 20>, <2, 10, 27>, <2, 11, 16>, <2, 11, 27>, <2, 16, 19>, <2, 20, 28>, <2, 27, 25>, <3, 13, 23>, <4, 13, 19>, <4, 16, 19>, <6, 7, 22>, <6, 10, 16>, <6, 10, 24>, <6, 12, 13>, <6, 12, 28>, <6, 24, 29>, <7, 8, 10>, <7, 8, 23>, <7, 22, 21>, <7, 25, 27>, <8, 10, 16>, <10, 16, 19>, <16, 19, 23>, <24, 25, 29>
