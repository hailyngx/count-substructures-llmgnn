Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 7), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 0), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 3), (7, 8), (1, 3), (1, 2), (3, 2), (6, 8)

Now, we need to count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method. Let's label the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes in decreasing order of degree:
Node 5 (Degree 5)
Node 4 (Degree 4)
Node 0 (Degree 4)
Node 8 (Degree 4)
Node 3 (Degree 3)
Node 1 (Degree 2)
Node 7 (Degree 2)
Node 9 (Degree 2)
Node 2 (Degree 2)
Node 6 (Degree 1)

Now, let's count the triangles based on the unique triangles formed:
[Number of triangles: 3]
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 4, 8>
<2, 1, 3>
