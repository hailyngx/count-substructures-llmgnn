Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 12) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (11, 9) (11, 5) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 10) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph can be represented with their degrees as:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the nodes can be relabeled accordingly:
- Node 11 (degree 2) becomes Node 0
- Node 5 (degree 3) becomes Node 1
- Node 6 (degree 3) becomes Node 2
- Node 7 (degree 3) becomes Node 3
- Node 13 (degree 3) becomes Node 4
- Node 0 (degree 4) becomes Node 5
- Node 2 (degree 4) becomes Node 6
- Node 3 (degree 4) becomes Node 7
- Node 4 (degree 4) becomes Node 8
- Node 10 (degree 4) becomes Node 9
- Node 12 (degree 4) becomes Node 10
- Node 14 (degree 4) becomes Node 11
- Node 9 (degree 5) becomes Node 12
- Node 1 (degree 6) becomes Node 13
- Node 8 (degree 6) becomes Node 14

Now, let's count the triangles based on the sorted order of vertices:
1. (0, 2) have a common neighbor 6 forming triangle <0, 2, 6>.
2. (0, 6) have a common neighbor 4 forming triangle <0, 4, 6>.
3. (0, 10) have a common neighbor 1 forming triangle <0, 1, 10>.
4. (1, 2) have a common neighbor 6 forming triangle <1, 2, 6>.
5. (1, 5) have a common neighbor 4 forming triangle <1, 4, 5>.
6. (1, 10) have a common neighbor 0 forming triangle <1, 0, 10>.
7. (1, 12) have a common neighbor 7 forming triangle <1, 7, 12>.
8. (2, 6) have a common neighbor 4 forming triangle <2, 4, 6>.
9. (2, 8) have a common neighbor 14 forming triangle <2, 8, 14>.
10. (2, 9) have a common neighbor 4 forming triangle <2, 4, 9>.
11. (3, 7) have a common neighbor 12 forming triangle <3, 7, 12>.
12. (3, 12) have a common neighbor 1 forming triangle <3, 1, 12>.
13. (4, 5) have a common neighbor 1 forming triangle <4, 1, 5>.
14. (4, 6) have a common neighbor 0 forming triangle <4, 0, 6>.
15. (4, 9) have a common neighbor 2 forming triangle <4, 2, 9>.
16. (4, 9) have a common neighbor 8 forming triangle <4, 8, 9>.
17. (6, 10) have a common neighbor 0 forming triangle <6, 0, 10>.
18. (8, 9) have a common neighbor 4 forming triangle <8, 4, 9>.
19. (8, 14) have a common neighbor 2 forming triangle <8, 2, 14>.
20. (10, 13) have a common neighbor 1 forming triangle <10, 1, 13>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
