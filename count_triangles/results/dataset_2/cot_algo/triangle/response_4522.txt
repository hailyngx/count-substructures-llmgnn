Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 6
Node 9: Degree 6

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will count the number of triangles in the graph.

[The total number of triangles is 13]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 4>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 0>
<3, 1, 4>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 4>
