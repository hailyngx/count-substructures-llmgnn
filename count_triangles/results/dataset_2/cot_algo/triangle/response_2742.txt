Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5)
(1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8)
(2, 8) (2, 3)
(3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2)
(4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3)
(5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3)
(6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4)
(7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1)
(8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1)
(9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0)

After sorting by the degree-based ordering, the nodes are relabeled as follows:
{1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 5, 9}

Now, let's count the triangles:

Triangles: 6 in total
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 9>
