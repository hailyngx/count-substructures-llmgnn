Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 20) (9, 3) (9, 16) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 8) (26, 7) (3, 9) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 17) (3, 20) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 16) (25, 4) (22, 9) (22, 23) (22, 29) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 27) (0, 20) (0, 21) (0, 1) (20, 9) (20, 3) (20, 0) (20, 5) (1, 26) (1, 0) (1, 14) (7, 26) (7, 12) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 10) (8, 26) (8, 2) (8, 15) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 18) (5, 20) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 17) (27, 25) (27, 23) (27, 29) (27, 10) (18, 7) (18, 28) (18, 19) (18, 11) (11, 18) (11, 4) (11, 21) (17, 3) (17, 23) (17, 19) (29, 22) (29, 27) (29, 15) (21, 22) (21, 0) (21, 11) (15, 8) (15, 29) (13, 12) (13, 16) (14, 1) (14, 28) (16, 9) (16, 25) (16, 13) (10, 2) (10, 27) (4, 25) (4, 11) (6, 12) (6, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the graph. 

The sorted list of vertices based on the number of connections is as follows:
Vertices: 26, 1, 8, 18, 28, 15, 10, 5, 29, 6, 7, 19, 27, 16, 13, 4, 11, 2, 17, 23, 12, 0, 3, 25, 21, 14, 9, 22

By following the method, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph:

Number of triangles: [32]

Unique triangles found:
