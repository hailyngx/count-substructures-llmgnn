Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 6) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 7) (10, 7) (10, 4) (17, 6) (17, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 17) (6, 5) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 18) (12, 0) (9, 18) (9, 14) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (4, 15) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (13, 15) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be visually represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 6) 
(16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 6) 
(3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 18) 
(15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 4) 
(1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 7) 
(10, 7) (10, 4) 
(17, 6) (17, 8) 
(5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) 
(6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 17) (6, 5) 
(0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 8) 
(2, 0) (2, 4) 
(8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) 
(18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 9) 
(19, 18) 
(12, 0) 
(9, 18) (9, 14) 
(7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) 
(4, 15) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
(14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) 
(13, 15)

Next, let's sort the nodes by their number of connections:

Nodes by degree: 
12: 1 
13: 1 
10: 2 
2: 2 
18: 3 
9: 3 
17: 2 
19: 1 
16: 3 
15: 3 
14: 3 
11: 3 
7: 4 
0: 5 
6: 4 
8: 4 
5: 5 
3: 4 
1: 4 
4: 4

Based on the sorted node list, we will count the triangles. 

Triangles found: 
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 4, 15>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 8, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 14>
<3, 1, 5>
<3, 1, 7>
<3, 1, 14>
<4, 0, 5>
<4, 0, 2>
<7, 1, 5>
<7, 1, 14>
<8, 0, 5>
<8, 0, 7>
<14, 1, 5>
<14, 1, 9>
Total number of triangles: [20]
