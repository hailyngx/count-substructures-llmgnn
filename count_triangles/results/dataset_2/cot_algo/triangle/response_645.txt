Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 15) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 18) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 10) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 17) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 4) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 4) (15, 12) (15, 17) (19, 2) (19, 10) (4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 16) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 18) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 19) (1, 18) (14, 5) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 18) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 16) (16, 4) (16, 18) 

Response:
The graph based on the given information is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) 
(7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 15) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 18) 
(2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 10) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 17) (6, 17) (6, 10) 
(6, 4) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 4) (15, 12) (15, 17) (19, 2) (19, 10) 
(4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 16) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 18) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 19) 
(1, 18) (14, 5) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 18) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 1) 
(18, 11) (18, 16) (16, 4) (16, 18)

Now, let's calculate the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted by their number of connections (degree):
1: 1 connection
15: 2 connections
14: 2 connections
1: 2 connections
19: 2 connections
9: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
13: 4 connections
12: 5 connections
2: 5 connections
10: 5 connections
17: 5 connections
4: 6 connections
6: 6 connections
16: 6 connections
5: 6 connections
0: 6 connections
3: 6 connections
18: 7 connections
7: 7 connections
11: 7 connections

Triangles: [<0, 5, 14>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 2, 11>, <0, 2, 19>, <2, 11, 18>, <2, 19, 10>, <3, 0, 17>, <3, 7, 13>, <4, 6, 17>, <4, 16, 18>, <6, 10, 19>, <7, 9, 12>, <12, 13, 18>]

Total number of triangles: [13]
