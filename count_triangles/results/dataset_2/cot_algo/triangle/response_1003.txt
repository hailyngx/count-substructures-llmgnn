Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 6) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 3) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 1) (10, 0) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (1, 8) (1, 12) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 10) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 12), (4, 13), (4, 14), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 13), (7, 5), (8, 4), (8, 14), (8, 11), (8, 6), (8, 1), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 9), (0, 2), (14, 4), (14, 8), (14, 12), (5, 7), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 10), (13, 4), (13, 7), (13, 9), (13, 6), (3, 5), (3, 11), (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 2), (11, 8), (11, 0), (11, 3), (12, 4), (12, 14), (12, 10), (12, 1), (10, 0), (10, 5), (10, 12), (10, 6), (2, 7), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 3), (1, 8), (1, 12), (9, 0), (9, 13), (9, 3), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 13), (6, 3), (6, 10)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by their number of connections:
1. Node 1: degree 2
2. Node 9: degree 2
3. Node 10: degree 3
4. Node 11: degree 3
5. Node 5: degree 4
6. Node 12: degree 4
7. Node 13: degree 4
8. Node 0: degree 4
9. Node 6: degree 5
10. Node 8: degree 5
11. Node 3: degree 5
12. Node 7: degree 5
13. Node 4: degree 5
14. Node 2: degree 5
15. Node 14: degree 5

Let's calculate the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found:

[Total number of triangles: 10]
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 10>
<0, 5, 10>
<0, 2, 3>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 10>
<2, 5, 10>
<3, 5, 10>
<4, 7, 13>
<4, 7, 14>
