Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 8) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 10) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 11) (12, 1) (16, 12) (16, 9) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 13) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 1) (19, 17) (19, 6) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 2) (1, 12) (1, 18) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 1) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 9) (13, 1) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 12) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: 5, 9, 2
- 1: 12, 18, 2, 13
- 2: 0, 7, 1, 14
- 3: 15
- 4: 10, 8
- 5: 0, 10, 11, 18
- 6: 12, 19
- 7: 17, 14, 18, 2
- 8: 4, 11, 17
- 9: 0, 16, 13
- 10: 4, 5
- 11: 8, 5, 12
- 12: 6, 1, 11, 16
- 13: 15, 14, 9, 1
- 14: 15, 7, 2, 13
- 15: 3, 13, 14
- 16: 12, 9
- 17: 19, 8, 7
- 18: 5, 7, 1
- 19: 17, 6

Next, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the given graph. 

Vertices sorted by degree (from least to most):
0, 3, 6, 16, 19, 4, 10, 8, 5, 17, 7, 18, 1, 12, 9, 13, 14, 2, 11, 15

Triangles found:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 1, 2>
<3, 13, 15>
<4, 8, 11>
<5, 10, 11>
<6, 12, 19>
<7, 14, 18>
<13, 1, 15>

Total number of triangles: [8]
