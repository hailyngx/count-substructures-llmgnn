Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 29) (26, 16) (26, 3) (1, 15) (1, 4) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 15) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 16) (8, 18) (8, 10) (8, 11) (2, 18) (2, 23) (28, 14) (28, 24) (17, 29) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 12) (29, 26) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 25) (3, 26) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 27) (11, 8) (11, 3) (15, 1) (15, 21) (15, 19) (20, 7) (20, 14) (7, 20) (7, 19) (25, 29) (25, 5) (16, 26) (16, 4) (16, 24) (0, 22) (0, 17) (10, 22) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 5) (6, 24) (6, 23) (6, 12) (24, 9) (24, 28) (24, 16) (24, 6) (24, 27) (19, 15) (19, 7) (13, 21) (13, 14) (5, 22) (5, 25) (5, 10) (5, 23) (23, 21) (23, 2) (23, 6) (23, 5) (27, 22) (27, 29) (27, 3) (27, 24) (14, 28) (14, 20) (14, 13) (12, 17) (12, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to efficiently count the number of triangles in the graph. 

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
- Node 26 has 4 connections.
- Node 1 has 2 connections.
- Nodes 18 and 22 have 5 connections each.
- Nodes 4, 8, and 21 have 3 connections each.
- Nodes 17, 29, and 3 have 4 connections each.
- Nodes 11, 15, and 0 have 3 connections each.
- Nodes 20, 7, 25, 16, 13, and 5 have 2 connections each.
- Node 6 has 3 connections.
- Nodes 19 and 12 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 24 and 14 have 4 connections each.
- Nodes 2 and 10 have 4 connections each.
- Node 23 has 4 connections.
- Nodes 27 and 9 have 3 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method for the edges, we can count the number of triangles formed:
- Triangles:
