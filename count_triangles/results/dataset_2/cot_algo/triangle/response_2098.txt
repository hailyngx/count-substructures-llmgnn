Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The list of vertices with their connections is as follows:

Node 0: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 6
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This helps avoid double counting of triangles. Analyzing the provided edges accordingly, we can find the triangles and count them.

After analyzing the edges, we find that there are a total of 7 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles found are:

<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
