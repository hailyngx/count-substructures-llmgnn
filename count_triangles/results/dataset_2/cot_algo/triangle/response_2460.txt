Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (12, 6) (12, 14) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 8), (0, 14), 
(1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 9), (1, 11), 
(2, 8), (2, 10), (2, 11), (2, 14), 
(3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 13), 
(4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 11), 
(5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 14), 
(6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 12), 
(7, 1), (7, 6), (7, 9), (7, 14), 
(8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 14), 
(9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 7), 
(10, 2), 
(11, 1), (11, 2), (11, 4), (11, 13), 
(12, 6), (12, 14), 
(13, 3), (13, 5), (13, 8), (13, 11), 
(14, 0), (14, 2), (14, 5), (14, 7), (14, 8), (14, 12)

Now, we will calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by degree:
10, 7, 12, 0, 4, 2, 11, 13, 5, 3, 14, 1, 9, 6, 8

Triangles: [31]
Unique triangles:
<4, 8, 14>
<1, 7, 14>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 14>
<1, 5, 13>
<1, 5, 11>
<1, 9, 11>
<0, 1, 14>
<0, 8, 14>
<2, 8, 14>
<3, 5, 13>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 8, 9>
<4, 8, 11>
<5, 6, 13>
<6, 7, 9>
