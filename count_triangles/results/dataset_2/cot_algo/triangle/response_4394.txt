Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 14) (11, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 15) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 13) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 6) (8, 10) (8, 6) (16, 19) (16, 1) (16, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 13) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 8) (6, 16) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 17) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 1) (15, 12) (15, 9) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 16) (1, 9) (18, 11) (18, 12) (18, 5) (18, 17) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (17, 4) (17, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their degree, relabeling them accordingly, and then checking for triangles based on the vertices' connections. Let's follow this method to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

Sorting the vertices by degree:
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 11 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 19 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 16 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 4
- Node 15 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 5
- Node 12 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 17 has degree 2
- Node 13 has degree 3
- Node 18 has degree 4
- Node 10 has degree 2
- Node 14 has degree 4

Relabeling the nodes based on their degree:
- Nodes 11, 8, 16, 15, 10 have label 1
- Nodes 17, 3 have label 2
- Nodes 12, 0, 19 have label 3
- Nodes 13, 7, 2 have label 4
- Nodes 18, 5, 9 have label 5
- Nodes 1, 4, 6, 14 have label 6

Checking for triangles using the given edges, where the lower label vertex connects fewer times:
- <0, 7, 12>
- <0, 7, 14>
- <0, 14, 1>
- <0, 14, 13>
- <1, 9, 2>
- <1, 9, 4>
- <1, 9, 14>
- <1, 14, 13>
- <2, 9, 4>
- <5, 18, 16>
- <5, 18, 6>
- <5, 18, 12>
- <5, 18, 17>
- <5, 18, 13>
- <5, 18, 9>
- <5, 19, 6>
- <5, 19, 16>
- <6, 7, 12>
- <6, 7, 14>
- <6, 7, 0>
- <6, 7, 15>
- <6, 7, 9>
- <6, 13, 2>
- <6, 13, 4>
- <6, 13, 9>
- <6, 16, 1>
- <6, 16, 9>
- <9, 15, 12>
- <9, 15, 13>
- <12, 15, 9>
- <13, 14, 1>
- <13, 14, 4>
- <17, 18, 5> 

Calculation:
- Total triangles = 36

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [36].
