Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 7) (9, 0) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 7) (18, 15) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 16) (14, 11) (14, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 19) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 11) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 18) (15, 10) (15, 4) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (8, 19) (8, 6) (8, 7) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 6) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 4) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 11) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 6) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 12) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 3) (12, 13) (12, 3) 

Response:
The nodes and their connections based on the given edges:
- Node 0 -> [5, 9, 16]
- Node 1 -> [2, 10, 19]
- Node 2 -> [1, 7, 16, 17]
- Node 3 -> [4, 7, 12, 13, 14]
- Node 4 -> [3, 13, 15, 16]
- Node 5 -> [0]
- Node 6 -> [8, 11, 19]
- Node 7 -> [2, 3, 8, 9]
- Node 8 -> [6, 7, 19]
- Node 9 -> [0, 7]
- Node 10 -> [1, 15, 19]
- Node 11 -> [6, 14, 17]
- Node 12 -> [3, 13]
- Node 13 -> [3, 4, 12, 17]
- Node 14 -> [3, 11]
- Node 15 -> [4, 10, 18]
- Node 16 -> [0, 2, 4]
- Node 17 -> [2, 11, 13]
- Node 18 -> [15]
- Node 19 -> [1, 6, 8, 10]

Now, by considering the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted nodes based on their number of connections:
Nodes -> [Sorted List of Nodes by Number of Connections]
Node 5 -> [0]
Node 18 -> [15]
Node 14 -> [3, 11]
Node 12 -> [13]
Node 15 -> [4, 10, 16]
Node 6 -> [8, 11, 19]
Node 9 -> [7]
Node 1 -> [2, 9, 10]
Node 17 -> [11, 13, 2]
Node 8 -> [6, 7, 19]
Node 10 -> [1, 15, 19]
Node 16 -> [0, 2, 4]
Node 0 -> [5, 9, 16]
Node 7 -> [2, 3, 8, 9]
Node 13 -> [3, 4, 12, 17]
Node 11 -> [6, 14, 17]
Node 3 -> [4, 7, 12, 13, 14]
Node 4 -> [3, 13, 15, 16]
Node 2 -> [1, 7, 16, 17]

Now, calculating the number of triangles:
Triangles = 9

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [9].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 16>, <3, 4, 13>, <3, 7, 13>, <3, 11, 17>, <4, 13, 15>, <6, 8, 19>, <7, 8, 9>, <10, 15, 19>, <11, 13, 17>.
