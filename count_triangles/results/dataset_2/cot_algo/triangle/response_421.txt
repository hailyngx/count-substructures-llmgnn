Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 24) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 23) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 29) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 24) (27, 20) (14, 4) (17, 1) (17, 11) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 15) (6, 23) (8, 9) (23, 9) (23, 6) (23, 29) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 13) (12, 5) (12, 7) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 24) (1, 19) (1, 18) (3, 7) (3, 2) (11, 17) (11, 2) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 4) (25, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 25) (22, 27) (22, 28) (22, 10) (16, 5) (16, 21) (16, 13) (16, 18) (21, 16) (21, 19) (21, 18) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 22) (24, 5) (24, 27) (24, 6) (24, 7) (24, 1) (4, 14) (4, 25) (15, 6) (26, 25) (26, 29) (20, 27) (29, 0) (29, 23) (29, 26) (13, 7) (13, 16) (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 21) (28, 22) (28, 19) (19, 1) (19, 21) (19, 28) 

Response:
Based on the given list of edges, let's construct the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges:

     Graph:
       0 --- 9 --- 8 --- 6 --- 23 --- 29
       |     |     |     |         |
       27 --- 5 --- 2 --- 3 --- 7   26
        |         |         |     |    |
       10 --- 22  16--18--21   25 -- 4
        |    |    |     |    |  
       20  24-12-19-1--17--11
            | |  |    |
            14  13    25
                       |
                       6
       

Let's sort the nodes by the degree-based ordering method:

    Nodes (sorted by degree):
    8 --- 25
    20 --- 28
    14 --- 26
    4 --- 18 --- 21 --- 13
    10 --- 27
    11 --- 1
    3
    7
    6
    12 --- 19
    5 --- 29
    9 --- 0
    16 --- 22 --- 24
    2

Counting the triangles:

- (5, 9) (5, 2) form triangle <5, 9, 2>
- (5, 9) (5, 12) form triangle <5, 9, 12>
- (5, 9) (5, 24) form triangle <5, 9, 24>
- (5, 9) (5, 16) - No triangles
- (9, 6) (9, 8) - No triangles
- (9, 6) (9, 23) - No triangles
- (9, 0) (0, 27) form triangle <9, 0, 27>
- (27, 22) (27, 24) - No triangles
- (14, 4) - No triangles
- (17, 1) (17, 11) - No triangles
- (6, 9) (6, 23) - No triangles
- (7, 12) (7, 24) - No triangles
- (1, 17) (1, 19) - No triangles
- (3, 7) (3, 2) - No triangles
- (11, 17) (11, 2) - No triangles
- (26, 25) (26, 29) - No triangles
- (20, 27) - No triangles
- (13, 7) (13, 16) - No triangles
- (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 21) form triangle <18, 1, 16>
- (28, 19) - No triangles

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles found: <5, 9, 2>, <5, 9, 12>, <5, 9, 24>
