Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method allows us to efficiently count the number of triangles in the given graph. 
Here is the sorted list of vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: {1, 7}, {5, 2}, {7, 4}, {0, 8}, {9, 3}, {6}

Now, let's count the number of triangles:
1. For edge (6, 9):
   Both 6 and 9 have more connections, so do not proceed.

2. For edge (6, 3):
   Both 6 and 3 have more connections, so do not proceed.

3. For edge (6, 2):
   Vertex 2 has fewer connections, so we check shared connections between 6 and 2:
   Shared connections: 9
   Triangle found: <6, 2, 9>

4. For edge (6, 4):
   Vertex 4 has fewer connections, so we check shared connections between 6 and 4:
   Shared connections: 9
   Triangle found: <6, 4, 9>

5. For edge (6, 8):
   Vertex 8 has fewer connections, so we check shared connections between 6 and 8:
   Shared connections: 9
   Triangle found: <6, 8, 9>

6. For edge (6, 0):
   Vertex 0 has fewer connections, so we check shared connections between 6 and 0:
   Shared connections: 9
   Triangle found: <6, 0, 9>

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <6, 2, 9>, <6, 4, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 0, 9>
