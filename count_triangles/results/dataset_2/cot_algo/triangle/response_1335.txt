Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (9, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
The graph vertices in the Degree-Based Ordering are as follows:
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 5: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 0: 6 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we start counting triangles by considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles found:
<4, 0, 5>
<4, 0, 1>
<4, 0, 6>
