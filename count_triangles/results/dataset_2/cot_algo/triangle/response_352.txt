Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (9), (4), (2), (3)
- 1: (9), (4), (6), (7)
- 2: (5), (4), (8), (0)
- 3: (5), (9), (0), (7)
- 4: (9), (8), (0), (1), (6), (2)
- 5: (9), (2), (8), (3)
- 6: (4), (8), (1)
- 7: (3), (1)
- 8: (5), (4), (2), (6)
- 9: (5), (4), (3), (1), (0)

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes by degrees in ascending order: 7, 6, 1, 3, 0, 8, 2, 5, 4, 9

Triangles:
[24]
<0, 4, 9>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 0, 9>, <4, 0, 2>, <4, 1, 9>, <4, 1, 6>, <5, 9, 3>, <5, 9, 2>, <5, 2, 8>, <8, 6, 4>, <8, 2, 0>, <9, 3, 7>, <9, 3, 5>, <9, 4, 1>, <9, 4, 0>, <9, 5, 2>
