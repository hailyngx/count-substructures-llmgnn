Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3), 
(9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 0), 
(4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 2), 
(7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 1), 
(1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 0), 
(3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 8), 
(2, 4), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 0), 
(8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 6), 
(0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 1), (0, 2), 
(6, 7), (6, 8)

Next, let's sort the nodes by their degree:

Nodes sorted by degree:
0 (degree 4)
2 (degree 4)
6 (degree 2)
4 (degree 3)
3 (degree 4)
7 (degree 4)
1 (degree 5)
8 (degree 5)
5 (degree 5)
9 (degree 5)

Now, we go through each edge and count the triangles:

Triangles:

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 3>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 0>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 0>
<1, 7, 4>
