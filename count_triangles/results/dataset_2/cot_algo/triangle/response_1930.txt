Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 24) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 25) (9, 15) (9, 10) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 29) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 15) (3, 25) (3, 24) (25, 9) (25, 14) (25, 3) (25, 22) (8, 23) (8, 20) (23, 8) (23, 29) (21, 28) (21, 18) (28, 21) (28, 26) (28, 20) (22, 25) (22, 4) (22, 16) (26, 28) (11, 13) (11, 29) (11, 15) (20, 17) (20, 8) (20, 28) (10, 9) (10, 19) (4, 22) (4, 6) (12, 16) (12, 1) (16, 17) (16, 22) (16, 12) (16, 19) (2, 5) (2, 24) (24, 5) (24, 3) (24, 2) (24, 1) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 15) (7, 27) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 6) (18, 21) (18, 27) (18, 29) (18, 13) (27, 7) (27, 18) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 15) (1, 12) (1, 24) (1, 0) (1, 13) (19, 14) (19, 10) (19, 16) (29, 14) (29, 23) (29, 11) (29, 18) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with 30 nodes and 90 edges based on the provided information. 

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

First, we'll sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Vertices with their respective degrees:
(7, 2) (17, 2) (21, 2) (26, 2) (27, 2) (28, 3) (3, 4) (8, 4) (11, 4) (12, 4) (13, 4) (18, 4) (22, 4) (6, 5) (10, 5) (20, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (4, 6) (14, 6) (19, 6) (5, 8) (9, 8) (15, 8) (23, 8) (25, 8) (24, 8) (29, 8)

Now, we'll find the triangles in the graph by checking shared connections between the vertices of each edge. 

After counting the triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<14, 17, 20>
<1, 13, 24>
<9, 15, 17>
<9, 10, 19>
<9, 14, 25>
<6, 15, 27>
<6, 1, 13>
<6, 4, 22>
<6, 0, 1>
<25, 14, 29>
<25, 11, 29>
<22, 16, 12>
<20, 17, 16>
<20, 8, 23>
<20, 8, 28>
