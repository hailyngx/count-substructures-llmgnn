Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 3) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 13) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 7) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

- Nodes sorted by degree: 
   - Node 4, degree 2
   - Node 9, degree 2
   - Node 12, degree 2
   - Node 0, degree 3
   - Node 2, degree 3
   - Node 7, degree 3
   - Node 1, degree 3
   - Node 6, degree 4
   - Node 10, degree 4
   - Node 8, degree 5
   - Node 11, degree 5
   - Node 13, degree 5
   - Node 3, degree 6
   - Node 5, degree 7
   - Node 14, degree 7

Triangles formed by the connections are: 
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 1, 12>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <3, 5, 8>
- <3, 5, 11>
- <3, 10, 13>
- <5, 7, 11>
- <6, 8, 14>
- <6, 13, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
