Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 8, 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, 7.

Let's relabel the nodes based on their degree:
- Node 3 has 2 connections, so it is relabeled as 0.
- Node 0 has 4 connections, so it is relabeled as 1.
- Node 7 has 3 connections, so it is relabeled as 2.
- Node 6 has 3 connections, so it is relabeled as 3.
- Node 8 has 4 connections, so it is relabeled as 4.
- Node 4 has 5 connections, so it is relabeled as 5.
- Node 1 has 4 connections, so it is relabeled as 6.
- Node 5 has 5 connections, so it is relabeled as 7.
- Node 2 has 5 connections, so it is relabeled as 8.
- Node 9 has 5 connections, so it is relabeled as 9.

Now, we will count the triangles by checking the shared connections between the lower labeled node in each edge pair:
- Triangles: <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 7, 5>, <1, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 1>, <5, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 5> 

The total number of triangles in the graph is: [10].
