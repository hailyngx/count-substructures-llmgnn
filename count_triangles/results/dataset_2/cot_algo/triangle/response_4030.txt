Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 12) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of vertices is as follows:
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 11: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 10: 5 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 14: 6 connections

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

By following this method, we find a total of 42 triangles in the graph, which are as follows:

[<1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 14>, <1, 8, 13>, <1, 8, 9>, <1, 9, 10>, <1, 9, 14>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 14>, <2, 6, 12>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 7, 12>, <2, 7, 14>, <2, 12, 14>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 13>, <3, 8, 9>, <3, 8, 13>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 14>, <4, 7, 12>, <4, 7, 14>, <5, 9, 1>, <5, 9, 3>, <5, 1, 8>, <5, 1, 0>, <5, 3, 8>, <5, 3, 0>, <6, 9, 1>, <6, 9, 3>, <6, 9, 14>, <7, 12, 0>, <7, 12, 14>, <7, 14, 11>, <7, 14, 12>, <8, 9, 1>, <8, 9, 3>, <9, 10, 8>, <12, 14, 7>, <12, 14, 0>]

The total number of triangles is [42].
