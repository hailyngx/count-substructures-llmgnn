Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (15, 3) (15, 23) (15, 14) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 22) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 22) (1, 3) (1, 25) (1, 28) (22, 14) (22, 17) (22, 4) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 28) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 21) (27, 11) (27, 26) (27, 19) (8, 9) (20, 0) (20, 11) (20, 10) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 25) (18, 2) (18, 19) (6, 28) (6, 4) (28, 1) (28, 23) (28, 6) (28, 26) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 29) (11, 14) (11, 27) (11, 20) (11, 29) (5, 13) (5, 25) (5, 4) (5, 16) (13, 5) (26, 27) (26, 28) (26, 25) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 16) (4, 22) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (19, 27) (19, 18) (19, 7) (19, 21) (16, 0) (16, 5) (16, 9) (25, 1) (25, 2) (25, 5) (25, 26) (21, 12) (21, 19) (7, 19) (7, 10) (24, 23) (10, 12) (10, 20) (10, 7) (10, 29) (29, 14) (29, 0) (29, 11) (29, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly. 

After sorting the vertices, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 30 has 0 connections.
Node 9 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 13 has 2 connections.
Node 18 has 2 connections.
Node 24 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 15 has 3 connections.
Node 17 has 3 connections.
Node 28 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 11 has 4 connections.
Node 12 has 4 connections.
Node 16 has 4 connections.
Node 27 has 4 connections.
Node 14 has 5 connections.
Node 2 has 5 connections.
Node 1 has 6 connections.
Node 4 has 6 connections.
Node 22 has 6 connections.
Node 19 has 7 connections.
Node 10 has 8 connections.
Node 21 has 8 connections.
Node 25 has 8 connections.
Node 20 has 9 connections.
Node 29 has 9 connections.
Node 26 has 10 connections.
Node 0 has 11 connections.

After labeling the vertices, we can start counting the triangles:

- Triangle 1: <1, 3, 15>
- Triangle 2: <1, 3, 28>
- Triangle 3: <1, 25, 28>
- Triangle 4: <3, 15, 23>
- Triangle 5: <4, 5, 16>
- Triangle 6: <4, 6, 28>
- Triangle 7: <4, 10, 12>
- Triangle 8: <4, 10, 20>
- Triangle 9: <4, 6, 12>
- Triangle 10: <7, 10, 21>
- Triangle 11: <9, 16, 25>
- Triangle 12: <10, 11, 20>
- Triangle 13: <10, 11, 29>
- Triangle 14: <14, 17, 22>
- Triangle 15: <14, 11, 27>
- Triangle 16: <19, 21, 27>
- Triangle 17: <19, 18, 27>
- Triangle 18: <19, 21, 12>
- Triangle 19: <19, 18, 2>
- Triangle 20: <27, 26, 25>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is: [20]
