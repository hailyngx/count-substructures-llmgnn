Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (17, 9) (17, 1) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 14) (3, 1) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 13) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 8) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 15) (16, 7) (16, 6) (6, 1) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (19, 2) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 6) (8, 11) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows the steps to count triangles in the given graph. 

Firstly, we construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: 
- 0: (9, 12), (10)
- 1: (5, 17), (3, 6, 2)
- 2: (1, 18, 19)
- 3: (14, 1)
- 4: (13, 11, 15)
- 5: (12, 1)
- 6: (16, 1, 11, 8)
- 7: (16, 15, 8, 13)
- 8: (14, 7, 18, 6, 11)
- 9: (17, 14, 0, 12)
- 10: (0, 12)
- 11: (4, 6, 8)
- 12: (5, 9, 18, 10)
- 13: (4, 7, 15)
- 14: (9, 3, 8)
- 15: (4, 7, 13)
- 16: (7, 6)
- 17: (9, 1)
- 18: (2, 8, 12)
- 19: (2)

Next, sorting the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order, we get:
Nodes by degree: 19, 10, 0, 3, 5, 17, 4, 15, 16, 7, 18, 11, 6, 2, 1, 14, 8, 9, 12, 13

Now, we count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 14]
<1, 2, 6>, <1, 6, 11>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 16>, <1, 8, 11>, <2, 6, 18>, <2, 8, 11>, <3, 1, 14>, <4, 7, 13>, <4, 7, 15>, <8, 11, 14>, <8, 11, 18>, <8, 12, 18>, <9, 12, 0>
