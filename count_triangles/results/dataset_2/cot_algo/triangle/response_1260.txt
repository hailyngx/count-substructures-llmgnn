Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in the given graph. Let's proceed step by step.

First, let's list the degrees of each node from least to most:
Node 1: degree 3
Node 0: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 8: degree 5
Node 9: degree 5
Node 7: degree 6
Node 5: degree 7

Next, let's label the nodes in ascending order of their degrees:
Node 1: label 1
Node 0: label 2
Node 4: label 3
Node 3: label 4
Node 2: label 5
Node 6: label 6
Node 8: label 7
Node 9: label 8
Node 7: label 9
Node 5: label 10

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:
- Edges involving lower labeled node:
1. (1, 4): No triangles
2. (0, 2): No triangles
3. (4, 9): No triangles
4. (3, 7): No triangles
5. (2, 6): No triangles
6. (6, 9): No triangles
7. (8, 9): No triangles
8. (7, 9): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 0 ([]).

I will list down the triangles <...> found if there are any.
