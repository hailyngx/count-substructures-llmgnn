Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 19) (10, 15) (10, 19) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 0) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 13) (13, 0) (13, 15) (18, 14) (18, 11) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 16) (6, 15) (6, 14) (6, 7) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 6) (14, 11) (7, 8) (7, 6) (16, 5) (16, 19) (12, 1) (12, 17) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

0: 5 connections
1: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
4: 3 connections
14: 3 connections
15: 3 connections
9: 2 connections
17: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
19: 2 connections
11: 2 connections
18: 2 connections
13: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
10: 2 connections
16: 2 connections
12: 2 connections
5: 1 connection

Now, we will relabel the vertices from 0 to 19 following their degrees. 

Vertices: 
0 - 5 connections (originally vertex 5)
1 - 4 connections (originally vertex 9)
2 - 4 connections (originally vertex 3)
3 - 4 connections (originally vertex 1)
4 - 3 connections (originally vertex 4)
5 - 1 connection (originally vertex 14)
6 - 2 connections (originally vertex 15)
7 - 2 connections (originally vertex 11)
8 - 2 connections (originally vertex 18)
9 - 2 connections (originally vertex 13)
10 - 2 connections (originally vertex 8)
11 - 2 connections (originally vertex 7)
12 - 2 connections (originally vertex 10)
13 - 2 connections (originally vertex 16)
14 - 3 connections (originally vertex 12)
15 - 3 connections (originally vertex 19)
16 - 2 connections (originally vertex 6)
17 - 2 connections (originally vertex 17)
18 - 2 connections (originally vertex 2)
19 - 2 connections (originally vertex 0)

Now, we'll go through each edge and count the number of triangles. 

[Total number of triangles: 3]

<1, 3, 17>
<2, 3, 17>
<1, 2, 3>
