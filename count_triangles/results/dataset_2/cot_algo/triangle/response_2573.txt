Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 5) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 9) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 12) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 12) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 3) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
Let's construct a graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: 4, 9, 5, 10, 12
- 1: 6, 12
- 2: 4, 13, 3
- 3: 8, 5, 6, 9, 2
- 4: 7, 0, 14, 2
- 5: 7, 11, 6, 0, 3
- 6: 10, 5, 1, 3
- 7: 4, 14, 5
- 8: 10, 13, 9, 14, 3
- 9: 10, 8, 13, 3, 0
- 10: 11, 0, 6, 8, 9
- 11: 10, 5
- 12: 13, 1, 0, 14
- 13: 8, 12, 2, 9
- 14: 4, 7, 8, 12

Now, we will count the number of triangles present using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

By sorting the vertices based on their degree, the order becomes: 1, 11, 2, 6, 13, 14, 7, 12, 9, 8, 3, 5, 0, 10, 4

Now, let's find the total number of triangles: [38]

Here are the unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 14>
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 4, 12>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 10>
<0, 9, 13>
<0, 9, 3>
<0, 9, 10>
<0, 9, 5>
<0, 9, 8>
<0, 9, 4>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 13>
<2, 4, 14>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 13>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 13, 12>
<2, 13, 9>
<2, 13, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 4>
<3, 6, 10>
<4, 7, 14>
<5, 6, 10>
<8, 9, 13>
