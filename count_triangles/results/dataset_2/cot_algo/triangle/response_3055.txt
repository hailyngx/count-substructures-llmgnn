Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 17) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 9) (10, 8) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 18) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 12) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (8, 10) (8, 17) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 19) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 18) (0, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (12, 2) (12, 18) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 19) (15, 19) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 15) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are: 10, 15, 6, 4, 8, 12, 7, 19, 14, 5, 2, 17, 18, 3, 13, 16, 1, 0, 11, 9.

The total number of triangles is [10].
The unique triangles found are: <2, 11, 16>, <0, 11, 16>, <0, 11, 18>, <1, 5, 13>, <1, 7, 13>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 13, 19>, <2, 12, 18>, <4, 6, 14>, <7, 13, 19>.
