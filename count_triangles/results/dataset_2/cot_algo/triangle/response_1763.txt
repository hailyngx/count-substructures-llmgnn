Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes by their degrees in non-decreasing order:
Nodes: 9(5) 4(5) 8(4) 7(5) 1(5) 6(4) 3(5) 2(5) 0(5) 5(3)

Next, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:
(5, 9): Shared connections: None
(5, 0): Shared connections: 2(0, 9)
(5, 3): Shared connections: 0(5, 3) 2(0, 9)
(9, 6): Shared connections: None
(9, 8): Shared connections: None
(9, 0): Shared connections: 8(0, 9)
(4, 7): Shared connections: None
(4, 8): Shared connections: None
(4, 3): Shared connections: 3(3, 4)
(7, 3): Shared connections: 4(3, 4) 8(0, 9)
(7, 2): Shared connections: None
(7, 1): Shared connections: None
(6, 1): Shared connections: None
(6, 3): Shared connections: 1(6, 3)
(6, 2): Shared connections: None
(1, 6): Shared connections: None
(1, 2): Shared connections: 6(1, 2)
(1, 0): Shared connections: 9(0, 9)
(3, 4): Shared connections: 7(3, 4)
(3, 7): Shared connections: 9(0, 9)
(3, 2): Shared connections: 1(6, 3)
(2, 7): Shared connections: None
(2, 6): Shared connections: None
(2, 1): Shared connections: 3(3, 4) 7(0, 9)
(0, 1): Shared connections: 2(0, 9)
(0, 2): Shared connections: None

Counting the total number of triangles: 4

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are: 
<5, 0, 9>
<5, 0, 3>
<3, 0, 9>
<3, 2, 0>
