Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and their connections:
- Node 0: 5, 7, 8, 1, 2
- Node 1: 5, 2, 0
- Node 2: 9, 1, 6, 0
- Node 3: 9, 7, 6
- Node 4: 5, 8
- Node 5: 9, 6, 1, 4, 0
- Node 6: 5, 9, 7, 3, 2, 8
- Node 7: 9, 0, 3, 6
- Node 8: 4, 6, 0
- Node 9: 5, 6, 2, 3, 7

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted as follows:
Node 8 < Node 1 < Node 3 < Node 4 < Node 2 < Node 7 < Node 0 < Node 5 < Node 6 < Node 9

Now, counting the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 5, 6> (shared connection: 5)
- Triangle <0, 6, 8> (shared connection: 8)
- Triangle <0, 6, 7> (shared connection: 7)
- Triangle <1, 2, 5> (shared connection: 5)
- Triangle <1, 2, 6> (shared connection: 2)
- Triangle <2, 6, 9> (shared connection: 9)
- Triangle <3, 6, 7> (shared connection: 7)
- Triangle <5, 6, 9> (shared connection: 6)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
