Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 16) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 11) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 15) (13, 18) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 0) (1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 3) (0, 18) (0, 16) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 10) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 15) (6, 2) (6, 15) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 0) (14, 5) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 6) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 12) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 12, 17
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 9, 14
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 11
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 11, 16
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 7, 9, 18, 3
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 17, 10, 15
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 15, 18
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 13, 19, 12, 6
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 8, 1, 0, 9
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 1, 12
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 13, 2, 11, 0
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 2, 15, 10

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees from least to most connections:
Nodes by degrees: 1, 0, 8, 6, 10, 14, 3, 7, 13, 19, 5, 9, 17, 18, 12, 16, 11, 4, 2, 15

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
- Node 1 (degree 1) becomes node 0
- Node 0 (degree 1) becomes node 1
- Node 8 (degree 1) becomes node 2
- Node 6 (degree 1) becomes node 3
- Node 10 (degree 2) becomes node 4
- Node 14 (degree 2) becomes node 5
- Node 3 (degree 2) becomes node 6
- Node 7 (degree 2) becomes node 7
- Node 13 (degree 2) becomes node 8
- Node 19 (degree 3) becomes node 9
- Node 5 (degree 3) becomes node 10
- Node 9 (degree 3) becomes node 11
- Node 17 (degree 4) becomes node 12
- Node 18 (degree 4) becomes node 13
- Node 12 (degree 5) becomes node 14
- Node 16 (degree 5) becomes node 15
- Node 11 (degree 5) becomes node 16
- Node 4 (degree 5) becomes node 17
- Node 2 (degree 5) becomes node 18
- Node 15 (degree 5) becomes node 19

Using the relabeled nodes, we will go through each edge to count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 16]
<List of unique triangles:
<0, 1, 17>
<0, 2, 12>
<0, 2, 18>
<0, 16, 1>
<3, 12, 4>
<3, 12, 10>
<4, 12, 17>
<4, 12, 15>
<4, 12, 2>
<4, 17, 1>
<6, 15, 12>
<6, 15, 19>
<12, 15, 2>
<12, 15, 6>
<16, 1, 17>
<16, 1, 0>
