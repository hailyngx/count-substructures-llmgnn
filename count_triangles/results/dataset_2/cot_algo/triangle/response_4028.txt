Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 16) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 13) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 18) (8, 19) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 15) (13, 10) (13, 17) (19, 8) (19, 16) (19, 12) (16, 3) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 18) (16, 2) (6, 10) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 12) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 14) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 18) (18, 1) (18, 17) (18, 16) (18, 12) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in increasing order. Then, we label the vertices accordingly. Here are the vertices labeled by their degrees:

Vertex 0: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 4
Vertex 6: Degree 2
Vertex 12: Degree 3
Vertex 1: Degree 2
Vertex 5: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 1
Vertex 2: Degree 4
Vertex 4: Degree 2
Vertex 7: Degree 4
Vertex 11: Degree 4
Vertex 13: Degree 3
Vertex 9: Degree 3
Vertex 14: Degree 3
Vertex 19: Degree 3
Vertex 10: Degree 4
Vertex 15: Degree 4
Vertex 18: Degree 4
Vertex 16: Degree 5
Vertex 17: Degree 6

Now, let's count the triangles:
