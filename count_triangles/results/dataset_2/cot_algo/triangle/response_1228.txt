Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 5) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 9) (4, 19) (4, 16) (7, 14) (7, 5) (2, 18) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 1) (8, 10) (8, 16) (3, 16) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (0, 18) (0, 15) (1, 18) (1, 15) (1, 5) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 1) (15, 9) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 9) (6, 11) (6, 19) (12, 17) (12, 10) (9, 17) (9, 15) (9, 13) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 12) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 13) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves labeling the vertices based on their degree. Let's list the nodes with their degrees:

Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 2
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 4
Node 12: degree 2
Node 13: degree 5
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 4
Node 16: degree 5
Node 17: degree 3
Node 18: degree 6
Node 19: degree 4

Now we'll relabel the vertices based on their degrees from least to most:

Node 3: degree 2
Node 6: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 12: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 17: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4
Node 15: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5
Node 13: degree 5
Node 16: degree 5
Node 18: degree 6

Next, we will proceed with counting the triangles based on the relabeled vertices using the given edges. 

The total number of triangles and the unique triangles found are as follows:

Total number of triangles: [25]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 7, 5>, <1, 5, 15>, <1, 5, 18>, <1, 15, 18>, <2, 5, 11>, <3, 8, 16>, <4, 9, 13>, <4, 9, 19>, <4, 13, 19>, <5, 11, 14>, <5, 11, 1>, <5, 11, 6>, <5, 14, 7>, <7, 11, 6>, <9, 13, 17>, <9, 13, 16>, <9, 13, 10>, <10, 12, 17>, <10, 8, 16>, <13, 16, 4>, <13, 16, 8>, <13, 16, 3>, <15, 9, 13>, <15, 1, 18>
