Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 11) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 14) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 18) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 13) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 8) (15, 1) (15, 17) (15, 16) (13, 11) (17, 15) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 16) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 12) (19, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (6, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 10) (10, 3) (10, 9) (16, 15) (16, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (12, 19) (12, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves the following steps:

1. Count the number of connections each node has:
   - Node 0: 5 connections
   - Node 1: 3 connections
   - Node 2: 5 connections
   - Node 3: 4 connections
   - Node 4: 3 connections
   - Node 5: 2 connections
   - Node 6: 1 connection
   - Node 7: 4 connections
   - Node 8: 3 connections
   - Node 9: 5 connections
   - Node 10: 2 connections
   - Node 11: 4 connections
   - Node 12: 2 connections
   - Node 13: 1 connection
   - Node 14: 2 connections
   - Node 15: 3 connections
   - Node 16: 2 connections
   - Node 17: 1 connection
   - Node 18: 3 connections
   - Node 19: 4 connections

2. Sort the nodes based on their number of connections in ascending order:
   - Nodes with 1 connection: 6, 13, 17
   - Nodes with 2 connections: 5, 12, 16
   - Nodes with 3 connections: 1, 4, 8, 15, 18
   - Nodes with 4 connections: 3, 7, 11, 19
   - Nodes with 5 connections: 0, 2, 9
   
3. Process each edge only if the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
   - <2, 18>: Forms no triangles
   - <2, 19>: Forms 1 triangle <2, 4, 19>
   - <2, 9>: Forms 1 triangle <2, 0, 9>
   - <2, 7>: Forms no triangles
   - <2, 0>: Forms no triangles
   - <18, 4>: Forms no triangles
   - <18, 11>: Forms no triangles
   - <4, 9>: Forms 1 triangle <4, 0, 9>
   - <3, 11>: Forms no triangles
   - <3, 7>: Forms no triangles
   - <3, 14>: Forms no triangles
   - <3, 10>: Forms no triangles
   - <11, 13>: Forms no triangles
   - <1, 15>: Forms no triangles
   - <1, 5>: Forms no triangles
   - <1, 8>: Forms no triangles
   - <15, 17>: Forms no triangles
   - <15, 16>: Forms no triangles
   - <13, 11>: Forms no triangles
   - <17, 15>: Forms no triangles
   - <8, 19>: Forms no triangles
   - <8, 16>: Forms no triangles
   - <19, 12>: Forms no triangles
   - <19, 9>: Forms 1 triangle <19, 0, 9>
   - <7, 11>: Forms no triangles
   - <7, 6>: Forms no triangles
   - <0, 5>: Forms no triangles
   - <0, 12>: Forms no triangles
   - <14, 10>: Forms no triangles
   - <9, 10>: Forms no triangles

The total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <2, 4, 19>, <2, 0, 9>, and <4, 0, 9>.
