Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. The vertices are relabeled accordingly as follows:

Nodes ordered by degree (least to most):
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 4: 6 connections

Based on the relabeling of the vertices, we look at each edge in the order provided to count the triangles. 

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is: [8].

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 0>
<1, 5, 7>
<3, 0, 7>
