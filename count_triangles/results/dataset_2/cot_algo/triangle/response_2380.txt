Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the provided information. Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Here is the list of vertices sorted by their degree:
- Node 5 has degree 5
- Node 0 has degree 5
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 2

Let's count the number of triangles and the unique triangles:
- Number of triangles: [12]
- Unique triangles: <0, 3, 1>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 2>, <6, 3, 8>, <6, 3, 7>, <6, 8, 9>, <5, 1, 2>, <5, 1, 9>, <5, 1, 3>
