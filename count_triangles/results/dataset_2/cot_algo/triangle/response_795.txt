Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 16) (27, 24) (27, 18) (27, 9) (2, 29) (2, 26) (2, 7) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 17) (29, 22) (29, 24) (8, 20) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 26) (10, 7) (10, 9) (17, 29) (17, 3) (17, 23) (17, 22) (28, 29) (5, 23) (19, 1) (19, 20) (3, 17) (3, 24) (3, 16) (21, 20) (21, 12) (14, 26) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 9) (26, 2) (26, 10) (26, 14) (26, 6) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (12, 13) (12, 21) (12, 4) (11, 13) (11, 24) (11, 25) (24, 27) (24, 29) (24, 3) (24, 11) (23, 17) (23, 5) (23, 14) (1, 19) (1, 4) (1, 25) (1, 22) (22, 29) (22, 17) (22, 1) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 6) (25, 11) (25, 1) (25, 16) (20, 8) (20, 19) (20, 21) (20, 9) (20, 16) (18, 27) (18, 14) (18, 0) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 9) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 25) (16, 20) (6, 26) (6, 0) (9, 27) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 20) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

0: 4 connections
5: 3 connections
8: 1 connection
15: 1 connection
27: 4 connections
1: 4 connections
12: 4 connections
19: 2 connections
2: 6 connections
28: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
7: 4 connections
18: 4 connections
24: 5 connections
11: 3 connections
25: 3 connections
3: 4 connections
16: 4 connections
22: 4 connections
10: 3 connections
17: 4 connections
29: 6 connections
4: 4 connections
21: 3 connections
13: 2 connections
14: 4 connections
9: 5 connections
23: 4 connections
