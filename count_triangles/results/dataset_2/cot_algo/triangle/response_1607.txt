Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 13) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 11) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 1) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) 

Response:
Given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 7), (5, 14), (9, 4), (9, 11), (9, 1), (9, 12), (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 14), (4, 11), (4, 3), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 1), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 12), (0, 14), (0, 12), (0, 13), (0, 2), (14, 5), (14, 4), (14, 0), (14, 8), (14, 13), (2, 0), (2, 8), (2, 13), (8, 14), (8, 2), (8, 10), (8, 3), (12, 9), (12, 6), (12, 0), (12, 13), (13, 5), (13, 0), (13, 14), (13, 2), (13, 12), (13, 11), (1, 9), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 11), (1, 10), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 10), (11, 9), (11, 4), (11, 13), (11, 1), (10, 8), (10, 1), (10, 3)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 3 has 3 connections  
Node 10 has 3 connections  
Node 2 has 3 connections  
Node 8 has 4 connections  
Node 0 has 4 connections  
Node 6 has 4 connections  
Node 12 has 4 connections  
Node 7 has 4 connections  
Node 11 has 4 connections  
Node 1 has 5 connections  
Node 9 has 5 connections  
Node 14 has 6 connections  
Node 4 has 6 connections   
Node 13 has 7 connections   
Node 5 has 6 connections  

Now, we will traverse the edges following the rules mentioned earlier to count the triangles:

Triangles: [24]

Unique triangles: <0, 4, 14>, <0, 8, 14>, <0, 12, 13>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 10, 11>, <1, 6, 11>, <1, 9, 11>, <2, 8, 13>, <3, 4, 11>, <3, 8, 10>, <4, 9, 11>, <5, 6, 12>, <5, 7, 14>, <5, 13, 14>, <6, 12, 13>, <7, 9, 11>, <8, 10, 1>, <9, 11, 13>, <0, 2, 14>, <2, 13, 14>, <3, 8, 3>, <4, 7, 5>, <8, 10, 3>, <11, 1, 6>
