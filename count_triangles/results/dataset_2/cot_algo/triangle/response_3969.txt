Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 8) (4, 16) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 6) (7, 12) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 7) (18, 2) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (19, 9) (19, 14) (15, 4) (15, 14) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 2) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly. 

After relabeling the vertices, the new order is: 
0 (degree 4)
2 (degree 2)
3 (degree 2)
4 (degree 3)
1 (degree 5)
6 (degree 5)
8 (degree 4)
5 (degree 4)
7 (degree 4)
10 (degree 4)
13 (degree 3)
12 (degree 3)
11 (degree 4)
16 (degree 2)
17 (degree 2)
18 (degree 2)
14 (degree 4)
19 (degree 2)
15 (degree 2)
9 (degree 2)

Now, we will count the triangles by examining the edges and shared connections:

<0, 6, 8> (common connection: 1)
<0, 6, 5> (common connection: 1)
<1, 3, 6> (common connection: 5)
<1, 3, 10> (common connection: 6)
<1, 4, 6> (common connection: 5)
<1, 4, 10> (common connection: 6)
<1, 4, 5> (common connection: 6)
<1, 5, 10> (common connection: 6)
<3, 6, 10> (common connection: 1)
<4, 8, 6> (common connection: 0)
<4, 8, 10> (common connection: 6)
<5, 7, 10> (common connection: 6)
<7, 12, 14> (common connection: 4)
<14, 19, 12> (common connection: 7)

The total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
