Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 3, 1, 6
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 9, 2, 5, 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 3, 2
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 3
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 2, 5, 0, 1
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 6, 8, 0
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 6, 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 0
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 6, 9
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8, 5, 1

Now, let's order the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

0: 3 connections
9: 2 connections
2: 3 connections
1: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
8: 6 connections
7: 6 connections
4: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's count the triangles:

1. Check edges involving nodes with lower degree:
- (8, 0): shared connection with 5 -> Triangle <0, 5, 8>
- (5, 0): shared connection with 8 -> Triangle <0, 5, 8>
- (0, 1): shared connection with 8 -> Triangle <0, 1, 8>

2. Continue checking remaining edges:
- No more triangles found.

Total number of triangles: [3]
