Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 1) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 2) (3, 25) (3, 27) (25, 13) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 9) (23, 22) (23, 29) (23, 19) (2, 22) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 20) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 24) (8, 2) (8, 28) (8, 20) (19, 23) (19, 29) (19, 14) (19, 27) (26, 20) (26, 6) (9, 22) (9, 25) (9, 20) (11, 28) (11, 29) (28, 8) (28, 11) (28, 17) (28, 12) (28, 27) (6, 26) (6, 21) (6, 4) (21, 6) (21, 5) (7, 25) (10, 12) (10, 20) (15, 17) (4, 6) (4, 27) (4, 1) (27, 3) (27, 19) (27, 28) (27, 4) (27, 16) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 24) (12, 28) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 0) (16, 27) (16, 24) (17, 28) (17, 15) (17, 12) (24, 18) (24, 1) (24, 16) (14, 19) (14, 5) (20, 2) (20, 8) (20, 26) (20, 9) (20, 10) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 5) (29, 23) (29, 19) (29, 11) (5, 21) (5, 14) (5, 0) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by degree:
(30) - 1 connection
(7, 15, 16, 17, 21, 22, 25, 26) - 2 connections
(4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 14, 18, 19, 23, 24, 27, 29) - 3 connections
(0, 3, 9, 13) - 4 connections
(2, 8, 12, 20, 28) - 5 connections
