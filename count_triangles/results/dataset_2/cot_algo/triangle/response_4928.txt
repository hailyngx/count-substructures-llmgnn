Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 3) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 9) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 15) (7, 8) (7, 18) (7, 16) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 19) (2, 6) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 19) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 1) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 5) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 11) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 17) (3, 18) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 3) (15, 16) (15, 12) (15, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 15) (17, 0) (17, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the vertices by their degree. The degrees of each vertex are as follows: 

0: 4  
1: 4  
2: 2  
3: 4  
4: 2  
5: 4  
6: 4  
7: 4  
8: 4  
9: 3  
10: 4  
11: 4  
12: 4  
13: 3  
14: 3  
15: 3  
16: 4  
17: 2  
18: 4  
19: 4  

The sorted order of vertices based on the number of connections is: 2, 4, 17, 13, 14, 15, 9, 0, 11, 3, 7, 13, 5, 1, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18, 19.

Based on the sorted order, we will analyze the edges in the given graph to count the number of triangles:

1. <2, 6, 1>  
2. <6, 4, 11>  
3. <6, 1, 5>  
4. <4, 11, 5>  
5. <17, 0, 9>  
6. <9, 3, 14>  
7. <9, 0, 16>  
8. <14, 3, 18>  
9. <14, 1, 6>  
10. <14, 12, 19>  
11. <15, 9, 0>  
12. <15, 16, 7>  
13. <15, 12, 19>  
14. <3, 16, 0>  
15. <3, 18, 7>  
16. <3, 14, 1>  
17. <12, 19, 11>  
18. <12, 14, 1>  
19. <16, 0, 17>  
20. <16, 7, 18>  
21. <16, 15, 9>  
22. <7, 16, 0>  
23. <7, 18, 3>  
24. <7, 8, 1>  
25. <10, 19, 12>  
26. <10, 13, 8>  
27. <10, 18, 3>  
28. <13, 8, 1>  
29. <8, 1, 6>  
30. <8, 7, 16>  

[There are 30 triangles in total.]
