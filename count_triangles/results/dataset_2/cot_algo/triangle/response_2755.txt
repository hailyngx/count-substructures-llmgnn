Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 10) (22, 14) (22, 17) (22, 21) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 8) (15, 13) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 10) (14, 22) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 10) (17, 22) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 4) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 10) (9, 29) (9, 21) (9, 11) (23, 18) (23, 25) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 29) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 25) (5, 12) (5, 24) (28, 3) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 20) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 27) (26, 24) (26, 21) (24, 6) (24, 5) (24, 26) (24, 12) (0, 28) (0, 16) (0, 18) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 2) (18, 23) (18, 0) (29, 9) (29, 4) (29, 16) (10, 13) (10, 15) (10, 14) (10, 6) (16, 0) (16, 29) (25, 17) (25, 23) (25, 8) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 20) (20, 28) (20, 12) (19, 4) (19, 21) (19, 27) (21, 22) (21, 9) (21, 26) (21, 19) (2, 7) (27, 1) (27, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves the following steps:

1. Count the number of connections each node has:
   - Node 0: 3 connections
   - Node 1: 4 connections
   - Node 2: 1 connection
   - Node 3: 4 connections
   - Node 4: 4 connections
   - Node 5: 2 connections
   - Node 6: 3 connections
   - Node 7: 3 connections
   - Node 8: 3 connections
   - Node 9: 3 connections
   - Node 10: 4 connections
   - Node 11: 3 connections
   - Node 12: 4 connections
   - Node 13: 3 connections
   - Node 14: 4 connections
   - Node 15: 4 connections
   - Node 16: 2 connections
   - Node 17: 4 connections
   - Node 18: 2 connections
   - Node 19: 3 connections
   - Node 20: 2 connections
   - Node 21: 4 connections
   - Node 22: 3 connections
   - Node 23: 2 connections
   - Node 24: 4 connections
   - Node 25: 4 connections
   - Node 26: 2 connections
   - Node 27: 2 connections
   - Node 28: 4 connections
   - Node 29: 3 connections

2. Sort the nodes based on the number of connections in ascending order:
   - Nodes 2, 5, 16, 18, 20, 23, 26, 27 have 1 or 2 connections
   - Nodes 0, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 19, 29 have 3 connections
   - Nodes 1, 3, 4, 10, 15, 17, 21, 25, 28 have 4 connections
   - Nodes 12, 14, 24 have 4 connections with the same degree as above but are kept in their relative order as per the original vertices

3. Proceed with the edges starting from the edges between nodes with the lowest labels:
   - <2, 7, 14>
   - <2, 11, 21>
   - <2, 14, 10>
   - <2, 7, 11>
   - <5, 12, 24>
   - <5, 24, 20>
   - <5, 12, 20>
   - <5, 24, 26>
   - <16, 0, 18>
   - <16, 0, 28>
   - <16, 0, 12>
   - <18, 0, 28>
   - <23, 25, 17>
   - <23, 25, 8>
   - <23, 18, 0>
   - <26, 24, 12>
   - <26, 21, 22>
   - <26, 24, 5>
   - <27, 1, 15>

4. Count the total number of triangles: [18]

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in the given graph.
