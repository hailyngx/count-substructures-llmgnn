Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 15) (16, 13) (16, 4) (16, 6) (5, 17) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 12) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 4) (1, 15) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 4) (14, 15) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 18) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 14) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 10) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 10) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 12) (10, 13) (10, 7) (12, 9) (12, 19) (0, 11) (0, 19) (0, 18) (18, 8) (18, 0) (4, 16) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 14) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: (11, 7), (11, 19), (11, 0), (11, 15), (16, 13), (16, 4), (16, 6), (5, 17), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 12), (6, 16), (6, 4), (6, 9), (1, 15), (1, 7), (3, 8), (3, 4), (14, 17), (14, 8), (14, 19), (14, 4), (14, 15), (17, 5), (17, 14), (17, 13), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (8, 3), (8, 14), (8, 2), (8, 18), (15, 11), (15, 1), (15, 14), (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 10), (7, 11), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 10), (19, 11), (19, 14), (19, 0), (19, 12), (10, 13), (10, 7), (12, 9), (12, 19), (0, 11), (0, 19), (0, 18), (18, 8), (18, 0), (4, 16), (4, 6), (4, 3), (4, 14)

Now, we will sort the vertices by their degrees:
Vertex Degree
0 - 4, 1 - 3, 5 - 2, 10 - 2, 12 - 2, 18 - 2, 3 - 3, 19 - 4, 8 - 4, 13 - 4, 15 - 4, 6 - 4, 16 - 4, 2 - 4, 9 - 4, 7 - 4, 11 - 4, 17 - 4, 4 - 5, 14 - 6

Using the degree-based ordering method, we count the triangles by checking the shared connections between each edge's lower labeled vertex:
Total number of triangles: [28]
Unique triangles found: 
<4, 6, 16>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 3>, <4, 6, 14>, <4, 16, 13>, <4, 16, 6>, <4, 16, 14>, <4, 9, 6>, <4, 9, 3>, <4, 14, 6>, <4, 14, 15>, <4, 14, 17>, <4, 3, 6>, <4, 3, 9>, <4, 3, 14>, <4, 3, 8>, <6, 9, 2>, <6, 9, 4>, <6, 9, 12>, <6, 16, 13>, <6, 16, 4>, <6, 16, 14>, <6, 14, 4>, <6, 14, 17>, <6, 14, 15>, <8, 2, 9>, <8, 2, 14>, <9, 2, 8>
