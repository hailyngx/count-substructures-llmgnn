Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

By counting the number of connections for each node:
- Node 0 has 4 connections.
- Node 1 has 4 connections.
- Node 2 has 3 connections.
- Node 3 has 4 connections.
- Node 4 has 5 connections.
- Node 5 has 4 connections.
- Node 6 has 4 connections.
- Node 7 has 4 connections.
- Node 8 has 5 connections.
- Node 9 has 4 connections.

Arranging the nodes in order of increasing connections: {2, 9, 0, 3, 6, 7, 1, 5, 8, 4}.

Now, we will count the triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 1, 8>
<4, 3, 6>
<4, 3, 8>
<5, 0, 9>
<5, 8, 4>
<8, 6, 7>
<8, 6, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
