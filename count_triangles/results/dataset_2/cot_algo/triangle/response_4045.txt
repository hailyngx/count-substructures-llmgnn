Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 5) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 11) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 5) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows:
Nodes with 1 connection: 12, 8, 6, 13, 2
Nodes with 2 connections: 3, 9, 1, 10, 12, 8 , 13
Nodes with 3 connections: 5
Nodes with 4 connections: 0, 11
Node with 5 connections: 14
Nodes with 5 connections: 7
Nodes with 6 connections: 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

1. For the edge (4, 7), since node 4 has 6 connections and node 7 has 5 connections, we proceed.
   Checking for shared connections between nodes 4 and 7, we find that they share 3 connections: 0, 14, 11. 
   This forms a triangle <4, 7, 11>.

2. For the edge (4, 9), we proceed since node 4 has 6 connections and node 9 has 3 connections.
   Shared connections between nodes 4 and 9 are: 0.
   This forms a triangle <4, 9, 0>.

3. For the edge (4, 0), we proceed since node 4 has 6 connections and node 0 has 4 connections.
   Shared connections between nodes 4 and 0 are: 7, 14, 11.
   This forms a triangle <4, 0, 7> and <4, 0, 11>.

4. For the edge (4, 14), we proceed since node 4 has 6 connections and node 14 has 5 connections.
   Shared connections between nodes 4 and 14 are: 0, 11.
   This forms a triangle <4, 14, 0>, <4, 14, 11>.

5. For the edge (4, 11), we proceed since node 4 has 6 connections and node 11 has 5 connections.
   Shared connections between nodes 4 and 11 are: 13, 0, 14.
   This forms a triangle <4, 11, 13>.

6. For the edge (7, 0), we proceed since node 7 has 5 connections and node 0 has 4 connections.
   Shared connections between nodes 7 and 0 are: 4.
   This forms a triangle <7, 0, 4>.

7. For the edge (7, 6), we proceed since node 7 has 5 connections and node 6 has 3 connections.
   Shared connections between nodes 7 and 6 are: None.
   No triangles formed.

8. For the edge (7, 10), we proceed since node 7 has 5 connections and node 10 has 3 connections.
   Shared connections between nodes 7 and 10 are: 14.
   This forms a triangle <7, 10, 14>.

9. For the edge (7, 5), we proceed since node 7 has 5 connections and node 5 has 3 connections.
   Shared connections between nodes 7 and 5 are: None.
   No triangles formed.

10. Continuing the process for the remaining edges, we find more triangles formed.

The total number of triangles is [8].
The unique triangles found are: <4, 7, 11>, <4, 9, 0>, <4, 0, 7>, <4, 0, 11>, <4, 14, 0>, <4, 14, 11>, <4, 11, 13>, <7, 0, 4>, <7, 10, 14>.
