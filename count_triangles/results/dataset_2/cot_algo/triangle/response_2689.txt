Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 18) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 12) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 14) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 10) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (15, 14) (15, 12) (15, 17) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 19) (16, 4) (16, 6) (16, 19) (12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 19) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 18) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 15) (14, 3) (0, 1) (0, 5) (3, 14) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 12) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 5) (5, 0) (5, 10)
