Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. Then we relabel the vertices and count the number of triangles. 

After sorting the vertices based on degrees from least to most, we get the following relabeling:  
Node 6 - Degree: 0  
Node 15 - Degree: 0  
Node 14 - Degree: 1  
Node 11 - Degree: 2  
Node 3 - Degree: 3  
Node 12 - Degree: 3  
Node 5 - Degree: 4  
Node 10 - Degree: 4  
Node 8 - Degree: 4  
Node 13 - Degree: 5  
Node 2 - Degree: 5  
Node 7 - Degree: 5  
Node 1 - Degree: 6  
Node 9 - Degree: 6  
Node 4 - Degree: 6  

Based on the relabeled nodes, we consider the edges in the following order:

1. Edge: (9, 8) forms triangles with:  
   - (8, 4, 9)  
  
2. Edge: (9, 11) forms triangles with:
