Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 17) (15, 27) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 3) (0, 27) (0, 24) (0, 12) (0, 23) (18, 7) (18, 29) (18, 13) (22, 4) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 29) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 25) (3, 14) (20, 25) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 16) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 21) (21, 7) (21, 13) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 13) (28, 11) (28, 23) (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 8) (1, 5) (1, 19) (17, 26) (17, 2) (24, 26) (24, 0) (24, 4) (29, 27) (29, 18) (29, 22) (13, 15) (13, 18) (13, 21) (13, 12) (8, 11) (8, 19) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 6) (4, 22) (4, 12) (4, 24) (4, 14) (5, 22) (5, 1) (5, 16) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 17) (2, 14) (10, 22) (10, 16) (6, 19) (6, 23) (6, 16) (23, 9) (23, 0) (23, 28) (23, 6) (16, 25) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly. 

The sorted list of nodes with their degrees is as follows:
Node 28: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 20: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 18: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 21: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 16: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 22: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 0: degree 5
Node 25: degree 5
Node 27: degree 5
Node 9: degree 5
Node 13: degree 5
Node 17: degree 5
Node 24: degree 5
Node 26: degree 5
Node 29: degree 5
Node 23: degree 5
Node 15: degree 5

Using the sorted list, we can count the number of triangles present in the graph by looking at the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

Triangles found:
