Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 24) (0, 23) (27, 17) (3, 2) (3, 19) (25, 9) (25, 15) (23, 0) (23, 14) (23, 16) (10, 21) (10, 16) (10, 29) (11, 14) (11, 24) (11, 26) (7, 13) (7, 21) (7, 6) (7, 9) (21, 10) (21, 7) (21, 16) (21, 8) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 17) (15, 25) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 28) (20, 15) (20, 17) (20, 4) (26, 11) (26, 28) (26, 4) (28, 15) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 1) (17, 27) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 20) (5, 24) (5, 14) (19, 3) (19, 29) (16, 23) (16, 10) (16, 21) (16, 18) (16, 28) (9, 25) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 1) (29, 10) (29, 19) (4, 20) (4, 26) (4, 12) (12, 13) (12, 4) (1, 2) (1, 28) (1, 9) (1, 8) (6, 7) (6, 24) (14, 23) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 5) (24, 0) (24, 11) (24, 5) (24, 6) (8, 21) (8, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows these steps:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order.
2. Relabel the vertices accordingly.
3. Check each edge and count triangles only if the lower-labeled vertex has fewer connections.

Vertices sorted by degree (from lowest to highest): <3, 5, 6, 12, 13, 19, 29, 2, 8, 25, 27, 4, 10, 26, 0, 7, 14, 20, 21, 23, 24, 1, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 28, 22>

Triangles (unique) found: <0, 13, 24>, <0, 15, 25>, <0, 15, 20>, <0, 21, 7>, <0, 23, 14>, <1, 9, 15>, <1, 9, 28>, <2, 3, 18>, <4, 12, 26>, <4, 12, 24>, <4, 20, 15>, <4, 20, 17>, <5, 14, 24>, <6, 7, 24>, <7, 9, 15>, <10, 16, 21>, <11, 14, 24>, <11, 14, 18>, <15, 17, 20>, <15, 17, 28>, <16, 18, 21>, <16, 18, 28>, <16, 21, 28>, <18, 21, 28>.

Total number of triangles: [24]
