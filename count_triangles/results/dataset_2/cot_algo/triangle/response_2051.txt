Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently. 

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the relabeling of vertices is as follows:
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 2
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 5

Let's count the triangles and identify unique triangles:
1. Triangles involving node 1: None
2. Triangles involving node 7: None
3. Triangles involving node 9: None
4. Triangles involving node 0: <0, 4, 8>
5. Triangles involving node 5: <0, 3, 5>
6. Triangles involving node 8: <0, 4, 8>
7. Triangles involving node 3: <0, 3, 5>
8. Triangles involving node 2: <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 9>
9. Triangles involving node 6: None
10. Triangles involving node 4: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 7>

Total number of triangles: [11]
