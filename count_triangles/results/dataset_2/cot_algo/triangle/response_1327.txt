Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:  

- Vertex 5: 3 connections  
- Vertex 7: 2 connections  
- Vertex 9: 4 connections  
- Vertex 3: 3 connections  
- Vertex 4: 4 connections  
- Vertex 8: 5 connections  
- Vertex 2: 5 connections  
- Vertex 0: 5 connections  
- Vertex 1: 5 connections  
- Vertex 6: 5 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:  

1. For edge (5, 9):  
    - Vertex 5 < Vertex 9, so proceed  
    - Shared connections: 6  
    - Triangle <5, 9, 6>  
2. For edge (5, 6):  
    - Vertex 5 < Vertex 6, so proceed  
    - Shared connections: 9  
    - Triangle <5, 6, 9>  
3. For edge (5, 3):  
    - Vertex 5 < Vertex 3, so proceed  
    - Shared connections: none  
4. For edge (9, 5):  
    - Vertex 5 < Vertex 9, so proceed  
    - Shared connections: 6 and 3  
    - Triangle <5, 9, 3>  
5. For edge (9, 6):  
    - Vertex 6 < Vertex 9, so proceed  
    - Shared connections: 5, 1, and 2  
    - Triangle <9, 6, 5>  
6. For edge (9, 8):  
    - Vertex 8 < Vertex 9, so proceed  
    - Shared connections: 4, 1, and 7  
    - Triangle <9, 8, 1>  
7. For edge (9, 4):  
    - Vertex 4 < Vertex 9, so proceed  
    - Shared connections: 8 and 2  
    - Triangle <9, 4, 8>  
   
Continue this process for all edges.  

The total number of triangles is [17].  
The unique triangles are: <5, 9, 6>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 9, 3>, <9, 6, 5>, <9, 8, 1>, <9, 4, 8>, <7, 1, 8>, <3, 5, 4>, <3, 4, 2>, <4, 8, 2>, <4, 2, 0>, <8, 4, 0>, <8, 4, 2>, <2, 0, 6>, <2, 0, 4>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 1, 7>.
