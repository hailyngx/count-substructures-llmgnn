Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 9)
(1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)
(2, 0), (2, 6)
(3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7)
(4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 8)
(5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 8)
(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 9)
(7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 9)
(8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 9)
(9, 0), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes with the least connections first:
{4, 2}
Next nodes:
{7, 9}
Next nodes:
{1, 5}
Next nodes:
{3, 0}
Last node:
{6, 8}
