Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
(0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9),
(1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 8), 
(2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 9),
(3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7),
(4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 8),
(5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 7),
(6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9),
(7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 6),
(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 9),
(9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 8)

Let's now list the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 4: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 0: degree 5
Node 9: degree 5

Based on the above ordering, let's count the triangles:

[14]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 7, 6>,
<2, 4, 8>, <2, 7, 4>, <2, 8, 4>, <2, 8, 9>,
<3, 5, 7>, <3, 7, 5>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 9>,
<6, 9, 0>, <7, 9, 0>
