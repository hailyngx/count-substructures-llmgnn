Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph with their corresponding connections are as follows:

0: 4, 2
1: 9, 6, 3, 2, 4
2: 9, 1, 7, 8, 0
3: 9, 1, 8
4: 5, 6, 1, 8, 0
5: 9, 8, 4, 7
6: 9, 1, 8, 4
7: 5, 2
8: 5, 6, 3, 4, 2
9: 5, 6, 2, 3, 1


We will now count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [7]
