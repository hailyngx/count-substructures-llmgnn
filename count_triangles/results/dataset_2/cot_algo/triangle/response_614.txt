Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 8) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

First, let's construct the graph with the nodes and edges provided:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 14), (6, 3), (6, 0), (6, 13), (9, 10), (9, 13), (10, 11), (10, 7), (10, 1), (10, 2), (11, 4), (8, 13), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 12), (8, 1), (13, 2), (4, 5), (4, 14), (7, 2), (12, 8)

Now, we sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

Nodes by degrees: [(12, 1), (0, 4), (7, 4), (11, 4), (12, 4), (3, 5), (1, 5), (14, 5), (5, 5), (2, 6), (10, 6), (9, 6), (13, 6), (8, 6), (6, 7)]

Next, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 
Based on the sorted nodes, we only consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [7].

Unique triangles found are: 
<6, 0, 3>
<6, 0, 11>
<6, 1, 10>
<6, 1, 14>
<6, 3, 14>
<6, 5, 14>
<0, 3, 11>
