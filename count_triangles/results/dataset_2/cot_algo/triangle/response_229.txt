Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 20) (3, 16) (3, 5) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 4) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 4) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 2) (27, 19) (27, 23) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 21) (22, 27) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 10) (25, 1) (25, 5) (25, 4) (23, 27) (23, 22) (6, 15) (6, 28) (9, 20) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 26) (28, 12) (19, 27) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 4) (26, 18) (26, 28) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 14) (21, 18) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 11) (21, 24) (24, 26) (24, 21) (7, 18) (1, 25) (1, 29) (1, 10) (17, 5) (17, 2) (4, 15) (4, 0) (4, 25) (4, 19) (12, 28) (12, 21) (16, 3) (16, 29) (14, 26) (14, 2) (14, 13) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 1) (29, 1) (29, 16) (11, 19) (11, 21) (20, 3) (20, 9) (20, 2) (20, 5) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 25) (5, 17) (5, 20) (13, 14) (2, 27) (2, 17) (2, 14) (2, 20) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections).

Here is a sorted list of nodes with their respective degrees:

Node 28 - degree 4
Node 7 - degree 1
Node 0 - degree 3
Node 13 - degree 1
Node 1 - degree 3
Node 17 - degree 2
Node 9 - degree 1
Node 24 - degree 2
Node 18 - degree 5
Node 11 - degree 2
Node 15 - degree 3
Node 5 - degree 5
Node 6 - degree 2
Node 23 - degree 2
Node 25 - degree 3
Node 21 - degree 4
Node 19 - degree 4
Node 2 - degree 4
Node 10 - degree 4
Node 22 - degree 4
Node 20 - degree 3
Node 12 - degree 2
Node 26 - degree 5
Node 3 - degree 3
Node 16 - degree 2
Node 14 - degree 3
Node 27 - degree 6
Node 4 - degree 5
Node 29 - degree 2

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will iterate through the edges and only consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

After processing all edges, we count the number of triangles. 

The total number of triangles found in the graph is: [36]

And the unique triangles are:

<0, 4, 15>
<0, 4, 19>
<0, 4, 25>
<0, 10, 18>
<0, 10, 22>
<1, 10, 18>
<1, 10, 25>
<2, 14, 26>
<2, 17, 20>
<4, 10, 18>
<4, 19, 26>
<4, 19, 27>
<5, 15, 25>
<5, 15, 27>
<5, 19, 26>
<6, 15, 27>
<10, 18, 22>
<11, 19, 21>
<12, 21, 28>
<14, 26, 27>
<15, 19, 27>
<15, 25, 27>
