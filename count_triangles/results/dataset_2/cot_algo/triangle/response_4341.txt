Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 13) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 14) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 3) (11, 8) (11, 0) 

Response:
