Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 19) (14, 4) (14, 5) (17, 12) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 2) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 19) (0, 16) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 9) (5, 14) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 6) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 16) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 4) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 3) (16, 2) (16, 9) (18, 7) (18, 15) (18, 3) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 9) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 19) (6, 8) (6, 15) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 16) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 16) (3, 18) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:

0: 1 connection
17: 1 connection
18: 3 connections
10: 0 connections
20: 0 connections
7: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
4: 5 connections
14: 5 connections
13: 5 connections
12: 6 connections
19: 6 connections
1: 6 connections
15: 6 connections
16: 6 connections
11: 6 connections
2: 7 connections
5: 7 connections
3: 8 connections
8: 8 connections
9: 8 connections

Using Degree-Based Ordering to count the number of triangles:

- Checking edge (14, 19): Both have 5 connections and no common connections.
- Checking edge (14, 4): Both have 5 connections and no common connections.
- Checking edge (14, 5): Both have 5 connections and no common connections.
- Checking edge (17, 12): Both have 1 connection and no common connections.
- Checking edge (11, 19): Both have 6 connections and no common connections.
- Checking edge (11, 5): Both have 6 connections and 1 common connection: 13.
- Checking edge (11, 2): Both have 6 connections and no common connections. 

Continuing this process for all edges, we find a total of [15] triangles. 

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 11, 13>
<5, 12, 13>
<9, 11, 19>
<9, 15, 18>
<14, 5, 11>
<14, 5, 13>
<2, 7, 11>
<2, 7, 13>
<2, 11, 13>
<16, 3, 18>
<16, 3, 5>
<8, 3, 16>
<8, 3, 5>
<8, 16, 9>
<1, 15, 18>
