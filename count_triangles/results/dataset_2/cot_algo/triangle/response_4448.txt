Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are connected in the following way based on the given edges:

Node 0 is connected to: 5, 1, 3, 6  
Node 1 is connected to: 5, 9, 7, 3, 0  
Node 2 is connected to: 4, 3, 6  
Node 3 is connected to: 1, 0, 2  
Node 4 is connected to: 5, 9, 7, 8, 2  
Node 5 is connected to: 9, 1, 4, 0  
Node 6 is connected to: 7, 8, 2, 0  
Node 7 is connected to: 9, 4, 6, 1  
Node 8 is connected to: 9, 4, 6  
Node 9 is connected to: 5, 9, 4, 8, 7, 1  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we relabel the nodes accordingly:

Nodes sorted by degree:  
Node 2 has degree 3  
Node 3 has degree 3  
Node 6 has degree 4  
Node 8 has degree 3  
Node 0 has degree 4  
Node 7 has degree 4  
Node 1 has degree 5  
Node 4 has degree 5  
Node 9 has degree 6  
Node 5 has degree 4  

Based on the degree-based ordering, we can start counting the triangles:
- Looking at edges (5, 9) and (5, 1): Node 5 has fewer connections than nodes 9 and 1, forming a triangle <1, 5, 9>.
- Looking at edges (5, 4) and (5, 0): Node 5 has fewer connections than nodes 4 and 0, forming a triangle <0, 4, 5>.
- Looking at edges (5, 1) and (1, 3): Node 1 has fewer connections than nodes 5 and 3, forming a triangle <3, 1, 5>.
- Looking at edges (5, 9) and (9, 7): Node 5 has fewer connections than nodes 9 and 7, forming a triangle <5, 7, 9>.
- Looking at edges (5, 0) and (0, 3): Node 0 has fewer connections than nodes 5 and 3, forming a triangle <0, 3, 5>.
- Looking at edges (4, 9) and (9, 7): Node 4 has fewer connections than nodes 9 and 7, forming a triangle <4, 7, 9>.

Count of triangles: [6]
Triangles found: <1, 5, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, <3, 1, 5>, <5, 7, 9>, <0, 3, 5>, <4, 7, 9>.
