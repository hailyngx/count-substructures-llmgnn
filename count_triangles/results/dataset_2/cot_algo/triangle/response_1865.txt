Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 7) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (6, 1), (6, 3), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 14), (9, 10), (1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 0), (1, 8), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 14), (3, 10), (4, 8), (4, 12), (4, 13), (4, 5), (4, 11), (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 14), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 0), (5, 4), (5, 13), (5, 12), (5, 10), (13, 4), (13, 5), (13, 12), (13, 11), (13, 14), (13, 7), (12, 4), (12, 5), (12, 13), (12, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 12), (0, 10), (0, 11), (10, 9), (10, 3), (10, 5), (10, 0), (7, 2), (7, 13), (14, 9), (14, 3), (14, 8), (14, 13), (11, 4), (11, 13), (11, 0)

Now, let's find the number of triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by degree:
Vertex 7: Degree 2
Vertex 11: Degree 3
Vertex 6: Degree 4
Vertex 12: Degree 4
Vertex 0: Degree 5
Vertex 5: Degree 5
Vertex 10: Degree 5
Vertex 2: Degree 5
Vertex 14: Degree 5
Vertex 13: Degree 6
Vertex 1: Degree 7
Vertex 3: Degree 7
Vertex 8: Degree 7
Vertex 9: Degree 7
Vertex 4: Degree 8
