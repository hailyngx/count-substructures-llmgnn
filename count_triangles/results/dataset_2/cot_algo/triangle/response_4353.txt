Response:
The nodes can be represented in terms of their connections as follows:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 4: 5 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections
- Node 10: 2 connections
- Node 11: 4 connections
- Node 12: 5 connections
- Node 13: 3 connections
- Node 14: 3 connections
- Node 15: 3 connections
- Node 16: 4 connections
- Node 17: 5 connections
- Node 18: 4 connections
- Node 19: 3 connections
- Node 20: 5 connections
- Node 21: 3 connections
- Node 22: 4 connections
- Node 23: 4 connections
- Node 24: 2 connections
- Node 25: 2 connections
- Node 26: 3 connections
- Node 27: 1 connection
- Node 28: 3 connections
- Node 29: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will sort the nodes in ascending order of their number of connections and relabel them accordingly:

New Labels:
Node 27 (1 connection) -> Node A
Node 0 (2 connections) -> Node B
Node 2 (2 connections) -> Node C
Node 3 (2 connections) -> Node D
Node 7 (2 connections) -> Node E
Node 8 (2 connections) -> Node F
Node 9 (2 connections) -> Node G
Node 10 (2 connections) -> Node H
Node 24 (2 connections) -> Node I
Node 25 (2 connections) -> Node J
Node 1 (3 connections) -> Node K
Node 5 (3 connections) -> Node L
Node 13 (3 connections) -> Node M
Node 14 (3 connections) -> Node N
Node 21 (3 connections) -> Node O
Node 26 (3 connections) -> Node P
Node 15 (3 connections) -> Node Q
Node 19 (3 connections) -> Node R
Node 28 (3 connections) -> Node S
Node 4 (5 connections) -> Node T
Node 6 (5 connections) -> Node U
Node 12 (5 connections) -> Node V
Node 20 (5 connections) -> Node W
Node 17 (5 connections) -> Node X
Node 11 (4 connections) -> Node Y
Node 16 (4 connections) -> Node Z
Node 18 (4 connections) -> Node AA
Node 22 (4 connections) -> Node AB
Node 23 (4 connections) -> Node AC
Node 29 (4 connections) -> Node AD

Now, we will check for triangles based on shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.
