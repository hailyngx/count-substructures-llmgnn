Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (17, 1) (17, 9) (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 17) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (0, 14) (0, 19) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 16) (18, 15) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 16) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 10) (7, 14) (1, 17) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 11) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 19) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 6) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 16) (8, 15) (8, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) from least to most. Then, we label the vertices accordingly. Let's proceed with this method:

Node 17 (Degree 2) -> L1
Node 7 (Degree 2) -> L2
Node 1 (Degree 2) -> L3
Node 19 (Degree 2) -> L4
Node 8 (Degree 2) -> L5
Node 0 (Degree 2) -> L6
Node 6 (Degree 3) -> L7
Node 18 (Degree 4) -> L8
Node 4 (Degree 4) -> L9
Node 5 (Degree 4) -> L10
Node 11 (Degree 4) -> L11
Node 12 (Degree 4) -> L12
Node 14 (Degree 4) -> L13
Node 2 (Degree 4) -> L14
Node 16 (Degree 4) -> L15
Node 3 (Degree 5) -> L16
Node 9 (Degree 5) -> L17
Node 13 (Degree 5) -> L18
Node 15 (Degree 5) -> L19
Node 10 (Degree 5) -> L20

Now, let's find the triangles based on the ordering method:
