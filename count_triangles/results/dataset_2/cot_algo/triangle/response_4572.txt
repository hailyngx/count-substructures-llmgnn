Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 10 nodes using the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 0), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 2), (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 3), (8, 2), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 3), (2, 1), (2, 7), (0, 7)

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections) from least to most:

Nodes: 1, 7, 8, 3, 0, 9, 5, 2, 4, 6

Next, we will start counting the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (1, 6): Both 1 and 6 have only 1 connection.
2. Edge (7, 2): Both 7 and 2 have only 2 connections.
3. Edge (8, 2): Proceed because 8 (2 connections) < 2 (3 connections). Shared connections: 5.
4. Edge (3, 0): Proceed because 3 (2 connections) < 0 (3 connections). Shared connections: 4.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2] which are <1, 2, 5> and <0, 3, 4>.
