Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in increasing order and relabeling them accordingly. The vertices will be relabeled as follows:
Vertex 0: Degree 4
Vertex 1: Degree 5
Vertex 2: Degree 5
Vertex 3: Degree 4
Vertex 4: Degree 4
Vertex 5: Degree 3
Vertex 6: Degree 3
Vertex 7: Degree 2
Vertex 8: Degree 3
Vertex 9: Degree 2
Vertex 10: Degree 4
Vertex 11: Degree 3
Vertex 12: Degree 4
Vertex 13: Degree 2
Vertex 14: Degree 3
Vertex 15: Degree 3
Vertex 16: Degree 2
Vertex 17: Degree 4
Vertex 18: Degree 1
Vertex 19: Degree 3
Vertex 20: Degree 2
Vertex 21: Degree 3
Vertex 22: Degree 3
Vertex 23: Degree 3
Vertex 24: Degree 4
Vertex 25: Degree 5
Vertex 26: Degree 2
Vertex 27: Degree 2
Vertex 28: Degree 2
Vertex 29: Degree 3

After relabeling the vertices, we can count the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 2> (Connected: 0-1, 0-2, 1-2)
- Triangle <0, 1, 4> (Connected: 0-1, 0-4, 1-4)
- Triangle <0, 1, 24> (Connected: 0-1, 0-24, 1-24)
- Triangle <1, 2, 17> (Connected: 1-2, 1-17, 2-17)
- Triangle <1, 2, 25> (Connected: 1-2, 1-25, 2-25)
- Triangle <1, 4, 25> (Connected: 1-4, 1-25, 4-25)
- Triangle <1, 10, 3> (Connected: 1-10, 1-3, 3-10)
- Triangle <1, 10, 5> (Connected: 1-10, 1-5, 5-10)
- Triangle <1, 22, 21> (Connected: 1-21, 1-22, 21-22)
- Triangle <2, 8, 17> (Connected: 2-8, 2-17, 8-17)
- Triangle <2, 17, 6> (Connected: 2-17, 2-6, 17-6)
- Triangle <3, 10, 5> (Connected: 3-10, 3-5, 5-10)
- Triangle <4, 10, 25> (Connected: 4-10, 4-25, 10-25)
- Triangle <13, 20, 3> (Connected: 13-20, 13-3, 20-3)
- Triangle <14, 20, 13> (Connected: 14-20, 14-13, 20-13)
