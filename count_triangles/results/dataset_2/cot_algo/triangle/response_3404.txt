Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 2) (1, 24) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 26) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 21) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 27) (7, 13) (20, 25) (20, 3) (20, 24) (25, 7) (25, 20) (25, 29) (12, 0) (27, 7) (27, 23) (27, 17) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (18, 19) (18, 23) (11, 8) (11, 28) (11, 29) (11, 15) (28, 11) (28, 22) (3, 20) (3, 23) (5, 13) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 16) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 26) (15, 24) (14, 26) (14, 22) (14, 9) (26, 21) (26, 15) (26, 14) (26, 23) (26, 17) (19, 18) (19, 0) (22, 28) (22, 14) (22, 6) (23, 27) (23, 18) (23, 3) (23, 26) (29, 25) (29, 11) (17, 27) (17, 26) (17, 16) (16, 8) (16, 10) (16, 17) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 22) (9, 14) (9, 24) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 19) (24, 1) (24, 20) (24, 15) (24, 9) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the nodes based on their number of connections is as follows:
Node 12 (Degree: 1)  
Node 5 (Degree: 2)  
Node 18 (Degree: 2)  
Node 2 (Degree: 2)  
Node 19 (Degree: 2)  
Node 9 (Degree: 2)  
Node 10 (Degree: 3)  
Node 22 (Degree: 3)  
Node 3 (Degree: 3)  
Node 21 (Degree: 3)  
Node 28 (Degree: 3)  
Node 29 (Degree: 3)  
Node 4 (Degree: 4)  
Node 8 (Degree: 4)  
Node 20 (Degree: 4)  
Node 23 (Degree: 4)  
Node 1 (Degree: 4)  
Node 7 (Degree: 5)  
Node 27 (Degree: 5)  
Node 17 (Degree: 5)  
Node 6 (Degree: 6)  
Node 14 (Degree: 6)  
Node 16 (Degree: 6)  
Node 13 (Degree: 6)  
Node 24 (Degree: 6)  
Node 15 (Degree: 6)  
Node 26 (Degree: 7)  
Node 11 (Degree: 7)  
Node 0 (Degree: 7)  

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Number of triangles: 36]
