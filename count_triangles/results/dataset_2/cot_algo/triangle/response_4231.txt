Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 16) (3, 13) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 15) (17, 0) (17, 18) (10, 15) (10, 14) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 12) (13, 3) (13, 11) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 11) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 14) (18, 5) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 0) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 19) (14, 11) (12, 15) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 17) (0, 18) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 5, 2, 10, 12, 13, 17, 19, 3, 16, 18, 1, 4, 15, 7, 6, 8, 11, 14, 9, 0.

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Only considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
  - Checking edge (5, 9): Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 9 and 18, while vertex 9 is connected to vertices 5, 6, 0, and 14. There is one triangle: <5, 9, 18>.
  - Checking edge (9, 6): Vertex 9 is connected to vertices 6, 5, 0, and 14, while vertex 6 is connected to vertices 9, 7, and 8. There are no triangles.
  - Checking edge (9, 0): Vertex 9 is connected to vertices 0, 6, 14, and 5, while vertex 0 is connected to vertices 1, 17, 18, and 9. There is one triangle: <0, 9, 17>.
  - Checking edge (6, 7): Vertex 6 is connected to vertices 7, 9, and 8, while vertex 7 is connected to vertices 6, 4, 15, and 8. There is one triangle: <6, 7, 8>.
  - Checking edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2, 0, while vertex 2 is connected to vertices 1 and 11. There are no triangles.
  - Checking edge (3, 16): Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 16, 13, while vertex 16 is connected to vertices 3, 4, 8, and 12. There is one triangle: <3, 16, 4>.
  - Checking edge (4, 7): Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 7, 16, 11, and 6, while vertex 7 is connected to vertices 6, 4, 15, and 8. There is one triangle: <4, 7, 6>.
  - Checking edge (17, 0): Vertex 17 is connected to vertices 0, 18, while vertex 0 is connected to vertices 1, 17, 18, and 9. There is one triangle: <0, 17, 18>.
- Total number of triangles: [4]

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
