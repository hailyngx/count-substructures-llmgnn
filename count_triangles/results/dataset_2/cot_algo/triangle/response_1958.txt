Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 4) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 11) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 4) (10, 5) (10, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, relabeling the vertices accordingly. 

After sorting the nodes by the number of edges connected to each node, the new labels for the nodes are:
Node 0 has 3 edges
Node 3 has 4 edges
Node 7 has 4 edges
Node 11 has 3 edges
Node 14 has 4 edges
Node 6 has 5 edges
Node 12 has 4 edges
Node 2 has 5 edges
Node 8 has 5 edges
Node 10 has 2 edges
Node 13 has 5 edges
Node 1 has 6 edges
Node 5 has 4 edges
Node 9 has 4 edges
Node 4 has 6 edges

Now, we will list the unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 2, 1>
<3, 8, 2>
<3, 8, 1>
<7, 8, 2>
<14, 12, 2>
<6, 12, 1>
<6, 2, 1>
<6, 8, 1>
<12, 8, 1>

There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
