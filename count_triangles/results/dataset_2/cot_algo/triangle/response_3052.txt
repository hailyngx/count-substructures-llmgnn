Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are as follows:
Vertex 4 -> degree 2
Vertex 2 -> degree 2
Vertex 5 -> degree 3
Vertex 8 -> degree 4
Vertex 1 -> degree 4
Vertex 9 -> degree 4
Vertex 7 -> degree 5
Vertex 0 -> degree 6
Vertex 3 -> degree 6
Vertex 6 -> degree 6

By considering the edges in the correct order (from lower labeled vertex to higher labeled vertex with fewer connections), we can count the number of triangles formed:
1. From edge (2, 4): <2, 4, 5>
2. From edge (2, 8): None
3. From edge (4, 1): <1, 4, 5>
4. From edge (4, 5): None
5. From edge (5, 3): <3, 5, 7>
6. From edge (8, 2): None
7. From edge (8, 5): None
8. From edge (1, 9): <1, 5, 7>
9. From edge (9, 6): None
10. From edge (5, 7): None
11. From edge (0, 1): <0, 1, 3>
12. From edge (0, 9): None
13. From edge (0, 3): None
14. From edge (0, 6): None

Total number of triangles: [4]
Triangles found: <2, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 7>, <0, 1, 3>
