Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 16) (22, 20) (6, 13) (6, 21) (9, 2) (9, 15) (1, 7) (3, 28) (3, 20) (3, 16) (14, 21) (17, 13) (17, 25) (21, 6) (21, 14) (21, 28) (21, 18) (28, 3) (28, 21) (28, 12) (28, 27) (28, 15) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 26) (11, 15) (18, 21) (18, 26) (18, 20) (18, 0) (26, 11) (26, 18) (26, 10) (26, 8) (7, 1) (7, 11) (25, 17) (25, 24) (23, 11) (23, 2) (23, 0) (8, 26) (8, 24) (8, 10) (19, 4) (15, 9) (15, 28) (15, 11) (2, 9) (2, 23) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 27) (12, 28) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 24) (10, 26) (10, 8) (10, 27) (10, 4) (10, 29) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 24) (24, 25) (24, 8) (24, 12) (24, 5) (4, 19) (4, 10) (29, 10) (29, 0) (0, 18) (0, 23) (0, 29) (20, 22) (20, 3) (20, 18) (20, 16) (16, 22) (16, 3) (16, 20) (27, 28) (27, 2) (27, 10) 

Response:
The degree of each node is as follows:  
Node 0: 4  
Node 1: 2  
Node 2: 6  
Node 3: 4  
Node 4: 3  
Node 5: 3  
Node 6: 3  
Node 7: 2  
Node 8: 4  
Node 9: 2  
Node 10: 5  
Node 11: 4  
Node 12: 4  
Node 13: 3  
Node 14: 2  
Node 15: 4  
Node 16: 3  
Node 17: 2  
Node 18: 4  
Node 19: 1  
Node 20: 4  
Node 21: 5  
Node 22: 3  
Node 23: 3  
Node 24: 4  
Node 25: 2  
Node 26: 4  
Node 27: 3  
Node 28: 5  
Node 29: 2  

After relabeling the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order, we get:
Nodes in order: 19 1 7 25 14 9 17 4 5 6 13 23 16 27 0 11 18 22 24 2 3 12 26 8 10 15 28 21 29 20  

Now, we can count the triangles based on the given edges:
Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles found: <2, 9, 15>, <2, 12, 24>, <2, 23, 0>, <2, 23, 11>, <9, 11, 15>, <11, 15, 28>, <18, 20, 21>, <18, 20, 26>, <20, 26, 21>
