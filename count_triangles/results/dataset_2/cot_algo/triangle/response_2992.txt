Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 1) (17, 5) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 1) (18, 19) (18, 15) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 19) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 1) (15, 18) (15, 10) (15, 6) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 12) (7, 16) (7, 2) (7, 10) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 19) (12, 3) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 12) (9, 11) (1, 16) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 19) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 16) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (3, 12) (3, 19) (4, 11) (4, 12) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 17) (6, 11) (6, 15) (6, 19) (7, 10) (7, 16) (8, 11) (10, 15) (10, 17) (11, 9) (12, 13) (12, 19) (13, 19) (15, 18) (16, 17) (18, 19)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degree in non-decreasing order: 

Nodes by degree: {0, 7, 8, 9, 17, 18, 13, 16, 2, 5, 15, 3, 4, 10, 6, 12, 1, 19, 11}

Based on the given edges and the relabeled nodes, we find that the number of triangles in the graph is [8].

Unique triangles: <4, 11, 12>, <1, 5, 12>, <1, 12, 19>, <3, 12, 19>, <10, 15, 17>, <6, 11, 15>, <1, 10, 16>, <5, 12, 17>
