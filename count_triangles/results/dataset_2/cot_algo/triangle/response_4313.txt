Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: 9, 7, 5, 8, 1, 2
- 1: 8, 0, 2
- 2: 9, 0, 3, 5, 1
- 3: 9, 4, 8, 2
- 4: 9, 7, 5, 3
- 5: 4, 0, 8, 2
- 6: 7
- 7: 6, 4, 0
- 8: 9, 0, 5, 3, 1
- 9: 8, 4, 2, 3, 0

Next, we need to sort the nodes based on their degrees from least to most connections and relabel them accordingly:

Sorted nodes: 6, 1, 7, 5, 4, 8, 3, 2, 0, 9

Now, we will analyze each edge in the graph, starting with the edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. 

Edge (6, 7) is skipped because both vertices have the same degree.
Edge (9, 8) forms triangle <9, 8, 0>.
Edge (9, 4) forms triangle <9, 4, 7>.
Edge (9, 2) forms triangle <9, 2, 0>.
Edge (9, 3) forms triangle <9, 3, 0>.
Edge (9, 0) forms triangle <9, 0, 2>.
Edge (4, 9) is skipped because vertex 4 has more connections.
Edge (4, 7) forms triangle <4, 7, 0> and <4, 7, 6>.
Edge (4, 5) forms triangle <4, 5, 0> and <4, 5, 2>.
Edge (4, 3) forms triangle <4, 3, 9> and <4, 3, 8>.
Edge (7, 6) is skipped because both vertices have the same degree.
Edge (7, 4) forms triangle <7, 4, 0>.
Edge (7, 0) forms triangle <7, 0, 8> and <7, 0, 5>.
Edge (0, 9) forms triangle <0, 9, 2> and <0, 9, 8>.
Edge (0, 7) forms triangle <0, 7, 4>.
Edge (0, 5) forms triangle <0, 5, 4> and <0, 5, 8>.
Edge (0, 8) forms triangle <0, 8, 5> and <0, 8, 1>.
Edge (0, 1) is skipped because vertex 0 has more connections.
Edge (0, 2) forms triangle <0, 2, 9> and <0, 2, 5>.
Edge (8, 9) forms triangle <8, 9, 0>.
Edge (8, 0) forms triangle <8, 0, 5>.
Edge (8, 5) forms triangle <8, 5, 0> and <8, 5, 4>.
Edge (8, 3) forms triangle <8, 3, 4> and <8, 3, 9>.
Edge (8, 1) forms triangle <8, 1, 0>.
Edge (3, 9) forms triangle <3, 9, 0> and <3, 9, 2>.
Edge (3, 4) forms triangle <3, 4, 9> and <3, 4, 5>.
Edge (3, 8) forms triangle <3, 8, 0>.
Edge (3, 2) is skipped because vertex 2 has more connections.
Edge (2, 9) forms triangle <2, 9, 0>.
Edge (2, 0) forms triangle <2, 0, 9>.
Edge (2, 5) forms triangle <2, 5, 0> and <2, 5, 4>.
Edge (2, 1) forms triangle <2, 1, 0>.
Edge (5, 4) forms triangle <5, 4, 0> and <5, 4, 8>.
Edge (5, 0) forms triangle <5, 0, 4> and <5, 0, 8>.
Edge (5, 8) forms triangle <5, 8, 0> and <5, 8, 4>.
Edge (5, 2) forms triangle <5, 2, 0> and <5, 2, 4>.
Edge (1, 0) is skipped because vertex 0 has more connections.
Edge (1, 8) forms triangle <1, 8, 0>.
Edge (1, 2) forms triangle <1, 2, 0>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [23].

Unique triangles found:
<9, 8, 0>, <9, 4, 7>, <9, 2, 0>, <9, 3, 0>, <9, 0, 2>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 7, 6>, <4, 5, 0>, <4, 5, 2>, <4, 3, 9>, <4, 3, 8>, <7, 4, 0>, <7, 0, 8>, <7, 0, 5>, <0, 9, 2>, <0, 9, 8>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 2, 5>, <8, 9, 0>, <8, 0, 5>, <8, 5, 4>, <8, 3, 4>, <8, 3, 9>, <8, 1, 0>, <3, 9, 0>, <3, 9, 2>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 8, 0>, <2, 9, 0>, <2, 0, 9>, <2, 5, 0>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 1, 0>, <5, 4, 0>, <5, 4, 8>, <5, 0, 4>, <5, 0, 8>, <5, 8, 0>, <5, 8, 4>.
