Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 12) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered 0 to 14.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices based on their degree are:\
Node 5 -> connections: 4 \
Node 6 -> connections: 4 \
Node 2 -> connections: 4 \
Node 8 -> connections: 4 \
Node 11 -> connections: 4 \
Node 0 -> connections: 4 \
Node 12 -> connections: 4 \
Node 13 -> connections: 4 \
Node 10 -> connections: 5 \
Node 7 -> connections: 5 \
Node 1 -> connections: 5 \
Node 3 -> connections: 5 \
Node 9 -> connections: 5 \
Node 4 -> connections: 5 \
Node 14 -> connections: 5

Applying the degree-based ordering to the edges:
(5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) \
(9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) \
(4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 10) \
(6, 2) (12, 6) (13, 2) (0, 13) \
(10, 8) (14, 11) (3, 13) (1, 8)
