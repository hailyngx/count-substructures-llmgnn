Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 11) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 11) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 11) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 4) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections each vertex has. Then relabel the vertices accordingly.

Here is the sorted list of vertices with their respective connections:
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 12: 2 connections
- Node 14: 3 connections
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 13: 5 connections
- Node 11: 5 connections
- Node 10: 5 connections
- Node 8: 5 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 6: 6 connections
- Node 9: 6 connections

Now, we will go through the edges considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Triangle <1, 11, 13>
- Triangle <1, 11, 7>
- Triangle <1, 11, 5>
- Triangle <12, 6, 10>
- Triangle <12, 6, 2>

[Total Number of Triangles: 5]
