Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 27) (22, 28) (0, 27) (0, 16) (0, 29) (27, 22) (27, 0) (6, 28) (6, 14) (6, 25) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 17) (20, 26) (20, 12) (20, 16) (28, 22) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 15) (21, 28) (21, 25) (21, 14) (21, 4) (21, 24) (3, 14) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 1) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 25) (1, 5) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 15) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 23) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 24) (23, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 7) (16, 0) (16, 20) (16, 25) (26, 20) (26, 10) (26, 4) (10, 26) (10, 8) (10, 29) (18, 9) (18, 12) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 21) (14, 3) (14, 2) (29, 0) (29, 10) (12, 20) (12, 3) (12, 18) (12, 15) (7, 2) (7, 15) (7, 8) (15, 28) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 7) (4, 21) (4, 26) (25, 6) (25, 21) (25, 1) (25, 16) (24, 21) (24, 19) (8, 10) (8, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degrees. Let's calculate the degree of each node first.

- Node 0: Degree 3
- Node 1: Degree 4
- Node 2: Degree 3
- Node 3: Degree 3
- Node 4: Degree 3
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 3
- Node 7: Degree 3
- Node 8: Degree 2
- Node 9: Degree 3
- Node 10: Degree 3
- Node 11: Degree 2
- Node 12: Degree 4
- Node 13: Degree 4
- Node 14: Degree 6
- Node 15: Degree 4
- Node 16: Degree 4
- Node 17: Degree 4
- Node 18: Degree 3
- Node 19: Degree 3
- Node 20: Degree 4
- Node 21: Degree 5
- Node 22: Degree 4
- Node 23: Degree 2
- Node 24: Degree 2
- Node 25: Degree 4
- Node 26: Degree 3
- Node 27: Degree 3
- Node 28: Degree 5
- Node 29: Degree 3

Now, let's reorder the nodes based on their degrees from least to most connections:

8, 11, 23, 24, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 18, 19, 26, 27, 9, 29, 12, 16, 17, 20, 13, 22, 25, 1, 28, 15, 21, 14

Following the instructions of the degree-based ordering method, we should only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Let's count the triangles formed by these edges:

- Triangle <0, 16, 20>
- Triangle <0, 16, 25>
- Triangle <0, 27, 22>
- Triangle <0, 29, 10>
- Triangle <1, 11, 9>
- Triangle <2, 13, 14>
- Triangle <3, 12, 18>
- Triangle <4, 21, 2>
- Triangle <4, 21, 24>
- Triangle <4, 26, 20>
- Triangle <5, 1, 17>
- Triangle <5, 19, 13>
- Triangle <5, 19, 24>
- Triangle <6, 14, 3>
- Triangle <6, 14, 21>
- Triangle <6, 25, 16>
- Triangle <6, 25, 21>
- Triangle <7, 2, 14>
- Triangle <8, 7, 15>
- Triangle <8, 10, 26>
- Triangle <8, 7, 2>
- Triangle <9, 11, 1>
- Triangle <9, 17, 1>
- Triangle <9, 18, 12>
- Triangle <10, 26, 20>
- Triangle <10, 29, 0>
- Triangle <12, 18, 9>
- Triangle <12, 15, 7>
- Triangle <12, 15, 28>
- Triangle <13, 22, 27>
- Triangle <14, 2, 13>
- Triangle <14, 6, 21>
- Triangle <15, 12, 18>
- Triangle <15, 17, 1>
- Triangle <15, 17, 9>
- Triangle <15, 28, 21>
- Triangle <16, 0, 27>
- Triangle <16, 6, 25>
- Triangle <16, 20, 26>
- Triangle <17, 1, 11>
- Triangle <17, 9, 18>
- Triangle <17, 9, 11>
- Triangle <18, 9, 11>
- Triangle <19, 5, 23>
- Triangle <20, 26, 10>
