Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 18) (4, 13) (4, 18) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 19) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 15) (0, 17) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 4) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 2) (6, 12) (6, 5) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 16) (9, 3) (9, 8) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 11) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 10) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 15) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 11) (17, 0) (10, 7) (10, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently. Let's follow the steps:
1. Count the degrees of each node:
   - Node 0: degree 4
   - Node 1: degree 4
   - Node 2: degree 3
   - Node 3: degree 3
   - Node 4: degree 3
   - Node 5: degree 3
   - Node 6: degree 2
   - Node 7: degree 5
   - Node 8: degree 2
   - Node 9: degree 2
   - Node 10: degree 2
   - Node 11: degree 4
   - Node 12: degree 3
   - Node 13: degree 4
   - Node 15: degree 4
   - Node 16: degree 4
   - Node 17: degree 1
   - Node 18: degree 4
   - Node 19: degree 5

2. Sort the nodes based on their degrees in non-decreasing order:
   Lowest degree to highest degree: 17, 8, 9, 10, 6, 2, 4, 3, 12, 5, 13, 0, 1, 15, 16, 11, 18, 7, 19

3. Start counting triangles where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
   - Triangles <0, 1, 13> and <1, 13, 18> are found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. Each triangle is listed only once as <0, 1, 13> and <1, 13, 18>.
