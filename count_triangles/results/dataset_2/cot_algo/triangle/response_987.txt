Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 10) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 18) (10, 9) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 7) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 14) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 15) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 1) (14, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 18) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 2) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 17) (17, 9) (17, 19) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 15) (7, 13) (16, 15) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 16) 

Response:
The given graph's edges can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 20
Edges: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 10) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 18) (10, 9) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 7) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 14) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 15) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 1) (14, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 18) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 2) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 17) (17, 9) (17, 19) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 15) (7, 13) (16, 15) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 16)

Now let's find the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Sorted vertices based on the number of connections (degrees):
0(4), 1(3), 7(1), 16(1), 18(3), 2(3), 14(2), 17(2), 19(3), 3(4), 5(4), 9(4), 10(2), 6(4), 11(4), 13(3), 8(3), 12(3), 15(4), 4(4)

Triangles found using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 11>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 4, 14>, <1, 3, 0>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 14>, <2, 6, 3>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 18>, <5, 6, 11>, <5, 6, 15>, <5, 11, 13>, <5, 11, 15>, <5, 11, 19>, <6, 9, 10>, <6, 9, 17>, <6, 9, 18>, <6, 10, 9>, <6, 11, 5>, <6, 11, 13>, <6, 15, 5>, <9, 10, 11>, <9, 17, 19>, <9, 18, 3>, <9, 18, 6>, <10, 9, 17>, <10, 11, 5>, <10, 11, 13>, <11, 13, 5>, <13, 7, 8>, <13, 8, 12>, <15, 8, 12>, <15, 8, 13>, <15, 8, 16>
