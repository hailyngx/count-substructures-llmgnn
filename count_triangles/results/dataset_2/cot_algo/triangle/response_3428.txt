Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (3, 8) (3, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 6) (4, 2) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: 
- 0: {9, 13, 7, 12, 10, 6}
- 1: {7, 11, 10, 2}
- 2: {4, 1, 6}
- 3: {8, 11}
- 4: {2}
- 5: {9, 13, 8, 11}
- 6: {8, 7, 0, 10, 14, 2}
- 7: {9, 12, 0, 6, 1}
- 8: {5, 9, 14, 6, 3}
- 9: {5, 8, 7, 0}
- 10: {12, 0, 6, 1}
- 11: {5, 12, 3, 14, 1}
- 12: {7, 10, 0, 11}
- 13: {5, 14, 0}
- 14: {8, 13, 11, 6}

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by their degrees (in ascending order):
{4, 3, 10, 2, 12, 1, 13, 0, 9, 7, 14, 6, 11, 8, 5}

Triangles found:
[9] <5, 11, 8>
