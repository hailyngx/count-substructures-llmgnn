Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 17) (5, 15) (6, 2) (6, 19) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 8) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 3) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 18) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 11) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 17) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 15) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 12) (14, 18) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (2, 6) (15, 7) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 9) (9, 15) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 14) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently in this graph. Let's first sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 18: 5 connections
Node 19: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 15: 6 connections
Node 17: 6 connections
Node 16: 6 connections
Node 10: 6 connections
Node 4: 6 connections

Now, let's count the triangles:
