Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. The sorted list of vertices with their degrees is as follows:
```
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 5: Degree 5
```

Now, we will go through each edge to count the triangles. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

1. Edge: (1, 0)
   Vertices: 1, 0
   Check for shared connections: None

2. Edge: (9, 4)
   Vertices: 9, 4
   Check for shared connections: None

3. Edge: (8, 0)
   Vertices: 8, 0
   Check for shared connections: None

4. Edge: (6, 1)
   Vertices: 6, 1
   Check for shared connections: None

5. Edge: (3, 1)
   Vertices: 3, 1
   Check for shared connections: None

6. Edge: (7, 3)
   Vertices: 7, 3
   Check for shared connections: None

7. Edge: (0, 5)
   Vertices: 0, 5
   Check for shared connections: 2

8. Edge: (2, 3)
   Vertices: 2, 3
   Check for shared connections: None

9. Edge: (2, 7)
   Vertices: 2, 7
   Check for shared connections: 3

10. Edge: (2, 8)
    Vertices: 2, 8
    Check for shared connections: None

11. Edge: (0, 2)
    Vertices: 0, 2
    Check for shared connections: 5

[Total number of triangles: 3]
<0, 5, 2>
<2, 7, 3>
<0, 5, 2>
