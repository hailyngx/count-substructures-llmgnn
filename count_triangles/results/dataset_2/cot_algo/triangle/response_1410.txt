Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 8) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 12) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 8) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 2) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections, relabeling them accordingly, and then checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to find triangles.

By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following relabeled vertices:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 6
- Node 8 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 2
- Node 10 has degree 3
- Node 11 has degree 4
- Node 12 has degree 5
- Node 13 has degree 3
- Node 14 has degree 6

With the relabeled vertices, we can now check for triangles using the given edges. 

Here are the unique triangles found:
- <5, 14, 3>
- <4, 14, 3>
- <1, 7, 0>
- <14, 5, 3>
- <0, 7, 1>
- <0, 8, 7>
- <0, 10, 4>
- <4, 10, 2>
- <2, 3, 1>
- <2, 5, 3>
- <2, 13, 6>
- <6, 12, 9>
- <6, 12, 11>
- <6, 13, 7>
- <9, 12, 6>
- <9, 12, 11>
- <7, 13, 2>
- <7, 13, 6>
- <8, 12, 6>
- <8, 12, 11>
- <8, 12, 5>
- <8, 12, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [21].
