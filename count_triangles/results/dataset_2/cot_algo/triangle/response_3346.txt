Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The labels will be rearranged accordingly:
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering and the given edges, we consider each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections to count only unique triangles formed by shared connections. 

The total number of triangles is: [6]

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
