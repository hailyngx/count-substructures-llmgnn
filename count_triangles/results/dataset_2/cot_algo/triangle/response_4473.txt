Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) 

Response:
The given graph with its nodes and edges is represented below:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 0), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 2), (8, 4), (8, 3), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 3), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 1), (2, 4), (2, 1), (2, 7), (7, 5), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 1), (1, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 7), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 6), (3, 7)

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Nodes by degree: 2, 8, 6, 1, 0, 7, 5, 9, 4, 3

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will follow the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles in the graph [9]:
<1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 2>, <1, 7, 3>, <1, 7, 0>, <1, 0, 2>, <1, 0, 7>
