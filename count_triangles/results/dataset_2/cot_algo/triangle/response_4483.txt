Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 21) (6, 24) (6, 10) (9, 8) (9, 15) (1, 20) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 27) (7, 21) (7, 20) (21, 6) (21, 7) (21, 23) (21, 5) (21, 22) (10, 6) (10, 17) (10, 27) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 27) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 16) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 22) (8, 18) (29, 5) (24, 6) (24, 26) (26, 24) (26, 15) (16, 4) (16, 28) (16, 15) (28, 16) (28, 13) (28, 18) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 20) (12, 17) (12, 2) (2, 12) (2, 22) (2, 13) (2, 25) (22, 21) (22, 8) (22, 2) (11, 14) (11, 25) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 5) (23, 21) (23, 10) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 5) (15, 9) (15, 26) (15, 16) (15, 0) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 19) (27, 3) (27, 10) (27, 17) (18, 8) (18, 28) (18, 14) (18, 13) (25, 2) (25, 11) (13, 28) (13, 2) (13, 18) (5, 21) (5, 29) (5, 14) (5, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The list of vertices and their connections are as follows:

0: 1, 3, 5
1: 0, 20
2: 12, 13, 22, 25
3: 0, 14, 27
4: 8, 16, 19
5: 0, 5, 14, 21, 29
6: 10, 21, 24
7: 20, 21
8: 4, 8, 9, 18, 19, 22
9: 8, 15
10: 6, 10, 17, 23, 27
11: 14, 25
12: 2, 17
13: 2, 18, 28
14: 3, 5, 11, 18
15: 9, 15, 16, 26
16: 4, 15, 28
17: 10, 12, 17, 27
18: 8, 13, 14, 18, 28
19: 4, 8, 16, 20
20: 1, 7, 19, 20
21: 5, 6, 7, 21, 22, 23
22: 2, 8, 21
23: 10, 21, 23
24: 6, 24, 26
25: 2, 11, 25
26: 15, 24, 26
27: 3, 10, 17, 27
28: 13, 16, 18, 28
29: 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the count of triangles in the graph is [144]. 

Unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 1, 20>
<0, 3, 14>
<0, 5, 21>
<0, 15, 26>
<3, 14, 18>
<3, 27, 10>
<4, 8, 19>
<5, 14, 21>
<5, 21, 22>
<8, 18, 13>
<10, 17, 12>
<15, 9, 15>
<15, 26, 24>
<18, 14, 5>
<18, 28, 13>
<21, 5, 29>
<22, 21, 23>
<27, 3, 0>
