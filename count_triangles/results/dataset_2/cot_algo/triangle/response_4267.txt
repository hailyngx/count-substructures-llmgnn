Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: {4, 7, 3, 8, 5, 9}
- 1: {4, 7, 3, 6, 9}
- 2: {4, 8, 5, 6, 9}
- 3: {1, 8, 0, 9}
- 4: {7, 0, 1, 2}
- 5: {7, 2, 0}
- 6: {1, 2}
- 7: {4, 0, 5, 1}
- 8: {3, 2, 0}
- 9: {1, 3, 2, 0}

Now, let's count the triangles:

Triangles: [<0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 9>, <4, 7, 0>]

Total number of triangles: [5]
