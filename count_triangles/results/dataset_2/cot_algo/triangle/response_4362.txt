Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 12) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 9) (16, 6) (4, 16) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 0) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 6) (6, 16) (6, 4) (6, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 15) (10, 15) (15, 0) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 14) (17, 16) (17, 13) (18, 8) (19, 7) (19, 3) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 2) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 15) (14, 8) (14, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. Here is the list of vertices with their corresponding degrees:

- Node 2: Degree 2
- Node 18: Degree 2
- Node 14: Degree 3
- Node 10: Degree 2
- Node 19: Degree 2
- Node 17: Degree 2
- Node 12: Degree 3
- Node 1: Degree 3
- Node 0: Degree 4
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 4
- Node 8: Degree 4
- Node 13: Degree 4
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 5: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 5
- Node 11: Degree 3
- Node 9: Degree 3
- Node 15: Degree 3
- Node 16: Degree 4
