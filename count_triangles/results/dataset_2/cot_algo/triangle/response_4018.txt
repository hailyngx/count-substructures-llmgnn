Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 5) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 3) (6, 12) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 18) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 18) (7, 9) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 4) (1, 14) (1, 19) (1, 9) (1, 12) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 18) (9, 3) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 9) (18, 13) (3, 5) (3, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 15) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 13) (13, 18) (13, 14) (13, 12) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 4) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 15)
