Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 4) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 9) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 19) (3, 11) (3, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 17) (5, 19) (5, 17) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 13) (1, 18) (1, 7) (1, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 15) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 16) (15, 6) (15, 13) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 15) (16, 18) (16, 9) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 17) (12, 18) (17, 7) (17, 5) (17, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. Then, we'll relabel the vertices accordingly.  

From the provided graph and edge list, the degrees of each node are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 6
- Node 12: degree 1
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 4

Vertices with sorted labels and degrees:
- Node 12: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we identify the triangles using the connections:
- <13, 10, 19>
- <13, 15, 6>
- <7, 4, 17>
- <3, 11, 0>
- <0, 8, 6>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
