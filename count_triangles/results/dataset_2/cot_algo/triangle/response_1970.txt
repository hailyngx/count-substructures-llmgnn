Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 5) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 13) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 12) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order first. Then we need to relabel the nodes accordingly to ensure we start with the node with the least connections.

The nodes with their respective degrees are as follows:
Node 6: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 4: degree 5
Node 8: degree 4
Node 2: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 14: degree 5
Node 3: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 7: degree 6
Node 12: degree 3
Node 5: degree 5
Node 1: degree 2
Node 13: degree 5
Node 10: degree 4

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 10: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 14: degree 5
Node 13: degree 5
Node 7: degree 6

Next, we will check each edge, making sure to only count triangles where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

The triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 14>
<3, 10, 12>
<3, 10, 13>
<3, 10, 14>
<3, 13, 12>
<3, 13, 14>
<3, 14, 12>
<3, 14, 13>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 14>
<1, 7, 5>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 8, 5>
<1, 8, 7>
<7, 11, 0>
<7, 11, 3>
<7, 11, 14>
<7, 11, 1>
<7, 11, 5>
<7, 1, 5>
<7, 1, 8>
<7, 1, 14>
<7, 5, 8>
<7, 5, 14>
<7, 8, 5>
<12, 10, 3>
<12, 10, 13>
<12, 10, 14>
<12, 13, 3>
<12, 13, 14>
<12, 14, 3>
<12, 14, 10>
<12, 14, 13>
<5, 10, 3>
<5, 10, 12>
<5, 10, 13>
<5, 10, 14>
<5, 12, 3>
<5, 12, 14>
<5, 12, 10>
<5, 12, 13>
<5, 13, 3>
<5, 13, 10>
<5, 13, 14>
<5, 13, 12>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [48].
