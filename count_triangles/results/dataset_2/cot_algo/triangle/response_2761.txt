Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 14) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 7) (2, 18) (2, 9) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 17) (0, 5) (14, 16) (14, 9) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 19) (12, 16) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 19) (6, 1) (6, 19) (6, 13) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 3) (19, 3) (19, 1) (19, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 15) (5, 10) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (10, 1) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 8) (17, 18) (13, 6) (13, 15) (13, 9) 

Response:
The given graph has the following edges:
(11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 14) (4, 8) (4, 18) 
(4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 17) (2, 9) (18, 17) (0, 5) (3, 19) (1, 6) (1, 10) 
(6, 13) (5, 15) (9, 14) 

Now, let's construct the graph to visualize it better:

```
   0 -- 5
   |    |
   11---7
  /| \ /|
 5 |  3 |
   | /| |
   |/ | |
   17--8
     \ |
      \| 
       16--12
         |
         14--9--2
             |
             18
             |
             4--15
             |   |
             1---10
              \  |
               \ |
                6--13
```

Next, we will relabel the nodes according to their degrees (number of connections):

Nodes sorted by degree (lowest to highest): 
0, 2, 9, 10, 13, 14, 19, 12, 3, 18, 6, 5, 7, 15, 16, 8, 1, 17, 11, 4

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 13]

<0, 5, 11>
<0, 5, 15>
<0, 11, 17>
<0, 5, 15>
<0, 7, 11>
<2, 4, 18>
<2, 9, 18>
<2, 9, 14>
<10, 1, 6>
<13, 6, 19>
<13, 9, 14>
<13, 9, 6>
<13, 15, 5>
