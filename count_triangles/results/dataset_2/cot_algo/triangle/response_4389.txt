Now let's calculate the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted by degree:
0(3), 2(1), 14(2), 3(2), 11(3), 5(3), 13(2), 10(2), 12(3), 1(3), 9(3), 4(4), 17(4), 19(4), 7(4), 16(3), 18(3), 8(4), 6(3), 15(4)

Triangles found: [<0, 3, 6>, <0, 15, 14>, <0, 15, 19>, <0, 3, 18>, <2, 10, 7>, <2, 10, 12>, <2, 10, 19>, <14, 15, 8>, <14, 13, 18>, <3, 0, 6>, <11, 12, 4>, <11, 5, 4>, <11, 5, 17>, <5, 17, 6>, <13, 18, 16>, <13, 18, 14>, <7, 10, 2>, <7, 10, 12>, <7, 10, 19>, <7, 12, 4>, <7, 12, 11>, <7, 12, 19>, <7, 12, 5>, <7, 19, 8>, <7, 19, 15>, <7, 19, 1>, <7, 19, 8>, <12, 11, 4>, <12, 11, 5>, <12, 4, 9>, <12, 4, 11>, <12, 4, 5>, <15, 0, 6>, <13, 18, 16>, <13, 18, 14>, <17, 16, 18>, <19, 1, 8>, <19, 1, 16>, <19, 1, 19>, <19, 1, 15>, <19, 15, 14>, <0, 15, 8>, <0, 15, 19>, <8, 19, 15>, <8, 19, 1>]
