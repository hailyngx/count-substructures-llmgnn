Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
The ordered list of nodes based on their number of connections is: 4, 7, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 0, 2, 9.

Based on the edges given, we can identify the triangles formed:

- Triangles including node 4: None
- Triangles including node 7: <1, 7, 9>
- Triangles including node 1: <7, 1, 9>
- Triangles including node 3: None
- Triangles including node 5: <1, 5, 8>
- Triangles including node 6: <1, 6, 8>
- Triangles including node 8: <1, 8, 2>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 8>
- Triangles including node 0: None
- Triangles including node 2: None
- Triangles including node 9: None

Total number of triangles: [15]
