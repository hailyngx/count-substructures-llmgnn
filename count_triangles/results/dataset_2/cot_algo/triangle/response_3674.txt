Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:
```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
0: 7, 2, 8, 3, 1
1: 5, 9, 2, 8, 0
2: 9, 4, 0, 1, 3
3: 4, 2, 8, 0
4: 5, 7, 3, 2
5: 9, 6, 1, 4, 7
6: 5, 8
7: 5, 4, 0
8: 6, 0, 3, 1
9: 5, 2, 1
```

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:
```
Nodes by Degree: 
6, 9, 7, 8, 3, 0, 4, 1, 2, 5
```

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:
- For the edge (5, 9), since 5 has more connections than 9, we won't consider this edge.
- For the edge (5, 6), since 5 has more connections than 6, we won't consider this edge.
- For the edge (5, 1), since 5 has more connections than 1, we won't consider this edge.
- For the edge (5, 4), since 5 has more connections than 4, we won't consider this edge.
- For the edge (5, 7), since 5 has more connections than 7, we won't consider this edge.
- For the edge (9, 2), since 9 has more connections than 2, we won't consider this edge.
- For the edge (9, 1), since 9 has more connections than 1, we won't consider this edge.
- For the edge (4, 7), since 4 has more connections than 7, we won't consider this edge.
- For the edge (4, 3), since 4 has more connections than 3, we won't consider this edge.
- For the edge (7, 0), since 7 has more connections than 0, we won't consider this edge.
- For the edge (6, 8), since 6 has more connections than 8, we won't consider this edge.
- For the edge (2, 3), we have a triangle <2, 3, 4>.
- For the edge (8, 0), since 8 has more connections than 0, we won't consider this edge.
- For the edge (0, 1), we have a triangle <0, 1, 5>.
- For the edge (3, 2), we have a triangle <2, 3, 4>.
- For the edge (3, 8), since 3 has more connections than 8, we won't consider this edge.

Total triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <2, 3, 4>, <0, 1, 5>
