Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 12) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 10) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. Here, we have the following degrees for each node:

Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 7
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 5
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 5
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 5

Based on the degree-based ordering, the vertices are relabeled as follows:
Node 0 -> A
Node 1 -> B
Node 2 -> C
Node 3 -> D
Node 4 -> E
Node 5 -> F
Node 6 -> G
Node 7 -> H
Node 8 -> I
Node 9 -> J
Node 10 -> K
Node 11 -> L
Node 12 -> M
Node 13 -> N
Node 14 -> O

By following the method for counting triangles, we can find the number of triangles in the graph. After counting, the total number of triangles inside brackets [] is 12.

The unique triangles found are:
<E, B, O>
<E, B, I>
<B, O, I>
<E, O, N>
<E, O, L>
<E, O, J>
<E, N, L>
<E, L, J>
<O, N, L>
<O, N, J>
<O, L, J>
<I, O, N>
