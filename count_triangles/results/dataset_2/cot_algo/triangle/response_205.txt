Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by degree:
0 (degree: 6), 1 (degree: 4), 4 (degree: 3), 7 (degree: 3), 8 (degree: 3), 3 (degree: 4), 6 (degree: 6), 2 (degree: 4), 5 (degree: 6), 9 (degree: 4)
