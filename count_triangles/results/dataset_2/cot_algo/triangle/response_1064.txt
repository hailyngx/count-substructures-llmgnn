Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 15) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 14) (19, 4) (19, 10) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 7) (4, 19) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 6) (1, 2) (6, 12) (6, 14) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 16) (7, 2) (7, 17) (7, 9) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 16) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 11) (15, 8) (18, 14) (18, 10) (10, 19) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 18) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
Node 2 (degree 3)
Node 1 (degree 2)
Node 7 (degree 3)
Node 8 (degree 2)
Node 15 (degree 1)
Node 5 (degree 3)
Node 17 (degree 3)
Node 3 (degree 2)
Node 13 (degree 6)
Node 12 (degree 4)
Node 9 (degree 5)
Node 14 (degree 5)
Node 19 (degree 2)
Node 4 (degree 5)
Node 0 (degree 4)
Node 6 (degree 3)
Node 11 (degree 4)
Node 18 (degree 3)
Node 10 (degree 5)
Node 16 (degree 2)

2. Based on the ordering, we will analyze the edges to count the triangles:

- From (2, 8): No triangle
- From (2, 1): No triangle
- From (2, 7): No triangle
- From (8, 15): No triangle
- From (8, 15): No triangle
- From (5, 13): Triangle <5, 13, 17>
- From (5, 17): Triangle <5, 13, 17>
- From (5, 3): No triangle
- From (13, 17): Triangle <5, 13, 17>
- From (13, 17): Triangle <5, 13, 17>
- From (13, 12): Triangle <4, 12, 13>
- From (13, 9): No triangle
- From (13, 14): Triangle <10, 13, 14>
- From (19, 4): No triangle
- From (19, 10): No triangle
- From (17, 5): Triangle <5, 13, 17>
- From (17, 13): Triangle <5, 13, 17>
- From (17, 7): Triangle <7, 9, 17>
- From (4, 19): No triangle
- From (4, 12): Triangle <4, 12, 13>
- From (4, 9): Triangle <4, 9, 13>
- From (4, 0): Triangle <0, 4, 12>
- From (4, 10): No triangle
- From (12, 13): Triangle <4, 12, 13>
- From (12, 4): Triangle <4, 12, 13>
- From (12, 0): Triangle <0, 4, 12>
- From (12, 6): No triangle
- From (1, 2): No triangle
- From (6, 12): Triangle <4, 12, 6>
- From (6, 14): No triangle
- From (11, 14): Triangle <11, 14, 10>
- From (11, 0): No triangle
- From (11, 9): No triangle
- From (14, 13): Triangle <10, 13, 14>
- From (14, 6): No triangle
- From (14, 11): Triangle <11, 14, 10>
- From (14, 18): No triangle
- From (14, 10): Triangle <10, 13, 14>
- From (3, 5): No triangle
- From (3, 16): No triangle
- From (7, 2): No triangle
- From (7, 17): Triangle <7, 9, 17>
- From (7, 9): Triangle <7, 9, 17>
- From (9, 13): No triangle
- From (9, 4): Triangle <4, 9, 13>
- From (9, 11): No triangle
- From (9, 7): Triangle <7, 9, 17>
- From (9, 16): No triangle
- From (0, 4): Triangle <0, 4, 12>
- From (0, 12): Triangle <0, 4, 12>
- From (0, 11): No triangle
- From (15, 8): No triangle
- From (18, 14): No triangle
- From (18, 10): No triangle
- From (10, 19): No triangle
- From (10, 4): No triangle
- From (10, 14): Triangle <10, 13, 14>
- From (10, 18): No triangle
- From (16, 3): No triangle
- From (16, 9): No triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6], and the unique triangles found are <5, 13, 17>, <4, 12, 13>, <10, 13, 14>, <7, 9, 17>, <0, 4, 12>, and <11, 14, 10>.
