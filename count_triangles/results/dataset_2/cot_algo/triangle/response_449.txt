Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 13) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 18) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (4, 12) (4, 17) (18, 6) (18, 17) (19, 8) (19, 15) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 14) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 2) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 2) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 15) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 18) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 14) (14, 16) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the nodes by their degree.

Here are the degrees of each node:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 6
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 5
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 15: degree 4
Node 16: degree 2
Node 17: degree 4
Node 18: degree 3
Node 19: degree 3

By counting triangles based on the sorted vertices and edges provided, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 11, 15>
<2, 15, 19>
<3, 13, 14>
<5, 9, 13>
<5, 9, 15>
<6, 10, 14>
