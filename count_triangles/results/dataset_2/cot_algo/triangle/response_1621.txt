Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 14) (20, 24) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 0) (25, 18) (10, 9) (10, 16) (17, 27) (17, 15) (28, 27) (28, 22) (28, 19) (29, 1) (29, 7) (29, 19) (29, 21) (0, 25) (0, 14) (0, 23) (14, 20) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (1, 29) (1, 26) (1, 13) (26, 1) (26, 15) (26, 21) (26, 6) (9, 10) (9, 22) (9, 3) (22, 28) (22, 9) (22, 6) (5, 25) (5, 8) (19, 28) (19, 29) (19, 3) (19, 13) (2, 6) (2, 11) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 24) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 21) (12, 14) (12, 16) (16, 10) (16, 12) (7, 29) (7, 24) (7, 27) (8, 14) (8, 5) (8, 21) (15, 17) (15, 26) (24, 20) (24, 3) (24, 7) (18, 25) (18, 27) (27, 17) (27, 28) (27, 7) (27, 18) (27, 13) (4, 23) (4, 6) (23, 0) (23, 4) (6, 26) (6, 22) (6, 2) (6, 4) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 27) (21, 29) (21, 26) (21, 11) (21, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees. Based on the provided edges, the degrees for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 5
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 2
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 19: degree 4
- Node 20: degree 3
- Node 21: degree 3
- Node 22: degree 3
- Node 23: degree 2
- Node 24: degree 3
- Node 25: degree 4
- Node 26: degree 4
- Node 27: degree 5
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 29: degree 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will use the following vertex order:
10, 2, 5, 18, 4, 23, 16, 12, 15, 17, 9, 22, 3, 7, 1, 8, 11, 21, 0, 24, 20, 25, 29, 26, 6, 19, 28, 13, 14, 27

Now, we will count the triangles based on the shared connections between the vertices.

After counting, the total number of triangles is: [17]

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 9, 22>
<3, 9, 19>
<3, 13, 27>
<6, 22, 26>
<7, 27, 18>
<9, 22, 28>
<9, 22, 3>
<13, 27, 7>
<13, 27, 18>
<13, 19, 29>
<14, 0, 25>
<14, 11, 21>
<14, 12, 16>
<19, 3, 24>
<19, 13, 27>
<19, 28, 22>
<21, 11, 14>
