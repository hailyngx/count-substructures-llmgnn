Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 6) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 3) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 12) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 1) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Relabeling the vertices accordingly, we get the following graph:

Nodes: 0, 4, 8, 3, 1, 12, 6, 13, 7, 11, 5, 9, 2, 10, 14
Edges:
(0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 8)
(4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 10)
(8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 2)
(3, 7) (3, 13)
(1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 12)
(12, 5)
(6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 2)
(13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 6)
(7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 3)
(11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 1)

Now, let's count the triangles in this graph:
Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <8, 4, 2>, <1, 6, 12>, <6, 1, 11>, <1, 11, 14>
