Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 2) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 19) (10, 11) (10, 7) (2, 15) (2, 8) (18, 14) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 17) (5, 16) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 17) (17, 12) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 9) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 14) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 15) (19, 1) (19, 14) (19, 9) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 6) (14, 19) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 19) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges along with their connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes: 3, 15, 16
- Node 1 is connected to nodes: 3, 6, 11, 19
- Node 2 is connected to nodes: 8, 15
- Node 3 is connected to nodes: 0, 1, 14, 15
- Node 4 is connected to nodes: 8, 9, 12
- Node 5 is connected to nodes: 13, 16
- Node 6 is connected to nodes: 1, 14, 17
- Node 7 is connected to nodes: 9, 10, 12
- Node 8 is connected to nodes: 2, 4
- Node 9 is connected to nodes: 4, 7, 17, 19
- Node 10 is connected to nodes: 7, 11
- Node 11 is connected to nodes: 1, 10, 12, 16
- Node 12 is connected to nodes: 4, 7, 11, 17
- Node 13 is connected to nodes: 5, 17
- Node 14 is connected to nodes: 3, 6, 18, 19
- Node 15 is connected to nodes: 0, 2, 3
- Node 16 is connected to nodes: 5, 11
- Node 17 is connected to nodes: 6, 9, 12, 13
- Node 18 is connected to nodes: 14
- Node 19 is connected to nodes: 1, 9, 14

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:
Nodes in order: 2, 5, 18, 0, 13, 7, 8, 10, 6, 16, 19, 4, 14, 1, 3, 17, 15, 12, 11, 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles by looking at the connections between nodes:
[Total number of triangles: 15]
<0, 3, 15>
<0, 3, 16>
<0, 15, 2>
<1, 3, 14>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 6, 14>
<4, 8, 2>
<4, 8, 12>
<4, 12, 7>
<6, 14, 19>
<8, 2, 15>
<9, 4, 7>
<9, 4, 17>
<9, 7, 12>
<9, 19, 14>
