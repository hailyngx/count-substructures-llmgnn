Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 1) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method by sorting the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most.

Here is the list of vertices along with their degrees:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3

We will relabel the vertices as follows based on their degrees:
- Node 6 (degree 3) -> Node 0
- Node 2 (degree 3) -> Node 1
- Node 9 (degree 3) -> Node 2
- Node 1 (degree 3) -> Node 3
- Node 8 (degree 3) -> Node 4
- Node 5 (degree 4) -> Node 5
- Node 7 (degree 5) -> Node 6
- Node 0 (degree 5) -> Node 7
- Node 3 (degree 5) -> Node 8
- Node 4 (degree 6) -> Node 9

Now, we will consider each edge in the graph where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. Count the number of triangles with shared connections between the two vertices of each edge:

1. (0, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 0, 1, 4
2. (0, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 0, 2, 6
3. (0, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 0, 3, 4
4. (0, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 0, 6, 4
5. (1, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 1, 4, 7
6. (2, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 2, 3, 4
7. (3, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 3, 4, 7

Based on the above analysis, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7], and the unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 4>.
