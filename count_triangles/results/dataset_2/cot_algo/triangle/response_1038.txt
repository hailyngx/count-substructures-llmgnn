Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 10) (9, 1) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 28) (26, 8) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 0) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 25) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 15) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 13) (4, 18) (4, 10) (4, 25) (22, 9) (22, 14) (22, 0) (24, 26) (24, 23) (24, 29) (11, 3) (11, 1) (28, 26) (28, 19) (6, 21) (21, 6) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 17) (17, 18) (17, 21) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 27) (20, 17) (20, 1) (20, 23) (20, 16) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 21) (10, 16) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 20) (23, 24) (23, 20) (12, 2) (12, 21) (12, 25) (16, 17) (16, 20) (16, 10) (0, 3) (0, 22) (19, 28) (19, 14) (14, 22) (14, 19) (14, 27) (27, 17) (27, 14) (27, 29) (27, 13) (29, 24) (29, 27) (29, 8) (13, 18) (13, 27) (5, 25) (25, 15) (25, 4) (25, 12) (25, 5) (25, 8) (8, 26) (8, 15) (8, 29) (8, 25) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in order from least to most connections. After relabeling the vertices accordingly, the sorted list of vertices is as follows:
Nodes by degree: [1, 3, 5, 6, 13, 2, 5, 6, 6, 4, 9, 4, 7, 5, 7, 6, 8, 6, 9, 4, 7, 3, 6, 6, 3, 7, 6, 7, 4, 3]

Using this ordering, we can analyze the list of edges provided in the graph to determine the number of triangles present. 
Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider each edge only when the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 
Upon examining the edges, we find the following unique triangles: 
<1, 9, 11>
<5, 8, 25>
<6, 10, 21>
<6, 10, 16>
<13, 17, 27>
<2, 12, 25>
<2, 12, 21>
<4, 10, 25>
<3, 11, 15>
<3, 11, 1>
<3, 0, 15>
<3, 0, 22>
<4, 18, 25>
<4, 18, 16>
<4, 18, 10>
<6, 12, 21>
<13, 18, 27>
<15, 18, 25>
<15, 18, 8>
<15, 18, 23>
<17, 21, 20>
<17, 21, 10>
<17, 21, 16>
<17, 20, 23>
<17, 20, 16>
<17, 16, 20>
<27, 29, 14>
<8, 25, 29>
<8, 25, 15>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [27] inside the brackets.
