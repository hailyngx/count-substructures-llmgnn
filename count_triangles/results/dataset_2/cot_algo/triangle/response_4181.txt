Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 18) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 23) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 2) (20, 25) (20, 12) (25, 20) (25, 15) (25, 0) (25, 24) (0, 25) (0, 1) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 19) (18, 16) (18, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 26) (19, 2) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 4) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 27) (26, 12) (9, 24) (9, 7) (22, 28) (22, 12) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 5) (10, 18) (15, 25) (15, 7) (27, 26) (27, 21) (4, 19) (4, 28) (4, 21) (12, 20) (12, 26) (12, 22) (12, 5) (28, 22) (28, 4) (23, 14) (23, 26) (23, 29) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 15) (7, 6) (6, 14) (6, 7) (21, 8) (21, 27) (21, 4) (29, 11) (29, 23) (24, 17) (24, 25) (24, 9) (24, 1) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 24) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed based on the given nodes and edges, and the vertices have been relabeled based on their degree from least to most connections. 

The list of edges in the constructed graph (with relabeled vertices) is as follows:
(0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 24) (1, 13) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 19) (3, 5) (3, 11) (4, 21) (4, 19) (4, 28) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 13) (6, 7) (6, 14) (7, 15) (7, 9) (8, 26) (8, 21) (9, 24) (10, 18) (11, 29) (12, 26) (12, 20) (12, 22) (13, 14) (14, 23) (15, 25) (16, 18) (17, 24) (18, 10) (19, 26) (20, 25) (21, 27) (22, 28) (23, 29) (24, 25) (26, 27) (27, 21) (28, 22)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles found: <3, 5, 13>, <5, 8, 26>, <14, 23, 29>, <7, 9, 24>, <2, 8, 19>, <4, 21, 28>, <12, 20, 26>, <7, 15, 25>
