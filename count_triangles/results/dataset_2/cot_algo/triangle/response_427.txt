Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 16) (17, 14) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 22) (25, 3) (25, 0) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 16) (22, 3) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 12) (7, 16) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 5) (21, 13) (21, 24) (0, 25) (0, 20) (0, 4) (0, 8) (20, 7) (20, 0) (20, 13) (20, 9) (20, 24) (5, 7) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 23) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 15) (26, 28) (26, 15) (26, 29) (28, 3) (28, 26) (28, 9) (15, 8) (15, 26) (15, 23) (16, 14) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 19) (13, 21) (13, 20) (11, 18) (11, 23) (11, 1) (11, 29) (23, 6) (23, 15) (23, 11) (23, 10) (9, 20) (9, 28) (9, 29) (29, 26) (29, 11) (29, 9) (4, 0) (4, 24) (12, 22) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 10) (19, 2) (19, 16) (19, 27) (27, 22) (27, 19) (10, 8) (10, 23) (10, 1) (10, 24) (24, 21) (24, 20) (24, 4) (24, 10) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 16 has degree 4,
Node 0 has degree 4,
Node 8 has degree 4,
Node 20 has degree 5,
Node 18 has degree 4,
Node 7 has degree 4,
Node 9 has degree 3,
Node 15 has degree 3,
Node 1 has degree 3,
Node 22 has degree 4,
Node 11 has degree 4,
Node 26 has degree 3,
Node 13 has degree 2,
Node 5 has degree 2,
Node 10 has degree 3,
Node 24 has degree 4,
Node 29 has degree 3,
Node 25 has degree 2,
Node 2 has degree 3,
Node 19 has degree 3,
Node 12 has degree 1,
Node 21 has degree 2,
Node 6 has degree 2,
Node 27 has degree 2,
Node 3 has degree 3,
Node 4 has degree 2,
Node 23 has degree 3,
Node 17 has degree 2,
Node 14 has degree 2,
Node 28 has degree 3.

Based on the connections and the degree-based ordering, the number of triangles in the graph is 15.

The unique triangles found are as follows:
<0, 8, 2>,
<0, 8, 20>,
<0, 2, 18>,
<0, 2, 19>,
<0, 18, 16>,
<20, 8, 24>,
<20, 8, 0>,
<20, 8, 9>,
<7, 16, 18>,
<7, 16, 19>,
<7, 5, 1>,
<7, 5, 6>,
<15, 26, 23>,
<1, 11, 23>,
<11, 18, 16>.
