Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 10) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 1) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
(5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) 
(9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 1) 
(8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) 
(13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 10) 
(4, 14) 
(6, 12) 
(2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) 
(0, 10) 
(10, 12) 
(3, 8) 
(7, 6) (7, 1) 
(1, 14) 
(12, 6) 

Next, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method and relabel the vertices accordingly:
Degree of each node:
0: 2, 1: 5, 2: 5, 3: 4, 4: 3, 5: 5, 6: 2, 7: 3, 8: 4, 9: 5, 10: 3, 11: 3, 12: 5, 13: 4, 14: 3

Nodes in increasing order of degrees:
0, 6, 7, 4, 11, 10, 1, 14, 3, 8, 13, 2, 5, 9, 12

Now, we will go through the edges based on the lower label having fewer connections:
Triangles:
<0, 8, 10>
<0, 2, 14>
<1, 2, 14>
<1, 7, 14>
<1, 12, 14>
<2, 10, 12>
<3, 8, 13>

[Total number of triangles: 7]
