Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 12) (20, 27) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 9) (25, 26) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 8) (12, 20) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 21) (27, 20) (27, 12) (27, 29) (27, 2) (27, 6) (28, 29) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 18) (28, 23) (29, 10) (29, 27) (29, 28) (29, 26) (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 27) (2, 0) (21, 12) (21, 28) (21, 15) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 26) (13, 19) (26, 25) (26, 29) (26, 13) (26, 18) (18, 28) (18, 26) (18, 1) (8, 17) (8, 28) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 3) (9, 25) (9, 8) (15, 21) (16, 22) (16, 6) (7, 25) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 5) (22, 16) (22, 4) (4, 0) (4, 22) (4, 24) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 19) (24, 8) (24, 4) (11, 6) (19, 20) (19, 13) (19, 3) (6, 27) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 14) (14, 6) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 23) (5, 7) (23, 28) (23, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their degree:
- Node 5 has degree 1
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 11, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 have degree 2
- Nodes 4, 6, 8, 13, 16, 17, 18, 26, 27, 29 have degree 3
- Nodes 7, 12, 14, 28 have degree 4
- Node 10 has degree 5
- Node 25 has degree 6

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 11, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 = Label 0
- Node 4, 6, 8, 13, 16, 17, 18, 26, 27, 29 = Label 1
- Nodes 7, 12, 14, 28 = Label 2
- Node 10 = Label 3
- Node 25 = Label 4
- Node 5 = Label 5

3. Count the triangles:
- <0, 2, 27>
- <3, 9, 25>
- <3, 14, 28>
- <5, 7, 10>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <1, 8, 28>
- <1, 13, 26>
- <0, 19, 21>
- <21, 23, 28>
- <4, 25, 29>
- <0, 4, 24>
- <6, 11, 16>
- <7, 16, 22>
- <0, 2, 27>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
