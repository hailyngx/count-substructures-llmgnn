Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 6) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 11) (10, 4) (10, 12) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the nodes based on their degree, i.e., the number of edges connected to each node. After sorting, we have the following order of nodes from least to most connections:
(1) Node 5 - Degree 4
(2) Node 3 - Degree 3
(3) Node 7 - Degree 3
(4) Node 10 - Degree 2
(5) Node 14 - Degree 2
(6) Node 0 - Degree 2
(7) Node 6 - Degree 5
(8) Node 8 - Degree 4
(9) Node 4 - Degree 5
(10) Node 2 - Degree 4
(11) Node 11 - Degree 5
(12) Node 13 - Degree 4
(13) Node 1 - Degree 3
(14) Node 12 - Degree 6
(15) Node 9 - Degree 5

Now, we look at each edge starting from the one between the nodes with the lowest label. For each edge, we only consider triangles when the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections to avoid duplicate counting.

By following this method, we can identify all triangles and count them.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [24].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 12>
<0, 11, 12>
<0, 12, 14>
<1, 3, 13>
<1, 8, 12>
<1, 8, 11>
<1, 11, 14>
<4, 7, 12>
<4, 11, 12>
<4, 11, 13>
<5, 9, 13>
<5, 9, 6>
<6, 12, 14>
<7, 8, 12>
<8, 11, 14>
<10, 12, 0>
<10, 12, 11>
<11, 12, 13>
<12, 0, 9>
<12, 11, 9>
<12, 11, 13>
<12, 0, 11>
<12, 0, 9>
<12, 0, 11>
