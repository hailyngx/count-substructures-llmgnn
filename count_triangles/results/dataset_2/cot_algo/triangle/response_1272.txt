Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 13) (11, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 14) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 6) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the graph. 

Sorted list of nodes based on the number of connections (degree):
```
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 11: 2 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 12: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 10: 5 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
```

Now, we will count the triangles by examining each edge. We will only consider cases where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles:
<1, 8, 13>
<3, 4, 10>
<1, 12, 14>
<3, 10, 13>
<4, 6, 10>
<4, 6, 12>
<3, 10, 7>
<4, 6, 12>
<7, 10, 13>
<4, 6, 12>
