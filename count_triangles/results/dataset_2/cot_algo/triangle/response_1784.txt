Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 25) (27, 16) (4, 27) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 21) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 12) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 12) (29, 17) (29, 19) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 17) (1, 10) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 24) (3, 23) (3, 22) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 2) (18, 11) (18, 26) (18, 19) (26, 18) (26, 28) (26, 20) (13, 0) (13, 16) (28, 26) (28, 24) (28, 5) (16, 27) (16, 13) (16, 21) (21, 0) (21, 16) (25, 27) (25, 23) (25, 24) (2, 11) (2, 20) (2, 7) (22, 3) (22, 11) (22, 5) (19, 29) (19, 18) (19, 20) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 20) (7, 8) (7, 2) (24, 3) (24, 28) (24, 25) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 19) (20, 12) (20, 6) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 25) (9, 11) (6, 20) (5, 0) (5, 28) (5, 22) (10, 1) 

Response:
The graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges has been provided along with the list of edges. To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method. Let's follow the steps:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections).
2. Relabel the vertices accordingly.
3. For each edge, only consider the cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
4. Count the number of triangles formed by shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

After applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find that there are:
\[ [22] \]

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
\[ <1, 4, 17>, <3, 11, 22>, <4, 12, 20>, <4, 12, 17>, <4, 12, 14>, <5, 20, 22>, <5, 20, 28>, <5, 22, 28>, <8, 11, 22>, <11, 18, 19>, <11, 18, 26>, <11, 19, 26>, <11, 22, 23>, <16, 21, 22>, <20, 21, 22>, <20, 22, 28> \]
