Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 7) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 10) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (11, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 9) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges based on the provided information. 
Additionally, we will sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections) to apply the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Nodes and their connections:
- Node 0: 12, 10, 11, 4, 9
- Node 1: 6, 2, 5, 10, 7
- Node 2: 1, 12, 6, 10
- Node 3: 14, 6, 5
- Node 4: 13, 0, 6, 10, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 8, 7, 12
- Node 6: 1, 3, 8, 2, 4
- Node 7: 1, 13, 5
- Node 8: 13, 5, 6, 12
- Node 9: 13, 0, 14, 4
- Node 10: 1, 0, 14, 2, 4
- Node 11: 0
- Node 12: 8, 2, 5, 0
- Node 13: 8, 4, 9, 7
- Node 14: 3, 9, 10

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
