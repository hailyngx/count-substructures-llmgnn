The edges are as follows: (13, 4) (22, 23) (22, 9) (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 8) (27, 15) (27, 25) (27, 21) (27, 3) (27, 26) (4, 13) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 23) (7, 26) (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 1) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 26) (10, 11) (23, 22) (23, 7) (23, 19) (20, 1) (12, 7) (12, 9) (12, 28) (12, 29) (9, 22) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 17) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 18) (0, 7) (0, 28) (0, 25) (0, 6) (2, 24) (25, 27) (25, 0) (25, 1) (25, 26) (25, 24) (24, 16) (24, 2) (24, 25) (1, 11) (1, 20) (1, 25) (5, 3) (8, 15) (8, 29) (8, 21) (28, 12) (28, 0) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 18) (14, 6) (14, 3) (3, 27) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 14) (19, 23) (19, 21) (21, 27) (21, 8) (21, 19) (21, 29) (29, 12) (29, 8) (29, 21) (26, 27) (26, 7) (26, 16) (26, 25) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and edges:

Nodes: 30
Edges: 90

After constructing the graph with the given edges, the Degree-Based Ordering method is applied to count the number of triangles in the graph.

Sorted nodes with their connections:

0: 4 connections
2: 1 connection
5: 1 connection
10: 1 connection
13: 2 connections
14: 2 connections
20: 1 connection
22: 3 connections
7: 5 connections
12: 4 connections
16: 3 connections
23: 3 connections
17: 3 connections
4: 4 connections
1: 4 connections
24: 3 connections
25: 4 connections
26: 4 connections
27: 5 connections
3: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
8: 3 connections
18: 3 connections
9: 4 connections
28: 3 connections
11: 3 connections
15: 3 connections
19: 3 connections
21: 4 connections
29: 3 connections

Count of triangles: [30]
