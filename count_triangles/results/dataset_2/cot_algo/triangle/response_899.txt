Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree, or number of connections. The graph with the nodes relabeled in increasing degree is as follows:
Nodes: [0, 7, 6, 9, 3, 5, 1, 2, 8, 4]

Now, let's check for triangles using the specified method:

1. Edge (4, 7):
    - Node 4 has connections with nodes [0, 2, 5, 7, 9].
    - Node 7 has connections with nodes [0, 3, 4, 8].
    - Node 0 is a shared connection, so the triangle is <4, 7, 0>.

2. Edge (4, 2):
    - Node 4 has connections with nodes [0, 2, 5, 7, 9].
    - Node 2 has connections with nodes [0, 1, 6, 4].
    - Node 0 is a shared connection, so the triangle is <4, 2, 0>.

3. Edge (4, 9):
    - Node 4 has connections with nodes [0, 2, 5, 7, 9].
    - Node 9 has connections with nodes [1, 4, 8].
    - There are no shared connections.

4. Edge (4, 0):
    - Node 4 has connections with nodes [0, 2, 5, 7, 9].
    - Node 0 has connections with nodes [2, 7, 8, 4].
    - Node 7 is a shared connection, so the triangle is <4, 0, 7>.

5. Edge (4, 5):
    - Node 4 has connections with nodes [0, 2, 5, 7, 9].
    - Node 5 has connections with nodes [1, 4, 6, 8].
    - Node 4 is a shared connection, so the triangle is <4, 5, 1>.

6. Continuing this process for all edges, the total number of triangles is [4]. The unique triangles found are <4, 7, 0>, <4, 2, 0>, <4, 0, 7>, <4, 5, 1>.
