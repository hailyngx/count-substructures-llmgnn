Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 2) (1, 25) (1, 19) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 20) (14, 17) (14, 27) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 15) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 8) (22, 26) (22, 7) (7, 22) (7, 0) (20, 21) (20, 25) (20, 23) (25, 1) (25, 20) (25, 23) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 9) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 6) (27, 14) (27, 9) (27, 16) (27, 23) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 29) (19, 1) (26, 18) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 6) (24, 26) (24, 0) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 2) (15, 17) (15, 5) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 23) (0, 7) (0, 24) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 27) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 12) (6, 26) (29, 4) (29, 16) (29, 8) (28, 17) (16, 27) (16, 29) (8, 18) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 29) (23, 20) (23, 25) (23, 27) (23, 13) (5, 15) (5, 0) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29
Edges: 
(1, 21), (1, 2), (1, 25), (1, 19), (1, 12), 
(21, 20), 
(14, 17), (14, 27), (14, 9), (14, 13), 
(17, 10), (17, 28), (17, 15), 
(18, 4), (18, 26), (18, 8), 
(22, 26), (22, 7), 
(7, 0), 
(20, 23), 
(25, 23), 
(10, 9), 
(12, 6), 
(27, 16), 
(4, 29), 
(26, 24), (26, 6), 
(24, 0), 
(3, 11), (3, 8), 
(11, 2), 
(15, 5), 
(13, 23), 
(2, 13), 
(6, 26), 
(29, 16), (29, 8), 
(28, 17), 
(5, 15)

Now, let's determine the vertices with their respective degrees in ascending order:
Vertices with degrees:
0: 6
1: 5
2: 5
3: 4
4: 4
5: 3
6: 3
7: 3
8: 4
9: 5
10: 3
11: 3
12: 3
13: 4
14: 4
15: 3
16: 3
17: 4
18: 3
19: 1
20: 3
21: 2
22: 2
23: 4
24: 2
25: 3
26: 4
27: 4
28: 2
29: 3

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [<0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 15>, <0, 7, 24>, <1, 12, 6>, <2, 12, 6>, <2, 12, 11>, <2, 12, 13>, <2, 11, 3>, <2, 13, 23>, <2, 13, 27>, <4, 9, 27>, <4, 9, 14>, <4, 9, 0>, <8, 29, 16>, <16, 27, 14>]

Total number of triangles: [16]
