Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 19) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 18) (2, 13) (18, 10) (18, 12) (1, 15) (1, 0) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 9) (8, 11) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 7) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 7) (12, 16) (12, 15) (12, 18) (12, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 9) (4, 13) (4, 9) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 4) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
I will first construct the graph with the given information and then count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (11, 16), (11, 8), (16, 12), (16, 9), (16, 6), (3, 15), (3, 7), (15, 1), (15, 8), (15, 12), (14, 17), (14, 19), (14, 10), (17, 10), (17, 19), (10, 6), (10, 18), (2, 13), (18, 10), (18, 12), (1, 0), (5, 13), (13, 4), (8, 11), (8, 15), (8, 0), (8, 7), (19, 7), (12, 16), (12, 15), (12, 18), (7, 9), (4, 9)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes and their degrees:
0: 4
1: 2
2: 2
3: 2
4: 2
5: 2
6: 3
7: 4
8: 4
9: 4
10: 4
11: 2
12: 4
13: 4
14: 3
15: 4
16: 4
17: 3
18: 3
19: 3

Now, we need to count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 15>, <0, 5, 13>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 9, 13>, <6, 10, 18>, <10, 14, 17>
