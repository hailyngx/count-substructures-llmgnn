Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 2) (4, 5) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 6) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 3) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 9) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 18) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 6) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (14, 3) (14, 5) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 18) (9, 10) (9, 2) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 9) (6, 3) (6, 19) (6, 8) (6, 18) (18, 12) (18, 0) (18, 6) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed. Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The sorted vertices based on their degree are:
Vertex 4: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 14: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 18: 3 connections
Vertex 10: 3 connections
Vertex 13: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 12: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 19: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 17: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 15: 5 connections
Vertex 11: 6 connections
Vertex 16: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider the edges where the vertex with the smaller label has fewer connections than the vertex with the higher label.

Using this method, we find the following triangles:
[<1, 3, 17>, <0, 11, 13>, <0, 11, 12>, <0, 11, 16>, <0, 15, 19>, <2, 7, 19>, <2, 9, 10>, <5, 12, 18>, <6, 8, 18>]

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
