Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 6) (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 23) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 9) (17, 19) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 9) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 25) (3, 23) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 4) (20, 25) (20, 9) (20, 4) (20, 6) (2, 15) (18, 1) (18, 27) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 23) (7, 26) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 22) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 19) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 20) (9, 22) (9, 28) (22, 12) (22, 9) (22, 28) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 24) (13, 5) (21, 23) (26, 14) (26, 7) (26, 5) (26, 8) (26, 27) (19, 17) (19, 1) (19, 0) (24, 5) (24, 29) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 24) (29, 4) (28, 0) (28, 9) (28, 22) (28, 27) (27, 18) (27, 26) (27, 28) (8, 3) (8, 26) (8, 15) (4, 25) (4, 20) (4, 29) (6, 16) (6, 20) (6, 12) (15, 2) (15, 8) (23, 14) (23, 3) (23, 7) (23, 21) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the given nodes and edges. Now, let's proceed with counting the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

After sorting the vertices by the number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
0 - 1 connections
2 - 1 connections
13 - 1 connections
21 - 1 connections
24 - 1 connections
16 - 2 connections
17 - 4 connections
18 - 4 connections
1 - 5 connections
25 - 5 connections
27 - 5 connections
28 - 5 connections
29 - 5 connections
3 - 6 connections
5 - 6 connections
15 - 6 connections
19 - 7 connections
20 - 7 connections
8 - 8 connections
22 - 8 connections
26 - 8 connections
7 - 9 connections
4 - 10 connections
9 - 10 connections
6 - 11 connections
12 - 11 connections
14 - 11 connections
11 - 12 connections
10 - 29 connections

Now, let's proceed with counting the number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [64]
