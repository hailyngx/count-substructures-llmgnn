Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 3) (9, 12) (26, 5) (26, 21) (14, 17) (14, 3) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 22) (17, 27) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 13) (20, 17) (20, 6) (6, 20) (6, 21) (6, 23) (6, 13) (21, 26) (21, 6) (21, 11) (21, 15) (15, 21) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 24) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 24) (8, 10) (8, 19) (8, 29) (8, 22) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 1) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (12, 9) (12, 16) (12, 4) (5, 26) (5, 29) (5, 27) (22, 17) (22, 8) (22, 24) (24, 15) (24, 16) (24, 22) (24, 1) (7, 28) (29, 8) (29, 5) (29, 13) (11, 21) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 25) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 4) (27, 17) (27, 5) (1, 19) (1, 4) (1, 24) (1, 25) (1, 0) (25, 11) (25, 1) (25, 23) (25, 18) (0, 15) (0, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 29) (18, 10) (18, 25) (2, 11) (2, 23) (2, 28) (23, 6) (23, 25) (23, 2) (28, 7) (28, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

1. Node 7, connections: 1
2. Node 28, connections: 2
3. Node 4, connections: 3
4. Node 5, connections: 3
5. Node 9, connections: 3
6. Node 12, connections: 3
7. Node 18, connections: 3
8. Node 19, connections: 3
9. Node 20, connections: 3
10. Node 22, connections: 3
11. Node 27, connections: 3
12. Node 0, connections: 4
13. Node 13, connections: 4
14. Node 15, connections: 4
15. Node 16, connections: 4
16. Node 24, connections: 4
17. Node 1, connections: 5
18. Node 2, connections: 5
19. Node 11, connections: 5
20. Node 25, connections: 5
21. Node 3, connections: 6
22. Node 6, connections: 6
23. Node 8, connections: 6
24. Node 10, connections: 6
25. Node 14, connections: 6
26. Node 17, connections: 6
27. Node 21, connections: 6
28. Node 23, connections: 6
29. Node 26, connections: 8
30. Node 29, connections: 8
