Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their number of connections, relabeling the vertices, and checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices will be:
0 -> 6
3 -> 5
4 -> 4
5 -> 3
6 -> 2
7 -> 1
8 -> 0
9 -> 7
1 -> 8
2 -> 9

Checking for shared connections between vertices with lower labels:
- Edge (0, 8): No shared connections
- Edge (1, 8): No shared connections
- Edge (2, 6): No shared connections
- Edge (2, 9): No shared connections
- Edge (2, 1): Forms a triangle with vertex 3 -> <1, 2, 3>
- Edge (2, 3): Forms a triangle with vertex 1 -> <1, 2, 3>
- Edge (3, 7): No shared connections
- Edge (3, 9): No shared connections
- Edge (3, 2): Forms a triangle with vertex 1 -> <1, 2, 3>
- Edge (4, 1): Forms a triangle with vertex 5 -> <1, 4, 5>
- Edge (4, 5): Forms a triangle with vertex 1 -> <1, 4, 5>
- Edge (5, 4): Forms a triangle with vertex 1 -> <1, 4, 5>
- Edge (5, 2): No shared connections
- Edge (5, 1): No shared connections
- Edge (6, 7): No shared connections
- Edge (6, 2): No shared connections
- Edge (6, 8): No shared connections
- Edge (7, 8): No shared connections
- Edge (7, 1): No shared connections
- Edge (7, 0): No shared connections
- Edge (7, 3): No shared connections
- Edge (7, 6): No shared connections
- Edge (8, 0): No shared connections
- Edge (8, 6): No shared connections
- Edge (8, 1): No shared connections
- Edge (8, 7): No shared connections
- Edge (8, 9): No shared connections
- Edge (9, 0): No shared connections
- Edge (9, 2): No shared connections
- Edge (9, 3): No shared connections
- Edge (9, 8): No shared connections
