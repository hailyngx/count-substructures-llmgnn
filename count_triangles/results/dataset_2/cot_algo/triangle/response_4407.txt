Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- 0: {2, 6, 7}
- 1: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- 2: {0, 7, 9}
- 3: {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- 4: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- 5: {1, 3, 6}
- 6: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- 7: {0, 2, 4, 6}
- 8: {1, 6, 9}
- 9: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Degree-based ordering: {2, 5, 8, 0, 1, 7, 4, 6, 9, 3}

Next, we will count the number of triangles by considering the shared connections between vertices connected by each edge:

1. (4, 7) forms triangle with: 
   {4, 6, 7}

2. (4, 9) forms triangle with: 
   {4, 9, 3}

3. (4, 6) forms triangle with: 
   {4, 6, 3}

4. (4, 3) forms triangle with: 
   {4, 3, 6}

5. (7, 4) is already counted (from (4, 7))

6. (7, 0) forms triangle with: 
   {7, 0, 2}

7. (7, 6) forms triangle with: 
   {7, 6, 4}

8. (7, 2) forms triangle with: 
   {7, 2, 0}

9. (1, 3) forms triangle with: 
   {1, 3, 5}

10. (1, 5) forms triangle with: 
    {1, 5, 3}

11. (1, 9) forms triangle with: 
    {1, 9, 8}

12. (1, 8) forms triangle with: 
    {1, 8, 9}

13. (3, 4) is already counted (from (4, 3))

14. (3, 1) is already counted (from (1, 3))

15. (3, 6) forms triangle with: 
    {3, 6, 4}

16. (3, 9) forms triangle with: 
    {3, 9, 1}

17. (3, 5) forms triangle with: 
    {3, 5, 1}

18. (8, 1) is already counted (from (1, 8))

19. (8, 9) forms triangle with: 
    {8, 9, 1}

20. (8, 6) forms triangle with: 
    {8, 6, 3}

21. (5, 1) is already counted (from (1, 5))

22. (5, 3) is already counted (from (3, 5))

23. (5, 6) forms triangle with: 
    {5, 6, 3}

24. (6, 4) is already counted (from (4, 6))

25. (6, 7) is already counted (from (7, 6))

26. (6, 3) is already counted (from (3, 6))

27. (6, 8) is already counted (from (8, 6))

28. (6, 5) is already counted (from (5, 6))

29. (6, 0) forms triangle with: 
    {6, 0, 2}

30. (2, 7) is already counted (from (7, 2))

31. (2, 9) forms triangle with: 
    {2, 9, 4}

32. (2, 0) forms triangle with: 
    {2, 0, 7}

33. (0, 7) is already counted (from (7, 0))

34. (0, 6) is already counted (from (6, 0))

35. (0, 2) is already counted (from (2, 0))

36. (9, 4) is already counted (from (4, 9))

37. (9, 1) is already counted (from (1, 9))

38. (9, 3) is already counted (from (3, 9))

39. (9, 8) is already counted (from (8, 9))

40. (9, 2) is already counted (from (2, 9))

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 9, 3>
<4, 6, 3>
<7, 0, 2>
<7, 6, 4>
<7, 2, 0>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 9, 8>
<3, 6, 4>
<3, 9, 1>
<3, 5, 1>
<8, 9, 1>
<8, 6, 3>
