Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 19) (0, 7) (0, 15) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 19) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 2) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 15) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 3) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 3) (1, 5) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 10) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 19) (16, 17) (15, 0) (15, 7) (15, 17) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 12) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 10) 

Response:
The degrees of each node are as follows:  
Node 0: degree 2  
Node 1: degree 1  
Node 2: degree 4  
Node 3: degree 4  
Node 4: degree 3  
Node 5: degree 4  
Node 6: degree 0  
Node 7: degree 3  
Node 8: degree 4  
Node 9: degree 5  
Node 10: degree 4  
Node 11: degree 4  
Node 12: degree 3  
Node 13: degree 4  
Node 14: degree 3  
Node 15: degree 3  
Node 16: degree 1  
Node 17: degree 4  
Node 18: degree 3  
Node 19: degree 5  

By sorting the nodes by their degree in increasing order, we get the following order: 6, 1, 0, 16, 4, 14, 12, 18, 15, 7, 13, 2, 3, 8, 10, 11, 17, 5, 9, 19.

Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph:

Number of triangles: [14]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 13>, <0, 3, 14>, <0, 7, 13>, <0, 7, 15>, <4, 11, 8>, <4, 11, 19>, <4, 18, 19>, <7, 13, 17>, <8, 10, 12>, <9, 10, 8>, <9, 10, 13>, <9, 13, 17>, <11, 8, 10>.
