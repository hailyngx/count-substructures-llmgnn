Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
The graph after sorting the vertices based on the number of connections is as follows:
Vertices: 3, 7, 6, 1, 5, 0, 8, 4, 9, 2

The new edges are:
(3, 8), (3, 0), (3, 2), (7, 8), (7, 1), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 8), (1, 5), (1, 2), (1, 7), (5, 4), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 2), (0, 3), (8, 6), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 7), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 2), (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 7)

Now, counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Triangles: [8]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>
