Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 22) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 27) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 16) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 19) (26, 1) (26, 18) (26, 14) (26, 8) (28, 6) (28, 29) (28, 27) (28, 20) (29, 28) (3, 11) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 21) (17, 20) (17, 24) (17, 15) (17, 18) (20, 1) (20, 28) (20, 17) (20, 21) (21, 11) (21, 20) (18, 26) (18, 11) (18, 17) (14, 26) (14, 27) (14, 16) (14, 5) (2, 22) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 25) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 5) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 19) (12, 10) (12, 25) (12, 8) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 15) (15, 17) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 13) (8, 26) (8, 12) (24, 7) (24, 17) (27, 7) (27, 28) (27, 14) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 19) (25, 2) (25, 12) (5, 14) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. Let's do that first:

Vertices sorted by degrees:
0(3), 3(1), 12(3), 17(4), 21(2), 8(2), 10(4), 7(4), 11(4), 22(3), 29(3), 1(4), 5(4), 13(4), 15(4), 18(4), 6(3), 9(3), 14(4), 16(3), 19(4), 20(4), 24(2), 27(3), 26(4), 28(4), 2(4), 25(2), 4(2)

Now, let's count the triangles:
Total number of triangles: [27]

Unique triangles found: 
<5, 13, 19>, <1, 19, 20>, <1, 19, 15>, <17, 18, 26>, <5, 0, 13>, <6, 9, 16>, <9, 6, 13>, <1, 9, 26>, <14, 16, 15>, <12, 8, 26>, <10, 0, 13>, <17, 20, 1>, <11, 18, 21>, <10, 12, 25>, <20, 28, 1>, <15, 17, 20>, <7, 4, 22>, <14, 27, 28>, <5, 22, 2>, <10, 19, 15>, <2, 22, 5>, <2, 13, 0>, <17, 24, 7>, <27, 7, 28>, <16, 14, 26>, <11, 3, 21>, <14, 5, 15>
