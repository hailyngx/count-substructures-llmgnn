Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- 0: (9, 8, 2, 3, 1)
- 1: (4, 7, 6, 0)
- 2: (4, 7, 6, 0)
- 3: (9, 4, 0)
- 4: (7, 3, 1, 2)
- 5: (6, 8, 7)
- 6: (5, 9, 1, 2)
- 7: (5, 9, 4, 2, 1)
- 8: (5, 9, 0)
- 9: (6, 8, 3, 7, 0)

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [18]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>
