Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and the given 40 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 0), (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 4), (1, 5), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 2), (3, 8), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 1), (4, 7), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 0), (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 3), (2, 8), (8, 9), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 0), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 7), (0, 8)

Next, let's determine the degree of each node:
- Node 0: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 3
- Node 2: Degree 4
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 4
- Node 5: Degree 4
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 5
- Node 8: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 4

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degree from least to most connections:
- Node 1: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 2: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 4
- Node 8: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 4
- Node 0: Degree 4
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 5: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles and list them:

Triangles: 
[9] 
<0, 2, 4> <0, 3, 8> <0, 5, 7> <0, 7, 8> <1, 3, 8> <1, 4, 7> <3, 4, 7>
