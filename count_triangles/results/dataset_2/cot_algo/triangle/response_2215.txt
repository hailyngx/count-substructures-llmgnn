Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 19) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 18) (10, 19) (17, 8) (17, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 15) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 11) (18, 16) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 12) (12, 2) (12, 4) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 15) (7, 3) (7, 6) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 16) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method first involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. 

Here is the list of vertices sorted by their degrees:
```
Node 17: 2 edges
Node 10: 1 edge
Node 12: 2 edges
Node 7: 2 edges
Node 1: 2 edges
Node 5: 4 edges
Node 16: 3 edges
Node 6: 3 edges
Node 15: 3 edges
Node 2: 4 edges
Node 3: 3 edges
Node 14: 3 edges
Node 18: 4 edges
Node 0: 3 edges
Node 19: 4 edges
Node 11: 4 edges
Node 13: 3 edges
Node 8: 4 edges
Node 4: 4 edges
Node 9: 4 edges
```

Now, we proceed through the edges with the vertices with lower labels having fewer connections.

By counting the triangles, we find the total number of triangles to be **14**.

The unique triangles present in the graph are as follows:
```
<0, 8, 17>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 19, 9>
<1, 11, 14>
<2, 5, 15>
<4, 13, 11>
<4, 13, 18>
<4, 17, 8>
<9, 14, 11>
<9, 14, 1>
<9, 16, 18>
<9, 19, 10>
<16, 15, 5>
``` 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is **[14]**.
