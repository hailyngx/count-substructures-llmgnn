Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 5), (4, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7,8), (6, 9), (6, 3), (9, 0), (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 1), (5, 0), (2, 1)

To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices by degree: (0: 4), (1: 2), (5: 2), (6: 2), (2: 4), (3: 5), (9: 5), (7: 5), (8: 6), (4: 6)

Now, we will list the triangles found:
1. <2, 4, 7>
2. <0, 4, 8>
3. <0, 1, 8>
4. <0, 1, 2>
5. <0, 5, 2>
6. <1, 2, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
