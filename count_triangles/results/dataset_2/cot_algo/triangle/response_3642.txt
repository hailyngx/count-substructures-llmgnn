Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 15) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 0) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 5) (15, 4) (15, 10) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 1) (18, 16) (18, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 17) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 19) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 3) (17, 19) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 5) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 6) (19, 0) (19, 17) (19, 16) (5, 10) (5, 1) (5, 11) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 19) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) 

Response:
Let's first sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 14: degree 0
Nodes 20, 14, 3: degree 1
Nodes 19, 13, 18, 7, 2, 13, 11: degree 2
Nodes 6, 5, 12, 16, 15, 9, 1: degree 3
Nodes 0, 19, 8, 6, 4, 18, 10: degree 4
Node 17: degree 5

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 8]
<0, 2, 17>
<0, 3, 17>
<0, 3, 19>
<2, 8, 17>
<2, 17, 19>
<4, 10, 15>
<5, 11, 6>
<6, 12, 18>
