Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 11) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 5) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 10) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 12) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabelling the nodes accordingly.

Here are the sorted nodes with their degrees:
Node 0 - degree 2
Node 3 - degree 2
Node 6 - degree 3
Node 12 - degree 3
Node 8 - degree 4
Node 4 - degree 4
Node 14 - degree 4
Node 2 - degree 5
Node 7 - degree 5
Node 5 - degree 5
Node 10 - degree 5
Node 1 - degree 5
Node 9 - degree 6
Node 11 - degree 6
Node 13 - degree 6

Now, we will count the number of triangles by examining edges in the order based on the relabelled nodes. Only edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections will be considered:

Triangles found:
- <1, 5, 11>
- <1, 7, 14>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 11, 14>
- <3, 8, 13>
- <5, 7, 11>
- <7, 10, 12>
- <9, 10, 13>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
