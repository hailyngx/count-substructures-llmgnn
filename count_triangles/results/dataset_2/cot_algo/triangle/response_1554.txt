Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 10) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 10) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (11, 0) (11, 9) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 10) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 3) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges can be illustrated as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges:
- 0: {7, 11, 12, 5}
- 1: {7, 4, 6, 10}
- 2: {13, 5, 7, 12, 6}
- 3: {8, 13, 6, 10}
- 4: {14, 12, 9, 1}
- 5: {0, 14, 2, 7}
- 6: {7, 1, 10, 3, 2}
- 7: {13, 0, 5, 6, 2, 1}
- 8: {13, 12, 3}
- 9: {13, 4, 11}
- 10: {14, 1, 6, 3}
- 11: {0, 9}
- 12: {8, 0, 4, 2}
- 13: {8, 2, 3, 9, 7}
- 14: {4, 5, 10}

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes by degree (ascending order): [8, 11, 14, 10, 9, 4, 6, 1, 0, 5, 12, 3, 2, 7, 13]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 10, 6>, <2, 3, 13>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 10>, <4, 9, 13>, <4, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 7>
