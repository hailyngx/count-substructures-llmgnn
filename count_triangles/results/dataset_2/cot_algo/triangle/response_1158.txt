Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 28) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 8) (3, 13) (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 27) (10, 17) (10, 5) (10, 20) (7, 12) (7, 20) (7, 18) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 0) (29, 14) (29, 17) (29, 5) (24, 26) (24, 1) (26, 24) (26, 21) (26, 16) (6, 25) (6, 8) (6, 16) (21, 26) (21, 20) (21, 2) (11, 23) (11, 0) (23, 11) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 19) (16, 26) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 20) (4, 22) (4, 3) (4, 25) (19, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 29) (8, 22) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 27) (9, 28) (25, 6) (25, 4) (20, 10) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 21) (20, 16) (1, 24) (1, 2) (1, 28) (2, 13) (2, 15) (2, 21) (2, 1) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 28) (28, 13) (28, 9) (28, 1) (28, 18) (27, 17) (27, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method aims to count the number of triangles in the given graph. First, we sort the nodes based on their degrees from least to most connected:

Nodes by degree (in ascending order):
9, 23, 24, 1, 5, 7, 15, 29, 2, 19, 26, 4, 10, 12, 14, 18, 27, 3, 6, 11, 20, 22, 25, 8, 0, 13, 17, 21, 28, 16

Now, we will iterate through the edges only considering cases where the lower-degree node comes first to avoid duplicate counts.
