Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 11) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 11) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the graph is as follows:

Nodes Degrees:
0: 4
1: 2
2: 4
3: 4
4: 5
5: 3
6: 3
7: 4
8: 6
9: 3
10: 3
11: 4
12: 3
13: 6
14: 4

Based on the above degrees, we should check the following edges in order:

(1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7), (3, 10), (3, 6), (3, 12), (6, 10), (6, 14)

After checking these edges, we find the following triangles:
<1, 3, 6>, <3, 6, 10>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [2]
