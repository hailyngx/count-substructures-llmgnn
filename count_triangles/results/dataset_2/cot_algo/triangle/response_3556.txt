Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 19) (17, 6) (17, 7) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 5) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 15) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 18) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 16) (4, 12) (4, 14) (12, 13) (12, 4) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 16) (16, 3) (16, 15) (16, 7) (14, 4) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 18) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 8) (8, 18) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: {(6, 9), (6, 17), (6, 2), (9, 7), (10, 15), (10, 0), (10, 19), (17, 7), (0, 1), (0, 13), (2, 1), (3, 11), (3, 16), (3, 5), (11, 19), (5, 13), (13, 12), (15, 7), (15, 16), (4, 14), (1, 18), (18, 8)}

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Degree-Based Ordering: 
Vertices sorted by their number of connections: 
8(1) -> 4(1) -> 14(1) -> 6(3) -> 9(3) -> 10(3) -> 12(3) -> 17(3) -> 1(3) -> 19(4) -> 18(4) -> 7(5) -> 11(5) -> 5(5) -> 2(5) -> 16(5) -> 13(6) -> 0(6) -> 3(6) -> 15(6)

Triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 16]
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 13, 12>
<0, 13, 5>
<0, 1, 18>
<2, 1, 18>
<6, 2, 17>
<6, 2, 1>
<9, 7, 17>
<9, 6, 17>
<15, 10, 0>
