Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 22) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 13) (9, 23) (2, 16) (2, 28) (29, 25) (29, 23) (29, 4) (1, 3) (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 20) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 13) (21, 27) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 8) (20, 9) (20, 11) (20, 0) (26, 1) (26, 7) (26, 17) (28, 2) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 8) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 21) (13, 24) (24, 13) (24, 7) (19, 5) (19, 3) (15, 0) (7, 26) (7, 24) (7, 16) (7, 17) (25, 29) (25, 12) (23, 9) (23, 29) (23, 11) (23, 27) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 7) (16, 22) (6, 17) (6, 18) (4, 29) (4, 1) (4, 22) (22, 5) (22, 16) (22, 4) (8, 0) (8, 28) (17, 26) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 27) (18, 6) (18, 12) (14, 27) (27, 21) (27, 23) (27, 17) (27, 14) (12, 3) (12, 25) (12, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied as follows:

1. Count the degree of each node:

Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 2
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 1
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 1
Node 15: degree 1
Node 16: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 18: degree 2
Node 19: degree 2
Node 20: degree 4
Node 21: degree 4
Node 22: degree 3
Node 23: degree 4
Node 24: degree 2
Node 25: degree 2
Node 26: degree 3
Node 27: degree 4
Node 28: degree 4
Node 29: degree 3

2. Sort nodes based on their degree in ascending order:

Nodes by degree:
Node 10: degree 1
Node 14: degree 1
Node 15: degree 1
Node 18: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 19: degree 2
Node 24: degree 2
Node 25: degree 2
Node 6: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 12: degree 3
Node 22: degree 3
Node 29: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 26: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 20: degree 4
Node 21: degree 4
Node 27: degree 4
Node 28: degree 4
Node 23: degree 4
Node 11: degree 3

3. Count the triangles and calculate the total number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [25]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 13>
<0, 5, 16>
<0, 5, 22>
<0, 9, 20>
<0, 20, 28>
<1, 3, 19>
<1, 3, 26>
<1, 4, 21>
<1, 21, 28>
<3, 4, 1>
<3, 4, 29>
<5, 9, 13>
<5, 16, 22>
<7, 17, 26>
<9, 13, 21>
<11, 20, 23>
<13, 21, 27>
<16, 5, 22>
<17, 7, 27>
<17, 27, 21>
<21, 27, 23>
<24, 7, 26>
