Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 16) (9, 1) (8, 6) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 7) (2, 6) (2, 17) (2, 11) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 11) (0, 13) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 16) (1, 9) (1, 12) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 5) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 3) (4, 3) (12, 10) (12, 1) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 4) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 5) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 15) (7, 5) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 11) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
(0, 3), (0, 13), (1, 9), (1, 12), (2, 6), (2, 17), (3, 4), (3, 19), (4, 3), (5, 7), (5, 11), (5, 15), (5, 16), (6, 2), (6, 8), (6, 11), (6, 14), (7, 5), (7, 10), (7, 14), (7, 15), (7, 17), (8, 6), (8, 13), (9, 1), (9, 16), (10, 7), (10, 12), (10, 17), (11, 2), (11, 5), (11, 6), (11, 13), (11, 18), (12, 1), (12, 10), (13, 0), (13, 8), (13, 11), (14, 6), (14, 7), (14, 16), (15, 5), (15, 7), (15, 18), (16, 5), (16, 9), (16, 14), (17, 2), (17, 7), (17, 10), (17, 19), (18, 11), (18, 15), (18, 19), (19, 3), (19, 17), (19, 18)

Let's label the nodes based on their degree in increasing order:

Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 13: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5
Node 10: degree 5
Node 14: degree 5
Node 6: degree 6
Node 2: degree 6
Node 7: degree 6
Node 16: degree 6
Node 11: degree 7
Node 15: degree 7
Node 17: degree 7
Node 18: degree 7
Node 19: degree 7

Based on the above labeling, we will now count the triangles. 

[Number of triangles: 6]

<0, 3, 4>
<0, 13, 8>
<5, 7, 10>
<5, 7, 14>
<5, 11, 2>
<11, 15, 18>
