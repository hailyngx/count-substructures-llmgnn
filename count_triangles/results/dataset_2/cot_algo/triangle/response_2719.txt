Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 3) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 11) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (10, 6) (10, 9) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 
0: [8, 3, 5, 1]
1: [6, 13, 0, 14, 5]
2: [14, 5, 11]
3: [7, 8, 12, 0, 5]
4: [5, 14]
5: [4, 8, 0, 2, 1, 3]
6: [9, 1, 10]
7: [12, 3, 11, 13]
8: [13, 5, 0, 12, 3]
9: [6, 11, 10, 13]
10: [6, 9]
11: [9, 7, 13, 2]
12: [7, 8, 3]
13: [9, 7, 8, 11, 1, 14]
14: [4, 13, 1, 2]

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices should be relabeled as follows:
0 -> 1, 1 -> 4, 2 -> 2, 3 -> 3, 4 -> 8, 5 -> 5, 6 -> 6, 7 -> 9, 8 -> 7, 9 -> 10, 10 -> 11, 11 -> 12, 12 -> 13, 13 -> 14, 14 -> 0

The triangles found are as follows:
- <1, 14, 8>
- <1, 5, 4>
- <1, 5, 0>
- <1, 4, 14>
- <1, 13, 9>
- <1, 14, 4>
- <1, 0, 5>
- <1, 14, 13>
- <2, 5, 11>
- <3, 5, 0>
- <5, 8, 3>
- <5, 14, 13>
- <5, 13, 1>
- <5, 13, 9>
- <5, 9, 11>
- <5, 1, 14>
- <5, 11, 2>
