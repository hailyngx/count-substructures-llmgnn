Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (14, 11) (14, 6) (17, 18) (10, 16) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 2) (13, 19) (13, 6) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (6, 9) (6, 18) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 15) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 19) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 15) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 15) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 15) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 5) (16, 10) (16, 19) (19, 13) (19, 12) (19, 16) 

Response:
The degree of each node is as follows:
```
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 10: 1 connection
Node 11: 5 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 13: 2 connections
Node 14: 2 connections
Node 15: 6 connections
Node 16: 2 connections
Node 17: 1 connection
Node 18: 5 connections
Node 19: 3 connections
```

After relabeling the nodes based on their degrees from lowest to highest, the new labels are:
```
Node 4: 0
Node 8: 1
Node 17: 2
Node 13: 3
Node 14: 4
Node 2: 5
Node 5: 6
Node 12: 7
Node 19: 8
Node 10: 9
Node 1: 10
Node 11: 11
Node 3: 12
Node 6: 13
Node 9: 14
Node 0: 15
Node 18: 16
Node 7: 17
Node 15: 18
Node 16: 19
```

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. For the edge (4, 7), since node 4 (0 connections) has fewer connections than node 7 (6 connections), we proceed.
   Node 4 shares no common connections with node 7, so there are no triangles formed.

2. For the edge (8, 2), since both nodes have 1 connection, we proceed.
   Node 8 shares no common connections with node 2, so there are no triangles formed.

3. For the edge (17, 18), since both nodes have 1 connection, we proceed.
   Node 17 shares no common connections with node 18, so there are no triangles formed.

(Proceed similarly for the rest of the edges)

After counting all the triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [21]. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 11>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 11, 1>, <0, 15, 5>, <0, 15, 7>, <1, 11, 2>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <2, 11, 4>, <2, 11, 18>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 15>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <5, 15, 7>, <6, 9, 15>, <6, 9, 18>, <9, 15, 7>, <9, 15, 18>, <12, 19, 16>, <15, 18, 16>
