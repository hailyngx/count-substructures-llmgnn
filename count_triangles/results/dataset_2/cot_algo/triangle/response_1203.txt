Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 17) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 18) (14, 12) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 3) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 4) (18, 13) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 3) (13, 18) (13, 5) (13, 19) (1, 15) (1, 2) (17, 11) (17, 2) (15, 10) (15, 1) (15, 16) (15, 6) (8, 16) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 12) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 9) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 12) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 2) (7, 11) (6, 0) (6, 15) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 3) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 19) 

Response:
The given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(10, 15), (10, 3), (10, 19), (10, 2), (11, 7), (11, 18), (11, 17), 
(0, 6), (0, 9), (14, 18), (14, 12), (4, 18), (4, 19), (4, 5), (4, 3), 
(18, 11), (18, 14), (18, 4), (18, 13), (5, 4), (5, 13), (5, 3), 
(13, 18), (13, 5), (13, 19), (1, 15), (1, 2), (17, 11), (17, 2), 
(15, 10), (15, 1), (15, 16), (15, 6), (8, 16), (8, 3), (9, 0), 
(9, 16), (9, 12), (16, 15), (16, 8), (16, 9), (2, 10), (2, 1), 
(2, 17), (2, 12), (12, 14), (12, 9), (12, 2), (7, 11), (6, 0), 
(6, 15), (19, 10), (19, 4), (19, 13), (19, 3), (3, 10), (3, 4), 
(3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 19)

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method: 

[Total number of triangles: 12]

Unique triangles:
<2, 10, 15>
<2, 12, 14>
<2, 12, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 18>
<3, 4, 19>
<3, 8, 16>
<4, 13, 18>
<4, 13, 5>
<4, 18, 13>
<4, 19, 13>
<9, 12, 14>
