Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (4, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 19) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 16) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 13) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (12, 7) (12, 16) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 14) (17, 5) (17, 9) (15, 10) (15, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 2) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 12) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 2) (0, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 19) (2, 6) (14, 9) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: (5)
- 1: (3, 2, 16, 10)
- 2: (1, 10, 9, 19, 6)
- 3: (7, 1, 16)
- 4: (5, 16)
- 5: (4, 13, 17, 0)
- 6: (7, 18, 2)
- 7: (12, 3, 6, 19)
- 8: (13, 9)
- 9: (8, 17, 14, 2)
- 10: (1, 11, 15, 2)
- 11: (10, 19, 13)
- 12: (7, 16)
- 13: (11, 8, 5, 15)
- 14: (9)
- 15: (10, 13)
- 16: (4, 1, 3, 12)
- 17: (5, 9)
- 18: (19, 6)
- 19: (7, 11, 18, 2)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
(0): 1, (14): 1, (18): 1, (4): 2, (12): 2, (15): 2, (17): 2, (8): 2, (6): 3, (16): 4, (13): 4, (5): 4, (11): 4, (3): 4, (0): 5, (10): 5, (7): 5, (9): 5, (2): 6, (1): 6, (19): 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

1. Considering edge (4, 5):
   - Node 4 has degree 2, and node 5 has degree 4. Since 4 < 5, proceed.
   - Check for shared connections with nodes: 13 (5, 13, 4) - <4, 5, 13>.

2. Considering edge (4, 16):
   - Node 4 has degree 2, and node 16 has degree 4. Since 4 < 16, proceed.
   - Check for shared connections with nodes: 1 (4, 16, 1) - <1, 4, 16>.

3. Continue this process for all edges and count the total number of triangles.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4] <4, 5, 13>, <1, 4, 16>, <1, 10, 2>, <1, 2, 19>.
