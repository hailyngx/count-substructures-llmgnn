Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 6) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 22) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 20) (15, 3) (15, 24) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 25) (22, 21) (22, 23) (23, 22) (23, 0) (23, 20) (23, 9) (10, 13) (10, 29) (17, 18) (17, 29) (17, 13) (17, 11) (26, 25) (26, 27) (29, 10) (29, 17) (29, 20) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 14) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 28) (28, 11) (28, 4) (28, 19) (28, 13) (4, 28) (4, 27) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 2) (27, 26) (27, 4) (27, 16) (27, 6) (16, 12) (16, 27) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 28) (20, 3) (20, 23) (20, 29) (20, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (6, 1) (6, 27) (6, 25) (9, 23) (9, 20) (9, 24) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 25) (5, 24) (19, 28) (19, 4) (19, 2) (25, 18) (25, 26) (25, 6) (25, 2) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 23) (0, 4) (24, 15) (24, 9) (24, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort the nodes based on the number of edges (degree):
   - Node 28: degree 5
   - Node 4: degree 5
   - Node 27: degree 5
   - Node 11: degree 5
   - Node 17: degree 5
   - Node 20: degree 4
   - Node 2: degree 4
   - Node 12: degree 3
   - Node 13: degree 3
   - Node 14: degree 2
   - Node 6: degree 3
   - Node 7: degree 3
   - Node 9: degree 3
   - Node 15: degree 2
   - Node 18: degree 3
   - Node 25: degree 4
   - Node 29: degree 3
   - Node 1: degree 3
   - Node 23: degree 4
   - Node 16: degree 2
   - Node 24: degree 3
   - Node 10: degree 2
   - Node 19: degree 3
   - Node 21: degree 3
   - Node 22: degree 2
   - Node 5: degree 1
   - Node 8: degree 1
   - Node 3: degree 2
   - Node 0: degree 3
   - Node 26: degree 2

2. Start counting triangles:
   - Consider edges starting from nodes with lower degrees and connect them if the edge starts from the node with fewer connections.
   - Count triangles based on shared connections.

The total number of triangles is [21].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 23, 4>
<0, 23, 20>
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 4, 19>
<1, 21, 22>
<1, 21, 6>
<1, 21, 0>
<2, 4, 25>
<3, 11, 7>
<3, 15, 24>
<3, 15, 20>
<4, 27, 6>
<4, 28, 13>
<7, 11, 28>
<9, 20, 23>
<9, 20, 29>
<9, 20, 24>
<10, 13, 29>
<11, 17, 18>
<25, 18, 26>
