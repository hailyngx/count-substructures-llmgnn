Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 2, 7, 8
- Node 1: 9, 3, 6, 4, 0, 8
- Node 2: 5, 9, 0
- Node 3: 5, 1, 7, 6, 0
- Node 4: 5, 9, 1
- Node 5: 2, 4, 3
- Node 6: 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 9, 3, 0, 6
- Node 8: 1, 0, 6
- Node 9: 4, 2, 1, 7

Based on the degree-based ordering method and the given edges, we find the following triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 15]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 8, 6>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 1>
