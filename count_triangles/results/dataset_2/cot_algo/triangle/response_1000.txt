Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
Nodes sorted by their degrees are: 
```
Node 0: degree 2
Node 8: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 6: degree 6
Node 2: degree 6
Node 1: degree 7
```

Triangles found in the graph are:
```
