Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 1) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 14) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 10) (10, 4) (10, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method simplifies the process of counting triangles in the graph you provided. Let's start by sorting the nodes based on their degree:

Node 5 has degree 3
Node 9 has degree 5
Node 6 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 6
Node 11 has degree 4
Node 0 has degree 5
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 13 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 4
Node 12 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 5
Node 14 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 10 has degree 2

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 14 (degree 2)
Node 10 (degree 2)
Node 5 (degree 3)
Node 11 (degree 4)
Node 6 (degree 4)
Node 7 (degree 4)
Node 13 (degree 4)
Node 4 (degree 4)
Node 12 (degree 4)
Node 8 (degree 4)
Node 1 (degree 4)
Node 9 (degree 5)
Node 2 (degree 5)
Node 0 (degree 5)
Node 3 (degree 6)

Now, we will only consider edges where the node with the smaller label has fewer connections. Let's count the triangles formed by shared connections:

- Triangle <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle <0, 5, 7>
- Triangle <0, 9, 5>
- Triangle <0, 9, 7>
- Triangle <0, 11, 3>
- Triangle <1, 4, 9>
- Triangle <1, 4, 10>
- Triangle <1, 4, 13>
- Triangle <1, 7, 13>
- Triangle <1, 10, 4>
- Triangle <1, 10, 7>
- Triangle <2, 6, 13>
- Triangle <2, 7, 13>
- Triangle <2, 12, 8>
- Triangle <2, 12, 11>
- Triangle <3, 11, 0>
- Triangle <3, 11, 12>
- Triangle <3, 13, 2>
- Triangle <3, 13, 6>
- Triangle <4, 1, 9>
- Triangle <4, 1, 10>
- Triangle <4, 1, 13>
- Triangle <4, 3, 9>
- Triangle <4, 9, 1>
- Triangle <4, 9, 3>
- Triangle <5, 0, 9>
- Triangle <6, 0, 5>
- Triangle <7, 0, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [29].
