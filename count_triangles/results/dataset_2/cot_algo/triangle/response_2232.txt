Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 15) (16, 3) (16, 9) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 4) (10, 12) (10, 9) (10, 5) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 15) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 15) (18, 17) (18, 13) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 5) (19, 14) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 1) (2, 14) (2, 9) (12, 14) (12, 10) (3, 16) (3, 0) (6, 17) (6, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 1) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 7) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 19) (1, 5) (1, 9) (13, 18) (13, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their corresponding degrees:
Node 0 : degree 2
Node 1 : degree 3
Node 2 : degree 3
Node 3 : degree 2
Node 4 : degree 4
Node 5 : degree 6
Node 6 : degree 2
Node 7 : degree 3
Node 8 : degree 4
Node 9 : degree 5
Node 10 : degree 3
Node 11 : degree 3
Node 12 : degree 3
Node 13 : degree 2
Node 14 : degree 4
Node 15 : degree 4
Node 16 : degree 2
Node 17 : degree 4
Node 18 : degree 2
Node 19 : degree 4

Based on the degrees of the nodes, let's relabel the nodes:
Node 0 => Node 16
Node 1 => Node 18
Node 2 => Node 0
Node 3 => Node 6
Node 4 => Node 3
Node 5 => Node 15
Node 6 => Node 17
Node 7 => Node 13
Node 8 => Node 10
Node 9 => Node 7
Node 10 => Node 2
Node 11 => Node 5
Node 12 => Node 11
Node 13 => Node 4
Node 14 => Node 14
Node 15 => Node 8
Node 16 => Node 12
Node 17 => Node 19
Node 18 => Node 1
Node 19 => Node 9

After relabeling, the edges are as follows:
(5, 7), (5, 1), (11, 9), (14, 2), (17, 6), (13, 18), (14, 19), (19, 1), (17, 4), (5, 8), (8, 15), (10, 5), (12, 14), (3, 0), (14, 17), (19, 8), (4, 19), (7, 0), (3, 16), (8, 19), (9, 2), (17, 14), (15, 8), (10, 12), (7, 5), (4, 17), (9, 1)

By checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we find the following triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 8]
<10, 12, 14>
<5, 11, 9>
<4, 19, 8>
<10, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 1>
<14, 17, 4>
<14, 2, 19>
<5, 8, 15>
