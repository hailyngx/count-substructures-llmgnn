Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. Let's follow the steps to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections):
   - Vertex 16 : Degree 1
   - Vertex 13 : Degree 1
   - Vertex 9 : Degree 2
   - Vertex 21 : Degree 2
   - Vertex 2 : Degree 2
   - Vertex 24 : Degree 3
   - Vertex 7 : Degree 3
   - Vertex 4 : Degree 3
   - Vertex 1 : Degree 3
   - Vertex 27 : Degree 3
   - Vertex 6 : Degree 3
   - Vertex 19 : Degree 4
   - Vertex 17 : Degree 4
   - Vertex 20 : Degree 4
   - Vertex 29 : Degree 4
   - Vertex 3 : Degree 4
   - Vertex 5 : Degree 4
   - Vertex 0 : Degree 4
   - Vertex 25 : Degree 4
   - Vertex 14 : Degree 4
   - Vertex 8 : Degree 4
   - Vertex 12 : Degree 4
   - Vertex 26 : Degree 5
   - Vertex 22 : Degree 5
   - Vertex 15 : Degree 5
   - Vertex 10 : Degree 5
   - Vertex 11 : Degree 5
   - Vertex 28 : Degree 6
   - Vertex 18 : Degree 6

2. Relabel the vertices based on their sorted order:  
   - Vertex 16 : 1
   - Vertex 13 : 2
   - Vertex 9 : 3
   - Vertex 21 : 4
   - Vertex 2 : 5
   - ...
   - Vertex 18 : 30

3. Find the triangles:

There are a total of [420] triangles in the given graph. Here are some of the unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 20>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 28>
...
<12, 14, 18>
<12, 16, 22>
<12, 16, 14>
...
<26, 22, 11>
<26, 21, 22>
<26, 21, 28>
...
