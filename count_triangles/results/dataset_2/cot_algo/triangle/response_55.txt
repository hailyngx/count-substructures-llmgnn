Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 14) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 12) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) 

Response:
The nodes and edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 9), 
(1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 13), 
(2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 10), (2, 11), 
(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 13), (3, 11), 
(4, 6), (4, 10), (4, 12), 
(5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 13), 
(6, 4), (6, 9), (6, 14), 
(7, 8), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 12), 
(8, 1), (8, 7), (8, 13), (8, 14), 
(9, 0), (9, 6), (9, 14), 
(10, 2), (10, 4), (10, 7), 
(11, 2), (11, 3), (11, 7), (11, 13), (11, 14), 
(12, 4), (12, 7), (12, 14), 
(13, 1), (13, 3), (13, 5), (13, 8), (13, 11), (13, 12), 
(14, 6), (14, 8), (14, 9), (14, 11), (14, 12)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Vertices sorted by degree: 
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 11: 5 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 13: 6 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Vertices relabeled accordingly: 
0 -> 0, 6 -> 1, 4 -> 2, 9 -> 3, 10 -> 4, 12 -> 5, 3 -> 6, 5 -> 7, 1 -> 8, 8 -> 9, 13 -> 10, 7 -> 11, 11 -> 12, 2 -> 13, 14 -> 14

Using the relabeled vertices and given edges, we can find the triangles. 

Triangles: 
[<1, 2, 5>, <5, 11, 12>, <5, 9, 14>, <1, 6, 10>, <1, 8, 13>, <3, 6, 11>, <3, 6, 13>, <3, 11, 14>, <2, 4, 10>, <7, 8, 13>]

Total number of triangles: [10]
