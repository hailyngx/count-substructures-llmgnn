Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 11) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 16) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 18) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 11) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 0) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 6) (18, 7) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 0) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 19) (7, 5) (7, 18) (7, 1) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 0) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 4) (6, 18) (14, 18) (14, 16) (12, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 2) (16, 9) (16, 14) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in the graph efficiently.

Let's construct the graph first based on the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: (2, 11, 1, 19)
- 1: (0, 7, 12)
- 2: (10, 18, 13, 0)
- 3: (11, 13, 8)
- 4: (9, 8, 13, 6)
- 5: (7)
- 6: (15, 17, 4, 18)
- 7: (5, 1, 18)
- 8: (3, 15, 4, 11)
- 9: (4, 16)
- 10: (2, 19)
- 11: (3, 15, 8, 0)
- 12: (1)
- 13: (3, 4, 2)
- 14: (18, 16)
- 15: (6, 8)
- 16: (9, 14)
- 17: (6, 19, 18)
- 18: (17, 2, 14, 6, 7)
- 19: (10, 17, 0)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Degree: 1 - Nodes: 5, 12, 10, 16
Degree: 2 - Nodes: 9, 1
Degree: 3 - Nodes: 3, 5, 9, 12
Degree: 4 - Nodes: 7, 4, 14
Degree: 5 - Nodes: 15, 19
Degree: 6 - Nodes: 0, 18
Degree: 7 - Nodes: 11
Degree: 8 - Nodes: 8
Degree: 9 - Nodes: 6
Degree: 10 - Nodes: 17
Degree: 11 - Nodes: 13
Degree: 12 - Nodes: 2

Now, let's count the triangles:

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 11>
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 7, 18>
<0, 11, 15>
<0, 11, 8>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 12>
<0, 1, 19>
<1, 7, 18>
<4, 8, 11>
<4, 8, 13>
<4, 9, 16>
<6, 15, 8>
<6, 17, 19>
<6, 17, 18>
<11, 15, 8>
<13, 2, 3>
<13, 2, 4>
<13, 2, 14>
<13, 4, 6>
<13, 4, 8>
<14, 16, 9>
<14, 16, 18>
<16, 9, 4>
<18, 2, 14>
<18, 6, 15>
