Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to efficiently count triangles in the graph provided.

Let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

1. Node 9 has degree 4.
2. Node 0 has degree 4.
3. Node 3 has degree 2.
4. Node 8 has degree 3.
5. Node 7 has degree 4.
6. Node 6 has degree 4.
7. Node 5 has degree 4.
8. Node 4 has degree 6.
9. Node 2 has degree 5.
10. Node 1 has degree 4.

We will now check each edge to find the triangles:

1. Node 5 (degree 4) - Node 9 (degree 4): No triangles.
2. Node 5 (degree 4) - Node 2 (degree 5): Triangle formed with Node 9.
3. Node 5 (degree 4) - Node 8 (degree 3): No triangles.
4. Node 5 (degree 4) - Node 4 (degree 6): Triangle formed with Node 2.
5. Node 9 (degree 4) - Node 6 (degree 4): No triangles.
6. Node 9 (degree 4) - Node 1 (degree 4): No triangles.
7. Node 6 (degree 4) - Node 7 (degree 4): No triangles.
8. Node 4 (degree 6) - Node 7 (degree 4): No triangles.
9. Node 4 (degree 6) - Node 8 (degree 3): No triangles.
10. Node 4 (degree 6) - Node 0 (degree 4): Triangle formed with Node 5.
11. Node 4 (degree 6) - Node 1 (degree 4): No triangles.

By examining all combinations, we find that the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are <2, 5, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, and <2, 4, 5>.
