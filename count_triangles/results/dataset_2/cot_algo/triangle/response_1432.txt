Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently in the given graph. Let's follow the steps to find the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
   Node 7: Degree 4
   Node 8: Degree 3
   Node 2: Degree 3
   Node 5: Degree 3
   Node 1: Degree 5
   Node 3: Degree 4
   Node 0: Degree 4
   Node 9: Degree 4
   Node 6: Degree 5
   Node 4: Degree 6

2. Relabel the vertices according to their degrees:
   Nodes with the lowest degrees will have the lowest labels.

   Node 8: Label 0
   Node 2: Label 1
   Node 5: Label 2
   Node 3: Label 3
   Node 7: Label 4
   Node 0: Label 5
   Node 9: Label 6
   Node 6: Label 7
   Node 1: Label 8
   Node 4: Label 9

3. Check each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
   - Proceed with the edges: (8, 4), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 1), (5, 1).

4. Count the triangles formed by shared connections:
   - Triangle 1: <2, 4, 9>
   - Triangle 2: <2, 5, 1>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
