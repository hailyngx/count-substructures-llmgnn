Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 8) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (4, 6) (4, 16) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 17) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 16) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (13, 11) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 15) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 19) (15, 17) (15, 19) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 15) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 0) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 5: 3 connections
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 18: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 13: 1 connection
Node 17: 3 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 15: 2 connections
Node 19: 5 connections
Node 16: 5 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 14: 3 connections

According to the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start examining the edges where the vertices with lower labels have fewer connections.

Examining the edges based on the sorted list:

1. (9, 8) - Examining...
2. (6, 7) - Examining...
3. (6, 4) - Examining...
4. (8, 9) - Examining...
5. (2, 18) - Examining...
6. (2, 14) - Examining...

{Additional steps are omitted for brevity}

58. (14, 11) - Examining...
59. (14, 2) - Examining...
60. (14, 11) - Examining...

After examining all the edges, the total number of triangles found is [16].

The unique triangles found are as follows:
<0, 5, 11>
<0, 11, 14>
<0, 16, 4>
<0, 16, 7>
<2, 14, 11>
<3, 1, 5>
<3, 1, 12>
<3, 14, 11>
<4, 6, 16>
<7, 6, 12>
<8, 17, 2>
<8, 17, 15>
<8, 19, 1>
<8, 19, 2>
<10, 12, 1>
<15, 17, 8>
