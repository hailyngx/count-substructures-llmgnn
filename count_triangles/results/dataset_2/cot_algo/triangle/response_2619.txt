Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given edges:  

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Edges:  
- 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6  
- 1: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9  
- 2: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8  
- 3: 5, 6  
- 4: 0, 2, 7, 8  
- 5: 0, 1, 3, 7, 9  
- 6: 0, 1, 2, 3  
- 7: 2, 4, 5  
- 8: 1, 2, 4, 9  
- 9: 1, 5, 8  

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:  
Nodes in degree-based order: 3, 7, 9, 4, 8, 6, 2, 0, 1, 5  

Next, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles:  
Considering edges where the lower label node has fewer connections than the higher label node:

For edge (5, 9):  
- Both nodes have the same degree, so no triangles.  

For edge (5, 1):  
- Node 1 has more connections than node 5, so no triangles.  

For edge (5, 0):  
- Node 0 has fewer connections than node 5, forming a triangle with node 1.  

For edge (5, 3):  
- Node 3 has fewer connections than node 5, forming a triangle with node 6.  

For edge (5, 7):  
- Node 7 has fewer connections than node 5, forming a triangle with nodes 2 and 4.  

For edge (9, 8):  
- Node 8 has fewer connections than node 9, forming a triangle with node 4.  

For edge (4, 7):  
- Node 7 has more connections than node 4, so no triangles.  

For edge (4, 8):  
- Node 4 has fewer connections than node 8, forming a triangle with node 2.  

For edge (4, 2):  
- Node 2 has more connections than node 4, so no triangles.  

For edge (4, 0):  
- Node 0 has fewer connections than node 4, forming a triangle with nodes 1 and 6.  

Total number of triangles: [3]  
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 7>
