Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 1) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 11) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 2) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 10) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 3) (13, 2) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their connections:
0: [10, 8, 2]
1: [9, 3, 14]
2: [9, 14, 0, 13]
3: [1, 14, 6, 8]
4: [9, 7, 11]
5: [9, 6, 8, 12, 10]
6: [5, 3, 11]
7: [4, 12, 11, 10]
8: [5, 3, 0, 10]
9: [5, 4, 2, 1, 12, 14]
10: [5, 7, 0, 8]
11: [4, 7, 6, 14]
12: [5, 9, 7, 1]
13: [3, 2]
14: [9, 1, 3, 11, 2]

Next, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

There are [29] triangles in the graph.

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 8, 10>
<1, 9, 12>
<1, 11, 14>
<1, 3, 14>
<2, 9, 14>
<3, 8, 10>
<3, 9, 14>
<4, 7, 11>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 10>
<6, 7, 11>
<7, 10, 12>
<9, 12, 14>
<9, 5, 12>
