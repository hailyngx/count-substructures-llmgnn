Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 10) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 0) (2, 11) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
The given graph with nodes and edges is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 13), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 14), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 14), (9, 10), (4, 9), (4, 10), (7, 5), (7, 12), (7, 3), (7, 10), (1, 6), (1, 14), (1, 0), (3, 7), (3, 11), (3, 0), (3, 12), (3, 8), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 13), (8, 5), (8, 3), (8, 13), (8, 0), (13, 5), (13, 6), (13, 8), (13, 12), (13, 11), (13, 14), (10, 9), (10, 4), (10, 7), (10, 11), (11, 3), (11, 13), (11, 10), (11, 0), (11, 2), (12, 7), (12, 3), (12, 13), (12, 0), (2, 11), (2, 14), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 11), (0, 12), 
(14, 5), (14, 9), (14, 1), (14, 13), (14, 2)

Now, sort the nodes based on degree (number of connections):
Nodes by degree: 2, 4, 10, 12, 1, 6, 8, 0, 11, 14, 3, 7, 5, 9, 13

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Triangles: [15]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 8, 13>, <0, 11, 13>, <0, 12, 14>, 
<2, 11, 14>, <2, 11, 0>, <4, 9, 10>, <5, 7, 14>, <5, 8, 13>, <6, 1, 14>, <6, 9, 13>,
<7, 3, 12>, <9, 4, 10>, <11, 10, 13>
