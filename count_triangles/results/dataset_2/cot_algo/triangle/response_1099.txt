Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 10) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
- Edges: (5, 8), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 14), (9, 8), (9, 11), (9, 10), (9, 1), (9, 12), (4, 0), (4, 10), (4, 2), (7, 5), (7, 12), (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 13), (8, 2), (8, 3), (13, 8), (13, 2), (13, 3), (13, 14), (13, 0), (12, 9), (12, 7), (12, 6), (12, 3), (0, 4), (0, 13), (0, 14), (0, 10), (0, 3), (0, 11), (14, 5), (14, 13), (14, 0), (14, 6), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 13), (2, 11), (10, 9), (10, 4), (10, 0), (10, 1), (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 13), (3, 12), (3, 0), (3, 6), (6, 12), (6, 14), (6, 3), (1, 9), (1, 10), (11, 9), (11, 0), (11, 2)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

Sorted Vertices by their degrees:
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 9: 6 connections

Triangles Found:
- <0, 3, 13>
- <0, 4, 10>
- <0, 4, 13>
- <0, 10, 13>
- <2, 8, 13>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <2, 8, 3>
- <3, 6, 12>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <3, 5, 8>
- <3, 7, 12>
- <5, 7, 14>
- <5, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [13]
