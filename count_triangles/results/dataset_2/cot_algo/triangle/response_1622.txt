Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 24) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 29) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 26) (21, 7) (21, 17) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 2) (25, 19) (25, 23) (25, 10) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 2) (3, 26) (8, 20) (8, 11) (8, 6) (23, 25) (23, 15) (0, 20) (0, 5) (0, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 29) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (17, 21) (17, 1) (17, 29) (29, 22) (29, 5) (29, 17) (29, 18) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 11) (26, 22) (26, 7) (26, 3) (26, 15) (9, 22) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 27) (16, 28) (16, 15) (28, 16) (28, 18) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 19) (24, 13) (24, 7) (19, 25) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 14) (15, 23) (15, 26) (15, 16) (2, 20) (2, 1) (4, 13) (4, 19) (10, 25) (10, 6) (10, 9) (18, 5) (18, 29) (18, 12) (18, 28) (18, 27) (27, 9) (27, 18) (14, 13) (14, 19) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 16, 28, 3, 24, 21, 29, 2, 1, 0, 7, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 9, 11, 13, 18, 14, 27.

The triangles in the graph are:
[<1, 2, 20>, <1, 2, 17>, <1, 2, 25>, <1, 2, 11>, <1, 2, 19>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 14>, <1, 4, 13>, <1, 4, 19>, <1, 4, 14>, <1, 17, 21>, <1, 17, 29>, <1, 17, 2>, <1, 17, 11>, <1, 17, 19>, <1, 11, 8>, <1, 11, 12>, <1, 11, 19>, <1, 19, 25>, <1, 19, 4>, <1, 19, 14>, <1, 25, 20>, <1, 25, 2>, <2, 20, 0>, <2, 20, 8>, <2, 20, 25>, <2, 20, 1>, <2, 20, 17>, <2, 20, 11>, <2, 20, 19>, <2, 25, 19>, <2, 25, 1>, <4, 13, 14>, <4, 13, 19>, <4, 19, 14>, <5, 0, 20>, <5, 0, 9>, <5, 0, 29>, <5, 0, 29>, <5, 0, 18>, <5, 0, 6>, <5, 6, 8>, <5,...<27, 18, 9>, <27, 18, 18>, <14, 13, 19>]

Total number of triangles: [87]
