Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: (4, 6, 7)
- 1: (3, 5, 6)
- 2: (4, 5, 6)
- 3: (1, 5, 6, 7)
- 4: (0, 2, 6, 8, 9)
- 5: (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9)
- 6: (0, 1, 3, 4, 8)
- 7: (0, 3, 5, 9)
- 8: (4, 6, 9)
- 9: (5, 7, 8)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method by sorting the nodes based on their degrees and relabeling them accordingly:

Nodes sorted by degree:
0(3), 1(3), 2(3), 7(4), 8(3), 6(5), 4(5), 3(4), 5(6), 9(3)

Now, we will check for triangles by following the method explained above:

Triangles:
- <0, 4, 6>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <4, 8, 9>
- <5, 7, 9>
- <6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
