Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 8) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 14) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the total number of triangles in the graph efficiently. 

After labeling the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order, the graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0(3), 1(3), 2(3), 3(4), 4(4), 5(4), 6(3), 7(5), 8(4), 9(5), 10(4), 11(5), 12(3), 13(4), 14(5)

Now, we will only consider the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:
(0, 3), (0, 9), (0, 11), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 14), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 10), (5, 11), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 12), (7, 13), (7, 14), (8, 14), (9, 10), (9, 14), (10, 11)

By analyzing the shared connections, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 3, 11>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 9, 14>, <1, 3, 12>, <4, 5, 10>, <4, 6, 11>, <4, 9, 10>, <5, 10, 11>, <7, 8, 14>, <7, 12, 14>, <7, 13, 14>, <9, 10, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
