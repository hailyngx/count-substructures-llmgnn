Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 9) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 0) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 6, and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 11, 2, and 14.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 13, 11, 6, and 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 11, 10, 6, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 12, 9, 0, and 14.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 13, 10.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 8, 13, 2, and 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 10, 5, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 13, 14, 0, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 12, and 11.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 7, 3, 5.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 9, and 2.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 13, and 9.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 5, 12, 2, and 6.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 8.

Now, we will sort the nodes by their degree:

Nodes by degree: 1, 5, 9, 10, 14, 0, 6, 2, 3, 12, 7, 13, 8, 4, 11

Calculating the triangles according to the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 4, 14>
- <0, 8, 14>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <0, 6, 2>
- <0, 2, 1>
- <0, 2, 6>
- <1, 2, 14>
- <3, 6, 13>
- <3, 6, 2>
- <3, 8, 14>
- <4, 12, 13>
- <5, 7, 10>
- <5, 7, 13>
- <7, 8, 14>
- <8, 12, 13>
- <8, 12, 9>
- <8, 13, 6>
- <9, 11, 12>
- <11, 1, 14>
