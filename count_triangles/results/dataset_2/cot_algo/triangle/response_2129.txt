Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 11) (14, 17) (14, 10) (17, 14) (10, 14) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 15) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 3) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (0, 19) (2, 7) (2, 19) (2, 3) (1, 10) (1, 6) (15, 10) (15, 8) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 19) (16, 13) (16, 7) (16, 19) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 16) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 18) (18, 7) (18, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the vertices in ascending order is as follows:
Vertex 0: Degree 1
Vertex 5: Degree 3
Vertex 9: Degree 3
Vertex 14: Degree 2
Vertex 17: Degree 1
Vertex 8: Degree 2
Vertex 13: Degree 3
Vertex 6: Degree 3
Vertex 16: Degree 3
Vertex 19: Degree 5
Vertex 4: Degree 3
Vertex 11: Degree 4
Vertex 7: Degree 5
Vertex 12: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 5
Vertex 2: Degree 4
Vertex 1: Degree 2
Vertex 15: Degree 2
Vertex 10: Degree 5
Vertex 18: Degree 2

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles by considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

There are 16 triangles in total: [<3, 12, 4>, <3, 12, 7>, <3, 12, 10>, <3, 12, 2>, <3, 19, 16>, <3, 19, 6>, <3, 19, 4>, <3, 19, 2>, <6, 1, 10>, <7, 12, 10>, <7, 12, 4>, <7, 12, 3>, <7, 16, 19>, <10, 12, 4>, <10, 12, 7>, <10, 12, 3>].

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [16].
