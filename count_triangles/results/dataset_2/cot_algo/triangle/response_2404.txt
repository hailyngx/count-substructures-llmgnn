Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (11, 14) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 11) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 10) 

Response:
The vertices based on their number of connections (degree) from least to most are:  
Node 11: degree 1  
Node 5: degree 2  
Node 7: degree 2  
Node 4: degree 2  
Node 12: degree 3  
Node 0: degree 3  
Node 7: degree 3  
Node 11: degree 3  
Node 5: degree 4  
Node 12: degree 4  
Node 2: degree 4  
Node 4: degree 4  
Node 1: degree 4  
Node 13: degree 4  
Node 8: degree 5  
Node 9: degree 8  
Node 6: degree 8

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Triangle <0, 10, 13>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 10>
4. Triangle <0, 6, 10>
5. Triangle <1, 10, 14>
6. Triangle <1, 12, 4>
7. Triangle <1, 14, 3>
8. Triangle <2, 9, 6>
9. Triangle <2, 9, 1>
10. Triangle <2, 9, 14>
11. Triangle <3, 13, 4>
12. Triangle <3, 13, 6>
13. Triangle <4, 12, 1>
14. Triangle <6, 9, 2>
15. Triangle <6, 9, 10>
16. Triangle <6, 9, 14>
17. Triangle <8, 14, 3>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
