Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 28) (3, 23) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 16) (28, 3) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 22) (29, 26) (29, 15) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 5) (19, 5) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 21) (26, 29) (26, 10) (26, 17) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 19) (21, 18) (21, 25) (9, 8) (9, 22) (22, 28) (22, 19) (22, 9) (17, 1) (17, 26) (17, 15) (17, 11) (4, 12) (4, 0) (27, 2) (27, 20) (27, 23) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 0) (20, 27) (20, 14) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 16) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 24) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 24) (10, 26) (10, 2) (18, 19) (18, 21) (24, 16) (24, 12) (24, 7) (2, 1) (2, 27) (2, 10) (2, 14) (7, 8) (7, 24) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 15) (23, 3) (23, 27) (23, 25) (25, 21) (25, 23) (25, 15) (14, 20) (14, 2) (15, 29) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 25) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are as follows:  

0 (degree 3), 7 (degree 3), 4 (degree 3), 9 (degree 3), 14 (degree 2), 10 (degree 2), 12 (degree 2), 18 (degree 2), 20 (degree 2), 24 (degree 3), 5 (degree 3), 27 (degree 3), 1 (degree 3), 2 (degree 4), 6 (degree 5), 8 (degree 3), 13 (degree 4), 26 (degree 3), 3 (degree 3), 11 (degree 4), 16 (degree 3), 17 (degree 4), 15 (degree 4), 19 (degree 4), 21 (degree 5), 22 (degree 4), 23 (degree 3), 25 (degree 3), 28 (degree 4), 29 (degree 2)  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. We will check for shared connections to count the triangles.

After analyzing the given graph, the total number of triangles is [45].  

The unique triangles found are:
