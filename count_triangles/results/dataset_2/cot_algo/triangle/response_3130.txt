Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 27) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 20) (4, 15) (7, 19) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 23) (3, 22) (8, 1) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 15) (18, 9) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 28) (22, 3) (22, 18) (22, 5) (22, 15) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 20) (29, 16) (29, 23) (29, 12) (5, 22) (5, 6) (5, 24) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 19) (14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 20) (17, 7) (17, 14) (17, 28) (17, 21) (21, 13) (21, 17) (21, 0) (28, 18) (28, 14) (28, 17) (28, 10) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 6) (23, 3) (23, 29) (11, 15) (12, 4) (12, 29) (12, 6) (12, 10) (25, 9) (25, 16) (27, 9) (27, 24) (27, 20) (10, 3) (10, 28) (10, 12) (24, 5) (24, 27) (0, 3) (0, 21) (0, 15) (20, 4) (20, 2) (20, 14) (20, 27) (16, 2) (16, 29) (16, 25) (15, 4) (15, 13) (15, 22) (15, 11) (15, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
(9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 27)
(4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 20) (4, 15)
(7, 19) (7, 17)
(1, 3) (1, 8)
(3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 23) (3, 22)
(8, 13)
(13, 21) (13, 15)
(18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 28)
(22, 5)
(2, 16)
(29, 23) (29, 12)
(5, 6) (5, 24)
(6, 19)
(14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 20)
(17, 21)
(21, 0)
(10, 28) (10, 12)
(27, 24) (27, 20)
(25, 16)
(11, 15)

Next, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Degree 0: 11, 26
Degree 1: 9, 7, 1, 8, 0, 10, 28, 27, 21, 25
Degree 2: 5, 6, 2, 29
Degree 3: 4, 17, 16
Degree 4: 19, 13, 18, 22, 3, 12, 24, 20, 14
Degree 5: 15

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [<0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 22>, <0, 15, 4>, <0, 15, 11>, <1, 3, 22>, <3, 12, 4>, <3, 18, 22>, <3, 22, 15>, <4, 12, 6>, <4, 15, 11>, <4, 15, 13>, <4, 15, 22>, <12, 6, 19>, <12, 10, 3>, <12, 10, 28>, <15, 11, 0>, <15, 13, 18>, <15, 13, 21>, <15, 22, 18>]

Total number of triangles: [18]
