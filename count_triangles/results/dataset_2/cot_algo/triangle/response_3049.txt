Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 4) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 10) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 8) (2, 16) (2, 5) (2, 13) (18, 9) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 17) (12, 7) (0, 10) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 13) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 4) (9, 18) (9, 4) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 1) (4, 16) (4, 19) (4, 9) (4, 6) (13, 2) (13, 18) (13, 14) (6, 11) (6, 10) (6, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. Here is the list of vertices with their degrees:

(0: 2), (1: 2), (9: 2), (5: 3), (18: 2), (19: 2), (12: 3), (7: 4), (4: 4), (13: 3), (8: 4), (15: 3), (10: 4), (2: 3), (6: 3), (3: 4), (17: 4), (11: 3), (14: 4), (16: 3)

Now, we will process the edges based on the degree-based ordering method:

Edge (0, 10) - Processed.
Edge (0, 14) - Processed as triangle <0, 10, 14>.
Edge (0, 14) - Ignored as it has already been processed.
Edge (1, 5) - Processed.
Edge (1, 7) - Processed.
Edge (2, 5) - Processed.
Edge (2, 13) - Processed.
Edge (2, 16) - Processed.
Edge (3, 11) - Processed.
Edge (3, 14) - Processed.
Edge (3, 15) - Processed.
Edge (3, 17) - Processed.
Edge (4, 6) - Processed.
Edge (4, 9) - Processed.

Edge (4, 19) - Processed.
Edge (5, 10) - Processed.
Edge (6, 10) - Processed.
Edge (6, 11) - Processed.
Edge (6, 4) - Processed.
Edge (7, 12) - Processed.
Edge (7, 14) - Processed.
Edge (7, 8) - Processed.
Edge (7, 1) - Ignored based on the ordering.
Edge (8, 7) - Processed.
Edge (8, 16) - Processed.
Edge (8, 17) - Processed.

Edge (12, 17) - Processed.
Edge (12, 7) - Processed.
Edge (13, 2) - Processed.
Edge (13, 14) - Processed.

Edge (14, 0) - Processed as triangle <0, 10, 14>.
Edge (14, 3) - Processed.
Edge (14, 7) - Processed.
Edge (15, 10) - Processed.
Edge (15, 3) - Processed.
Edge (16, 2) - Processed.
Edge (16, 4) - Processed.

Edge (19, 8) - Processed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2], and the unique triangles found are <0, 10, 14> and <4, 6, 16>.
