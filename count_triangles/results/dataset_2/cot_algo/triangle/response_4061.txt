Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 2) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 2) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 1) (13, 9) (13, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method begins by sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:

Nodes and their degrees:
1 (degree 6)
7 (degree 6)
11 (degree 6)
14 (degree 6)
4 (degree 2)
8 (degree 3)
0 (degree 4)
12 (degree 4)
2 (degree 4)
13 (degree 2)
5 (degree 4)
9 (degree 6)
6 (degree 4)
10 (degree 4)
3 (degree 6)

Nodes relabeled based on their degrees:
1→0, 7→1, 11→2, 14→3, 4→4, 8→5, 0→6, 12→7, 2→8, 13→9, 5→10, 9→11, 6→12, 10→13, 3→14

Now we will count the number of triangles using the given edges and the relabeled vertices:

Triangles:
1. <1, 4, 12>
2. <1, 4, 7>
3. <1, 0, 7>
4. <1, 7, 14>
5. <1, 14, 3>
6. <7, 4, 12>
7. <7, 4, 13>
8. <7, 12, 5>
9. <7, 0, 6>
10. <11, 6, 1>
11. <11, 6, 0>
12. <11, 6, 3>
13. <11, 6, 10>
14. <11, 1, 0>
15. <11, 10, 14>
16. <5, 9, 10>
17. <5, 9, 7>
18. <5, 9, 6>
19. <5, 9, 12>
20. <5, 10, 14>
21. <9, 6, 3>
22. <9, 6, 11>
23. <9, 6, 0>
24. <9, 6, 10> 

Count of triangles: [24]
