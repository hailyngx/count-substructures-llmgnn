Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 3) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node ID: Degree (Sorted)

0: 4
3: 4
5: 3
14: 2
6: 5
9: 4
1: 4
11: 4
12: 4
2: 5
4: 4
10: 5
7: 4
13: 5
8: 5

Applying the method to find triangles in the graph:

Triangles: [48]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 7, 3>
<2, 7, 13>
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 8, 13>
<6, 11, 5>
<6, 12, 4>
<5, 10, 12>
<4, 10, 3>
<7, 0, 3>
<8, 9, 13>
<8, 13, 2>
<13, 7, 2>
<12, 6, 11>
<11, 4, 12>
<10, 5, 11>
