Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 13) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 8) (29, 15) (29, 14) (18, 22) (18, 23) (18, 20) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 15) (22, 17) (0, 1) (27, 12) (12, 27) (12, 21) (20, 18) (20, 17) (20, 28) (1, 0) (1, 26) (1, 25) (26, 1) (26, 14) (26, 10) (17, 29) (17, 22) (17, 20) (17, 11) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 16) (8, 29) (8, 19) (8, 11) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 24) (14, 10) (7, 19) (7, 3) (16, 19) (16, 21) (16, 6) (21, 12) (21, 16) (21, 11) (10, 26) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (4, 10) (4, 25) (4, 6) (23, 18) (23, 6) (23, 24) (9, 28) (25, 1) (25, 4) (25, 5) (25, 28) (13, 2) (13, 18) (13, 3) (28, 20) (28, 9) (28, 25) (5, 10) (5, 3) (5, 25) (11, 17) (11, 8) (11, 21) (6, 16) (6, 4) (6, 23) (6, 15) (15, 29) (15, 22) (15, 6) (24, 2) (24, 14) (24, 23) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. 

The sorted vertices are:
(9, 0, 27, 1, 7, 19, 12, 20, 23, 25, 28, 16, 3, 13, 29, 11, 17, 8, 22, 26, 10, 14, 18, 4, 6, 15, 21, 5, 24)

Using this ordering, we can go through the edges and count the total number of triangles.

The total number of triangles is found to be 6: 
[6]

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 5, 25>
<10, 14, 26>
<6, 15, 23>
<3, 13, 29>
<16, 21, 11>
<17, 20, 22>
