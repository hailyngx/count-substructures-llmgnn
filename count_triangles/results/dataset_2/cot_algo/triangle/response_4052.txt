Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 19) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 16) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 14) (13, 11) (1, 10) (1, 18) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 18) (8, 6) (8, 12) (16, 0) (16, 2) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 6) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 5) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 6) (17, 12) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 12) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first by visualizing the nodes and their connections. Then we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 16), (0, 12), (0, 6),
(1, 10), (1, 18),
(2, 4), (2, 16),
(3, 15), (3, 14),
(4, 15), (4, 7), (4, 10), (4, 5), (4, 2),
(5, 4), (5, 19), (5, 14),
(6, 15), (6, 0), (6, 8), (6, 18), (6, 12),
(7, 15), (7, 4), (7, 19),
(8, 6), (8, 12),
(9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 12),
(10, 4), (10, 11), (10, 1), (10, 9), (10, 14),
(11, 10), (11, 9), (11, 13),
(12, 0), (12, 8), (12, 9), (12, 17), (12, 6),
(13, 11),
(14, 3), (14, 5), (14, 10),
(15, 3), (15, 7), (15, 6), (15, 4),
(16, 0), (16, 2),
(17, 12),
(18, 1), (18, 19), (18, 6),
(19, 7), (19, 5), (19, 18)

Next, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. Let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Vertices sorted by degree: (with number of connections)
13(1), 17(1), 11(2), 1(2), 3(2), 9(3), 13(3), 16(3), 18(3), 8(4), 5(4), 7(4), 0(4), 2(4), 19(4), 14(4), 12(5), 6(5), 10(5), 15(5), 4(6)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 7]

<0, 2, 4>, <0, 6, 12>, <4, 5, 14>, <4, 7, 15>, <4, 10, 14>, <6, 8, 12>, <6, 12, 18>
