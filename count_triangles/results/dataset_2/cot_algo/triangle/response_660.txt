Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 0) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 0 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 8 has degree 5
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 6 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 4

Now, starting with the edge between nodes 4 and 7, since 4 has a lower label and fewer connections compared to 7, we will check for shared connections to count triangles:
- Nodes [7, 9, 6] form a triangle <7, 9, 6>.

Continue the same process for all the edges:

Edge (4, 7):
- Nodes [7, 9, 6] form a triangle <7, 9, 6>.

Edge (4, 9):
- No triangles formed.

Edge (4, 1):
- Nodes [1, 7, 2] form a triangle <1, 7, 2>.

Edge (4, 6):
- Nodes [6, 9, 7] form a triangle <6, 9, 7>.

Edge (7, 9):
- No triangles formed.

Edge (7, 1):
- No triangles formed.

Edge (7, 8):
- Nodes [8, 9, 6] form a triangle <8, 9, 6>.

... (Continue this process for all edges)

After examining all the edges, the total number of triangles found in the graph is [3]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<7, 9, 6>
<1, 7, 2>
<6, 9, 8>
