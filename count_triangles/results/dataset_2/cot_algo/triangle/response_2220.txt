Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 13) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order. The unique triangles will be found by examining shared connections between vertices.

The sorted nodes are as follows:
0 (degree 4)
3 (degree 4)
11 (degree 5)
9 (degree 5)
8 (degree 5)
6 (degree 5)
13 (degree 5)
12 (degree 5)
2 (degree 6)
7 (degree 6)
1 (degree 6)
14 (degree 6)
10 (degree 7)
5 (degree 7)
4 (degree 7)

Now, we will count the triangles:

1. For the edge (5, 9):
    - 5 shares connections with 0, 1, 6, 12, 14
    - 9 shares connections with 0, 4
    - Shared connections: 0
    - Triangle <5, 9, 0>

2. For the edge (5, 6):
    - 5 shares connections with 0, 1, 9, 12, 14
    - 6 shares connections with 2, 8
    - Shared connections: None
    - No triangle

3. For the edge (5, 12):
    - 5 shares connections with 0, 1, 6, 9, 14
    - 12 shares connections with 3, 13
    - Shared connections: None
    - No triangle

4. For the edge (5, 1):
    - 5 shares connections with 0, 6, 9, 12, 14
    - 1 shares connections with 0, 4, 8
    - Shared connections: 0
    - Triangle <5, 1, 0>

5. For the edge (5, 0):
    - 5 shares connections with 1, 6, 9, 12, 14
    - 0 shares connections with 7, 13
    - Shared connections: None
    - No triangle

6. For the edge (5, 14):
    - 5 shares connections with 0, 1, 6, 9, 12
    - 14 shares connections with 4, 7, 10, 11
    - Shared connections: None
    - No triangle

[Total number of triangles: 2]
Unique triangles found: <5, 9, 0>, <5, 1, 0>
