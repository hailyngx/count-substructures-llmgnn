Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 17) (15, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (10, 13) (10, 16) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (2, 15) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 9) (4, 13) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 5) (11, 14) (9, 19) (9, 18) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 13) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 17) (6, 2) (6, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 16) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 18) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. 
Here are the vertices rearranged with their respective connections:

Node 11: 1 connection
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 19: 2 connections
Node 17: 3 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 16: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 18: 5 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 12: 4 connections

Now, we will check each edge based on the above ordering, ensuring that the lower labeled node has fewer connections.
