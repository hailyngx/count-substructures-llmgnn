Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 2) (18, 9) (18, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 17) (5, 13) (5, 16) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 9) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 9) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 14) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 12) (12, 10) (12, 19) (12, 16) (11, 19) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 9) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 6) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 12) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 11) (3, 18) (3, 13) (3, 17) (7, 11) (6, 14) (6, 17) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

- Relabel the nodes based on the number of connections each node has in ascending order.
- Nodes with their connection counts:
    - Node 0: 0 connections
    - Node 7: 1 connection
    - Node 4: 1 connection
    - Node 18: 1 connection
    - Node 2: 2 connections
    - Node 5: 3 connections
    - Node 1: 4 connections
    - Node 6: 4 connections
    - Node 17: 4 connections
    - Node 10: 4 connections
    - Node 19: 5 connections
    - Node 12: 5 connections
    - Node 11: 5 connections
    - Node 16: 5 connections
    - Node 9: 6 connections
    - Node 3: 6 connections
    - Node 13: 6 connections
    - Node 8: 6 connections
    - Node 14: 7 connections
    - Node 15: 7 connections

Counting the number of triangles:

- Triangle 1: <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle 2: <1, 13, 15>
- Triangle 3: <1, 13, 9>
- Triangle 4: <1, 15, 9>
- Triangle 5: <1, 9, 11>
- Triangle 6: <1, 9, 18>
- Triangle 7: <1, 13, 3>
- Triangle 8: <1, 16, 5>
- Triangle 9: <5, 14, 16>
- Triangle 10: <5, 13, 1>
- Triangle 11: <5, 13, 15>
- Triangle 12: <5, 13, 3>
- Triangle 13: <6, 14, 11>
- Triangle 14: <6, 17, 3>
- Triangle 15: <9, 11, 19>
- Triangle 16: <9, 11, 14>
- Triangle 17: <9, 11, 7>
- Triangle 18: <9, 18, 3>
- Triangle 19: <11, 14, 6>
- Triangle 20: <11, 14, 5>
- Triangle 21: <11, 19, 12>
- Triangle 22: <13, 15, 1>
- Triangle 23: <13, 15, 9>
- Triangle 24: <14, 5, 16>
- Triangle 25: <14, 5, 13>
- Triangle 26: <14, 6, 17>
- Triangle 27: <15, 1, 16>
- Triangle 28: <16, 12, 19>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [28].
