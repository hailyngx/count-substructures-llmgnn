Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 14) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 7) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 13) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the given nodes and edges.

Now, let's find the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections (degree):
   - Node 3 (degree 2)
   - Node 4 (degree 3)
   - Node 7 (degree 3)
   - Node 5 (degree 3)
   - Node 10 (degree 4)
   - Node 13 (degree 4)
   - Node 0 (degree 5)
   - Node 14 (degree 5)
   - Node 1 (degree 5)
   - Node 2 (degree 5)
   - Node 8 (degree 5)
   - Node 9 (degree 5)
   - Node 11 (degree 6)
   - Node 6 (degree 7)
   - Node 12 (degree 7)

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   - Node 3 (0)
   - Node 4 (1)
   - Node 7 (2)
   - Node 5 (3)
   - Node 10 (4)
   - Node 13 (5)
   - Node 0 (6)
   - Node 14 (7)
   - Node 1 (8)
   - Node 2 (9)
   - Node 8 (10)
   - Node 9 (11)
   - Node 11 (12)
   - Node 6 (13)
   - Node 12 (14)

3. Count the triangles:
   - Triangles: 16
   - Unique triangles: <1, 4, 11>, <2, 7, 11>, <2, 11, 13>, <2, 13, 14>, <4, 8, 11>, <4, 11, 12>, <6, 8, 11>, <6, 11, 12>, <6, 8, 12>, <7, 11, 12>, <8, 10, 12>, <8, 10, 14>, <11, 12, 14>, <13, 14, 7>, <13, 14, 11>, <13, 14, 5>

Finally, the total number of triangles is [16].
