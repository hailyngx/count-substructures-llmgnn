Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 13) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 20) (26, 25) (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 28) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 25) (3, 25) (3, 23) (25, 26) (25, 21) (25, 3) (25, 16) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 18) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 7) (15, 1) (15, 20) (15, 22) (15, 14) (15, 12) (20, 26) (20, 15) (20, 8) (4, 6) (18, 11) (18, 23) (18, 29) (7, 10) (7, 17) (12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 8) (5, 26) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (23, 3) (23, 10) (23, 18) (2, 17) (2, 22) (2, 19) (22, 15) (22, 2) (22, 28) (22, 29) (16, 25) (16, 12) (16, 27) (14, 15) (14, 8) (14, 28) (14, 19) (0, 1) (0, 8) (28, 1) (28, 22) (28, 14) (8, 20) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 0) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 29) (19, 27) (27, 21) (27, 16) (27, 19) (29, 18) (29, 22) (29, 19) (13, 9) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed and vertices have been relabeled based on their degree. Here are the new edges:
Edges: (1, 4) (1, 8), (1, 10), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 6), (4, 16), (1, 13), (8, 7), (8, 5), (8, 19), (8, 20), (13, 8), (13, 14), (13, 16), (2, 16), (2, 18), (16, 4), (16, 8), (16, 2), (16, 10), (10, 11), (10, 17), (10, 7), (10, 18), (11, 10), (11, 19), (17, 10), (17, 14), (17, 7), (14, 8), (14, 19), (14, 18), (14, 12), (14, 6), (19, 8), (19, 14), (19, 1), (6, 4), (18, 2), (18, 16), (18, 20), (7, 8), (7, 17), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 20), (12, 6), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 12), (3, 2), (3, 16), (3, 18), (20, 12), (20, 18), (20, 5), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 11), (0, 19)

Based on these edges, the number of triangles inside brackets [] is [30].

Unique triangles found are:
