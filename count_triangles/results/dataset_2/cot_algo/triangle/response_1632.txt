Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 0), 
(9, 6), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 7), 
(4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 3), 
(7, 9), (7, 3), (7, 8), 
(1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 2), 
(3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 2), (3, 8), 
(6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 2), (6, 0), 
(8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 3), (8, 2), 
(2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 8), 
(0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 6)

Now, let's sort the nodes by the number of connections they have:
Nodes by degree: 2, 7, 0, 4, 1, 8, 3, 6, 9, 5

Now, we will count the triangles:
Triangles: [10]

Unique triangles:
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
