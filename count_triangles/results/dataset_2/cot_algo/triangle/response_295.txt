Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 14) (3, 26) (8, 2) (8, 16) (13, 25) (13, 9) (13, 23) (10, 1) (11, 24) (11, 12) (11, 29) (12, 11) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 5) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 20) (27, 9) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 26) (20, 27) (20, 0) (20, 25) (5, 12) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 28) (28, 2) (28, 17) (28, 25) (25, 13) (25, 20) (25, 28) (25, 9) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 24) (18, 19) (18, 15) (19, 2) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 24) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 21) (14, 3) (14, 9) (24, 11) (24, 22) (24, 19) (24, 17) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 16) (26, 3) (26, 0) (26, 7) (26, 17) (9, 13) (9, 27) (9, 25) (9, 14) (23, 13) (7, 15) (7, 26) (7, 17) (21, 27) (21, 4) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 29) (29, 11) (29, 16) (17, 0) (17, 28) (17, 24) (17, 26) (17, 7) 

Response:
The graph constructed from the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}
Edges: [(1, 16), (1, 10), (3, 14), (3, 26), (8, 2), (8, 16), (13, 25), (13, 9), (13, 23), (10, 1), (11, 24), (11, 12), (11, 29), (12, 11), (12, 27), (12, 4), (12, 5), (27, 12), (27, 21), (27, 20), (27, 9), (0, 20), (0, 17), (0, 26), (20, 27), (20, 0), (....

Now let's label the nodes from 0 to 29 based on their degrees (connections) in ascending order:

Nodes by degree: [15, 16, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 21, 23, 0, 13, 14, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, 29, 5, 9, 12, 18, 1, 2, 4, 11, 17, 25, 27, 28]

Now, let's count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Number of triangles: [33]
