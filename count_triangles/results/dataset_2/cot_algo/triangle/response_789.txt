Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 11) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 3) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 10), (6, 2), (6, 11), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 12), (4, 9), (4, 12), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 1), (8, 9), (8, 14), (8, 3), (7, 11), (7, 10), (7, 13), (7, 5), (12, 9), (12, 4), (12, 11), (0, 14), (0, 5), (0, 13), (0, 2), (14, 8), (14, 0), (14, 1), (14, 5), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 0), (5, 14), (13, 7), (13, 0), (13, 3), (13, 1), (13, 10), (3, 8), (3, 13), (3, 10), (3, 2), (11, 6), (11, 7), (11, 12), (1, 6), (1, 4), (1, 14), (1, 13), (2, 6), (2, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (10, 6), (10, 7), (10, 13), (10, 3)

Now we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

0: degree 4
3: degree 4
5: degree 4
12: degree 4
2: degree 5
9: degree 5
1: degree 5
14: degree 5
8: degree 4
13: degree 4
10: degree 4
6: degree 5
4: degree 5
7: degree 4
11: degree 4

Now, based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check for triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 16]
<6, 9, 4>, <6, 9, 12>, <6, 9, 2>, <6, 9, 1>, <6, 1, 4>, <6, 1, 14>, <6, 1, 13>, <6, 10, 7>, <6, 2, 4>, <6, 2, 0>, <9, 4, 12>, <4, 12, 11>, <0, 5, 14>, <0, 5, 13>, <0, 13, 10>, <5, 14, 8>
