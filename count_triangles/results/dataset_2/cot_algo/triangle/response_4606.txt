Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: 6, 3, 4, 2
- 1: 6, 9, 5
- 2: 8, 5, 0
- 3: 7, 0, 8
- 4: 6, 9, 8, 0, 5
- 5: 1, 4, 8, 2, 7
- 6: 1, 4, 8, 0
- 7: 9, 3, 8, 5
- 8: 6, 3, 4, 2, 5, 7
- 9: 6, 1, 7, 4

Now, let's perform the Degree-Based Ordering:

Node 2 (degree 3)
Node 7 (degree 4)
Node 1 (degree 3)
Node 9 (degree 4)
Node 5 (degree 5)
Node 0 (degree 4)
Node 3 (degree 3)
Node 6 (degree 4)
Node 4 (degree 5)
Node 8 (degree 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering, let's count the triangles:

- (2, 5, 8)
- (2, 8, 7)
- (5, 7, 8)
- (0, 2, 8)
- (0, 2, 5)
- (0, 5, 8)
- (0, 3, 8)
- (3, 7, 8)
- (1, 5, 6)
- (4, 8, 5)
- (4, 9, 7)
- (4, 9, 6)
- (4, 9, 8)
- (6, 9, 1)
- (6, 9, 8)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15] and the unique triangles found are:

<2, 5, 8>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 6>
<4, 8, 5>
<4, 9, 7>
<4, 9, 6>
<4, 9, 8>
<6, 9, 1>
<6, 9, 8>
