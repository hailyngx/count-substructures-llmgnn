Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) 

Response:
The vertices and their connections are as follows based on the provided edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 2, 4, and 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 0, and 2
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 0, 4, and 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 3, 6, and 0
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 4
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 4, 0, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 3, 6, and 2
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 0, and 8
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 2, 7, and 9

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices should be sorted by their number of connections:
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Nodes 0, 5, and 8 have degree 5
- Nodes 3, 6, and 7 have degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 5

Now, let's count the triangles using the method described earlier:
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <6, 7, 9>
- <7, 2, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
