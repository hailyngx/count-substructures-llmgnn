Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 18) (16, 2) (9, 26) (9, 0) (26, 9) (26, 18) (15, 2) (15, 17) (27, 22) (27, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 24) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 17) (23, 8) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 6) (20, 11) (20, 0) (20, 13) (20, 22) (20, 5) (17, 15) (17, 8) (17, 29) (17, 7) (29, 17) (29, 1) (29, 6) (29, 22) (29, 21) (24, 10) (24, 4) (18, 16) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 1) (18, 3) (7, 17) (7, 13) (25, 0) (2, 16) (2, 15) (2, 10) (22, 27) (22, 20) (22, 29) (22, 3) (3, 18) (3, 22) (3, 12) (28, 12) (28, 14) (28, 5) (4, 24) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 3) (12, 28) (12, 4) (12, 13) (21, 16) (21, 29) (19, 18) (19, 4) (1, 29) (1, 18) (5, 20) (5, 28) (14, 8) (14, 28) (14, 6) (6, 27) (6, 0) (6, 29) (6, 14) (13, 20) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles in the graph efficiently. Let's start by sorting the vertices by their degrees:

Vertex 16 - degree 3
Vertex 9 - degree 2
Vertex 15 - degree 2
Vertex 27 - degree 2
Vertex 8 - degree 2
Vertex 23 - degree 1
Vertex 26 - degree 2
Vertex 17 - degree 4
Vertex 29 - degree 4
Vertex 24 - degree 2
Vertex 18 - degree 5
Vertex 7 - degree 2
Vertex 25 - degree 1
Vertex 2 - degree 3
Vertex 22 - degree 4
Vertex 3 - degree 3
Vertex 28 - degree 3
Vertex 4 - degree 3
Vertex 21 - degree 2
Vertex 19 - degree 2
Vertex 1 - degree 2
Vertex 5 - degree 2
Vertex 14 - degree 3
Vertex 6 - degree 4
Vertex 13 - degree 3
Vertex 11 - degree 3
Vertex 10 - degree 4
Vertex 20 - degree 4
Vertex 0 - degree 5
Vertex 12 - degree 4

Now, we will check for triangles formed by considering the edges in decreasing order of the lower labeled vertex:

Triangles:
<3, 12, 28>
<0, 6, 27>
<0, 6, 14>
<10, 11, 16>
<10, 20, 22>
<10, 6, 29>
<18, 26, 9>
<18, 12, 3>
<22, 20, 0>
<22, 29, 1>
<22, 6, 14>
<22, 29, 21>

Therefore, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
