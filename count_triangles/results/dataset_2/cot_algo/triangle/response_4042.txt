Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (7, 10) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 0) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 17) (2, 1) (2, 3) (12, 6) (12, 19) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 17) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 14) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 5) (3, 2) (3, 17) (3, 9) (3, 5) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 16) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 3) (8, 11) (8, 16) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (18, 15) (18, 14) (18, 0) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 16) (16, 19) (16, 8) (16, 13) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 14) (0, 1) (0, 18) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:
Nodes: 7 8 0 2 5 10 4 9 12 14 1 3 13 18 6 11 15 16 17 19
