Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 24) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 7) (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 18) (22, 23) (23, 22) (23, 24) (23, 12) (0, 20) (0, 29) (0, 25) (0, 19) (0, 13) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 5) (20, 10) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 20) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 16) (29, 17) (29, 0) (29, 1) (29, 18) (7, 15) (7, 12) (12, 23) (12, 7) (12, 24) (26, 24) (24, 3) (24, 23) (24, 12) (24, 26) (18, 17) (18, 29) (18, 9) (18, 11) (21, 3) (21, 10) (21, 25) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 10) (10, 20) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 16) (8, 28) (8, 27) (8, 16) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 27) (4, 14) (28, 8) (28, 13) (28, 25) (9, 18) (9, 10) (9, 27) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 8) (2, 19) (11, 18) (13, 0) (13, 28) (13, 27) (25, 0) (25, 21) (25, 28) (27, 20) (27, 8) (27, 19) (27, 9) (27, 13) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their corresponding degrees:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 1
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 3
- Node 20: degree 4
- Node 21: degree 3
- Node 22: degree 1
- Node 23: degree 3
- Node 24: degree 4
- Node 25: degree 3
- Node 26: degree 1
- Node 27: degree 5
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 29: degree 4

In Degree-Based Ordering, we sort the nodes from the lowest degree to the highest degree. The order is as follows:
2, 11, 22, 26, 4, 6, 7, 1, 14, 15, 8, 9, 13, 28, 19, 21, 25, 0, 3, 12, 16, 18, 10, 23, 24, 5, 17, 29, 20, 27

Next, we count the triangles formed by the edges while making sure to follow the lower label vertex with fewer connections condition:

Total number of triangles: [15]
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 20>, <0, 5, 14>, <0, 19, 27>, <1, 10, 29>, <3, 12, 24>, <3, 15, 7>, <4, 5, 14>, <5, 6, 16>, <8, 16, 10>, <8, 27, 13>, <9, 10, 18>, <9, 18, 29>, <10, 16, 6>, <18, 29, 17>
