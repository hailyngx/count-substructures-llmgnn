Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 28) (9, 13) (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 29) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 11) (27, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 20) (11, 27) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 24) (11, 29) (20, 10) (20, 18) (20, 5) (25, 23) (25, 4) (25, 28) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 18) (22, 6) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 2) (24, 29) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 4) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 1) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 17) (2, 12) (2, 24) (2, 6) (1, 0) (1, 19) (6, 22) (6, 2) (6, 4) (16, 0) (16, 21) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 19) (23, 25) (23, 29) (21, 15) (21, 16) (21, 4) (13, 9) (13, 16) (17, 7) (17, 28) (17, 19) (28, 9) (28, 25) (28, 17) (14, 19) (18, 20) (18, 12) (18, 16) (5, 20) (5, 4) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 17) (19, 14) (8, 27) (29, 15) (29, 11) (29, 24) (29, 23) (4, 25) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 21) (4, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degrees. The degrees of each node in the given graph are:

Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 5
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 1
Node 9: degree 2
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 5
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 1
Node 15: degree 7
Node 16: degree 5
Node 17: degree 3
Node 18: degree 4
Node 19: degree 5
Node 20: degree 3
Node 21: degree 3
Node 22: degree 1
Node 23: degree 2
Node 24: degree 4
Node 25: degree 3
Node 26: degree 0
Node 27: degree 7
Node 28: degree 3
Node 29: degree 5

Based on the degree-based ordering, we relabel the nodes as follows:
Node 8 < Node 14 < Node 22 < Node 26 < Node 9 < Node 1 < Node 5 < Node 23 < Node 2 < Node 3 < Node 7 < Node 13 < Node 28 < Node 17 < Node 20 < Node 12 < Node 10 < Node 24 < Node 18 < Node 0 < Node 4 < Node 11 < Node 25 < Node 15 < Node 21 < Node 6 < Node 16 < Node 19 < Node 27 < Node 29

Now, we will examine each edge, ensuring that vertex with lower label has fewer connections.
