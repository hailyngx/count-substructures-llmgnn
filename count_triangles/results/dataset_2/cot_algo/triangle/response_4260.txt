Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7

Next, we will label the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 5 (Degree 3)
- Node 1 (Degree 3)
- Node 0 (Degree 4)
- Node 6 (Degree 3)
- Node 9 (Degree 3)
- Node 7 (Degree 4)
- Node 8 (Degree 5)
- Node 4 (Degree 4)
- Node 3 (Degree 5)
- Node 2 (Degree 5)

Now, we will count the triangles.
