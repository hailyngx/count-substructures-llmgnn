Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (12, 24) (12, 29) (27, 10) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 26) (16, 28) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 25) (28, 16) (28, 13) (28, 10) (28, 15) (7, 9) (25, 16) (25, 22) (25, 21) (0, 16) (0, 21) (0, 29) (0, 23) (5, 17) (5, 3) (26, 4) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 29) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 14) (23, 0) (23, 13) (11, 24) (24, 12) (24, 4) (24, 11) (24, 13) (24, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (17, 5) (17, 19) (17, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 17) (29, 12) (29, 0) (29, 18) (29, 21) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 24) (2, 1) (2, 14) (20, 8) (20, 22) (20, 10) (21, 25) (21, 0) (21, 29) (21, 9) (9, 7) (9, 21) (9, 15) (9, 13) (15, 28) (15, 18) (15, 9) (22, 16) (22, 25) (22, 20) (14, 19) (14, 1) (14, 2) (8, 6) (8, 20) (10, 27) (10, 28) (10, 1) (10, 20) (13, 28) (13, 23) (13, 24) (13, 1) (13, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method of counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Sorted vertices by their number of connections:
Node 11 (degree 1)
Node 5 (degree 2)
Node 6 (degree 2)
Node 7 (degree 2)
Node 26 (degree 2)
Node 4 (degree 3)
Node 8 (degree 3)
Node 27 (degree 3)
Node 14 (degree 3)
Node 15 (degree 3)
Node 17 (degree 3)
Node 18 (degree 3)
Node 19 (degree 4)
Node 2 (degree 4)
Node 23 (degree 4)
Node 20 (degree 4)
Node 1 (degree 4)
Node 21 (degree 4)
Node 22 (degree 4)
Node 3 (degree 4)
Node 9 (degree 4)
Node 24 (degree 6)
Node 13 (degree 5)
Node 16 (degree 6)
Node 0 (degree 6)
Node 28 (degree 6)
Node 10 (degree 6)
Node 25 (degree 4)
Node 29 (degree 5)
Node 12 (degree 4)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following:
Total number of triangles: [54]
Unique triangles found: <0, 13, 25>, <0, 16, 25>, <0, 16, 28>, <0, 16, 29>, <0, 21, 25>, <0, 21, 29>, <1, 10, 20>, <1, 10, 28>, <1, 13, 24>, <1, 13, 9>, <1, 14, 19>, <1, 14, 2>, <1, 14, 29>, <1, 2, 14>, <1, 2, 29>, <1, 9, 13>, <2, 14, 29>, <3, 5, 17>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 17>, <4, 24, 26>, <4, 24, 29>, <4, 26, 24>, <5, 6, 8>, <9, 13, 24>, <9, 13, 28>, <9, 13, 29>, <9, 15, 18>, <9, 15, 28>, <10, 20, 22>, <13, 24, 28>, <15, 18, 29>, <16, 22, 25>, <17, 19, 4>, <17, 3, 6>, <17, 3, 17>, <19, 4, 24>, <19, 4, 26>, <19, 18, 29>, <19, 18, 15>, <23, 13, 24>, <23, 13, 9>, <23, 24, 13>, <24, 13, 9>, <25, 21, 9>, <25, 22, 16>, <27, 10, 1>, <27, 10, 28>, <27, 10, 20>, <28, 13, 9>, <28, 15, 18>, <28, 15, 9>, <29, 0, 21>, <29, 0, 23>
