Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 5) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 1) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 14) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 9) (2, 1) (2, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 3) (9, 14) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 9), (4, 6), (7, 0), (7, 9), (7, 1), (5, 8), (5, 12), (5, 1), (13, 12), (13, 11), (13, 10), (13, 14), (0, 5), (12, 3), (12, 9), (1, 11), (1, 2), (6, 8)
  
Now, let's assign labels based on the number of connections each node has.  
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 11: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 14: 6 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 12: 8 connections

Now, let's count the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Consider edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:
   - (4, 7): Node 4 has 6 connections, Node 7 has 6 connections
   - No triangle formed.

2. Subsequent edges:
   - (4, 12): Node 4 has 6 connections, Node 12 has 8 connections
     Shared connections between nodes 4 and 12: 3 (1, 5, 9)
     Triangle formed: <4, 5, 12>
   
   - (4, 9): Node 4 has 6 connections, Node 9 has 5 connections
     Shared connections between nodes 4 and 9: 2 (12, 3)
     Triangle formed: <4, 12, 9>
   
   - (4, 6): Node 4 has 6 connections, Node 6 has 3 connections
     Shared connections between nodes 4 and 6: 1 (1)
     Triangle formed: <4, 1, 6>
   
   - (7, 0): Node 7 has 6 connections, Node 0 has 2 connections
     Shared connections between nodes 7 and 0: 1 (5)
     Triangle formed: <7, 5, 0>
   
   - (7, 9): Node 7 has 6 connections, Node 9 has 5 connections
     Shared connections between nodes 7 and 9: 2 (3, 14)
     Triangle formed: <7, 9, 3>
   
   - (7, 1): Node 7 has 6 connections, Node 1 has 5 connections
     Shared connections between nodes 7 and 1: 1 (11)
     Triangle formed: <7, 11, 1>
   
   - (5, 8): Node 5 has 4 connections, Node 8 has 2 connections
     Shared connections between nodes 5 and 8: 1 (6)
     Triangle formed: <5, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <4, 5, 12>, <4, 12, 9>, <4, 1, 6>, <7, 5, 0>, <7, 9, 3>, <7, 11, 1>, <5, 6, 8>
