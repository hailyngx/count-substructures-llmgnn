Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 10) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 7) (1, 11) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 1) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections each has:

Node 2: 3 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 11: 2 connections
Node 14: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 7: 6 connections

We start with the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

Using the given list of edges:

1. (2, 8) - Forms a triangle with (8, 12, 2)
2. (2, 1) - No triangle formed
3. (2, 10) - No triangle formed
4. (0, 4) - Forms a triangle with (4, 6, 0)
5. (0, 14) - No triangle formed
6. (5, 4) - Forms a triangle with (4, 13, 5)
7. (5, 13) - Forms a triangle with (13, 9, 5)
8. (5, 10) - Forms a triangle with (10, 9, 5)
9. (11, 8) - No triangle formed
10. (11, 12) - Forms a triangle with (12, 1, 11)
11. (11, 1) - Forms a triangle with (1, 9, 11)
12. (10, 9) - Forms a triangle with (9, 7, 10)

The total number of triangles found is [7], and the unique triangles are found as follows:
<8, 12, 2>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 13, 5>, <13, 9, 5>, <10, 9, 5>, <12, 1, 11>, <1, 9, 11>.
