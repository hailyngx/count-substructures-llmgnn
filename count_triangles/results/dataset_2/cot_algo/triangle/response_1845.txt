Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 8) (14, 17) (14, 2) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 4) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 2) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 17) (12, 7) (12, 5) (8, 3) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 0) (0, 6) (0, 19) (0, 15) (0, 18) (16, 17) (16, 7) (16, 19) (15, 0) (15, 13) (18, 0) (18, 5) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 4) (11, 2) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 15) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 5) (2, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree:

Node 11: degree 1
Node 15: degree 2
Node 18: degree 2
Node 16: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 17: degree 5
Node 14: degree 5
Node 9: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5
Node 4: degree 6

Following the method, we should start with the edges involving nodes with the smallest degrees. 
We will count the number of triangles formed: 

1. Considering node 11 -> No triangle
2. Considering node 15 -> No triangle
3. Considering node 18 -> No triangle

Next, we move on to nodes with a degree of at least 3:

4. Considering node 16:
- No triangle with node 11 (degree 1) or node 15 (degree 2)
- Triangle found with node 18: [16, 18, 5]
- Triangle found with node 12: [16, 12, 7]

5. Considering node 12:
- No triangle with node 11 (degree 1) or node 15 (degree 2), already counted with 16
- Triangle found with node 18: [12, 18, 5]

6. Considering node 13:
- No triangle with node 11 (degree 1), 15 (degree 2), or 18 (degree 2)
- No additional triangles found with higher degree nodes

7. Considering node 7:
- No triangle with node 11 (degree 1), 15 (degree 2), or 18 (degree 2), already counted with 16 and 12

11. Considering node 0:
- No triangle with node 11 (degree 1) or node 15 (degree 2), already counted with 16, 12, 7, 5, 8, and 19
- No additional triangles found with higher degree nodes

12. Considering node 3:
- No triangle with node 11 (degree 1) or node 15 (degree 2), already counted with 16, 12, 7, 5, 8, 19, and 0
- Triangle found with node 1: [3, 1, 4]

- Triangle found with node 2: [10, 2, 14]
- Triangle found with node 17: [10, 17, 4]

15. Considering node 2:
- No triangle with node 11 (degree 1) or node 15 (degree 2), already counted with 16, 12, 7, 5, 8, 19, 0, 3, 1, and 10
- No additional triangles found with higher degree nodes

16. Considering node 17:
- No triangle with node 11 (degree 1) or node 15 (degree 2), already counted with 16, 12, 7, 5, 8, 19, 0, 3, 1, 10, and 2
- No additional triangles found with higher degree nodes

17. Considering node 14:
- No triangle with node 11 (degree 1) or node 15 (degree 2), already counted with 16, 12, 7, 5, 8, 19, 0, 3, 1, 10, 2, and 17
- No additional triangles found with higher degree nodes

18. Considering node 9:
- No triangle with node 11 (degree 1) or node 15 (degree 2), already counted with 16, 12, 7, 5, 8, 19, 0, 3, 1, 10, 2, 17, and 14

19. Considering node 6:
- No triangle with node 11 (degree 1) or node 15 (degree 2), already counted with 16, 12, 7, 5, 8, 19, 0, 3, 1, 10, 2, 17, 14, and 9
- No additional triangles found with higher degree nodes

20. Considering node 4:
- No triangle with node 11 (degree 1) or node 15 (degree 2), already counted with 16, 12, 7, 5, 8, 19, 0, 3, 1, 10, 2, 17, 14, 9, and 6

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4] (4 unique triangles found). The triangles are <16, 18, 5>, <16, 12, 7>, <7, 5, 18>, and <19, 0, 15>.
