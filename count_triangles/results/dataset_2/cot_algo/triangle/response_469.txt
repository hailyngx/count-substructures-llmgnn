Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 23) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 21) (10, 11) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 12) (11, 4) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 25) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 7) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 8) (20, 3) (8, 2) (8, 15) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 26) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 28) (0, 17) (26, 4) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 29) (26, 16) (28, 0) (28, 26) (28, 19) (17, 0) (17, 13) (13, 17) (13, 1) (14, 26) (14, 3) (3, 20) (3, 4) (3, 14) (25, 2) (25, 1) (25, 21) (27, 21) (27, 22) (7, 18) (7, 29) (7, 23) (16, 26) (24, 11) (24, 12) (24, 22) (24, 23) (19, 15) (19, 28) (29, 26) (29, 7) (29, 5) (29, 12) (29, 21) (21, 9) (21, 25) (21, 27) (21, 29) (23, 6) (23, 10) (23, 18) (23, 7) (23, 24) (1, 13) (1, 25) (1, 22) (22, 27) (22, 24) (22, 1) (22, 5) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 24) (12, 29) (5, 29) (5, 22) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their number of connections and relabeling the vertices accordingly. 

The sorted list of vertices based on their number of connections is as follows:
(5, 7, 10, 20, 1, 13, 16, 18, 2, 22, 27, 19, 28, 3, 4, 8, 14, 18, 24, 29, 15, 17, 21, 25, 26, 0, 6, 9, 11, 12, 23)

Now, we will count the triangles:

1. For vertex 5: No triangles can be formed as it only has connections with vertex 22.
2. For vertex 7: No triangles can be formed.
3. For vertex 10: No triangles can be formed.
4. For vertex 20: No triangles can be formed because it only has connections with vertex 3.
5. For vertex 1: The triangle <1, 13, 17> is formed.
6. For vertex 13: No triangles can be formed.
7. For vertex 16: No triangles can be formed.
8. For vertex 18: No triangles can be formed.
9. For vertex 2: The triangles <2, 18, 23> and <2, 25, 1> are formed.
10. For vertex 22: No triangles can be formed.
11. For vertex 27: No triangles can be formed.
12. For vertex 19: No triangles can be formed.
13. For vertex 28: The triangle <28, 0, 15> is formed.
14. For vertex 3: No triangles can be formed.
15. For vertex 4: The triangle <4, 3, 14> is formed.
16. For vertex 8: No triangles can be formed.
17. For vertex 14: No triangles can be formed.
18. For vertex 18: No triangles can be formed.
19. For vertex 24: The triangle <24, 22, 1> is formed.
20. For vertex 29: The triangle <29, 5, 22> is formed.
21. For vertex 15: No triangles can be formed.
22. For vertex 17: No triangles can be formed.
23. For vertex 21: The triangle <21, 25, 1> is formed.
24. For vertex 25: No triangles can be formed.
25. For vertex 26: The triangle <26, 14, 3> is formed.
26. For vertex 0: No triangles can be formed.
27. For vertex 6: No triangles can be formed.
28. For vertex 9: No triangles can be formed.
29. For vertex 11: No triangles can be formed.
30. For vertex 12: No triangles can be formed.

Thus, the total number of triangles is [9] and the unique triangles found are <1, 13, 17>, <2, 18, 23>, <2, 25, 1>, <28, 0, 15>, <4, 3, 14>, <24, 22, 1>, <29, 5, 22>, <21, 25, 1>, <26, 14, 3>.
