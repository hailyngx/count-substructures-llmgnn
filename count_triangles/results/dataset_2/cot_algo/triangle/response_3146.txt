Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 13) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (13, 1) (13, 12) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 
(5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) 
(9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) 
(1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) 
(3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) 
(10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 2) 
(11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 2) 
(0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 12) 
(14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 4) 
(2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 4) 
(8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) 
(4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 6) 
(12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 13) 
(7, 8) (7, 6) 
(6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) 
(13, 1) (13, 12)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by degree:
Nodes: 7, 13, 9, 0, 10, 6, 12, 8, 3, 2, 11, 1, 4, 14, 5

Triangles: 
[<0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 14>, <0, 12, 4>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 8, 2>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 1, 14>, <3, 6, 14>, <3, 11, 10>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 12>, <5, 9, 10>, <5, 4, 12>, <6, 7, 8>, <11, 10, 2>]

Total number of triangles: [16]
