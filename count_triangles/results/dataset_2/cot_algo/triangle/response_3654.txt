Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 12) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 11) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 0) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 14) 

Response:
The given graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. 
To count the number of triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices based on their degree:

Node 0: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 11: 5 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Node 12: 5 connections
Node 10: 5 connections
Node 4: 6 connections

Now we will relabel the vertices accordingly:

<0> (Node 0), <7> (Node 7), <9> (Node 9), <2> (Node 2), <6> (Node 6), <5> (Node 5), <3> (Node 3), <8> (Node 8), <1> (Node 1), <13> (Node 13), <11> (Node 11), <14> (Node 14), <12> (Node 12), <10> (Node 10), <4> (Node 4)

Using the degree-based ordering, we will now count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 12]
<3, 6, 5>, <3, 6, 2>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 1, 7>, <3, 1, 11>, <3, 1, 10>, <8, 2, 6>, <8, 2, 9>, <8, 12, 2>, <13, 11, 1>, <13, 14, 3>, <13, 14, 10>
