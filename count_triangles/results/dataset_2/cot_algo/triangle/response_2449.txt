Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 15) (13, 0) (1, 17) (1, 18) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (15, 13) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 18) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 2) (7, 19) (7, 18) (0, 13) (0, 3) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 10) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 2) (9, 16) (9, 14) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 5) (5, 3) (5, 10) (18, 1) (18, 15) (18, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method. Let's first label the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 11: degree 2
Node 19: degree 2
Node 1: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 4
Node 17: degree 6
Node 2: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 6: degree 3
Node 13: degree 4
Node 16: degree 5
Node 18: degree 3

Based on these labels, we will only consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections as per the method mentioned earlier.

After examining the edges based on the criteria, we find that there are 18 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is given as [18].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 17, 15>
<1, 17, 18>
<1, 17, 2>
<1, 15, 18>
<1, 15, 17>
<10, 5, 3>
<12, 2, 4>
<12, 2, 16>
<12, 8, 6>
<13, 2, 4>
<13, 2, 12>
<13, 4, 11>
<13, 4, 12>
<15, 17, 2>
<15, 17, 18>
<8, 6, 14>
<16, 11, 4>
<17, 15, 18>
