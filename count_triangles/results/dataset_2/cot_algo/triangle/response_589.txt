Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 17) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 20) (17, 22) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 8) (18, 22) (18, 10) (18, 25) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 19) (3, 8) (25, 18) (25, 3) (25, 29) (25, 10) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 26) (8, 17) (8, 3) (8, 6) (15, 20) (15, 5) (15, 16) (20, 14) (20, 15) (20, 21) (20, 28) (20, 10) (2, 21) (21, 20) (21, 2) (21, 28) (21, 11) (28, 3) (28, 20) (28, 21) (26, 4) (0, 17) (0, 19) (7, 14) (7, 27) (6, 8) (6, 23) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 29) (12, 1) (12, 9) (29, 25) (29, 16) (29, 27) (29, 23) (5, 15) (23, 6) (23, 29) (23, 9) (11, 13) (11, 21) (11, 19) (11, 1) (19, 3) (19, 0) (19, 11) (1, 16) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 10) (27, 22) (27, 7) (27, 29) (27, 9) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 23) (9, 27) (10, 18) (10, 25) (10, 20) (10, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. The vertices are then relabeled accordingly. 

The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is as follows:
Node 1 -> 1 connection
Node 5 -> 1 connection
Node 12 -> 1 connection
Node 2 -> 2 connections
Node 7 -> 2 connections
Node 6 -> 2 connections
Node 29 -> 3 connections
Node 26 -> 3 connections
Node 15 -> 3 connections
Node 13 -> 3 connections
Node 18 -> 3 connections
Node 14 -> 3 connections
Node 27 -> 3 connections
Node 8 -> 3 connections
Node 4 -> 3 connections
Node 16 -> 3 connections
Node 0 -> 3 connections
Node 3 -> 4 connections
Node 21 -> 4 connections
Node 19 -> 4 connections
Node 17 -> 4 connections
Node 25 -> 4 connections
Node 22 -> 4 connections
Node 20 -> 5 connections
Node 11 -> 4 connections
Node 9 -> 4 connections
Node 10 -> 4 connections
Node 23 -> 4 connections
Node 28 -> 4 connections

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. We will count the number of triangles formed by shared connections.

The total number of triangles in the graph is: [38]

Unique triangles found are:

<8, 3, 25>
<8, 6, 23>
