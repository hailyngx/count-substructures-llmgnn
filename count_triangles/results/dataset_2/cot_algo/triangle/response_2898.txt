Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 10) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 14) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 14) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections each vertex has. Then we relabel the vertices according to this sorting. Let's go ahead and do that for the given graph:

Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 11: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 10: 5 connections
Vertex 13: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 12: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 14: 4 connections

After relabeling the vertices based on their number of connections, we can analyze the edges:

Edges to consider in descending order of vertex label:
(0, 13), (0, 14), (0, 2), (0, 4)
(1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 12), (1, 7)
(2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 10), (2, 13)
(3, 5), (3, 1), (3, 10), (3, 12)
(4, 9), (4, 6), (4, 0), (4, 14)
(5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 3)
(6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 4)
(7, 9), (7, 6), (7, 1), (7, 13)
(8, 5), (8, 3), (8, 14)
(9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 10)
(10, 9), (10, 3), (10, 11), (10, 13)
(11, 10)
(12, 1), (12, 3), (12, 14)
(13, 10), (13, 2), (13, 7), (13, 0)
(14, 8), (14, 12), (14, 0), (14, 4)

Now, we will count the triangles:
Total number of triangles: [25]

Unique triangles found:
