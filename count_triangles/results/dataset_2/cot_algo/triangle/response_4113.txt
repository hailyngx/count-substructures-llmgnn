Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (9, 10) (9, 16) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 9) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 11) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 16) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 11) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 13) (16, 9) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 12) (19, 18) (19, 12) (12, 16) (12, 19) (0, 3) (14, 10) (14, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 14) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 15) 

Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. 

To count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections (degree). 

Here is the sorted list of vertices with their corresponding degrees:
Vertex 0: degree 1
Vertex 9: degree 1
Vertex 12: degree 2
Vertex 19: degree 2
Vertex 18: degree 4
Vertex 16: degree 5
Vertex 4: degree 5
Vertex 3: degree 5
Vertex 14: degree 2
Vertex 17: degree 3
Vertex 8: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 11: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 4
Vertex 5: degree 5
Vertex 2: degree 4
Vertex 1: degree 7
Vertex 10: degree 4
Vertex 15: degree 4
Vertex 13: degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- We start with the edge (6, 5) since 6 has fewer connections than 5. This edge forms triangles with shared connections (1).
- Next, we move to the edge (6, 1) since 6 has fewer connections than 1. This edge forms triangles with shared connections (3, 13, 7).
- Then, we consider edge (9, 10) with shared connections (16). 
- Continuing this process for all relevant edges, we count the number of triangles formed.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].

Unique triangles found:
<1, 3, 13>
<1, 6, 5>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 13, 7>
<2, 13, 16>
<4, 11, 15>
<10, 14, 13>
<16, 12, 19>
