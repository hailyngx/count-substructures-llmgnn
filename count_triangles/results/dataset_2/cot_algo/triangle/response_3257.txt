Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3)
(9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7)
(4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2)
(7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8)
(6, 7) (6, 8)
(2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3)
(8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3)
(0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1)
(1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0)
(3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8)

Now, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

Degree-Based Ordering:
Node 6 has 2 edges
Node 1 has 3 edges
Node 3 has 3 edges
Node 9 has 4 edges
Node 4 has 4 edges
Node 0 has 4 edges
Node 8 has 5 edges
Node 7 has 5 edges
Node 2 has 5 edges
Node 5 has 6 edges

Now, looking at the edges, we proceed in the order of vertices with the smallest degree.

Triangles:
