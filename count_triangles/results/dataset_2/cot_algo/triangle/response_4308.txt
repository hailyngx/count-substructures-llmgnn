Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are as follows:

0 -> 4 connections
2 -> 2 connections
8 -> 2 connections
4 -> 3 connections
6 -> 4 connections
9 -> 4 connections
1 -> 4 connections
7 -> 6 connections
3 -> 6 connections
5 -> 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider the edges with vertices having lower-degree labels.

The triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
