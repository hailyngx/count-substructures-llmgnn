Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 0) (4, 15) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 13) (10, 9) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 12) (8, 9) (8, 14) (1, 17) (1, 0) (1, 18) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 15) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 12) (9, 10) (9, 8) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 1) (0, 19) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 15) (3, 5) (3, 6) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 13) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 1) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
Let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 16 has 2 connections.
- Node 4 has 2 connections.
- Node 5 has 2 connections.
- Node 2 has 2 connections.
- Node 8 has 2 connections.
- Node 9 has 2 connections.
- Node 1 has 3 connections.
- Node 7 has 3 connections.
- Node 12 has 3 connections.
- Node 3 has 3 connections.
- Node 14 has 3 connections.
- Node 18 has 3 connections.
- Node 19 has 3 connections.
- Node 0 has 5 connections.
- Node 6 has 5 connections.
- Node 10 has 5 connections.
- Node 13 has 5 connections.
- Node 11 has 5 connections.
- Node 15 has 6 connections.
- Node 17 has 6 connections.

Let's now count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Triangle <0, 11, 16>
- Triangle <0, 1, 17>
- Triangle <0, 5, 19>
- Triangle <1, 12, 19>
- Triangle <4, 12, 15>
- Triangle <6, 13, 14>
- Triangle <6, 13, 15>
- Triangle <6, 13, 18>
- Triangle <6, 14, 15>
- Triangle <6, 15, 17>
- Triangle <7, 11, 13>
- Triangle <10, 13, 14>
- Triangle <10, 13, 18>
- Triangle <10, 14, 18>
- Triangle <11, 13, 14>
- Triangle <13, 14, 15>

Therefore, there are [15] triangles in total in the given graph.
