Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by degree (from least to most):
Node 6 - degree 2
Node 5 - degree 4
Node 8 - degree 4
Node 7 - degree 4
Node 1 - degree 5
Node 0 - degree 5
Node 2 - degree 5
Node 3 - degree 5
Node 4 - degree 6
Node 9 - degree 6
