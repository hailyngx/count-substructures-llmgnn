Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 18) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 18) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 4) (8, 17) (8, 13) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 15) (10, 14) (10, 17) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 16) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 4) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 16) (11, 5) (15, 9) (15, 16) (19, 14) (19, 1) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 12) (7, 14) (7, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on the number of connections are:  
Node 0: 1 connection  
Node 11: 1 connection  
Node 15: 2 connections  
Node 5: 3 connections  
Node 11: 3 connections  
Node 7: 3 connections  
Node 18: 3 connections  
Node 19: 3 connections  
Node 9: 3 connections  
Node 1: 3 connections  
Node 8: 3 connections  
Node 12: 4 connections  
Node 13: 4 connections  
Node 10: 4 connections  
Node 6: 4 connections  
Node 2: 4 connections  
Node 3: 5 connections  
Node 5: 4 connections  
Node 16: 6 connections  
Node 17: 6 connections  
Node 4: 8 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles.

The total number of triangles is: [18]
