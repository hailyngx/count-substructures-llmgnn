Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) 

Response:
Let's start by constructing the graph and sorting the vertices based on their degree. 

The given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 3), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 7), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 8), (3, 1), (4, 7), (4, 8), (7, 2), (8, 5), (2, 6), (0, 4)

Now, let's list the vertices based on their degree in increasing order:
1. Node 0 - Degree: 2
2. Node 3 - Degree: 2
3. Node 7 - Degree: 2
4. Node 8 - Degree: 2
5. Node 6 - Degree: 3
6. Node 4 - Degree: 4
7. Node 2 - Degree: 4
8. Node 1 - Degree: 5
9. Node 9 - Degree: 6
10. Node 5 - Degree: 6

Next, let's identify the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Check each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
2. Look for shared connections to form triangles.

Based on the given edges and degree-based ordering, we find the following triangles:
<4, 1, 8> 
<4, 8, 5> 
<4, 8, 7> 

Total number of triangles: [3]
