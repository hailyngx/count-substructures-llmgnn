Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 12) (22, 13) (22, 2) (22, 6) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 16) (7, 11) (7, 18) (7, 17) (20, 12) (20, 21) (25, 17) (25, 12) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 24) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 0) (17, 7) (17, 25) (17, 1) (17, 3) (6, 22) (6, 21) (6, 3) (21, 20) (21, 6) (15, 1) (15, 24) (15, 16) (10, 29) (2, 22) (2, 26) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 27) (28, 8) (28, 0) (11, 7) (11, 26) (11, 12) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 23) (3, 29) (9, 14) (9, 23) (5, 0) (5, 16) (27, 19) (27, 18) (27, 26) (29, 10) (29, 3) (29, 26) (26, 2) (26, 11) (26, 27) (26, 29) (26, 16) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 28) (0, 5) (0, 12) (12, 13) (12, 20) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 0) (24, 8) (24, 15) (24, 18) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 9) (18, 7) (18, 27) (18, 24) (14, 1) (14, 9) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 5) (16, 26) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps in finding triangles efficiently. Let's organize the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 28: Degree 2
Node 10: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 20: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 15: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 3
Node 22: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 19: Degree 3
Node 21: Degree 3
Node 29: Degree 3
Node 18: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 17: Degree 4
Node 23: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 5
Node 11: Degree 5
Node 16: Degree 5
Node 24: Degree 5
Node 26: Degree 6
Node 0: Degree 6
Node 3: Degree 6
Node 25: Degree 6
Node 27: Degree 6

Now, we will examine each edge following the ordering based on the degree:

<5, 0>
<5, 16>
<5, 16>
<10, 29>
<13, 22>
<13, 12>
<13, 22>
<14, 1>
<15, 24>
<16, 4>
<16, 15>
<16, 26>
<17, 1>
<17, 7>
<17, 3>
<18, 7>
<18, 24>
<18, 27>
<19, 4>
<19, 27>
<20, 12>
<21, 6>
<21, 20>
<22, 6>
<23, 4>
<23, 9>
<24, 8>
<24, 15>
<25, 17>
<26, 2>
<26, 11>
<26, 27>
<27, 18>
<27, 19>
<29, 3>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
<0, 5, 16>
<7, 17, 18>
<12, 13, 22>
<4, 19, 27>
<12, 20, 21>
<9, 23, 4>
<24, 15, 16>
<26, 27, 19>
