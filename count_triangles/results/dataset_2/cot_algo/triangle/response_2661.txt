Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node degrees:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4

Sorted nodes by degree:
Nodes: 4, 1, 2, 3, 0, 8, 9, 5, 6, 7
