Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 5) (11, 12) (16, 21) (16, 4) (16, 20) (3, 10) (3, 2) (15, 10) (15, 29) (15, 17) (6, 9) (6, 22) (6, 2) (6, 23) (9, 6) (9, 13) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 29) (4, 16) (4, 24) (8, 1) (28, 29) (28, 12) (28, 14) (28, 20) (29, 15) (29, 10) (29, 28) (29, 24) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 27) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 21) (21, 16) (21, 18) (24, 4) (24, 29) (24, 27) (26, 20) (26, 17) (23, 11) (23, 6) (23, 18) (23, 14) (23, 19) (12, 11) (12, 28) (12, 2) (12, 14) (20, 16) (20, 28) (20, 26) (19, 23) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 13) (22, 6) (22, 0) (22, 7) (27, 2) (27, 24) (27, 1) (7, 19) (7, 22) (7, 17) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 27) (5, 11) (5, 0) (0, 22) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 28) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 19) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 0) (17, 15) (17, 26) (17, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph can be represented based on the number of connections they have. The nodes are labeled as follows:

Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 16: 3 connections
Node 17: 3 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 20: 4 connections
Node 21: 2 connections
Node 22: 3 connections
Node 23: 5 connections
Node 24: 3 connections
Node 26: 2 connections
Node 27: 3 connections
Node 28: 4 connections
Node 29: 4 connections

By sorting these nodes in ascending order of their total connections, we get the Degree-Based Ordering as follows:

Node 8, 4, 3, 5, 21, 26, 17, 0, 1, 7, 13, 15, 11, 9, 22, 10, 24, 28, 16, 14, 19, 6, 2, 23, 27, 20, 29, 12, 18

Now, by following the described method in the instructions, the total number of triangles in this graph is [52].

The unique triangles found are as follows:
<1, 10, 15>
<1, 10, 29>
<1, 15, 17>
<1, 15, 29>
<1, 15, 27>
<1, 10, 3>
<1, 10, 2>
<4, 16, 20>
<4, 16, 21>
<4, 16, 24>
<9, 6, 23>
<9, 6, 2>
<9, 6, 22>
<9, 13, 19>
<22, 6, 23>
<22, 6, 2>
<22, 6, 7>
<26, 20, 16>
<26, 20, 28>
<26, 20, 24>
<26, 17, 7>
