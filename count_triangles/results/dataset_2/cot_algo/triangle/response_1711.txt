Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes by their degree:

- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 2

Next, we will examine each edge where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (7, 4): Node 4 has degree 5, and Node 7 has degree 5. Since they have the same degree, we skip this edge.
2. Edge (7, 0): Node 0 has degree 5, which is less than the degree of Node 7. We proceed.
    - Shared connections between Node 7 and Node 0: Node 1 and Node 9
    - <0, 7, 1> is a triangle.
3. Edge (1, 7): Node 1 has degree 5, which is equal to the degree of Node 7. We skip this edge.
4. Edge (1, 9): Node 1 has degree 5, which is equal to the degree of Node 9. We skip this edge.
5. Edge (3, 4): Node 3 has degree 4, which is less than the degree of Node 4. We proceed.
    - Shared connections between Node 3 and Node 4: Node 0
    - <0, 3, 4> is a triangle.
6. Edge (3, 0): Node 0 has degree 5, which is greater than the degree of Node 3. We skip this edge.
7. Edge (3, 2): Node 2 has degree 3, which is less than the degree of Node 3. We proceed.
    - Shared connections between Node 2 and Node 3: Node 1
    - <1, 2, 3> is a triangle.

Counting the triangles found:
[2] triangles found in total.
