Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 4), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 7), (4, 7), (4, 1), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (3, 0), (6, 0), (2, 8)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:
Nodes with degrees: 
0: 5
1: 2
2: 2
3: 3
4: 3
5: 4
6: 3
7: 4
8: 2
9: 5

We will now go through the edges and count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 8, 0>, <3, 6, 7>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
