Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 1) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 13) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 13) (3, 14) (3, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 13) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method works as follows:
- Sort vertices by the number of connections they have (degree).
- Relabel the nodes in ascending order of their degree.

After sorting the nodes by their degree:

Nodes: 3, 1, 5, 7, 6, 8, 9, 13, 14, 0, 2, 10, 12, 11, 4

Let's count the triangles:

1. For edge (4, 7):
   Since 4 is smaller labeled (degree: 7) and 7 is higher labeled with fewer connections (degree: 3), we proceed.
   4 shares connections with 2 (degree: 5) and 11 (degree: 4).
   Therefore, triangle <2, 4, 11> is formed.

2. For edge (4, 8):
   Since 4 is smaller labeled (degree: 7) and 8 is higher labeled with fewer connections (degree: 3), we proceed.
   4 shares a connection with 2 (degree: 5).
   Therefore, triangle <2, 4, 8> is formed.

3. For edge (4, 5):
   Since 4 is smaller labeled (degree: 7) and 5 is higher labeled with fewer connections (degree: 3), we proceed.
   4 shares a connection with 2 (degree: 5).
   Therefore, triangle <2, 4, 5> is formed.
