Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 5) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 10) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 17) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 11) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 2) (10, 11) (10, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 18) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 13) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 0) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 19) (0, 12) (0, 18) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 18) (1, 0) (1, 19) (2, 17) (2, 19) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 19) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 6) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 3) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 15) 

Response:
The graph with nodes and edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Now, we will perform the Degree-Based Ordering method on the graph to count the number of triangles. 

The vertices sorted by their degree are:
0 (degree 3)
1 (degree 2)
2 (degree 2)
8 (degree 3)
9 (degree 2)
16 (degree 2)
4 (degree 3)
6 (degree 3)
12 (degree 3)
13 (degree 3)
3 (degree 4)
5 (degree 4)
14 (degree 4)
15 (degree 3)
17 (degree 4)
7 (degree 4)
18 (degree 4)
10 (degree 2)
11 (degree 2)
19 (degree 4)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Total number of triangles: [9]

Unique triangles: 
<4, 12, 13>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 15>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 19>
<3, 7, 19>
<5, 15, 13>
<14, 17, 9>
<14, 17, 2>
