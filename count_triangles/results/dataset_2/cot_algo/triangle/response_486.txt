Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 0), (6, 7), (6, 0), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 1), (4, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (1, 8), (3, 0)

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes sorted by degrees (least to most): 4, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 7, 0, 6, 3
Relabeled nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Triangles:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <1, 4, 8>
5. <3, 4, 7>
6. <5, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [6]
