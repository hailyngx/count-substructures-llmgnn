Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 10) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be used to count the number of triangles in the graph provided. 

First, we sort the nodes by their number of connections:
Nodes sorted by connections: 
Node 5 : 3 connections 
Node 11 : 2 connections 
Node 8 : 2 connections 
Node 0 : 3 connections 
Node 14 : 4 connections 
Node 7 : 4 connections 
Node 6 : 4 connections 
Node 12 : 4 connections 
Node 1 : 5 connections 
Node 13 : 5 connections 
Node 10 : 6 connections 
Node 3 : 6 connections 
Node 4 : 6 connections 
Node 9 : 7 connections 
Node 2 : 7 connections 

Now, we will go through the edges and count the triangles:
Triangles:
[9] 
<1, 12, 3> 
<3, 12, 2> 
<4, 11, 10> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
