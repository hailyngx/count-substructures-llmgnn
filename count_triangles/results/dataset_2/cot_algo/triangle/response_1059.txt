Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 2) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 14) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 1) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 1) 

Response:
The nodes and edges in the graph have been given. Let's now construct the graph and count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (5, 13), (5, 8), (5, 3), (5, 14), (9, 3), (9, 13), (7, 12), (7, 0), (7, 10), (12, 7), (12, 4), (12, 2), (12, 0), (12, 1), (13, 5), (13, 9), (13, 4), (13, 2), (13, 6), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 11), (3, 0), (3, 10), (3, 8), (11, 3), (11, 6), (11, 4), (11, 2), (0, 7), (0, 12), (0, 3), (4, 12), (4, 13), (4, 11), (4, 1), (4, 2), (2, 12), (2, 13), (2, 11), (2, 4), (2, 1), (8, 5), (8, 3), (8, 6), (6, 13), (6, 11), (6, 8), (6, 14), (14, 5), (14, 6), (14, 1), (1, 12), (1, 4), (1, 2), (1, 14), (1, 10), (10, 7), (10, 3), (10, 1)

Degree-Based Ordering:
Node: Connections (Sorted by number of connections)
0: 3
1: 4
2: 4
4: 4
10: 3
5: 4
6: 4
8: 3
9: 2
7: 3
11: 4
3: 6
14: 3
12: 5
13: 6

Triangles: [16]
Unique triangles: <0, 12, 7>, <0, 12, 4>, <0, 12, 2>, <0, 4, 2>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 10, 7>, <1, 10, 3>, <1, 10, 0>, <2, 12, 7>, <2, 12, 1>, <2, 4, 1>, <3, 10, 7>, <3, 10, 0>, <4, 12, 7>, <4, 12, 2>, <6, 14, 1>
