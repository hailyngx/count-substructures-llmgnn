Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 20) (7, 21) (7, 23) (7, 26) (7, 13) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 11) (21, 18) (3, 28) (3, 17) (25, 9) (25, 22) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 20) (17, 3) (17, 14) (17, 4) (28, 21) (28, 3) (22, 9) (22, 25) (22, 5) (22, 29) (5, 22) (5, 13) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 0) (4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 29) (27, 16) (1, 10) (1, 23) (1, 0) (15, 29) (15, 24) (15, 2) (26, 7) (26, 20) (26, 16) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 10) (19, 8) (19, 12) (19, 23) (12, 14) (12, 19) (12, 20) (16, 27) (16, 26) (16, 2) (18, 9) (18, 21) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 1) (29, 22) (29, 4) (29, 15) (20, 9) (20, 14) (20, 26) (20, 12) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 21) (23, 7) (23, 1) (23, 19) (2, 15) (2, 16) (2, 10) (24, 15) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
- 0: 6, 13, 1
- 1: 10, 23, 0
- 2: 15, 16, 10
- 3: 28, 17
- 4: 6, 17, 10, 29
- 5: 22, 13
- 6: 9, 4, 0
- 7: 21, 23, 26, 13
- 8: 14, 19, 10
- 9: 6, 22, 18, 25, 20
- 10: 13, 4, 1, 8, 2
- 11: 21
- 12: 14, 19, 20
- 13: 7, 5, 10, 0
- 14: 17, 8, 12, 20
- 15: 29, 24, 2
- 16: 27, 26, 2
- 17: 14, 3, 4
- 18: 21, 9
- 19: 8, 12, 23
- 20: 26, 14, 12, 9
- 21: 7, 28, 18, 11
- 22: 9, 25, 5, 29
- 23: 7, 1, 19
- 24: 15
- 25: 9, 22
- 26: 7, 20, 16
- 27: 16
- 28: 21, 3
- 29: 4, 15, 22

Now, let's sort the vertices based on the number of connections they have:
Vertices in Degree-Based Ordering: 
- 27, 24
- 11, 5, 18
- 2, 3, 26, 28
- 1, 8, 19, 23
- 0, 10, 12, 17
- 4, 7, 15, 16, 29
- 6, 9, 14, 20, 21, 22, 25

Let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 7]
<Triangles: 
<4, 0, 10>
<4, 10, 29>
<4, 10, 1>
<4, 29, 15>
<13, 0, 6>
<13, 0, 1>
<13, 0, 10>
