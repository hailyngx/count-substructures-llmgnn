Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes by degree: [(14, 2), (8, 2), (18, 2), (4, 2), (2, 2), (5, 3), (16, 3), (0, 3), (12, 3), (1, 4), (11, 3), (17, 3), (7, 3), (3, 4), (6, 4), (15, 3), (9, 5), (10, 4), (19, 4)]

Triangles:
Total triangles = [32]
Unique triangles = <0, 7, 17>, <0, 5, 16>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 19>, <1, 12, 10>, <1, 9, 4>, <1, 9, 15>, <1, 12, 16>, <3, 19, 15>, <3, 9, 15>, <3, 9, 11>, <3, 9, 7>, <3, 9, 15>, <4, 9, 15>, <7, 10, 17>, <7, 0, 17>, <7, 0, 10>, <9, 11, 15>, <10, 12, 16>, <10, 12, 1>, <10, 17, 15>, <12, 16, 5>, <14, 3, 6>, <14, 3, 18>, <14, 6, 16>, <15, 17, 19>, <15, 9, 3>, <15, 9, 19>, <16, 6, 14>, <17, 15, 19>, <17, 0, 15>
