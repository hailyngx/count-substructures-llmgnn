Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 0: degree 4
Node 2: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 5: degree 7
Node 1: degree 5
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 5
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4

Now, we will proceed with the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

1. Edge between 2 and 0 (Node 0 has fewer connections)
2. Edge between 8 and 2 (Node 2 has fewer connections)
3. Edge between 8 and 7 (Node 7 has fewer connections)
4. Edge between 8 and 5 (Node 5 has fewer connections)
5. Edge between 0 and 2 (Node 2 has fewer connections)
6. Edge between 0 and 3 (Node 3 has fewer connections)
7. Edge between 0 and 1 (Node 1 has fewer connections)
8. Edge between 0 and 9 (Node 9 has fewer connections)
9. Edge between 1 and 3 (Node 3 has fewer connections)
10. Edge between 1 and 0 (Node 0 has fewer connections)
11. Edge between 3 and 9 (Node 9 has fewer connections)
12. Edge between 3 and 4 (Node 4 has fewer connections)
13. Edge between 3 and 1 (Node 1 has fewer connections)
14. Edge between 4 and 6 (Node 6 has fewer connections)
15. Edge between 4 and 7 (Node 7 has fewer connections)
16. Edge between 4 and 1 (Node 1 has fewer connections)
17. Edge between 5 and 9 (Node 9 has fewer connections)
18. Edge between 5 and 6 (Node 6 has fewer connections)
19. Edge between 5 and 2 (Node 2 has fewer connections)
20. Edge between 5 and 8 (Node 8 has fewer connections)
21. Edge between 6 and 4 (Node 4 has fewer connections)
22. Edge between 6 and 7 (Node 7 has fewer connections)
23. Edge between 6 and 1 (Node 1 has fewer connections)
24. Edge between 7 and 9 (Node 9 has fewer connections)
25. Edge between 9 and 5 (Node 5 has fewer connections)
