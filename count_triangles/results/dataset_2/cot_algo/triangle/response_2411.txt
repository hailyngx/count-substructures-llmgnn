Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 24) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 7) (2, 29) (2, 15) (29, 2) (29, 1) (29, 0) (29, 23) (6, 13) (28, 4) (28, 18) (21, 19) (21, 22) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 27) (22, 9) (22, 21) (14, 26) (14, 12) (14, 19) (26, 14) (26, 20) (26, 3) (17, 16) (17, 27) (17, 11) (25, 1) (11, 17) (0, 29) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 24) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 12) (1, 18) (27, 8) (27, 17) (27, 24) (27, 18) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 4) (20, 26) (20, 3) (4, 28) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 23) (24, 5) (24, 10) (24, 27) (24, 12) (24, 23) (18, 5) (18, 28) (18, 1) (18, 27) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 24) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 15) (7, 5) (7, 9) (19, 21) (19, 14) (23, 29) (23, 4) (23, 24) (23, 3) (3, 26) (3, 16) (3, 20) (3, 13) (3, 23) (15, 2) (15, 13) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29  
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 18), (5, 24), (5, 7), (9, 22), (2, 29), (2, 15), (29, 1), (6, 13), (28, 4), (21, 19), (21, 22), (8, 10), (8, 12), (8, 27), (14, 26), (14, 19), (17, 16), (17, 27), (17, 11), (25, 1), (11, 17), (0, 10), (10, 13), (4, 23), (24, 21), (14, 26), (20, 3), (7, 5), (23, 15)

Now let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

0: 2 connections  
1: 5 connections  
2: 2 connections  
3: 6 connections  
4: 6 connections  
5: 4 connections  
6: 1 connection  
7: 2 connections  
8: 3 connections  
9: 3 connections  
10: 4 connections  
11: 2 connections  
12: 4 connections  
13: 5 connections  
14: 3 connections  
15: 2 connections  
16: 3 connections  
17: 4 connections  
18: 5 connections  
19: 3 connections  
20: 2 connections  
21: 2 connections  
22: 3 connections  
23: 4 connections  
24: 5 connections  
25: 1 connection  
26: 3 connections  
27: 4 connections  
28: 2 connections  
29: 4 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can find the total number of triangles and list them as follows:

Total number of triangles: [20]  
Unique triangles:  
<0, 10, 13>  
<0, 10, 24>  
<1, 14, 19>  
<1, 14, 26>  
<2, 15, 29>  
<3, 13, 23>  
<4, 13, 23>  
<5, 7, 9>  
<5, 18, 27>  
<5, 18, 28>  
<5, 24, 27>  
<5, 24, 28>  
<8, 12, 24>  
<10, 13, 24>  
<10, 15, 29>  
<10, 24, 27>  
<12, 14, 19>  
<13, 15, 29>  
<16, 17, 27>  
<16, 17, 27>
