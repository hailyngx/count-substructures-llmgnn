Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 12) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 6) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 0) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 10) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 10) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 14) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: {(5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 14), (9, 5), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 7), (4, 7), (4, 13), (4, 11), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 12), (7, 0), (7, 13), (8, 12), (12, 7), (12, 8), (12, 2), (12, 0), (12, 11), (2, 9), (2, 12), (2, 1), (2, 6), (13, 5), (13, 4), (13, 7), (13, 0), (3, 9), (3, 11), (3, 14), (3, 10), (11, 4), (11, 12), (11, 3), (11, 0), (11, 6), (0, 7), (0, 12), (0, 13), (0, 11), (0, 10), (1, 9), (1, 2), (1, 14), (1, 10), (6, 2), (6, 11), (6, 10), (10, 3), (10, 0), (10, 1), (10, 6), (10, 14), (14, 5), (14, 3), (14, 1), (14, 10)}

Next, let's sort the vertices by their degrees:

Vertice Degrees:
0: 5
1: 4
3: 4
4: 4
5: 3
6: 3
8: 1
13: 4
14: 4
2: 4
7: 5
9: 5
11: 5
12: 5
10: 4

Now, let's count the triangles:

Triangles count: [32]

Unique triangles:
<0, 7, 13>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 7, 12>
<0, 11, 6>
<0, 11, 7>
<0, 11, 4>
<0, 11, 12>
<0, 12, 7>
<0, 12, 11>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 10, 3>
<1, 10, 6>
