Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 6) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 11) (7, 17) (12, 15) (12, 19) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 0) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 1) (19, 13) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 9) (9, 19) (16, 17) (16, 10) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 11) (10, 2) (10, 16) (10, 0) (10, 14) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (18, 8) (18, 19) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 15) (3, 2) (3, 14) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 3) (17, 7) (17, 16) (17, 11) (15, 12) (15, 0) (15, 11) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

Edges: 
(8, 18), 
(13, 5), (13, 19), (13, 6), 
(4, 14), (4, 1), (4, 6),

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by degree (number of connections):
8=1, 14=4, 3=2, 12=2, 16=2, 9=2, 18=2, 7=2, 17=3, 13=4, 5=4, 6=4, 4=5, 1=5, 2=5, 15=3, 10=5, 0=6, 11=7, 19=7

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles and list them:
Total number of triangles: [50]
<2, 14, 10>, <2, 14, 1>, <2, 14, 3>, <2, 10, 16>, <2, 10, 14>, <2, 10, 0>, <3, 14, 4>, <3, 14, 2>, <3, 2, 10>, <3, 2, 14>, <4, 1, 6>, <4, 1, 11>, <4, 1, 14>, <4, 6, 13>, <4, 6, 1>, <5, 13, 6>, <5, 13, 19>, <5, 6, 4>, <5, 6, 1>, <5, 19, 13>, <5...14>, <11, 0, 5>, <11, 0, 15>, <11, 1, 14>, <11, 1, 6>, <11, 14, 10>, <11, 14, 1>, <15, 0, 5>, <15, 0, 11>, <15, 11, 1>, <17, 7, 11>, <17, 7, 16>, <17, 7, 11>, <17, 16, 10>, <17, 16, 11>, <17, 16, 7>, <18, 8, 19>, <19, 9, 12>, <19, 9, 18>, <19, 18, 8>
