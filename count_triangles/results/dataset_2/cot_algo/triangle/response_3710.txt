Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 27) (15, 19) (15, 25) (15, 12) (27, 22) (27, 18) (27, 11) (14, 16) (17, 25) (17, 18) (17, 26) (23, 22) (23, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 26) (2, 21) (8, 2) (8, 28) (8, 29) (8, 6) (21, 2) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 9) (28, 8) (28, 21) (28, 9) (28, 19) (26, 13) (26, 22) (26, 17) (26, 2) (0, 13) (0, 2) (6, 8) (6, 21) (6, 10) (25, 15) (25, 17) (7, 5) (11, 13) (11, 27) (11, 5) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 4) (1, 18) (29, 8) (29, 1) (29, 4) (3, 23) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 5) (19, 15) (19, 28) (19, 3) (16, 14) (16, 24) (24, 16) (24, 12) (24, 5) (20, 1) (9, 21) (9, 28) (9, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 4) (18, 27) (18, 17) (18, 1) (12, 15) (12, 24) (12, 10) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 24) (4, 1) (4, 29) (4, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently in this graph. First, let's sort the vertices by their connections from least to most:

Vertices: 

0 - degree 2
1 - degree 4
7 - degree 1
13 - degree 4
16 - degree 2
17 - degree 3
20 - degree 1
21 - degree 4
22 - degree 4
23 - degree 2
24 - degree 3
28 - degree 4
3 - degree 4
6 - degree 3
10 - degree 3
11 - degree 3
12 - degree 3
14 - degree 1
15 - degree 3
18 - degree 3
19 - degree 3
2 - degree 4
25 - degree 3
26 - degree 4
27 - degree 3
29 - degree 3
4 - degree 3
5 - degree 4
8 - degree 4
9 - degree 3

Now, we will count the triangles by following the instructions in the original prompt. Once done, we will display the number of triangles found. Let's start counting.
