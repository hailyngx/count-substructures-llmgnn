Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 3), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 1), (4, 3), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 2), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 6), (3, 8), (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 3), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 7), (2, 1), (2, 8), (8, 9), (8, 3), (8, 2), (0, 7), (0, 3)

Now, let's find the total number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Degrees of each node:  
0: 2  
1: 3  
2: 5  
3: 6  
4: 4  
5: 4  
6: 5  
7: 5  
8: 3  
9: 4  

Relabeling the nodes in ascending order of degrees:  
Node 0: 0  
Node 1: 1  
Node 8: 2  
Node 9: 3  
Node 4: 4  
Node 5: 5  
Node 6: 6  
Node 7: 7  
Node 2: 8  
Node 3: 9  

Now, let's count the triangles:  
Triangles: [27]  
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 8, 2>, <0, 8, 3>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 8, 2>, <1, 8, 3>, <2, 8, 3>, <2, 8, 9>, <2, 8, 4>, <3, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 5>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 7, 4>, <3, 9, 6>, <4, 7, 6>, <4, 3, 9>, <4, 1, 2>, <7, 6, 5>
