Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3)
- 1: (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 1)
- 2: (4, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2)
- 3: (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 8)
- 4: (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 0), (1, 8)
- 5: (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 8)
- 6: (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 0)
- 7: (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 6)
- 8: (8, 7), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 0)
- 9: (0, 5), (0, 1), (0, 6), (0, 8)

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degrees:
Node degrees: 
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4

After relabeling based on degrees:
Nodes: 4, 7, 1, 0, 2, 6, 8, 5, 9, 3

Now, let's count the triangles:

Triangles: 
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 4, 1>
<2, 4, 1>
<7, 8, 3>
<7, 8, 2>
<8, 3, 3>
<5, 9, 6>

Total number of triangles: [9]
