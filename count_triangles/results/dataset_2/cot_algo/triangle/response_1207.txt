Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 18) (4, 7) (4, 16) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 13) (3, 10) (3, 19) (3, 18) (11, 9) (11, 13) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 1) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 15) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 15) (0, 9) (0, 12) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 6) (15, 2) (15, 12) (19, 3) (19, 2) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 18) (6, 14) (6, 16) (6, 8) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 18) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 1) (18, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count triangles efficiently. Let's follow the steps to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Sort the vertices by their degrees in ascending order:
```
Vertex 16 has 4 connections
Vertex 6 has 3 connections
Vertex 0 has 3 connections
Vertex 1 has 3 connections
Vertex 5 has 3 connections
Vertex 8 has 3 connections
Vertex 4 has 3 connections
Vertex 19 has 3 connections
Vertex 14 has 2 connections
Vertex 11 has 2 connections
Vertex 7 has 2 connections
Vertex 13 has 2 connections
Vertex 17 has 2 connections
Vertex 2 has 2 connections
Vertex 18 has 2 connections
Vertex 3 has 2 connections
Vertex 10 has 2 connections
Vertex 12 has 2 connections
Vertex 9 has 2 connections
```

2. Relabel the vertices according to their degrees:
```
Node 0: 0
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 2
Node 3: 2
Node 4: 2
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 2
Node 7: 2
Node 8: 2
Node 9: 2
Node 10: 2
Node 11: 2
Node 12: 2
Node 13: 2
Node 14: 2
Node 15: 3
Node 16: 3
Node 17: 3
Node 18: 3
Node 19: 3
```

3. Count the triangles formed by the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
```
Total number of triangles: [20]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 9, 12>
<0, 12, 15>
<1, 10, 13>
<1, 10, 18>
<2, 5, 17>
<2, 17, 18>
<3, 10, 18>
<4, 7, 16>
<6, 8, 16>
<6, 8, 18>
<7, 16, 4>
<8, 18, 6>
<10, 13, 1>
<10, 1, 18>
<12, 0, 9>
<12, 0, 15>
<13, 1, 10>
<14, 17, 6>
<16, 4, 7>
<16, 6, 8>
