Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 14) (17, 9) (17, 2) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 12) (3, 7) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 15) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 14) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 6) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 14) (16, 5) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 12) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 15) (5, 8) (5, 16) (5, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 5) (18, 1) (4, 3) (4, 11) (13, 9) (14, 10) (14, 15) (14, 19) (14, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

- The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
    - Node 0: 2 connections
    - Node 1: 4 connections
    - Node 2: 4 connections
    - Node 3: 2 connections
    - Node 4: 2 connections
    - Node 5: 4 connections
    - Node 6: 4 connections
    - Node 7: 4 connections
    - Node 8: 6 connections
    - Node 9: 5 connections
    - Node 10: 3 connections
    - Node 11: 4 connections
    - Node 12: 5 connections
    - Node 13: 1 connection
    - Node 14: 6 connections
    - Node 15: 3 connections
    - Node 16: 5 connections
    - Node 17: 2 connections
    - Node 18: 1 connection
    - Node 19: 5 connections

- Relabeling the nodes based on their degrees:
    - Node 0: 2 connections -> A
    - Node 1: 4 connections -> B
    - Node 2: 4 connections -> B
    - Node 3: 2 connections -> A
    - Node 4: 2 connections -> A
    - Node 5: 4 connections -> B
    - Node 6: 4 connections -> B
    - Node 7: 4 connections -> B
    - Node 8: 6 connections -> C
    - Node 9: 5 connections -> D
    - Node 10: 3 connections -> A
    - Node 11: 4 connections -> B
    - Node 12: 5 connections -> D
    - Node 13: 1 connection -> A
    - Node 14: 6 connections -> C
    - Node 15: 3 connections -> A
    - Node 16: 5 connections -> D
    - Node 17: 2 connections -> A
    - Node 18: 1 connection -> A
    - Node 19: 5 connections -> D

- After relabeling, the edges to consider based on the requirements are:
    - (A, B)
    - (A, C)
    - (A, D)
    - (B, C)
    - (B, D)
    - (C, D)

- Now, counting the triangles:
    - For edge (A, B): No triangle
    - For edge (A, C): Triangle <0, 6, 14>
    - For edge (A, D): No triangle
    - For edge (B, C): Triangle <8, 6, 14>
    - For edge (B, D): Triangle <8, 12, 19>
    - For edge (C, D): Triangle <8, 12, 19>

- Count of triangles = 4

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
