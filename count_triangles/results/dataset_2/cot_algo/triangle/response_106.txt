Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 22) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 4) (0, 20) (20, 0) (20, 29) (20, 14) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 29) (5, 25) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 25) (6, 13) (14, 20) (14, 27) (14, 7) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 26) (13, 29) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 21) (26, 17) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 23) (1, 9) (17, 26) (28, 26) (28, 9) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 12) (29, 20) (29, 5) (29, 13) (29, 10) (29, 12) (2, 22) (2, 12) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 21) (16, 21) (16, 18) (21, 4) (21, 26) (21, 22) (21, 16) (21, 24) (12, 19) (12, 29) (12, 2) (12, 25) (9, 1) (9, 28) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 27) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 11) (24, 21) (24, 10) (25, 5) (25, 6) (25, 12) (25, 9) (10, 3) (10, 29) (10, 24) (10, 7) (7, 14) (7, 19) (7, 10) (27, 14) (27, 9) (11, 18) (23, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections) from least to most:
   Nodes with degree 1: 0, 2, 23, 28
   Nodes with degree 2: 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24
   Nodes with degree 3: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 21, 25, 27
   Nodes with degree 4: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 29
   Nodes with degree 5: 1, 26
   Nodes with degree 6: 7

2. Relabel the nodes accordingly:
   0 -> 0, 2 -> 1, 23 -> 2, 28 -> 3
   16 -> 4, 17 -> 5, 18 -> 6, 20 -> 7, 22 -> 8, 24 -> 9
   11 -> 10, 12 -> 11, 13 -> 12, 14 -> 13, 15 -> 14, 19 -> 15, 21 -> 16, 25 -> 17, 27 -> 18
   4 -> 19, 5 -> 20, 6 -> 21, 8 -> 22, 9 -> 23, 10 -> 24, 29 -> 25
   1 -> 26, 26 -> 27
   7 -> 28

3. Count the triangles:
   - For each edge, calculate the number of triangles that can be formed where the lower-labeled node has fewer connections.
   
   Triangles:
   <4, 6, 21>
   <6, 13, 21>
   <1, 9, 26>
   
   Total number of triangles: [3]
