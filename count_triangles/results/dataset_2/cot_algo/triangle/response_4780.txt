Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 11) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 5) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (10, 8) (10, 12) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 2) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 11) 

Response:
The graph given can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 15
Edges: 60
Edges: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 11) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 5) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (10, 8) (10, 12) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 2) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 11)

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted by the number of connections:
Vertices: 0, 8, 9, 5, 10, 14, 11, 1, 13, 2, 7, 6, 12, 3, 4

Triangles found:
Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <7, 4, 5>, <6, 7, 11>, <9, 13, 6>
