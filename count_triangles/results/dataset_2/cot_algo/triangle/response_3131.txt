Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections. Let's do that first.

Node 5 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 4 connections.
Node 0 has 4 connections.
Node 7 has 6 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 5 connections.
Node 3 has 2 connections.

Based on the degree ordering, the new labels for the nodes will be:
Node 3 -> 0
Node 5 -> 1
Node 9 -> 2
Node 1 -> 3
Node 0 -> 4
Node 8 -> 5
Node 6 -> 6
Node 4 -> 7
Node 2 -> 8
Node 7 -> 9

Now, we will check the edges based on the new labels and count the triangles.

Triangles found: 
<4, 5, 8>
<1, 2, 8>

Total number of triangles: [2]
