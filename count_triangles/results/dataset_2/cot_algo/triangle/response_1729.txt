Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 8) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 11) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 3) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 17) (5, 15) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 19) (0, 17) (7, 3) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 11) (16, 4) (16, 13) (16, 15) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 19) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 3) (14, 1) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 9) (9, 15) (9, 1) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 12) (10, 4) (10, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (17, 5) (17, 0) 

Response:
The graph's nodes are numbered from 0 to 19 with the following connections:
Node 0: [17]
Node 1: [13, 9, 12, 14]
Node 2: [18, 8, 11, 14]
Node 3: [8, 7, 14, 6]
Node 4: [19, 10, 16, 11]
Node 5: [13, 19, 17, 15]
Node 6: [3, 10]
Node 7: [3]
Node 8: [2, 18, 3]
Node 9: [15, 1]
Node 10: [4, 6]
Node 11: [2, 4, 19]
Node 12: [13, 1]
Node 13: [5, 12, 16, 1, 19]
Node 14: [18, 3, 1, 2]
Node 15: [5, 16, 9]
Node 16: [4, 13, 15]
Node 17: [5, 0]
Node 18: [2, 8, 14]
Node 19: [4, 5, 13, 11]

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Edges involving a lower labeled vertex with fewer connections:
(2, 18) forms triangle with 8: <2, 18, 8>
(2, 8) forms triangle with 18: <2, 8, 18>
(2, 14) forms triangle with 1: <2, 14, 1>
(2, 11) forms triangle with 4 and 19: <2, 11, 4>, <2, 11, 19>
(18, 14) forms no triangles
(18, 8) forms no triangles
(4, 19) forms no triangles
(4, 10) forms no triangles
(4, 16) forms triangle with 13: <4, 16, 13>
(8, 3) forms triangle with 2: <8, 3, 2>
(8, 7) forms no triangles
(5, 13) forms triangle with 12: <5, 13, 12>
(13, 19) forms no triangles
(13, 16) forms triangle with 15: <13, 16, 15>
(0, 17) forms no triangles

Total number of triangles: [10]
Unique triangles found: <2, 18, 8>, <2, 8, 18>, <2, 14, 1>, <2, 11, 4>, <2, 11, 19>, <4, 16, 13>, <8, 3, 2>, <5, 13, 12>, <13, 16, 15>.
