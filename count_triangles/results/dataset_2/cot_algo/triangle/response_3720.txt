Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 9) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 29) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 6) (2, 17) (29, 15) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 8) (7, 15) (7, 21) (7, 18) (7, 9) (7, 5) (21, 7) (21, 12) (21, 26) (20, 5) (25, 6) (18, 7) (18, 9) (18, 16) (22, 11) (10, 17) (10, 28) (10, 5) (17, 2) (17, 10) (17, 16) (1, 26) (1, 23) (26, 21) (26, 1) (26, 13) (26, 14) (26, 8) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 26) (14, 0) (14, 27) (14, 16) (28, 29) (28, 10) (28, 19) (28, 24) (13, 26) (13, 19) (5, 7) (5, 20) (5, 10) (5, 19) (19, 28) (19, 13) (19, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 18) (11, 22) (11, 0) (11, 24) (11, 8) (24, 28) (24, 11) (24, 27) (16, 18) (16, 17) (16, 14) (16, 8) (27, 14) (27, 24) (12, 21) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 25) (6, 23) (4, 23) (23, 2) (23, 1) (23, 6) (23, 4) (8, 29) (8, 26) (8, 11) (8, 16) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Vertices: (0, 3, 4, 12, 22, 27) -> Degree: 1
Vertices: (5, 10, 13, 20) -> Degree: 2
Vertices: (1, 9, 18, 24, 25) -> Degree: 3
Vertices: (7, 11, 21, 28, 6) -> Degree: 4
Vertices: (14, 15, 16, 19) -> Degree: 5
Vertices: (2, 8, 17, 26) -> Degree: 6
Vertices: (29) -> Degree: 7

Following the degree-based ordering method, we will go through the edges:
