Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
Let's find the triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

**Vertices Sorted by Degree (Number of Connections):**
- Vertex 0: Degree 2
- Vertex 4: Degree 3
- Vertex 6: Degree 3
- Vertex 8: Degree 4
- Vertex 3: Degree 4
- Vertex 2: Degree 5
- Vertex 1: Degree 5
- Vertex 7: Degree 5
- Vertex 9: Degree 5
- Vertex 5: Degree 6
