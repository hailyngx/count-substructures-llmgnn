Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 1) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (8, 13) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 19) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 17) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 18) (15, 16) (15, 18) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 19) (6, 14) (6, 12) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 1) (19, 10) (19, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 15) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly. Let's go through the process step by step:

1. Sort the vertices by degree:
- Vertex 7 (degree 2)
- Vertex 5 (degree 2)
- Vertex 8 (degree 2)
- Vertex 9 (degree 1)
- Vertex 2 (degree 1)
- Vertex 19 (degree 2)
- Vertex 6 (degree 2)
- Vertex 0 (degree 4)
- Vertex 3 (degree 4)
- Vertex 12 (degree 3)
- Vertex 1 (degree 4)
- Vertex 15 (degree 2)
- Vertex 18 (degree 4)
- Vertex 10 (degree 5)
- Vertex 14 (degree 5)
- Vertex 16 (degree 5)
- Vertex 13 (degree 5)
- Vertex 17 (degree 5)
- Vertex 4 (degree 5)
- Vertex 11 (degree 5)

2. Relabel the vertices:
- Vertex 7 (degree 2) -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 5 (degree 2) -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 8 (degree 2) -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 9 (degree 1) -> Vertex 3
- Vertex 2 (degree 1) -> Vertex 4
- Vertex 19 (degree 2) -> Vertex 5
- Vertex 6 (degree 2) -> Vertex 6
- Vertex 0 (degree 4) -> Vertex 7
- Vertex 3 (degree 4) -> Vertex 8
- Vertex 12 (degree 3) -> Vertex 9
- Vertex 1 (degree 4) -> Vertex 10
- Vertex 15 (degree 2) -> Vertex 11
- Vertex 18 (degree 4) -> Vertex 12
- Vertex 10 (degree 5) -> Vertex 13
- Vertex 14 (degree 5) -> Vertex 14
- Vertex 16 (degree 5) -> Vertex 15
- Vertex 13 (degree 5) -> Vertex 16
- Vertex 17 (degree 5) -> Vertex 17
- Vertex 4 (degree 5) -> Vertex 18
- Vertex 11 (degree 5) -> Vertex 19

3. Proceed with counting triangles by checking shared connections:

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles:
- <0, 11, 14>
- <0, 13, 17>
- <3, 12, 18>
