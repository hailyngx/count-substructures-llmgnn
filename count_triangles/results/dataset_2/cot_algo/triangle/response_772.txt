Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 26) (11, 21) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 23) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 25) (4, 26) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 9) (20, 11) (20, 29) (20, 12) (25, 4) (25, 15) (25, 21) (5, 13) (5, 1) (6, 14) (6, 22) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 24) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (21, 11) (21, 25) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 13) (28, 10) (22, 6) (22, 26) (22, 10) (22, 17) (26, 11) (26, 4) (26, 22) (26, 10) (17, 22) (17, 29) (17, 18) (29, 20) (29, 17) (29, 1) (13, 5) (13, 28) (19, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 27) (10, 28) (10, 22) (10, 26) (15, 7) (15, 25) (15, 0) (12, 20) (12, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 29) (1, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 18) (24, 2) (24, 27) (14, 6) (14, 3) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 23) (23, 16) (23, 18) (27, 9) (27, 24) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. 
The sorted list of nodes based on their degree is as follows: 

Nodes with degree 2: 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 24, 27, 28, 29

Nodes with degree 3: 0, 1, 3, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23

Nodes with degree 4: 4, 8, 11, 16

Nodes with degree 5: 7, 25, 26

Nodes with degree 6: 9, 21

Now, we will check for triangles:
1. Nodes 5, 13, 1 form a triangle <5, 13, 1>.
2. Nodes 5, 3, 14 form a triangle <5, 3, 14>.
3. Nodes 6, 22, 10 form a triangle <6, 22, 10>.
4. Nodes 6, 3, 14 form a triangle <6, 3, 14>.
5. Nodes 10, 22, 26 form a triangle <10, 22, 26>.
6. Nodes 13, 28, 1 form a triangle <13, 28, 1>.
7. Nodes 14, 3, 18 form a triangle <14, 3, 18>.
8. Nodes 17, 18, 23 form a triangle <17, 18, 23>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
