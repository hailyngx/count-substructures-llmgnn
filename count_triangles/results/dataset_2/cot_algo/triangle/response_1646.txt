Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 19) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 15) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 12) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 8) (15, 9) (15, 1) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 10) (19, 16) (19, 7) (19, 0) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (12, 3) (12, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 11) (5, 4) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 2) (18, 12) (18, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph. Before proceeding, let's first sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Vertices: 
1. 16 (degree 4)
2. 9 (degree 2)
3. 17 (degree 3)
4. 15 (degree 2)
5. 10 (degree 3)
6. 5 (degree 2)
7. 8 (degree 3)
8. 12 (degree 2)
9. 18 (degree 2)
10. 0 (degree 4)
11. 6 (degree 4)
12. 11 (degree 3)
13. 4 (degree 4)
14. 2 (degree 2)
15. 14 (degree 3)
16. 7 (degree 4)
17. 1 (degree 2)
18. 13 (degree 3)
19. 3 (degree 2)
20. 19 (degree 3)

Now, let's count the triangles by checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Total number of triangles: [61]
