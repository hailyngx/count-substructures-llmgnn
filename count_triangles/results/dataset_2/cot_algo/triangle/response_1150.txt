Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 13) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 12) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 13) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (9, 0) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 13) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 9) (13, 12) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 13)
(1, 11)
(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 10), (2, 11), (2, 14)
(3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 10), (3, 14)
(4, 8), (4, 10)
(5, 6), (5, 11), (5, 12), (5, 14)
(6, 10), (6, 13)
(7, 13)
(8, 12)
(9, 13)
(10, 12)
(11, 12)

Now, let's sort the nodes by the number of connections in ascending order: 

Nodes: 7, 1, 9, 8, 13, 0, 11, 12, 6, 4, 7, 3, 5, 2, 10

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 6]
<Triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 11>, <0, 13, 9>, <6, 10, 13>, <3, 5, 14>>
