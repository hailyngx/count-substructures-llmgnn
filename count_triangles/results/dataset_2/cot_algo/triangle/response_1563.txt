Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 7) (10, 3) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 15) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 1) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 5) (0, 5) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 4) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 18) (4, 16) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 19) (19, 2) (19, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 18) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 16) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves relabeling the nodes based on their degrees.

Node 0: degree 1
Node 9: degree 2
Node 10: degree 2
Node 11: degree 2
Node 12: degree 2
Node 19: degree 2
Node 3: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 18: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 15: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will count the triangles formed by each edge starting from the edges involving nodes with the least degree.

Number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles:
<1, 6, 18>
<6, 9, 7>
<2, 4, 14>
<2, 11, 5>
<8, 13, 15>
<4, 10, 16>
<2, 4, 16>
<11, 5, 12>
<7, 5, 19>
<7, 1, 18>
