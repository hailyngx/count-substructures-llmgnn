Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 5) (15, 24) (27, 15) (18, 22) (18, 5) (18, 12) (22, 18) (22, 29) (22, 7) (10, 11) (10, 26) (10, 2) (10, 20) (11, 10) (11, 13) (28, 16) (28, 19) (28, 20) (29, 22) (29, 17) (29, 0) (29, 25) (4, 9) (4, 1) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 9) (7, 22) (7, 24) (7, 23) (7, 1) (12, 18) (12, 24) (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 8) (6, 14) (6, 25) (6, 13) (24, 15) (24, 7) (24, 12) (26, 10) (26, 16) (1, 4) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 13) (16, 28) (16, 26) (16, 19) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 21) (25, 29) (25, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 20) (19, 28) (19, 16) (19, 21) (8, 5) (8, 20) (8, 0) (14, 6) (14, 21) (23, 15) (23, 7) (23, 0) (0, 29) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 23) (21, 9) (21, 19) (21, 14) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 1) (20, 10) (20, 28) (20, 2) (20, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees. Let's arrange the nodes in increasing order of degrees: 

Nodes: (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 13, 8, 7, 16, 14, 21, 3, 5, 9, 11, 12, 15, 17, 19, 26, 10, 20, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 18) 

Now, let's count the number of triangles based on the given edges: 

Number of triangles: [24] 

Unique triangles:  
<0, 1, 17>  
<0, 8, 20>  
<0, 14, 21>  
<1, 7, 17>  
<1, 13, 21>
