Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (13, 6) (13, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 5) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
- 0: 9, 3
- 1: 4, 3, 10
- 2: 7, 11, 5
- 3: 6, 9, 1, 11, 0, 5
- 4: 6, 7, 8, 5, 1
- 5: 4, 3, 11, 8, 2
- 6: 9, 7, 3, 4, 13
- 7: 6, 4, 10, 14, 2
- 8: 4, 11, 5, 14, 12
- 9: 6, 14, 3, 13, 0
- 10: 7, 1, 11, 12
- 11: 3, 10, 5, 8, 2
- 12: 10, 8
- 13: 6, 9
- 14: 9, 7, 8

Now, let's count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by the number of connections (degree):
0 (2), 13 (2), 2 (3), 1 (3), 12 (2), 10 (4), 14 (3), 5 (4), 8 (5), 4 (5), 7 (5), 6 (5), 9 (5), 3 (6), 11 (5)

To count triangles, we start with edges involving vertices with lower degrees:
- The triangles found are: <3, 5, 11>, <4, 1, 5>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 3>, <4, 5, 11>, <4, 7, 14>, <5, 2, 11>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
