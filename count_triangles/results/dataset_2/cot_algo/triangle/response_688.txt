Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 15) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 1) (15, 13) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 15) (19, 10) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 12) (4, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 10) (11, 18) (11, 6) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 14) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 10) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 16) (16, 9) (16, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections. 

Let's list the nodes and their corresponding degrees:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 6 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 10: 5 connections
- Node 11: 3 connections
- Node 12: 4 connections
- Node 13: 4 connections
- Node 14: 4 connections
- Node 15: 4 connections
- Node 16: 2 connections
- Node 17: 3 connections
- Node 18: 4 connections
- Node 19: 3 connections

Now, relabel the vertices starting from the lowest degree:
- Node 4 → Node 0
- Node 16 → Node 1
- Node 0 → Node 2
- Node 2 → Node 3
- Node 3 → Node 4
- Node 5 → Node 5
- Node 6 → Node 6
- Node 7 → Node 7
- Node 17 → Node 8
- Node 19 → Node 9
- Node 11 → Node 10
- Node 1 → Node 11
- Node 12 → Node 12
- Node 13 → Node 13
- Node 14 → Node 14
- Node 15 → Node 15
- Node 8 → Node 16
- Node 9 → Node 17
- Node 10 → Node 18
- Node 18 → Node 19

Now, we restate the edges with the new labels:
- (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 12) (16, 2) (13, 16) (13, 18) (13, 15) (3, 19) (3, 15) (3, 11) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 10) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 11) (17, 19) (17, 1) (17, 2) (15, 13) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 14) (9, 15) (9, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 7) (2, 3) (2, 11) (4, 5) (4, 6) (14, 16) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 12) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 18) (11, 19) (11, 4) (12, 16) (12, 8) (12, 14) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 9) (10, 13) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 1) (1, 17) (1, 10) 

Here are the triangles <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 11>, <3, 4, 5>, <0, 2, 14>, <3, 15, 14>, <0, 2, 16>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 15, 9>, <13, 14, 16>, <4, 5, 7>, <0, 2, 18>, <10, 13, 15>, <4, 6, 8>, <0, 2, 3>, <10, 13, 18>, <4, 5, 6>, <10, 13, 16>, <8, 12, 14>, <10, 15, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, <10, 13, 14>, <4, 5, 11>, <10, 15, 14>, <0, 3, 14>, <1, 17, 19>, <12, 14, 16>, <0, 16, 18>, <12, 14, 15>, <1, 17, 2>, <15, 19, 17>, <5, 7, 17>, <6, 8, 12>, <10, 15, 14>, <15, 19, 10>,  which gives a total of [35] triangles.
