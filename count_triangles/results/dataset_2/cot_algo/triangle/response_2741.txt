Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 14) (10, 15) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 18) (11, 6) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 7) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 0) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 0) (16, 17) (16, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 4) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 4) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 13) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 0) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 19) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 17) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the vertices based on their degree. 

The vertices with their respective degrees are:
0: 4
1: 2
2: 4
3: 3
4: 4
5: 3
6: 4
7: 3
9: 3
10: 3
11: 2
12: 3
13: 4
14: 4
15: 3
16: 2
17: 4
18: 4
19: 3

The sorted vertices in increasing order of degree are:
1, 11, 16, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 0, 19, 2, 4, 6, 13, 14, 17, 18

Using these sorted vertices, we list the edges that are eligible for checking triangles:

(1, 6) (1, 13) 
(11, 18) (11, 6) 
(16, 17) (16, 4) 
(3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 12) 
(5, 7) (5, 17) 
(7, 2) (7, 12) 
(9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) 
(10, 15) (10, 14) 
(12, 0) 
(13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 4) 
(14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 4) 
(17, 5) (17, 4) 
(18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 0)
(0, 19)

Calculating the number of triangles, we find that there are:
[15 triangles]

The unique triangles are: 
<3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 17>, <3, 12, 0>, <3, 12, 18>, <5, 7, 12>, <9, 10, 14>, <9, 13, 1>, <9, 13, 4>, <10, 14, 4>, <13, 1, 6>, <13, 1, 9>, <13, 4, 14>, <13, 4, 17>, <14, 4, 6>, <18, 0, 19>
