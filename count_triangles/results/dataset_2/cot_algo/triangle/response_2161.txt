Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 17) (14, 11) (14, 15) (17, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 13) (10, 19) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 18) (8, 19) (8, 0) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 11) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 4) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 18) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 12) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 13) (4, 0) (4, 13) (15, 9) (15, 14) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 4) (18, 7) (18, 6) (18, 16) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph can be labeled from 0 to 19.

The degree of each node (number of connections):
Node 0: 5
Node 1: 3
Node 2: 4
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 2
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 3
Node 8: 2
Node 9: 4
Node 10: 2
Node 11: 4
Node 12: 4
Node 13: 5
Node 14: 2
Node 15: 2
Node 16: 3
Node 17: 1
Node 18: 3
Node 19: 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the nodes can be relabeled as follows:
Node 17: 0
Node 4: 1
Node 5: 2
Node 14: 3
Node 8: 4
Node 10: 5
Node 1: 6
Node 7: 7
Node 16: 8
Node 18: 9
Node 0: 10
Node 2: 11
Node 3: 12
Node 6: 13
Node 12: 14
Node 19: 15
Node 9: 16
Node 11: 17
Node 13: 18
Node 15: 19

Using these new labels, the edges in the graph can be represented as:
(2, 6) (4, 6) (8, 12) (11, 18) (10, 16) (0, 10) (1, 6) (7, 11) (8, 16) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 12) (6, 12) (6, 18) (12, 18) (3, 19) (6, 13) (4, 13) (7, 13) (10, 13) (11, 13) (4, 16) (7, 18) (10, 19) (3, 6) (3, 19) (12, 13) (8, 19) (11, 19)

Counting the triangles using these new labels gives us:
Total triangles: [28]

Unique triangles:
<6, 12, 18>
<3, 6, 12>
<3, 6, 18>
<4, 6, 12>
<6, 13, 18>
<4, 6, 13>
<12, 13, 18>
<3, 12, 13>
<10, 13, 16>
<10, 13, 18>
<11, 13, 18>
<4, 10, 13>
<4, 10, 16>
<7, 11, 13>
<7, 11, 18>
<7, 13, 18>
<8, 12, 16>
<7, 8, 11>
<6, 11, 18>
<8, 10, 16>
<1, 3, 12>
<1, 6, 12>
