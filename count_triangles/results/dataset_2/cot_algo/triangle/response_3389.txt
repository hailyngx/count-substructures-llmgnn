Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 11) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 12) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 0) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 14) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 9) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are as follows: 

Node 11 (degree 2) 
Node 14 (degree 2) 
Node 1 (degree 4) 
Node 9 (degree 4) 
Node 8 (degree 3) 
Node 6 (degree 3) 
Node 0 (degree 4) 
Node 3 (degree 3) 
Node 4 (degree 4) 
Node 7 (degree 4) 
Node 10 (degree 4) 
Node 13 (degree 4) 
Node 5 (degree 6)
Node 2 (degree 5)
Node 12 (degree 6)

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Now, we will identify the triangles formed by the shared connections:
- Triangle <0, 5, 7>
- Triangle <0, 5, 10>
- Triangle <0, 5, 12>
- Triangle <0, 5, 14>
- Triangle <0, 7, 13>
- Triangle <0, 9, 14>
- Triangle <2, 7, 13>
- Triangle <2, 9, 13>
- Triangle <3, 1, 4>
- Triangle <5, 7, 13>
- Triangle <5, 10, 13>
- Triangle <5, 12, 6>
- Triangle <5, 12, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
