Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 7) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 10) (8, 16) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 2) (12, 17) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (0, 2) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 10) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 19) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 17) (5, 15) (5, 19) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 14) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 13) (17, 12) (17, 15) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 13) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 14) (3, 18) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 13) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph can be labeled as follows according to their degree:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 18: 4 connections
Node 16: 5 connections
Node 10: 5 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 19: 5 connections
Node 11: 5 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 14: 6 connections

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph by examining the shared connections. 

The total number of triangles is given as: [13]

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 4, 16>
<1, 4, 19>
<1, 16, 8>
<1, 16, 14>
<2, 10, 13>
<2, 10, 19>
<4, 15, 17>
<5, 15, 17>
<7, 9, 11>
<7, 9, 18>
<7, 10, 13>
<10, 13, 16>
<13, 14, 16>
