Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 13) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 6) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 0) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 1) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: {(5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 3), (5, 10), (5, 14), (9, 14), (9, 1), (9, 13), (1, 14), (1, 10), (1, 12), (3, 7), (3, 14), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 11), (4, 6), (4, 2), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (12, 11), (0, 8), (0, 2), (0, 13), (2, 13), (11, 12), (14, 3), (14, 6)}

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes sorted by degree: [10, 2, 7, 11, 12, 1, 8, 9, 0, 5, 6, 13, 3, 14, 4]
Relabeled nodes: {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 6, 4: 10, 5: 11, 6: 12, 7: 1, 8: 3, 9: 7, 10: 5, 11: 8, 12: 9, 13: 13, 14: 14}
