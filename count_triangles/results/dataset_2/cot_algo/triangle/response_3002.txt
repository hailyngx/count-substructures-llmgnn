Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 9) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 2) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 14) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 9) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 3) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (8, 13), (8, 7), (8, 12), (8, 3), (8, 1), (13, 4), (13, 9), (10, 0), (10, 12), (10, 1), (10, 4), (10, 2), (11, 6), (11, 2), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7), (6, 11), (6, 12), (6, 0), (7, 5), (7, 9), (12, 10), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 10), (1, 2), (2, 11), (2, 7), (2, 4), (4, 14), (3, 14), (14, 9)

Next, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

Nodes by degree: 11, 5, 4, 13, 3, 6, 1, 14, 7, 9, 0, 12, 8, 2, 10

Now, we will proceed with counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
We will go through each edge and check for shared connections to form triangles.

Total number of triangles: [15]

Unique triangles found: 
<1, 8, 10>
<1, 4, 10>
<1, 2, 10>
<1, 7, 10>
<4, 10, 14>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 10>
<0, 6, 12>
<2, 7, 11>
