Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 11) (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 16) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 14) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 8) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 18) (6, 10) (6, 0) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 19) (16, 5) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 13) (2, 9) (2, 4) (11, 15) (11, 1) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 7) (18, 3) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 13) (19, 18) (1, 10) (1, 11) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):
   - Node 3: 4 connections
   - Node 15: 4 connections
   - Node 5: 3 connections
   - Node 9: 4 connections
   - Node 4: 2 connections
   - Node 7: 2 connections
   - Node 10: 4 connections
   - Node 17: 4 connections
   - Node 8: 4 connections
   - Node 12: 3 connections
   - Node 6: 2 connections
   - Node 13: 4 connections
   - Node 16: 4 connections
   - Node 2: 2 connections
   - Node 11: 2 connections
   - Node 14: 3 connections
   - Node 18: 3 connections
   - Node 19: 2 connections
   - Node 1: 2 connections
   - Node 0: 3 connections

2. Relabel the vertices in increasing order of their degrees:
   - Node 4: 0 connections
   - Node 7: 0 connections
   - Node 2: 0 connections
   - Node 6: 0 connections
   - Node 11: 0 connections
   - Node 1: 0 connections
   - Node 19: 0 connections
   - Node 0: 1 connection
   - Node 5: 2 connections
   - Node 12: 2 connections
   - Node 18: 2 connections
   - Node 14: 2 connections
   - Node 8: 3 connections
   - Node 13: 3 connections
   - Node 16: 3 connections
   - Node 3: 4 connections
   - Node 15: 4 connections
   - Node 9: 4 connections
   - Node 10: 4 connections
   - Node 17: 4 connections

3. Count the triangles based on the sorted order:
   - Check each edge to ensure the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.
   - Count the number of triangles by finding shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

After counting, we find:
Total number of triangles: [12]
Unique triangles: <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 16>, <0, 6, 10>, <0, 6, 12>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 13>, <2, 4, 16>, <5, 9, 13>, <5, 9, 16>, <5, 14, 7>, <8, 10, 17>, <13, 16, 19>
