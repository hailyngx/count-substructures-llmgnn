Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 20) (3, 26) (15, 3) (15, 23) (15, 6) (15, 13) (0, 20) (0, 24) (27, 13) (18, 22) (18, 17) (18, 25) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 5) (7, 16) (7, 24) (7, 23) (21, 24) (5, 22) (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 28) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 16) (9, 1) (10, 1) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 29) (20, 3) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 6) (28, 5) (28, 29) (29, 11) (29, 28) (29, 26) (29, 4) (14, 2) (14, 25) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 20) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 24) (4, 5) (4, 29) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 19) (16, 7) (16, 9) (16, 19) (17, 18) (17, 25) (17, 8) (25, 18) (25, 14) (25, 17) (25, 8) (8, 18) (8, 17) (8, 25) (26, 3) (26, 11) (26, 20) (26, 29) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 13) (19, 12) (19, 16) (19, 2) (19, 13) (23, 15) (23, 7) (24, 0) (24, 7) (24, 21) (24, 1) (13, 15) (13, 27) (13, 2) (13, 19) 

Response:
The vertices in the graph can be ordered based on their degrees as follows:
Vertices:
0 (degree 2), 3 (degree 3), 8 (degree 3), 21 (degree 1), 2 (degree 4), 20 (degree 4), 27 (degree 1), 7 (degree 3), 1 (degree 3), 12 (degree 2), 14 (degree 2), 17 (degree 4), 19 (degree 4), 25 (degree 4), 29 (degree 4), 4 (degree 4), 6 (degree 4), 13 (degree 4), 15 (degree 4), 5 (degree 4), 9 (degree 4), 18 (degree 4), 22 (degree 3), 23 (degree 2), 24 (degree 4), 10 (degree 1), 11 (degree 4), 16 (degree 3), 26 (degree 4), 28 (degree 3)

Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph:

[Total number of triangles: 18]
<3, 15, 20>, <3, 15, 6>, <3, 15, 13>, <3, 20, 6>, <3, 20, 26>, <15, 22, 5>, <15, 9, 6>, <15, 9, 16>, <15, 6, 9>, <15, 6, 20>, <15, 13, 19>, <15, 13, 27>, <20, 0, 24>, <20, 6, 9>, <20, 26, 11>, <22, 5, 9>, <22, 11, 29>, <26, 11, 29>
