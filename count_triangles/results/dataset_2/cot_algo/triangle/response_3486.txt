Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
(0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 8),
(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9),
(2, 5), (2, 6),
(3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 9),
(4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8),
(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6),
(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9),
(7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9),
(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 4),
(9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 7)

By analyzing the connections, we can rearrange the nodes in the following order (lowest to highest degree):
Nodes: 0, 2, 7, 5, 8, 9, 3, 1, 6, 4

Now, let's count the triangles:
Total number of triangles: [15]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
