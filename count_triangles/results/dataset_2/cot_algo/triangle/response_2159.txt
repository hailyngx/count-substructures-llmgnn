Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first and then apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 8), (6, 4), (9, 4), (9, 3), (4, 6), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 0), (8, 6), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 7), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 3), (7, 8), (7, 5), (7, 0), (7, 1), (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 5), (3, 2), (3, 0), (1, 8), (1, 2), (1, 7)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Node 9 has degree 2
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 0 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 9 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 2 has degree 5

Since all vertices have unique degrees and connections were added in increasing order of degrees, we can start counting triangles by considering each edge. 

Calculating the triangles, we find:
Total number of triangles: [26]
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 2, 3>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 3>, <2, 8, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 6>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 0>, <7, 8, 2>, <7, 8, 6>
