Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 11) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 12) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in this graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections):
Vertices from lowest to highest degree: 3, 7, 8, 0, 5, 10, 11, 1, 12, 9, 6, 4, 14, 2, 13.

2. Relabel the vertices based on their sorted order:
Vertices with their new labels: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

3. Check each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
Count triangles formed by shared connections.

Triangles found:
<0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 13>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 5, 13>, <2, 7, 5>, <2, 7, 13>, <2, 5, 13>, <7, 5, 13>.

Total number of triangles: [9].
