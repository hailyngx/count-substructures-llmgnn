Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
- Node 5 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 6
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 0 has degree 4

Based on the ordering above, we will look at each edge and count the triangles formed. 

The total number of triangles is [14].

The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 4>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 4>
<2, 1, 4>
<2, 1, 8>
<7, 5, 4>
<7, 5, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
