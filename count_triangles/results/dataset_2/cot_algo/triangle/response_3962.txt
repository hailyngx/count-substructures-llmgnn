Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 13) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (4, 8) (4, 15) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 7) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 6) (6, 15) (6, 13) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 2) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 9) (7, 2) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 19) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 13) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 9) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 16) (13, 14) (13, 12) (18, 0) (5, 17) (5, 16) (11, 8) (11, 2) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 11) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 3) (19, 14) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: (18, 19), (19, 0), (0, 2)
- 2: (0, 2), (2, 7), (2, 11)
- 3: (3, 4), (3, 9), (3, 19)
- 4: (8, 4), (4, 15), (4, 3)
- 5: (17, 5), (5, 16)
- 6: (15, 6), (6, 13)
- 7: (17, 7), (7, 8), (7, 16), (7, 9), (7, 2)
- 8: (4, 8), (8, 11), (8, 7)
- 9: (3, 9), (14, 9), (9, 7), (9, 12)
- 10: (17, 10), (10, 15), (10, 12), (10, 13)
- 11: (8, 11), (11, 2)
- 12: (10, 12), (12, 13), (12, 9)
- 13: (6, 13), (13, 16), (13, 14), (13, 12), (13, 10)
- 14: (9, 14), (14, 19), (14, 13)
- 15: (10, 15), (15, 4), (15, 6)
- 16: (7, 16), (16, 13), (16, 5)
- 17: (10, 17), (17, 19), (17, 5), (17, 7)
- 18: (0, 18)
- 19: (14, 19), (19, 17), (19, 0), (19, 3)

Now, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles.

Vertices sorted by degree:
0, 11, 18, 5
3, 6, 8, 16, 18
3, 6, 9, 12, 14
4, 8, 15
5, 16, 17
6, 13
7, 11, 16
7, 8, 9
10, 12, 17
11, 2
12, 13, 14
13, 16
14, 19
15
17, 19

Triangles found:
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 15>
<3, 9, 7>
<3, 9, 12>
<4, 8, 7>
<4, 15, 6>
<7, 8, 11>
<9, 12, 13>
<9, 12, 14>
<14, 19, 17>

Total number of triangles: [10]
