Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (6, 9), (2, 0), (3, 0)
- 1: (9, 1), (5, 1), (8, 1), (4, 1)
- 2: (5, 2), (0, 2)
- 3: (6, 3), (8, 3), (0, 3), (4, 3)
- 4: (7, 4), (5, 4), (1, 4), (3, 4)
- 5: (6, 5), (8, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (4, 5)
- 6: (7, 6), (9, 6), (5, 6), (3, 6), (0, 6)
- 7: (4, 7), (6, 7), (8, 7)
- 8: (7, 8), (9, 8), (5, 8), (1, 8), (3, 8)
- 9: (6, 9), (8, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Nodes 1, 9 have degree 4
- Nodes 0, 8 have degree 5
- Nodes 3, 5, 6 have degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 4

Now, we count the number of triangles inside brackets [ ]: [30].

Unique triangles <i, j, k> found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <3, 6, 8>
- <3, 8, 9>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <5, 8, 9>
- <6, 7, 8>
