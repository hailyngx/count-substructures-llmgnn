Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 15) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 18) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 19) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 18) (7, 6) (7, 19) (12, 16) (12, 17) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 8) (18, 13) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 19) (17, 12) (17, 15) (13, 3) (13, 18) (0, 10) (0, 8) (15, 16) (15, 17) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 8) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2) 

Response:
The given list of edges can be represented as a graph with 20 nodes. To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we'll first sort the vertices by their degree. Then, we will iterate through the edges while following the rules mentioned in the prompt.

The sorted vertices are:  
Vertex 5: Degree 2  
Vertex 7: Degree 2  
Vertex 0: Degree 3  
Vertex 1: Degree 3  
Vertex 15: Degree 3  
Vertex 17: Degree 3  
Vertex 4: Degree 4  
Vertex 13: Degree 4  
Vertex 2: Degree 5  
Vertex 14: Degree 2  
Vertex 12: Degree 2  
Vertex 3: Degree 5  
Vertex 18: Degree 5  
Vertex 6: Degree 5  
Vertex 11: Degree 5  
Vertex 10: Degree 5  
Vertex 8: Degree 5  
Vertex 16: Degree 5  
Vertex 9: Degree 6  
Vertex 19: Degree 6  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we proceed through the edges:  
1. (11, 16) - Form a triangle with node 6: Triangle <6, 11, 16>  
2. (11, 10) - No additional triangles  
3. (11, 19) - No additional triangles  
4. (16, 11) - Already counted  
5. (16, 12) - No additional triangles  
6. (16, 9) - Form a triangle with node 10: Triangle <9, 10, 16>  
7. (16, 15) - No additional triangles  
8. (1, 3) - No additional triangles

27. (12, 16) - No additional triangles  
28. (12, 17) - No additional triangles  
29. (18, 3) - No additional triangles
