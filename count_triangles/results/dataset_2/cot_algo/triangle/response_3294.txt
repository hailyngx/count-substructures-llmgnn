Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 8), (0, 5), (0, 2), (0, 9), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 9), (1, 7), (2, 8), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 9), (3, 1), (3, 9), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 8), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 0), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 9), (8, 0), (8, 6), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 0), (9, 7)

Degree-Based Ordering:
Node 7: degree 1
Node 6: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 1: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 9: degree 6

Triangles:
[<0, 2, 8>, <2, 8, 9>, <0, 2, 9>] 

Total number of triangles: [3]
