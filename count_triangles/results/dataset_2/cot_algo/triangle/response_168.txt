Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 7) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 13) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 18) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 15) (8, 5) (8, 2) (4, 13) (4, 1) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 7) (1, 17) (1, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 19) (0, 16) (0, 3) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 13) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 7) (3, 10) (3, 0) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 19) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 15) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 16) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with 20 nodes and 60 edges. 

The Degree-Based Ordering method first requires sorting the vertices based on their degree. The sorted list of vertices is as follows:
```
10: 3 connections
11: 3 connections
17: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
16: 4 connections
19: 5 connections
12: 3 connections
1: 2 connections
9: 3 connections
18: 3 connections
4: 2 connections
0: 2 connections
15: 3 connections
7: 3 connections
13: 4 connections
14: 3 connections
3: 2 connections
```

Looking at the edges and starting from the lower labeled vertex for each edge, the triangles are as follows:
- <1, 4, 17>
- <2, 8, 19>
- <2, 14, 15>
- <4, 9, 13>
- <5, 6, 18>
- <5, 7, 18>
- <5, 8, 16>
- <9, 11, 13>
- <10, 17, 19>
- <11, 13, 16>
- <11, 13, 19>
- <11, 13, 9>
- <12, 16, 19>
- <14, 15, 19>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
