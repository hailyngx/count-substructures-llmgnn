Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 24) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 7) (22, 18) (22, 4) (22, 14) (22, 16) (22, 5) (7, 18) (7, 26) (21, 6) (21, 10) (21, 19) (21, 26) (20, 12) (20, 16) (25, 29) (25, 15) (28, 3) (28, 9) (28, 12) (29, 25) (29, 5) (29, 3) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 1) (6, 21) (6, 24) (6, 14) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 10) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 26) (4, 27) (4, 22) (4, 24) (4, 16) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (23, 26) (23, 13) (8, 11) (19, 18) (19, 21) (10, 21) (10, 1) (16, 22) (16, 20) (16, 4) (16, 2) (26, 7) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 23) (26, 14) (3, 28) (3, 29) (3, 17) (24, 27) (24, 6) (24, 4) (24, 13) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 26) (12, 20) (12, 28) (9, 28) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 2) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 13) (13, 23) (13, 24) (13, 15) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method. First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections).

The degrees for each node are as follows:
Node 0: 1
Node 1: 3
Node 2: 3
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 4
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 3
Node 7: 2
Node 8: 2
Node 9: 4
Node 10: 2
Node 11: 3
Node 12: 2
Node 13: 3
Node 14: 3
Node 15: 3
Node 16: 4
Node 17: 4
Node 18: 3
Node 19: 3
Node 20: 2
Node 21: 4
Node 22: 5
Node 23: 2
Node 24: 4
Node 25: 2
Node 26: 5
Node 27: 3
Node 28: 3
Node 29: 3

Now, let's relabel the nodes from least to most connections:
Nodes in order: 0 10 8 25 23 12 20 7 9 13 1 2 6 14 15 19 11 28 4 29 17 16 18 3 24 5 21 27 26 22

Next, we will identify triangles in the graph by examining the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. 

The total number of triangles found using the Degree-Based Ordering method is [32].

The unique triangles found are:
<7, 26, 21>
<7, 26, 17>
<7, 26, 14>
<7, 26, 4>
<7, 26, 6>

<7, 21, 19>
