Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 10) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 11) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 14) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 
(3) - 1 connection
(2, 10) - 2 connections
(0, 11) - 3 connections
(1, 9) - 4 connections
(4, 7, 12) - 5 connections
(5, 6, 8, 13, 14) - 6 connections

Therefore, we can start counting the triangles as follows:
1. For node 3: No triangles
2. For nodes 2 and 10: No triangles
3. For nodes 0 and 11: 
   - No triangle as they do not share a common neighbor.
4. For nodes 1 and 9:
   - Triangle <1, 9, 14>
5. For nodes 4 and 7 (proceeding with the same rules as the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections):
   - Triangle <4, 7, 12>
   - Triangle <4, 7, 13>
6. For node 12 and nodes 5, 6, 8, 13, 14:
   - Triangle <12, 5, 6>
   - Triangle <12, 5, 13>
   - Triangle <12, 6, 13>
7. For nodes 5, 6, 8, 13, 14 (already covered above):
   - No new triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5] and the unique triangles found are <1, 9, 14>, <4, 7, 12>, <4, 7, 13>, <12, 5, 6>, and <12, 6, 13>.
