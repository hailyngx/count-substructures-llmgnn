Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 27) (1, 7) (3, 21) (3, 14) (22, 15) (22, 12) (23, 5) (23, 0) (23, 24) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (18, 17) (18, 25) (17, 18) (17, 12) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 21) (11, 28) (11, 14) (11, 15) (28, 11) (24, 23) (24, 20) (26, 29) (26, 21) (26, 6) (21, 3) (21, 29) (21, 26) (21, 15) (9, 29) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 7) (12, 22) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 13) (25, 18) (25, 27) (27, 1) (27, 25) (27, 2) (2, 12) (2, 27) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 10) (19, 2) (19, 20) (19, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (7, 16) (16, 9) (16, 7) (8, 5) (8, 20) (6, 1) (6, 26) (6, 2) (6, 20) (5, 23) (5, 4) (5, 8) (0, 23) (0, 19) (0, 10) (0, 15) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 0) (13, 4) (13, 12) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 15) (15, 22) (15, 11) (15, 21) (15, 0) (15, 14) (20, 24) (20, 19) (20, 8) (20, 6) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 30
Edges: 90

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
   Node 28: degree 1
   Node 5: degree 2
   Node 13: degree 2
   Node 3: degree 2
   Node 17: degree 2
   Node 10: degree 3
   Node 7: degree 3
   Node 8: degree 3
   Node 16: degree 3
   Node 14: degree 3
   Node 21: degree 4
   Node 22: degree 4
   Node 27: degree 4
   Node 26: degree 4
   Node 12: degree 5
   Node 25: degree 5
   Node 4: degree 5
   Node 20: degree 5
   Node 24: degree 5
   Node 0: degree 5
   Node 11: degree 5
   Node 18: degree 6
   Node 9: degree 6
   Node 2: degree 6
   Node 6: degree 6
   Node 1: degree 6
   Node 19: degree 6
   Node 23: degree 6
   Node 15: degree 6
   Node 29: degree 6

2. Identify the triangles:

   - Triangle 1: <4, 12, 13>
   - Triangle 2: <2, 12, 27>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 10, 19>
   - Triangle 4: <5, 8, 20>
   - Triangle 5: <1, 6, 27>
   - Triangle 6: <9, 16, 7>
   - Triangle 7: <11, 14, 15>
   - Triangle 8: <21, 26, 29>
   - Triangle 9: <0, 15, 23>
   - Triangle 10: <2, 6, 20>
   - Triangle 11: <3, 14, 21>
   - Triangle 12: <12, 17, 18>
   - Triangle 13: <2, 10, 27>
   - Triangle 14: <2, 6, 26>
   - Triangle 15: <10, 0, 9>
   - Triangle 16: <0, 15, 21>
   - Triangle 17: <16, 7, 9>
   - Triangle 18: <0, 19, 23>
   - Triangle 19: <12, 2, 27>
   - Triangle 20: <2, 27, 25>
   - Triangle 21: <15, 11, 14>
   - Triangle 22: <20, 6, 24>
   - Triangle 23: <12, 4, 5>
   - Triangle 24: <15, 0, 23>
   - Triangle 25: <6, 1, 26>
   - Triangle 26: <16, 9, 7>
   - Triangle 27: <12, 17, 2>
   - Triangle 28: <5, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [28].
