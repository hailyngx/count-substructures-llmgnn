Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 12) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 7) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 0), (5, 7), 
(9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 14), (9, 7), (9, 12), 
(10, 11), (10, 0), (10, 6), (10, 8), (10, 13),

(3, 6), (3, 0), (3, 12), 
(1, 11), (1, 13), (1, 7)

Let's sort the nodes based on the number of connections:
Nodes sorted by degrees: [1, 3, 4, 5, 14, 11, 7, 12, 2, 13, 6, 0, 10, 8, 9]

Triangles formed by shared connections:
[Total number of triangles: 8]
<5, 0, 10>, <5, 8, 10>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 9, 4>, <9, 7, 5>, <9, 7, 2>, <9, 14, 12>, <10, 0, 13>
