Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 14) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 13) 

Response:
The graph with the nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: (4, 7), (4, 13), (4, 10), (4, 11), (7, 14), (7, 9), (7, 5), (10, 11), (10, 0), (10, 1), (10, 9), (10, 14), (11, 5), (8, 13), (8, 5), (8, 0), (13, 8), (13, 5), (13, 1), (13, 9), (13, 14), (2, 6), (2, 3), (2, 0), (5, 12), (5, 3), (0, 8), (0, 3), (6, 12), (9, 1), (14, 13)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order and relabel them accordingly:
Degree-based ordering: {2, 6, 12, 1, 3, 8, 11, 0, 9, 13, 14, 4, 7, 10, 5}

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles is [8].
Unique triangles found: 
<0, 9, 10>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 9, 13>
<2, 3, 6>
<4, 7, 10>
<4, 10, 11>
<5, 7, 10>
<5, 11, 13>
