Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 3) (16, 9) (10, 18) (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 7) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (19, 5) (19, 7) (15, 8) (15, 0) (15, 4) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (18, 10) (18, 1) (3, 16) (3, 6) (7, 13) (7, 19) (7, 17) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 9) (2, 7) (14, 5) (14, 9) (4, 6) (4, 15) (4, 9) (4, 1) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 12) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) (1, 18) (1, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 20
Edges: 60
Edge List:
- 0: {11, 15, 12}
- 1: {18, 4}
- 2: {5, 17, 9, 7}
- 3: {16, 6}
- 4: {15, 6, 9, 1}
- 5: {6, 19, 2, 12, 14}
- 6: {5, 3, 4}
- 7: {13, 19, 17, 2}
- 8: {13, 15, 12}
- 9: {16, 4, 2, 14}
- 10: {18}
- 11: {16, 0}
- 12: {8, 5, 0}
- 13: {16, 8, 17, 7}
- 14: {5, 9}
- 15: {8, 0, 4}
- 16: {11, 13, 3, 9}
- 17: {13, 7, 2}
- 18: {10, 1}
- 19: {5, 7}

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph.
First, we sort the nodes by their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes by degree:
[10, 1, 3, 17, 18, 0, 14, 16, 8, 6, 12, 5, 7, 9, 4, 13, 19, 2, 11, 15]

Now, we will count the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [28]
Unique Triangles:
<0, 12, 15>
<0, 12, 8>
<0, 15, 8>
<0, 11, 16>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 18>
<2, 7, 17>
<2, 7, 13>
<2, 9, 14>
<2, 9, 4>
<2, 5, 12>
<2, 5, 14>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 5>
<4, 9, 14>
<4, 9, 13>
<5, 12, 14>
<5, 12, 6>
<5, 12, 0>
<5, 14, 9>
<6, 12, 5>
<7, 13, 17>
<7, 13, 2>
<7, 13, 19>
<8, 12, 5>
