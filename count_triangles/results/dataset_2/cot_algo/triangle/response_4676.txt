Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are:
0 (degree 6),
3 (degree 6),
1 (degree 4),
6 (degree 4),
5 (degree 4),
7 (degree 4),
9 (degree 4),
2 (degree 3),
4 (degree 3),
8 (degree 2).

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges involving vertices with lower labels and fewer connections:

(0, 5) (0, 9) - share a connection with 3 to form a triangle <0, 3, 5>.
(0, 4) (0, 3) - share a connection with 5 to form a triangle <0, 3, 4>.
(0, 1) (0, 4) - share a connection with 6 to form a triangle <0, 4, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
