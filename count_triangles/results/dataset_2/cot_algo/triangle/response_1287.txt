Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 28) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 19) (17, 27) (17, 11) (17, 4) (7, 25) (7, 3) (7, 23) (12, 10) (12, 2) (1, 26) (1, 13) (1, 0) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 21) (28, 9) (28, 26) (28, 3) (25, 7) (25, 21) (8, 9) (8, 20) (8, 6) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 27) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 28) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 15) (2, 24) (19, 10) (19, 22) (19, 4) (22, 19) (22, 27) (0, 1) (0, 4) (16, 24) (16, 21) (11, 17) (11, 24) (11, 21) (11, 15) (24, 2) (24, 16) (24, 11) (24, 4) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 16) (21, 11) (21, 29) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 14) (18, 14) (18, 23) (18, 15) (23, 7) (23, 18) (23, 13) (20, 8) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 24) (27, 17) (27, 14) (27, 22) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 23) (29, 21) (29, 15) (15, 2) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 29) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degrees in ascending order. Here is the list of nodes with their degrees:

Node 5: 2  
Node 6: 3  
Node 0: 3  
Node 20: 1  
Node 8: 3  
Node 7: 3  
Node 1: 3  
Node 14: 3  
Node 22: 2  
Node 17: 3  
Node 29: 2  
Node 25: 2  
Node 16: 3  
Node 12: 2  
Node 10: 3  
Node 26: 3  
Node 4: 5  
Node 9: 3  
Node 15: 4  
Node 23: 3  
Node 13: 4  
Node 18: 4  
Node 24: 5  
Node 21: 5  
Node 11: 4  
Node 28: 4  
Node 2: 6  
Node 3: 6  
Node 19: 3  
Node 27: 3  

To count the triangles, we will look at each edge and only consider cases where the node with the lower label has fewer connections than the other node. Then, we will check for shared connections to form triangles.

After analyzing all the edges, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [33]

The unique triangles found are:  
<2, 26, 28>  
<12, 2, 13>  
<12, 2, 24>  
<12, 10, 19>
