Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 14) (14, 11) (14, 3) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 

Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 10: 3 connections
Vertex 11: 5 connections
Vertex 12: 2 connections
Vertex 13: 4 connections  
Vertex 14: 2 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 6 connections
Vertex 3: 6 connections
Vertex 4: 6 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
