Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 28) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 1) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 23) (26, 3) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 5) (7, 12) (7, 22) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (3, 26) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 27) (4, 20) (4, 15) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 23) (25, 6) (25, 23) (28, 16) (28, 9) (28, 10) (9, 3) (9, 28) (9, 24) (29, 27) (29, 23) (10, 28) (10, 21) (10, 8) (10, 22) (21, 10) (21, 15) (21, 17) (5, 26) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 8) (23, 26) (23, 27) (23, 25) (23, 29) (19, 14) (22, 7) (22, 10) (22, 17) (6, 11) (6, 25) (6, 17) (17, 21) (17, 22) (17, 6) (17, 15) (8, 0) (8, 10) (8, 5) (20, 4) (20, 13) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 20) (13, 24) (24, 9) (24, 13) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 21) (15, 17) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: (11, 6), (11, 15), (16, 28), (2, 18), (2, 1), (2, 14), (18, 1), (1, 26), (26, 3), (0, 8), (14, 19), (7, 12), (7, 22), (12, 13), (3, 9), (3, 4), (4, 27), (20, 13), (24, 13), (17, 21), (17, 15), (5, 8), (19, 14), (6, 17), (25, 23), (5, 12), (13, 24), (27, 29), (10, 21), (29, 23)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes sorted by degrees: 16, 0, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 19, 25, 17, 22, 26, 18, 20, 21, 24, 27, 29, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 13, 14, 15, 3, 8, 23

Next, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

The total number of triangles is [35].
The unique triangles found are: <1, 18, 26>, <10, 21, 17>, <10, 21, 15>, <13, 3, 24>, <13, 3, 4>, <13, 4, 27>, <13, 9, 24>, <14, 2, 0>, <15, 4, 21>, <15, 4, 11>, <15, 4, 17>, <16, 28, 9>, <16, 28, 10>, <16, 28, 9>, <17, 15, 21>, <17, 15, 6>, <17, 21, 10>, <17, 21, 15>, <18, 2, 1>, <19, 14, 5>, <20, 4, 13>, <23, 26, 29>, <24, 13, 3>, <25, 23, 29>, <3, 4, 27>, <3, 9, 24>, <5, 8, 0>, <5, 8, 10>, <5, 12, 7>, <5, 14, 2>, <7, 12, 22>, <12, 13, 3>, <12, 13, 24>, <26, 1, 18>, <5, 12, 7>.
