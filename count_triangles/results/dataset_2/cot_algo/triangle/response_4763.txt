Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 2) (12, 6) (12, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 10) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 6) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently in the given graph. Let's start by identifying the nodes with their corresponding degrees:

- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 7
- Node 6: degree 6
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 5

Now, let's relabel the nodes according to their degrees in ascending order:

- Node 8 (degree 2)
- Node 12 (degree 2)
- Node 13 (degree 3)
- Node 3 (degree 4)
- Node 4 (degree 4)
- Node 10 (degree 4)
- Node 11 (degree 4)
- Node 1 (degree 5)
- Node 2 (degree 5)
- Node 7 (degree 5)
- Node 9 (degree 5)
- Node 14 (degree 5)
- Node 0 (degree 3)
- Node 6 (degree 6)
- Node 5 (degree 7)

Next, we will analyze the edges based on the relabeled nodes to count the number of triangles. The triangles found will be listed as unique combinations:

[Total number of triangles: 10]
<0, 1, 14>
<0, 2, 14>
<1, 2, 14>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 14>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 14>
<3, 4, 14>
<5, 6, 7>
<6, 11, 13>
