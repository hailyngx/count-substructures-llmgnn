Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 13) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 11), (9, 14), (9, 10), (9, 13), (9, 0), 
(4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 6), (7, 12), (7, 11), (7, 2), (7, 1), 
(1, 3), (1, 13), (1, 8), (3, 13), (3, 2), 
(10, 11), (10, 0), (10, 13), 
(12, 14), (12, 6), (12, 8), 
(2, 3), 
(8, 0), 
(6, 13), 
(0, 8), 
(14, 13)

Next, let's sort the nodes by the number of connections:

Nodes sorted by degree (from least connections to most):
{5, 2, 4, 6, 3, 8, 10, 14, 0, 12, 7, 11, 1, 13, 9}

Now, we will start counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 4]
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 8, 14>
<4, 6, 12>
<1, 5, 11>
