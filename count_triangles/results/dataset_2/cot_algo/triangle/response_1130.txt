Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- 0: {9, 4, 7, 3, 6, 8}
- 1: {7, 3}
- 2: {5, 9, 6}
- 3: {5, 4, 7, 1, 0, 6}
- 4: {7, 8, 0, 3}
- 5: {9, 2, 8, 3}
- 6: {3, 2, 0}
- 7: {4, 0, 3, 1}
- 8: {5, 9, 4, 0}
- 9: {5, 8, 2, 0}

Now, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles.

Vertices sorted by connections (ascending): [1, 2, 6, 9, 8, 5, 7, 4, 0, 3]

Triangles:
1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <0, 3, 4>
4. <0, 3, 6>
5. <0, 8, 4>
6. <0, 8, 5>
7. <0, 9, 5>
8. <0, 9, 8>
9. <1, 3, 7>
10. <2, 5, 9>
11. <2, 6, 0>

Total number of triangles: [11]
