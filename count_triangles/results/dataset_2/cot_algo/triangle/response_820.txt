Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9), 
(2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 9), 
(4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 7), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7), 
(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), 
(7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 8), 
(8, 0), (8, 7), (8, 9), 
(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 8)

Next, we will arrange the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes sorted by their degree:
0 (degree 5)
1 (degree 5)
3 (degree 5)
7 (degree 5)
2 (degree 4)
4 (degree 3)
5 (degree 3)
6 (degree 3)
8 (degree 3)
9 (degree 3)

Since we have sorted the nodes by degree, we now check the edges:

Edges to consider in order based on the degree of the nodes:
(4, 7), (5, 7), (4, 0), (5, 3), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 9), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 7), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (7, 8), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 9), (8, 0), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 8), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 3)

Counting the triangles in the graph:  

Number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 8>
