Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
The graph with nodes and edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (5, 9), (5, 1), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 7), (4, 8), (4, 1), (4, 6), (8, 0), (8, 7), (8, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2), (3, 6), (3, 2), (7, 8), (0, 3), (0, 1), (0, 2)

Now, let's solve for the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The vertices sorted by their number of connections (degree) are:

Vertices: 5, 4, 7, 0, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 9

With the sorted vertices, we analyze each edge and count the triangles formed:

1. Edge (5, 1): No triangle formed.
2. Edge (5, 9): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (9, 8): Triangle formed: <8, 9, 2>.
4. Edge (9, 2): Triangle formed: <2, 9, 3>.
5. Edge (9, 3): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (9, 1): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (9, 7): No triangle formed.
8. Edge (4, 8): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (4, 1): Triangle formed: <1, 4, 0>.
10. Edge (4, 6): Triangle formed: <6, 4, 8>.
11. Edge (8, 0): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (8, 7): No triangle formed.
13. Edge (8, 1): Triangle formed: <1, 8, 0>.
14. Edge (6, 3): No triangle formed.
15. Edge (6, 2): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (3, 6): No triangle formed.
17. Edge (3, 2): No triangle formed.
18. Edge (7, 8): No triangle formed.
19. Edge (0, 3): Triangle formed: <3, 0, 2>.
20. Edge (0, 1): Triangle formed: <1, 0, 2>.

After analyzing all the edges, the total number of triangles is [6]. 

The unique triangles found are: <8, 9, 2>, <2, 9, 3>, <1, 4, 0>, <6, 4, 8>, <1, 8, 0>, <3, 0, 2>.
