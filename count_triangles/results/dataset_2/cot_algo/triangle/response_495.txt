Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges based on the information provided:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 8, 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 4, 2, 0
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 3, 4, 0
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 7, 8, 0, 2
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 0, 1
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 2
- Node 3 is connected to node 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 0
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 1
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections):
Nodes in order: 3, 1, 8, 7, 0, 2, 5, 6, 4, 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles in the graph:

Triangles: 
- <4, 6, 9>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <1, 2, 6>

Total number of triangles: [5]
