Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 23) (9, 0) (26, 9) (26, 15) (26, 3) (8, 4) (13, 15) (13, 27) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 6) (22, 24) (23, 9) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 1) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 27) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 27) (4, 8) (4, 20) (4, 6) (4, 15) (16, 28) (16, 14) (28, 9) (28, 16) (28, 3) (28, 14) (29, 1) (29, 5) (21, 12) (21, 19) (2, 22) (2, 27) (12, 21) (12, 11) (12, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 20) (11, 25) (14, 16) (14, 28) (14, 11) (1, 23) (1, 29) (6, 22) (6, 4) (6, 25) (3, 26) (3, 10) (3, 28) (3, 12) (5, 29) (5, 0) (15, 26) (15, 13) (15, 23) (15, 4) (20, 4) (20, 11) (20, 18) (25, 11) (25, 6) (25, 24) (24, 22) (24, 25) (18, 10) (18, 20) (18, 27) (18, 0) (27, 13) (27, 10) (27, 17) (27, 2) (27, 18) (19, 17) (19, 21) (19, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 19) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and connections:

Nodes: 30
Edges: 90

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we need to first sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Vertices by degree:
9 - degree: 4
26 - degree: 4
8 - degree: 2
13 - degree: 2
22 - degree: 4
23 - degree: 4
10 - degree: 4
17 - degree: 3
4 - degree: 4
16 - degree: 3
28 - degree: 4
29 - degree: 2
21 - degree: 2
2 - degree: 3
12 - degree: 3
11 - degree: 4
14 - degree: 4
1 - degree: 2
6 - degree: 3
3 - degree: 4
5 - degree: 2
15 - degree: 4
20 - degree: 3
25 - degree: 3
24 - degree: 2
18 - degree: 4
27 - degree: 5
19 - degree: 3
0 - degree: 5

Using the sorted vertices and the given edges, we can find the triangles:

Triangles: 
<0, 9, 23>
<0, 9, 28>
<0, 9, 18>
<0, 19, 18>
<3, 10, 28>
<3, 10, 12>
<3, 10, 27>
<3, 12, 21>
<3, 12, 11>
<3, 28, 16>
<4, 6, 22>
<4, 6, 25>
<4, 11, 20>
<4, 11, 25>
<4, 15, 26>
<5, 0, 18>
<9, 23, 22>
<10, 17, 27>
<11, 14, 28>
<12, 21, 19>
<13, 15, 23>
<17, 19, 21>

Total number of triangles: [21]
