Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 25) (15, 16) (27, 7) (27, 1) (6, 7) (6, 29) (6, 0) (9, 0) (22, 2) (23, 8) (23, 0) (8, 23) (8, 5) (8, 17) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 21) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 23) (0, 14) (0, 29) (14, 4) (14, 0) (13, 16) (13, 29) (13, 10) (26, 28) (26, 10) (26, 21) (26, 7) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 28) (17, 8) (17, 20) (17, 12) (17, 5) (20, 17) (20, 24) (20, 28) (20, 10) (21, 4) (21, 26) (21, 16) (28, 26) (28, 11) (28, 20) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 21) (16, 1) (10, 13) (10, 26) (10, 20) (10, 7) (10, 24) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 12) (24, 20) (24, 10) (24, 7) (24, 25) (7, 27) (7, 6) (7, 26) (7, 10) (7, 24) (29, 6) (29, 0) (29, 13) (19, 1) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 25) (1, 27) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 19) (25, 15) (25, 24) (25, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Count the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 5
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 0
- Node 19: degree 1
- Node 20: degree 4
- Node 21: degree 3
- Node 22: degree 2
- Node 23: degree 3
- Node 24: degree 3
- Node 25: degree 3
- Node 26: degree 4
- Node 27: degree 2
- Node 28: degree 4
- Node 29: degree 3

2. Sort the nodes in increasing order of degrees:
Nodes in order: 18, 19, 9, 22, 15, 14, 18, 27, 25, 13, 3, 2, 6, 4, 21, 23, 24, 29, 0, 1, 7, 12, 5, 8, 26, 16, 20, 11, 10, 17

3. Count the triangles:
Total number of triangles: [14]

Unique triangles:
<0, 6, 29>
<0, 9, 10>
<0, 14, 4>
<0, 14, 6>
<0, 14, 29>
<0, 23, 8>
<0, 23, 5>
<4, 1, 16>
<4, 1, 19>
<12, 5, 17>
<12, 5, 8>
<12, 17, 8>
<16, 15, 21>
<20, 10, 24>
