Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 1) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 1) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 16) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 19) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 15) (10, 17) (10, 0) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 19) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 15) (18, 9) (18, 4) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 16) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 4) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 15) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 16) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:  
Vertices - Degrees  
5 - 2  
9 - 4  
14 - 3  
17 - 4  
1 - 4  
8 - 4  
13 - 3  
10 - 2  
7 - 4  
12 - 4  
4 - 4  
18 - 2  
19 - 4  
2 - 3  
0 - 4  
16 - 4  
15 - 4  
3 - 2  
6 - 0  
11 - 0  

Based on the sorting, the edges to consider are:  
(5, 0)  
(9, 8)  
(14, 17)  
(17, 10)  
(1, 9)  
(8, 9)  
(13, 17)  
(7, 5)  
(12, 7)  
(4, 18)  
(19, 1)  
(2, 7)  
(0, 5)  
(16, 2)  
(15, 13)  

The total number of triangles is [10].  
The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 4, 12>  
<0, 4, 15>  
<0, 5, 7>  
<0, 5, 12>  
<1, 14, 17>  
<1, 9, 8>  
<4, 12, 19>  
<7, 12, 19>  
<8, 9, 14>  
<9, 13, 17>
