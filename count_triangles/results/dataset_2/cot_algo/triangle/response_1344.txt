Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 

Node 0: degree 5  
Node 2: degree 5  
Node 7: degree 3  
Node 5: degree 4  
Node 8: degree 4  
Node 6: degree 4  
Node 4: degree 5  
Node 1: degree 6  
Node 9: degree 4  
Node 3: degree 5  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:  
(2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 0), (2, 1), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 8), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 0), (8, 3), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3), (4, 9), (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 2), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 1), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 2), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 8)

While counting the triangles in the graph, we find the following unique triangles:  
<0, 2, 4>  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 4, 6>  
<0, 2, 7>  
<1, 2, 4>  
<1, 2, 6>  
<1, 2, 7>  
<1, 5, 6>  
<1, 6, 9>  
<2, 4, 7>  
<3, 5, 9>  
<3, 7, 9>  
<3, 8, 9>  

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
