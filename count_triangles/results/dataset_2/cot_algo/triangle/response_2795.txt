Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 4) (27, 15) (27, 20) (1, 21) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 29) (21, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 28) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 7) (23, 25) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 25) (4, 15) (4, 1) (4, 21) (4, 22) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 20) (13, 1) (13, 26) (13, 29) (26, 13) (26, 29) (3, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 20) (7, 23) (25, 23) (25, 14) (9, 15) (9, 3) (9, 29) (9, 2) (29, 21) (29, 13) (29, 26) (29, 9) (17, 15) (17, 28) (17, 19) (17, 5) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 5) (16, 10) (12, 1) (12, 22) (12, 16) (12, 10) (8, 11) (8, 28) (28, 0) (28, 17) (28, 8) (28, 24) (28, 2) (19, 1) (19, 17) (24, 28) (2, 9) (2, 28) (2, 6) (2, 10) (10, 18) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 2) (20, 27) (20, 18) (20, 11) (6, 11) (6, 2) (5, 17) (5, 16) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: [(15, 27), (15, 9), (15, 17), (15, 4), (27, 20), (1, 21), (1, 13), (1, 19), (1, 12), (21, 29), (0, 14), (0, 16), (0, 28), (22, 23), (22, 12), (23, 7), (23, 25), (14, 18), (4, 22), (18, 10), (13, 26), (26, 29), (3, 9), (11, 6), (11, 8), (7, 25), (9, 2), (17, 5), (16, 5), (8, 24), (19, 5), (6, 2), (28, 24), (2, 6), (20, 27)]

Next, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes in degree-based order: [3, 7, 10, 24, 26, 27, 29, 0, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20, 21, 23, 25, 28, 2, 5, 8, 15, 17, 19, 1, 22, 4, 9]

Now, we will count the number of triangles and list the unique triangles found:

Total number of triangles: [14]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 14>
<2, 6, 10>
<2, 10, 12>
<2, 6, 11>
<2, 10, 16>
<2, 6, 11>
<2, 10, 18>
<2, 6, 11>
<2, 10, 20>
<5, 16, 17>
<9, 15, 27>
<9, 15, 17>
<9, 15, 4>
<9, 15, 27>
