Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows with the nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 7), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 1), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 1), (7, 8), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 0), (3, 9), (3, 6), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 0), (8, 6), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 0), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 1), (0, 8), (0, 2)}

Now, we will label the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order. The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
Node 3: degree 2
Node 2: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5
Node 4: degree 6
Node 5: degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and the edges given, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

Triangles: [10]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <6, 7, 8>
