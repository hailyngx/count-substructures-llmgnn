Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 0) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 14) (5, 18) (5, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 15) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 17) (17, 18) (17, 12) (10, 3) (10, 15) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 0) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 15) (0, 12) (7, 8) (7, 5) (11, 9) (11, 19) (2, 19) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 0) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 18) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges can be represented as follows:

```
0: [9, 8, 15, 12]
1: [8]
2: [19, 14]
3: [10, 12]
4: [9, 13, 18, 16, 15]
5: [18, 7]
6: [9, 12, 13]
7: [8, 5]
8: [1, 14, 0, 7]
9: [6, 4, 11, 16, 0]
10: [3, 15]
11: [9, 19]
12: [6, 3, 17, 0]
13: [6, 4, 14]
14: [8, 13, 2]
15: [4, 10, 0]
16: [9, 4, 18]
17: [18, 12]
18: [5, 4, 19, 16, 17]
19: [18, 11, 2]
```

Now, based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections:

```
1. Node 1 has degree 1
2. Node 2 has degree 2
3. Node 5 has degree 2
4. Node 7 has degree 2
5. Node 10 has degree 2
6. Node 11 has degree 2
7. Node 17 has degree 2
8. Node 19 has degree 3
9. Node 8 has degree 4
10. Node 3 has degree 4
11. Node 14 has degree 4
12. Node 15 has degree 4
13. Node 6 has degree 3
14. Node 9 has degree 5
15. Node 18 has degree 5
16. Node 0 has degree 4
17. Node 12 has degree 4
18. Node 13 has degree 3
16. Node 4 has degree 5
```

Now, we will count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [30]

Unique triangles:
1. <4, 9, 16>
2. <4, 9, 18>
3. <4, 9, 15>
4. <4, 9, 0>
5. <9, 16, 18>
6. <9, 16, 0>
7. <9, 18, 0>
8. <8, 14, 13>
9. <8, 14, 2>
10. <8, 14, 19>
11. <8, 13, 2>
12. <8, 13, 19>
13. <8, 2, 19>
14. <3, 12, 17>
15. <3, 12, 0>
16. <10, 15, 0>
17. <18, 5, 7>
18. <18, 7, 8>
19. <18, 5, 17>
20. <18, 17, 12>
21. <18, 17, 0>
22. <5, 18, 17>
23. <5, 18, 4>
24. <17, 12, 0>
25. <12, 6, 13>
26. <12, 6, 9>
27. <12, 13, 4>
28. <6, 9, 13>
29. <6, 9, 16>
30. <9, 4, 13>
