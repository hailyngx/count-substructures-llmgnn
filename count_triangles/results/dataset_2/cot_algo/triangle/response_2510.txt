Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 12) (16, 13) (5, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 19) (6, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 16) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 17) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 8) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 15) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 1) (15, 14) (15, 4) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 13) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 4) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 18) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 13) (4, 15) (4, 19) (13, 16) (13, 6) (13, 18) (13, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Count the degree of each node:
   - Node 0: degree 3
   - Node 1: degree 4
   - Node 2: degree 4
   - Node 3: degree 3
   - Node 4: degree 2
   - Node 5: degree 1
   - Node 6: degree 1
   - Node 7: degree 4
   - Node 8: degree 4
   - Node 9: degree 3
   - Node 10: degree 3
   - Node 11: degree 3
   - Node 12: degree 4
   - Node 13: degree 4
   - Node 14: degree 3
   - Node 15: degree 2
   - Node 16: degree 2
   - Node 17: degree 3
   - Node 18: degree 5
   - Node 19: degree 4

2. Sort nodes based on degree (ascending):
   - Nodes with degree 1: 5, 6
   - Nodes with degree 2: 4, 15, 16
   - Nodes with degree 3: 0, 3, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17
   - Nodes with degree 4: 1, 2, 7, 8, 12, 13, 19
   - Node with degree 5: 18

3. Relabel the nodes based on their sorted order:
   - 5, 6, 4, 15, 16, 0, 3, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 1, 2, 7, 8, 12, 13, 19, 18

4. Count the triangles:
   - Triangles: [24]
   
5. List of unique triangles found:
   - <0, 2, 7>
   - <0, 2, 8>
   - <0, 2, 19>
   - <0, 3, 9>
   - <0, 3, 13>
   - <0, 10, 18>
   - <1, 7, 12>
   - <1, 7, 14>
   - <1, 7, 17>
   - <1, 9, 14>
   - <2, 7, 12>
   - <2, 7, 17>
   - <2, 8, 11>
   - <2, 8, 12>
   - <2, 8, 19>
   - <2, 19, 18>
   - <3, 9, 13>
   - <4, 15, 14>
   - <7, 12, 17>
   - <8, 11, 18>
   - <9, 13, 18>
   - <10, 18, 19>
   - <13, 18, 19>
   - <14, 18, 19>
