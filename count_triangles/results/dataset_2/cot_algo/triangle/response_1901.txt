Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is: 

0 (degree 8) <br>
1 (degree 2) <br>
8 (degree 4) <br>
6 (degree 3) <br>
5 (degree 4) <br>
7 (degree 6) <br>
9 (degree 4) <br>
2 (degree 4) <br>
3 (degree 5) <br>
4 (degree 5) <br>

Based on the degree-based ordering, let's check for triangles:

Triangles: 
<0, 7, 8> <br>
<0, 5, 2> <br>
<0, 5, 4> <br>
<0, 5, 7> <br>
<2, 3, 8> <br>
<2, 5, 7> <br>
<4, 5, 7> <br>
<4, 0, 7> <br>

Total number of triangles: [8]
