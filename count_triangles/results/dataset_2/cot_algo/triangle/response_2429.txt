Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 14) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) 

Response:
The graph constructed based on the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 3), (9, 3), (9, 13), (9, 0), (4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 14), (4, 1), (4, 2), (7, 8), (10, 11), (10, 0), (10, 14), (11, 13), (11, 12), (13, 5), (2, 8), (5, 12), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 14), (0, 10)

Next, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Degrees:
0: 4
1: 5
2: 2
3: 3
4: 5
5: 4
6: 3
7: 2
8: 2
9: 4
10: 3
11: 4
12: 3
13: 4
14: 4

Based on degree-based ordering, the sorted nodes are:
2, 7, 8, 3, 6, 10, 12, 0, 5, 13, 1, 9, 11, 4, 14

Now, let's count the triangles:
[12]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 5, 14>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 5, 14>, <3, 5, 14>, <4, 5, 14>, <4, 11, 12>, <4, 11, 13>, <4, 12, 5>, <5, 13, 4>, <5, 14, 4>, <9, 1, 6>
