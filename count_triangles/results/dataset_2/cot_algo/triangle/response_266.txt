Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 11) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 12) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 14) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method as described earlier. 

Here is the list of nodes sorted by their degree (number of connections):
Nodes: 4, 7, 9, 3, 1, 6, 5, 14, 12, 0, 11, 8, 2, 13, 10 

Now, we will go through the list of edges and count the number of triangles formed:

1. (4, 7): No triangle formed.
2. (4, 9): No triangle formed.
3. (4, 0): No triangle formed.
4. (4, 3): Triangle formed: <0, 3, 4>.
5. (7, 4): No triangle formed.
6. (7, 6): No triangle formed.
7. (7, 14): No triangle formed.
8. (1, 3): Triangle formed: <1, 3, 5>.
9. (1, 11): No triangle formed.
10. (1, 14): No triangle formed.
11. (1, 10): No triangle formed.
12. (1, 13): No triangle formed.
13. (3, 4): Triangle formed: <0, 3, 4>.
14. (3, 1): Triangle formed: <1, 3, 5>.
15. (3, 11): Triangle formed: <1, 3, 6>.
16. (3, 0): Triangle formed: <0, 3, 4>.
17. (3, 9): No triangle formed.
18. (3, 5): No triangle formed.
19. (6, 7): No triangle formed.
20. (6, 5): Triangle formed: <1, 5, 6>.
21. (6, 2): No triangle formed.
22. (6, 11): Triangle formed: <1, 3, 6>.
23. (6, 13): No triangle formed.
24. (9, 4): No triangle formed.
25. (9, 3): No triangle formed.
26. (9, 14): No triangle formed.
27. (9, 12): No triangle formed.
28. (8, 2): No triangle formed.
29. (8, 5): Triangle formed: <1, 5, 8>.
30. (8, 10): No triangle formed.
31. (8, 12): No triangle formed.
32. (12, 9): No triangle formed.
33. (12, 8): No triangle formed.
34. (12, 13): No triangle formed.
35. (12, 5): No triangle formed.
36. (2, 6): No triangle formed.
37. (2, 8): No triangle formed.
38. (5, 3): No triangle formed.
39. (5, 6): Triangle formed: <1, 5, 6>.
40. (5, 8): Triangle formed: <1, 5, 8>.
41. (5, 12): No triangle formed.
42. (5, 10): No triangle formed.
43. (0, 4): No triangle formed.
44. (0, 3): Triangle formed: <0, 3, 4>.
45. (0, 14): No triangle formed.
46. (14, 7): No triangle formed.
47. (14, 1): No triangle formed.
48. (14, 9): No triangle formed.
49. (14, 0): No triangle formed.
50. (14, 11): No triangle formed.
51. (13, 1): No triangle formed.
52. (13, 6): No triangle formed.
53. (13, 12): No triangle formed.
54. (11, 1): No triangle formed.
55. (11, 3): Triangle formed: <1, 3, 6>.
56. (11, 6): Triangle formed: <1, 3, 6>.
