Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (13, 12) (13, 14) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 4) (3, 11) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 12) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 7) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4)
(9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12)
(8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10)
(13, 12) (13, 14)
(10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2)
(11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 4)
(0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1)
(14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 5)
(2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 4)
(3, 11) (3, 5)
(7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5)
(1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 12)
(12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1)
(5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 7)
(4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 1)

Now, let's list the nodes based on their degree:
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 10: Degree 2
Node 13: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 12: Degree 5
Node 11: Degree 5
Node 14: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges based on the degree of their corresponding nodes with the lower label having fewer connections.
