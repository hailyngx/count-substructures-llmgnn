Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 15) (14, 17) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (4, 12) (4, 5) (8, 11) (8, 10) (5, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 10) (6, 17) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 16) (15, 10) (15, 2) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 19) (18, 5) (2, 15) (2, 9) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows the steps below:

1. Sort the nodes based on their degree:
- Node 16 has 4 connections
- Node 17 has 3 connections
- Nodes 4, 6, 14, 19 have 3 connections
- Nodes 0, 1, 8, 15 have 2 connections
- Nodes 2, 5, 7, 10, 12 have 2 connections
- Nodes 3, 9, 11, 13 have 2 connections
- Node 18 has 1 connection

2. Relabel the nodes from 0 to 19 based on their degree as follows:
- Node 18 becomes node 0
- Nodes 0, 1, 8, 15 become nodes 1, 2, 3, 4
- Nodes 2, 5, 7, 10, 12 become nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Nodes 3, 9, 11, 13 become nodes 10, 11, 12, 13
- Nodes 4, 6, 14, 19 become nodes 14, 15, 16, 17
- Nodes 16, 17 become nodes 18, 19

Now, we consider the edges based on the relabeled nodes, only considering edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:

Edges to consider:
- (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 13) (1, 7) (2, 9) (2, 15)
- (3, 9) (3, 12) (4, 5) (5, 6) (5, 18) (6, 7) (6, 17) (7, 9)
- (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 11) (13, 12) (14, 17) (14, 5)
- (15, 16) (15, 10) (16, 19) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 16) (19, 10) (19, 9)

Finally, we count the number of triangles formed by these edges, which is 14 triangles. 

The triangles are as follows:
<0, 2, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 9, 12>, <4, 5, 6>, 
<5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 17>, <6, 7, 9>, <10, 12, 13>, <13, 11, 12>, 
<14, 5, 6>, <15, 10, 12>, <16, 15, 10>, <17, 14, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [14].
