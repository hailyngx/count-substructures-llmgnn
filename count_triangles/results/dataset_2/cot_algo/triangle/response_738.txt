Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 15) (5, 16) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (19, 1) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 9) (15, 18) (15, 9) (15, 12) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 14) (14, 18) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 1) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 17) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 0) (7, 1) (9, 10) (9, 15) (9, 13) (1, 19) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 13) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 17) 

Response:
The vertices with their corresponding connections are as follows:

0: 2, 8, 17  
1: 7, 13, 14, 19  
2: 0, 3, 8, 16, 18  
3: 2, 10, 11  
4: 8, 10, 12, 13  
5: 16  
6: 8  
7: 1  
8: 0, 2, 4, 6, 17  
9: 10, 13, 15  
10: 3, 4, 9  
11: 3, 12, 14  
12: 4, 11, 14, 15  
13: 1, 4, 9, 14  
14: 1, 11, 12, 13, 18  
15: 9, 12, 18  
16: 2, 5, 17  
17: 0, 8, 16  
18: 2, 14, 15  
19: 1  

By sorting the vertices by the number of connections:  
Vertices by degree: 6, 5, 7, 19, 0, 10, 15, 3, 7, 1, 9, 11, 16, 18, 4, 12, 13, 17, 2, 8  
Renaming vertices:  
0: 0  
1: 2  
2: 3  
3: 4  
4: 5  
5: 6  
6: 7  
7: 8  
8: 9  
9: 10  
10: 11  
11: 12  
12: 13  
13: 14  
14: 15  
15: 16  
16: 17  
17: 18  
18: 19  
19: 1  

Calculating the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we get:  
Total number of triangles: [18]
