Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 13) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 17) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (7, 5) (1, 0) (1, 19) (17, 15) (17, 13) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 10) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 10) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 8) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 8) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 12) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 16) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 6) (12, 3) (12, 19) (10, 13) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree of connections. The relabeled vertices are as follows:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 1
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 2
Node 13: degree 5
Node 15: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4
Node 17: degree 2
Node 18: degree 5
Node 19: degree 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (5, 9): Shared connections form triangle with node 7: <5, 7, 9>
- Edge (5, 16): Shared connections form triangle with node 2: <5, 2, 16>
- Edge (5, 7): No triangle formed
- Edge (9, 5): No triangle formed
- Edge (9, 18): Shared connections form triangle with node 11: <9, 11, 18>
- Edge (9, 13): Shared connections form triangle with node 10: <9, 10, 13>
  
Continuing this process for all edges, we find the total number of triangles inside brackets []: [5].

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 2, 16>
<9, 11, 18>
<9, 10, 13>
