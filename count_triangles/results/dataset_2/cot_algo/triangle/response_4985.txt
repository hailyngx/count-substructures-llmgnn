Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 17) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 8) (10, 17) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 3) (11, 19) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 12) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 5) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 18) (18, 16) (18, 9) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 12) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 2) (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 14) (2, 14) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 9) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

(10) - 1 connection
(2, 7, 18) - 2 connections
(0, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19) - 3 connections
(1, 4, 8, 15, 17) - 4 connections
(3, 14) - 5 connections

Now, let's relabel the vertices:

(10) - 1
(2, 7, 18) - 2, 3, 4
(0, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19) - 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
(1, 4, 8, 15, 17) - 14, 15, 16, 17, 18
(3, 14) - 19, 20

Now, we'll go through the edges and count the triangles:

Triangles: [21]

Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 15>, <0, 5, 19>, <0, 6, 17>, <0, 9, 12>, <1, 13, 17>, <1, 14, 8>, <1, 17, 15>, <2, 14, 8>, <4, 3, 7>, <4, 5, 19>, <4, 16, 8>, <5, 0, 6>, <5, 0, 9>, <5, 4, 16>, <6, 13, 15>, <8, 14, 16>, <9, 0, 6>, <9, 12, 0>, <12, 9, 0>, <13, 1, 17>, <16, 4, 8>
