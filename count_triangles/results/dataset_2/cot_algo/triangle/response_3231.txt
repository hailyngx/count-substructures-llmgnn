Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 18) (10, 14) (2, 16) (2, 18) (2, 7) (2, 0) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 1) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 12) (19, 5) (19, 4) (8, 17) (8, 1) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 7) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 1) (17, 18) (17, 8) (17, 15) (4, 11) (4, 19) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 8) (1, 14) (15, 18) (15, 17) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 12) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (11, 16), (11, 13), (11, 4), (16, 11), (16, 3), (16, 2), (5, 9), (5, 19), (5, 0), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 1), (9, 3), (6, 9), (6, 14), (6, 18), (10, 14), (2, 16), (2, 18), (2, 7), (2, 0), (18, 6), (18, 2), (18, 15), (18, 17), (18, 1), (7, 2), (7, 12), (7, 3), (7, 13), (12, 7), (12, 13), (12, 0), (13, 11), (13, 7), (13, 12), (19, 5), (19, 4), (8, 17), (8, 1), (3, 16), (3, 9), (3, 7), (14, 6), (14, 10), (14, 1), (17, 18), (17, 8), (17, 15), (4, 11), (4, 19), (1, 9), (1, 18), (1, 8), (1, 14), (15, 18), (15, 17), (0, 5), (0, 2), (0, 12)

Now, we will sort the nodes by the number of connections:
Nodes by degree: 10, 16, 8, 12, 6, 14, 15, 17, 4, 0, 5, 19, 7, 1, 3, 9, 18, 11, 13, 2

Triangles formed by the edges are: [<2, 7, 12>, <2, 18, 15>, <4, 11, 16>, <6, 9, 1>, <6, 14, 10>, <7, 13, 12>, <18, 1, 8>, <18, 15, 17>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
