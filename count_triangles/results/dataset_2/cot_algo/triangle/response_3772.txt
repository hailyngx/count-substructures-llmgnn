Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following edges:
- (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 1), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 0), 
- (4, 8), (4, 0), 
- (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 8), 
- (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 8), 
- (3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 2), 
- (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 2), 
- (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 1), 
- (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 3), 
- (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6)

First, let's list the nodes in order of their degree:
Node 4: 2 connections
Nodes 6, 7, 0, 8: 3 connections
Nodes 5, 2: 4 connections
Node 9: 8 connections
Node 1, 3: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed by each:
- (5, 9): Forms triangles with (1, 9, 5), (2, 9, 5), and (8, 9, 5) --> <1, 9, 5>, <2, 9, 5>, <8, 9, 5>
- (5, 2): No triangles are formed because node 5 has more connections than node 2.
- (5, 1): Forms a triangle (1, 5, 7) --> <1, 5, 7>
- Continuing this scheme for each edge formed by nodes with lower degree, we find additional triangles as follows: 
(9, 3): <1, 9, 3>
(4, 8): <1, 4, 8>
(7, 3): <1, 7, 3>
(1, 6): <1, 6, 9>
(3, 7): <1, 3, 7>
(6, 9): <1, 6, 9>
(8, 1): <1, 8, 9>
(0, 9): <0, 1, 9>
(2, 5): <1, 2, 5>

Counting the triangles found, we get a total of 10 triangles for the given graph.

The total number of triangles is [10].
