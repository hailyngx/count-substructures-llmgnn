Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by the number of connections:
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 8: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges to count the number of triangles:
