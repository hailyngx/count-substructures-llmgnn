Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (8, 14) (8, 11) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 18) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (10, 2) (10, 4) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 17) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 14) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 13) (18, 11) (18, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 14) (16, 13) (16, 1) (16, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 12) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 16) (1, 7) (4, 10) (4, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted list of vertices is as follows: 

Vertices: 6, 16, 18, 0, 10, 2, 8, 4, 12, 19, 5, 13, 15, 17, 7, 3, 1, 11, 9, 14

Now, we will count the number of triangles by considering the given edges:

1. For the edge (6, 9): No triangle is formed.
2. For the edge (9, 6): No triangle is formed.
3. For the edge (9, 11): Triangle formed with node 6: <6, 9, 11>.
4. For the edge (9, 1): Triangle formed with node 11: <11, 9, 1>.
5. For the edge (9, 7): No triangle is formed.
6. For the edge (2, 5): No triangle is formed.
7. For the edge (2, 10): No triangle is formed.
8. For the edge (8, 14): No triangle is formed.
9. For the edge (8, 11): Triangle formed with node 9: <9, 11, 8>.
10. For the edge (3, 11): Triangle formed with node 9: <9, 11, 3>.
11. For the edge (3, 7): No triangle is formed.
12. For the edge (3, 17): No triangle is formed.
13. For the edge (3, 5): No triangle is formed.
14. For the edge (11, 9): No triangle is formed (already counted above).
15. For the edge (11, 8): No triangle is formed (already counted above).
16. For the edge (11, 3): No triangle is formed (already counted above).
17. For the edge (11, 0): No triangle is formed.
18. For the edge (11, 18): Triangle formed with node 8: <8, 11, 18>.
19. For the edge (5, 2): No triangle is formed.
20. For the edge (5, 3): No triangle is formed.
21. For the edge (5, 19): No triangle is formed.
22. For the edge (19, 5): No triangle is formed.
23. For the edge (19, 15): No triangle is formed.
24. For the edge (19, 7): No triangle is formed.
25. For the edge (10, 2): No triangle is formed.
26. For the edge (10, 4): No triangle is formed.

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [4].
The unique triangles found are: <6, 9, 11>, <11, 9, 1>, <9, 11, 8>, <8, 11, 18>.
