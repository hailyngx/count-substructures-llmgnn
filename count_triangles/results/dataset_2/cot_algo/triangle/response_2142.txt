Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 4) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 5) (8, 11) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 5) (4, 0) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows: 

Nodes (Vertices):
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(6, 9), (6, 11), (6, 12), (6, 13), (9, 8), (9, 0), (1, 3), (1, 14), (1, 7), (3, 10), (3, 0), (7, 5), (12, 8), (0, 2), (0, 4), (14, 2),

(9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 0), (1, 14), (1, 0), (1, 7), (3, 0), (3, 10), (7, 1), (7, 12), (7, 11), (7, 5), (12, 6), (12, 7), (12, 8), (12, 5), (0, 9), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 14), (0, 2), (0, 4), (14, 1), (14, 0), (14, 8), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 13), (2, 10), (8, 9), (8, 12), (8, 14), (8, 5), (8, 11), (11, 6), (11, 7), (11, 8), (11, 13), (11, 5), (5, 7), (5, 12), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 11), (5, 10), (10, 3), (10, 2), (10, 5), (4, 0), (4, 13), (13, 6), (13, 2), (13, 11), (13, 4)

Next, we sort the nodes by their degrees:
Nodes - Degree (Sorted):
4 - 2, 10 - 2, 14 - 3, 3 - 3, 6 - 4, 9 - 4, 1 - 4, 7 - 4, 13 - 4, 2 - 4, 8 - 5, 0 - 7, 12 - 5, 11 - 5, 5 - 6

Now, let's count the triangles in the graph:

Total number of triangles: [6] 

Unique triangles:
<1, 7, 12>, <1, 7, 5>, <1, 7, 14>, <0, 3, 1>, <0, 3, 10>, <0, 1, 14>
