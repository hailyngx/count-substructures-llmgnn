Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 15) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 13) (17, 3) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 4) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 10) (18, 5) (18, 15) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 19) (19, 14) (19, 8) (19, 3) (19, 10) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 0) (5, 18) (5, 2) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 18) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 2) (0, 4) (0, 12) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges:
(0, 4), (0, 12)
(1, 8)
(2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 10), (2, 12)
(3, 7), (3, 9), (3, 17), (3, 19)
(4, 0), (4, 13), (4, 16)
(5, 2), (5, 18)
(6, 2), (6, 13)
(7, 3), (7, 10), (7, 15)
(8, 1), (8, 11), (8, 13), (8, 15), (8, 19)
(9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 12)
(10, 2), (10, 7), (10, 19)
(11, 8), (11, 16)
(12, 0), (12, 2), (12, 9), (12, 14)
(13, 4), (13, 6), (13, 8), (13, 17)
(14, 12), (14, 19)
(15, 7), (15, 8), (15, 16), (15, 18)
(16, 4), (16, 11), (16, 15)
(17, 3), (17, 13)
(18, 5), (18, 15)
(19, 3), (19, 8), (19, 10), (19, 14)

Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by degrees in increasing order:
Degree 2: {1, 5} 
Degree 3: {0, 7, 10, 14, 18} 
Degree 4: {6, 16, 17} 
Degree 5: {11} 
Degree 6: {4, 19} 
Degree 7: {3, 8, 12, 13} 
Degree 9: {2} 
Degree 10: {15} 

Number of triangles: [21]

Unique triangles found in the graph: 
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 5, 10>
<2, 6, 13>
<2, 9, 12>
<3, 7, 15>
<3, 9, 19>
<4, 13, 16>
<5, 2, 10>
<8, 13, 19>
<8, 15, 19>
<8, 15, 7>
<13, 4, 16>
<14, 12, 19>
<15, 7, 10>
<15, 8, 19>
<15, 18, 5>
<16, 4, 13>
<17, 3, 13>
<17, 3, 7>
<18, 15, 5>
<19, 3, 9>
