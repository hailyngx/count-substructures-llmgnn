Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 19) (17, 16) (17, 8) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 15) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 15) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 15) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 11) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 13) (3, 9) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 18) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 2) (16, 17) (16, 5) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 15) (2, 19) (2, 9) (15, 4) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 9) (5, 12) (5, 16) (5, 18) (18, 11) (18, 5) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 6) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: 8, 14, 15
- 1: 8, 7, 12, 6, 11
- 2: 19, 9
- 3: 9
- 4: 8, 13, 15
- 5: 12, 16, 18
- 6: 10, 1, 13
- 7: 12, 1
- 8: 0, 1, 17, 4
- 9: 3, 2, 15
- 10: 6, 13, 19
- 11: 1, 19, 18
- 12: 7, 5, 14, 1
- 13: 10, 4, 6
- 14: 12, 0, 19, 15
- 15: 0, 14, 4, 9
- 16: 17, 5
- 17: 16, 8
- 18: 11, 5
- 19: 2, 14, 11, 10

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Sorted vertices by degree: [3, 2, 9, 16, 18, 17, 7, 5, 0, 4, 6, 11, 12, 1, 13, 15, 8, 14, 19, 10]

Triangles found:
- <0, 8, 14>
- <0, 8, 15>
- <0, 14, 15>
- <12, 1, 7>
- <12, 1, 14>
- <12, 1, 15>
- <12, 5, 14>
- <12, 5, 15>
- <1, 8, 12>
- <1, 8, 4>
- <1, 8, 7>
- <1, 11, 19>
- <1, 13, 6>
- <1, 13, 10>
- <1, 6, 10>
- <4, 8, 13>
- <4, 13, 6>
- <4, 13, 10>
- <5, 12, 14>
- <5, 12, 15>
- <11, 18, 5>
- <14, 0, 15>
- <14, 0, 19>
- <14, 12, 15>
- <14, 19, 10>
- <15, 0, 14>
- <15, 4, 9>
- <15, 9, 3>
- <18, 5, 16>
- <19, 10, 6>

Total number of triangles: [29]
