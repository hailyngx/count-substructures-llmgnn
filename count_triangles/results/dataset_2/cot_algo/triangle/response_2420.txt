Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 10) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 5) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 18) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 10) (2, 11) (2, 19) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 15) (0, 9) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 5) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 15) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 6) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 4) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Then, we label the vertices accordingly from least connected to most connected.

In this graph, the number of connections for each node are as follows:
Node 0: 1
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 2
Node 3: 3
Node 4: 4
Node 5: 3
Node 6: 3
Node 7: 3
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 5
Node 10: 3
Node 11: 5
Node 12: 3
Node 13: 4
Node 15: 3
Node 16: 3
Node 17: 3
Node 18: 3
Node 19: 4

Now, let's relabel the vertices:
Node 0 -> Node A
Node 1 -> Node B
Node 2 -> Node C
Node 3 -> Node D
Node 4 -> Node E
Node 5 -> Node F
Node 6 -> Node G
Node 7 -> Node H
Node 8 -> Node I
Node 9 -> Node J
Node 10 -> Node K
Node 11 -> Node L
Node 12 -> Node M
Node 13 -> Node N
Node 15 -> Node O
Node 16 -> Node P
Node 17 -> Node Q
Node 18 -> Node R
Node 19 -> Node S

Now, let's identify the triangles according to the method described.

[Total number of triangles: 16]
<B, M, G>
<A, J, I>
<A, J, O>
<B, H, O>
<C, I, N>
<D, H, F>
<F, Q, S>
<D, E, C>
<I, N, R>
<I, N, S>
<I, N, B>
<J, O, G>
<J, D, E>
<L, K, P>
<O, G, M>
