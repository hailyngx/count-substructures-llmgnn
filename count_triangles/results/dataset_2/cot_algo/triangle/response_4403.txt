Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 11) (4, 29) (4, 6) (7, 11) (7, 24) (7, 2) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 10) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 8) (20, 28) (18, 11) (18, 21) (22, 0) (22, 29) (22, 21) (22, 8) (8, 20) (8, 22) (8, 29) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 1) (14, 23) (14, 17) (14, 28) (17, 14) (17, 28) (17, 9) (5, 25) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 10) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 23) (11, 24) (16, 13) (16, 6) (16, 27) (26, 20) (26, 21) (26, 27) (26, 12) (24, 7) (24, 11) (24, 1) (21, 18) (21, 22) (21, 26) (28, 20) (28, 14) (28, 17) (28, 27) (28, 10) (6, 4) (6, 16) (6, 29) (29, 4) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 6) (12, 26) (12, 0) (9, 17) (1, 23) (1, 24) (27, 16) (27, 26) (27, 28) (27, 10) (10, 25) (10, 13) (10, 28) (10, 27) (10, 2) (0, 22) (0, 12) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) 

Response:
The vertices with their respective degrees are:
Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 2
Vertex 2: degree 4
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 5: degree 2
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 7: degree 3
Vertex 8: degree 4
Vertex 9: degree 1
Vertex 10: degree 5
Vertex 11: degree 5
Vertex 12: degree 2
Vertex 13: degree 3
Vertex 14: degree 3
Vertex 15: degree 2
Vertex 16: degree 3
Vertex 17: degree 3
Vertex 18: degree 2
Vertex 20: degree 5
Vertex 21: degree 4
Vertex 22: degree 4
Vertex 23: degree 3
Vertex 24: degree 3
Vertex 25: degree 3
Vertex 26: degree 4
Vertex 27: degree 4
Vertex 28: degree 5
Vertex 29: degree 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will process the edges while considering vertices with lower degrees first.
