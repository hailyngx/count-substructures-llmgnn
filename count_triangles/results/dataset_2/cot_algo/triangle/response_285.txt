Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be used to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Sorting the nodes based on their connectivity:
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 5: 5 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting triangles with edges involving nodes with lower labels and fewer connections.

Number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
