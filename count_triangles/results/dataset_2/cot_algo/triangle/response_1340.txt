Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 3) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 5) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 1) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 10) (16, 17) (16, 0) (16, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 12) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 8) (11, 18) (19, 7) (19, 12) (2, 17) (2, 4) (2, 10) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 6) (3, 14) (3, 18) (9, 14) (9, 12) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 12) (10, 18) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 9) (12, 15) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their connections based on the given edges:

Node 0 : [1, 7, 16]
Node 1 : [0, 6, 10, 12]
Node 2 : [4, 10, 17]
Node 3 : [14, 18]
Node 4 : [2, 5]
Node 5 : [4, 10, 13]
Node 6 : [1, 8, 15, 16]
Node 7 : [0, 10, 15, 19]
Node 8 : [6, 14, 17]
Node 9 : [12, 14]
Node 10 : [1, 2, 5, 7, 18]
Node 11 : [18]
Node 12 : [1, 9, 15, 19]
Node 13 : [5]
Node 14 : [3, 8, 9, 17]
Node 15 : [6, 7, 12]
Node 16 : [0, 6, 17]
Node 17 : [2, 8, 14]
Node 18 : [3, 10, 11]
Node 19 : [7, 12]

Based on the degree-based ordering, the nodes are labeled as follows:
