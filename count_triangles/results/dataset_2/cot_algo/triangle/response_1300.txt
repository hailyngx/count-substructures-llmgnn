Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 21) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 0) (1, 29) (1, 19) (21, 13) (21, 6) (21, 16) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 15) (7, 19) (7, 27) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 26) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 26) (25, 15) (6, 21) (6, 2) (9, 25) (9, 8) (9, 20) (12, 27) (27, 7) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 28) (27, 16) (2, 6) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 10) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 15) (15, 4) (15, 25) (15, 18) (15, 20) (15, 26) (20, 9) (20, 15) (20, 0) (20, 19) (5, 8) (0, 22) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 24) (0, 8) (26, 13) (26, 3) (26, 25) (26, 15) (26, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 23) (23, 8) (23, 14) (11, 3) (11, 24) (11, 29) (17, 13) (17, 3) (10, 2) (10, 26) (16, 21) (16, 27) (16, 2) (24, 27) (24, 0) (24, 11) (29, 1) (29, 11) (28, 27) (28, 0) (14, 23) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 20) 

Response:
Based on the provided graph, we will perform the following steps to count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
   - Vertex 5 has degree 1
   - Vertices 10, 14, 28 have degree 2
   - Vertices 12, 5, 9, 14, 18, 22, 29 have degree 3
   - Vertices 1, 7 have degree 4
   - Vertices 11, 13, 16, 17, 21, 23 have degree 5
   - Vertices 0, 8, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27 have degree 6
   - Vertices 2, 3, 4, 6, 15 have degree 7

2. Relabel the vertices according to their new order:
   - Vertex 5 is now vertex 1
   - Vertices 10, 14, 28 are now vertices 2, 3, 4
   - Vertices 12, 5, 9, 14, 18, 22, 29 are now vertices 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
   - Vertices 1, 7 are now vertices 12, 13
   - Vertices 11, 13, 16, 17, 21, 23 are now vertices 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
   - Vertices 0, 8, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27 are now vertices 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27
   - Vertices 2, 3, 4, 6, 15 are now vertices 28, 29, 30, 31, 32

3. Identify the triangles in the graph:
   - Triangles are formed by shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [64].

Unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 22>, <0, 4, 15>, <0, 4, 18>, <0, 4, 20>, <0, 8, 20>, <0, 8, 24>, <0, 8, 27>, <0, 20, 24>, <0, 20, 27>, <0, 24, 27>, <1, 7, 19>, <2, 4, 18>, <2, 6, 16>, <2, 6, 21>, <2, 10, 26>, <2, 15, 18>, <2, 15, 26>, <2, 16, 21>, <3, 11, 24>, <3, 11, 29>, <3, 13, 26>, <3, 17, 13>, <3, 17, 26>, <3, 25, 15>, <3, 25, 26>, <7, 19, 20>, <14, 16, 21>, <15, 20, 26>, <18, 15, 20>, <27, 24, 28>
