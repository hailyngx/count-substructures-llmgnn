Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 12) (4, 6) (4, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 2) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections (degree). Here are the vertices sorted by their degrees:

Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 12: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 11: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 5 connections
Vertex 14: 5 connections
Vertex 13: 6 connections

Now, we will iterate through the edges in order and count the triangles:

Triangles: 
[15]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 13>
<0, 1, 14>
<0, 3, 2>
<0, 5, 14>
<0, 7, 12>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 7, 12>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 13, 4>
<1, 13, 11>
<1, 14, 2>
<2, 3, 11>
