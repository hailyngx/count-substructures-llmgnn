Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 2) (4, 8) (4, 18) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 2) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 12) (13, 10) (5, 3) (5, 12) (6, 7) (6, 17) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 9) (18, 0) (0, 18) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 1) (11, 14) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 12) (19, 9) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 12) (16, 19) (16, 10) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 19) (12, 9) (12, 17) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 16) 

Response:
The graph with nodes and edges is constructed as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (3, 15), (3, 10), (3, 5), (15, 8), (15, 2), (4, 8), (4, 18), (7, 6), (7, 18), (7, 2), (13, 12), (13, 10), (5, 12), (6, 17), (2, 1), (18, 0), (0, 14), (14, 11), (19, 16), (9, 19)

Now, we will determine the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Degree of each node:
0: 2
1: 2
2: 4
3: 3
4: 2
5: 2
6: 2
7: 3
8: 4
9: 4
10: 3
11: 1
12: 4
13: 2
14: 2
15: 3
16: 2
17: 2
18: 4
19: 3

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will sort the nodes in ascending order:
Nodes: 11, 1, 16, 5, 17, 6, 0, 14, 4, 13, 7, 3, 15, 19, 10, 12, 2, 8, 18, 9

Examining each edge in the sorted order:
(0, 14) - Does not form a triangle.
(1, 2) - Does not form a triangle.
(2, 8) - Forms a triangle <2, 8, 15>.
(2, 1) - Does not form a triangle.
(3, 15) - Does not form a triangle.
(4, 8) - Does not form a triangle.
(5, 12) - Does not form a triangle.
(6, 7) - Does not form a triangle.
(7, 2) - Does not form a triangle.
(7, 18) - Does not form a triangle.
(8, 15) - Does not form a triangle.
(9, 18) - Does not form a triangle.
(9, 12) - Does not form a triangle.
(10, 3) - Does not form a triangle.
(11, 14) - Does not form a triangle.
(12, 13) - Does not form a triangle.
(13, 10) - Does not form a triangle.
(14, 0) - Does not form a triangle.
(15, 3) - Does not form a triangle.
(16, 10) - Does not form a triangle.
(17, 6) - Does not form a triangle.
(18, 4) - Does not form a triangle.
(19, 16) - Does not form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <2, 8, 15>
