Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 3) (22, 1) (1, 22) (1, 21) (1, 19) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 26) (21, 5) (4, 27) (4, 24) (4, 17) (7, 25) (7, 29) (7, 23) (10, 13) (10, 25) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 29) (15, 20) (15, 23) (15, 12) (15, 16) (20, 15) (20, 23) (24, 4) (24, 5) (24, 19) (26, 21) (26, 0) (27, 21) (27, 4) (27, 28) (27, 2) (25, 7) (25, 10) (25, 6) (25, 28) (25, 14) (16, 15) (16, 28) (16, 3) (16, 18) (28, 27) (28, 25) (28, 16) (28, 5) (3, 22) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 8) (9, 12) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 14) (18, 29) (29, 7) (29, 11) (29, 18) (14, 25) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 2) (0, 26) (0, 8) (2, 27) (2, 14) (6, 25) (23, 13) (23, 7) (23, 15) (23, 20) (19, 1) (19, 24) (12, 1) (12, 15) (12, 9) (17, 4) (5, 21) (5, 24) (5, 28) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 0) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed based on the provided information and the degree-based ordering method has been applied to count the number of triangles.

The sorted vertices with their connections are as follows:
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 18: 4 connections
Vertex 26: 2 connections
Vertex 19: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 24: 3 connections
Vertex 25: 5 connections
Vertex 16: 4 connections
Vertex 12: 3 connections
Vertex 14: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 21: 4 connections
Vertex 20: 3 connections
Vertex 17: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 28: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 22: 3 connections
Vertex 15: 4 connections
Vertex 10: 2 connections
Vertex 27: 4 connections
Vertex 11: 3 connections
Vertex 29: 4 connections
Vertex 13: 3 connections

The number of triangles inside brackets [] is [46].

Unique triangles found are:
