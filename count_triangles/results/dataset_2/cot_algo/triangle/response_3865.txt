Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 19) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (1, 15) (1, 0) (17, 12) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 4) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 1) (15, 17) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 6) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 5) (19, 4) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 4) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 18) (16, 12) (16, 4) (14, 8) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 16) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 7) (2, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 18) 

Response:
The given graph with degree-based ordering is as follows:

Nodes:  
0 - degree 3  
1 - degree 2  
2 - degree 1  
3 - degree 2  
4 - degree 5  
5 - degree 3  
6 - degree 2  
7 - degree 5  
8 - degree 3  
9 - degree 4  
10 - degree 5  
11 - degree 3  
12 - degree 4  
13 - degree 3  
14 - degree 1  
15 - degree 4  
16 - degree 2  
17 - degree 4  
18 - degree 3  
19 - degree 5
