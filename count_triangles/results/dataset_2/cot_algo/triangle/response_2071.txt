Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 2) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 0) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 8) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 14) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 2) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the graph efficiently.

First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes sorted in ascending order of degree:
Node 10: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 12: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 6
Node 1: Degree 6
Node 14: Degree 6
Node 2: Degree 6

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- For each edge, we consider the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections.
- Check for shared connections between the two vertices, which will form triangles.

Total number of triangles: [17]
