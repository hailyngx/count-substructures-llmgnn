Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 11) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 10) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 9) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 9) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 9) 

Response:
The given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 2), (7, 11), (7, 6), (7, 10), (7, 2), (1, 5), (1, 13), (3, 0), (3, 14), (3, 6), (3, 13), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 14), (8, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 2), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 11), (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 14), (0, 10), (0, 11), (14, 3), (14, 8), (14, 0), (14, 12), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 5), (2, 10), (12, 14), (12, 10), (12, 11), (12, 9), (10, 7), (10, 0), (10, 2), (10, 12), (10, 9), (11, 7), (11, 6), (11, 0), (11, 12), (11, 9), (9, 4), (9, 12), (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 13), (13, 1), (13, 3), (13, 9)

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph. Let's sort the vertices by the number of connections:

Vertices with their connections (in parenthesis): 
0 (5), 1 (2), 12 (4), 13 (3), 5 (3), 3 (4), 9 (5), 6 (4), 14 (4), 4 (3), 2 (5), 10 (5), 11 (5), 7 (4), 8(4)

Now, we will proceed with the counting of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. After the calculations, we find that there are [25] triangles in the given graph.

Unique triangles found are: 
<0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 14>, <0, 6, 11>, <0, 6, 14>, <0, 11, 12>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 10>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 13>, <3, 6, 14>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 7, 2>, <4, 8, 2>, <6, 7, 11>, <6, 7, 2>, <6, 7, 10>, <7, 10, 2>, <9, 11, 12>, <10, 11, 12>, <10, 11, 9>
