Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 27) (13, 18) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 21) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 28) (2, 15) (29, 2) (29, 16) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 25) (7, 11) (7, 9) (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 20) (23, 0) (8, 1) (18, 13) (18, 22) (18, 3) (15, 2) (15, 26) (15, 14) (20, 11) (20, 19) (20, 16) (0, 23) (0, 14) (0, 26) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 5) (19, 20) (19, 26) (19, 27) (26, 15) (26, 0) (26, 19) (26, 5) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 26) (5, 24) (6, 13) (28, 2) (28, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 25) (1, 12) (3, 18) (3, 21) (21, 22) (21, 10) (21, 3) (21, 27) (17, 16) (17, 27) (25, 4) (25, 1) (25, 12) (16, 29) (16, 10) (16, 20) (16, 17) (24, 5) (24, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 24) (27, 13) (27, 19) (27, 21) (27, 17) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 25) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method states that we should sort the vertices based on their degree of connections from least to most. Then, we will relabel the vertices accordingly.

Here is the list of vertices based on their degree:
Vertex 28: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 2
Vertex 23: degree 2
Vertex 19: degree 3
Vertex 17: degree 3
Vertex 24: degree 3
Vertex 3: degree 3
Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 8: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 5: degree 4
Vertex 15: degree 4
Vertex 14: degree 4
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 20: degree 4
Vertex 29: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 4
Vertex 10: degree 4
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 25: degree 4
Vertex 9: degree 4
Vertex 18: degree 5
Vertex 21: degree 5
Vertex 27: degree 5
Vertex 11: degree 5
Vertex 12: degree 5
Vertex 22: degree 5
Vertex 16: degree 5
Vertex 13: degree 6

Now, counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [22] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 1, and the unique triangle found is <11, 12, 13>.
