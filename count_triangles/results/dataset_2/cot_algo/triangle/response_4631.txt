Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 6) (17, 4) (17, 14) (17, 9) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 18) (12, 7) (12, 10) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 15) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 0) (5, 8) (5, 1) (13, 3) (13, 15) (0, 18) (0, 16) (0, 6) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 6) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 9) (16, 19) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 1) (19, 16) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (9, 17) (9, 2) (9, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree. 

Here is the list of nodes sorted by their degree in increasing order:
\[ (19, 1),\, (1, 2),\, (0, 3),\, (13, 3),\, (5, 3),\, (18, 3),\, (7, 3),\, (11, 3),\, (14, 3),\, (12, 3),\, (17, 3),\, (6, 5),\, (15, 3),\, (3, 3),\, (10, 3),\, (8, 4),\, (2, 4),\, (16, 5),\, (4, 5),\, (9, 3) \]

We will now count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method with the given edges:

1. Start with the edge (0, 18):
    - Node 0 has degree 3, and Node 18 has degree 3.
    - Since both nodes have the same degree, we will not proceed.

2. Continue with the next edge (1, 5):
    - Node 1 has degree 2, and Node 5 has degree 3.
    - Proceed with this edge.

3. Consider shared neighbors of nodes 1 and 5:
    - Shared neighbors: Node 6
    - Triangle found: <1, 5, 6>

4. Next, move to edge (4, 7):
    - Node 4 has degree 5, and Node 7 has degree 3.
    - Proceed with this edge.

5. Consider shared neighbors of nodes 4 and 7:
    - Shared neighbors: None

6. Move on to the edge (4, 16):
    - Node 4 has degree 5, and Node 16 has degree 5.
    - Since both nodes have the same degree, we will not proceed.

7. Continue this process for all remaining edges, checking for shared neighbors:
    - Edge (7, 12) forms <1, 5, 6>
    - Edge (14, 17) forms <1, 5, 6>
    - Edge (14, 3) forms <1, 5, 6>
    - Edge (14, 6) forms <1, 5, 6>
    - Edge (17, 9) forms <1, 5, 6>
    - Edge (10, 3) forms <1, 5, 6>
    - Edge (10, 6) forms <1, 5, 6>
    - Edge (10, 12) forms <1, 5, 6>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is: [6]
Unique triangles found: <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 6>
