Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 9) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 12) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (15, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 3) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (16, 4) (16, 7) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 6) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (6, 18) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 2) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 12) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 19) (10, 12) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 10) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 11) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges:
- 0: {1, 13}
- 1: {0, 9, 13, 15}
- 2: {3, 6, 14, 19}
- 3: {2, 7, 9}
- 4: {5, 9, 16, 18}
- 5: {4, 11, 17}
- 6: {2, 7, 17, 18}
- 7: {3, 6, 16, 17}
- 8: {9}
- 9: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- 10: {12}
- 11: {5, 12}
- 12: {10, 11, 18, 19}
- 13: {1, 0, 17, 19}
- 14: {2}
- 15: {1}
- 16: {4, 7}
- 17: {5, 6, 7, 13}
- 18: {4, 6, 12}
- 19: {2, 12, 13}

After sorting the vertices by their connections from least to most, the new labels are:
{10, 15, 14, 8, 0, 11, 3, 7, 2, 18, 1, 5, 6, 9, 17, 4, 16, 12, 19, 13}

The triangles found in the graph are:
