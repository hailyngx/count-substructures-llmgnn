Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 10) (15, 27) (15, 9) (27, 15) (27, 18) (27, 3) (1, 21) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 2) (7, 24) (7, 17) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 3) (22, 18) (22, 19) (22, 0) (22, 12) (10, 16) (10, 21) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 13) (17, 7) (17, 10) (2, 11) (2, 21) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 4) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 14) (0, 24) (14, 0) (14, 25) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 28) (4, 3) (26, 5) (28, 4) (28, 8) (28, 20) (5, 26) (5, 13) (5, 8) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 20) (8, 16) (8, 28) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 16) (9, 15) (9, 8) (19, 22) (19, 23) (23, 19) (23, 25) (23, 3) (6, 10) (25, 14) (25, 23) (20, 28) (20, 13) (3, 27) (3, 18) (3, 4) (3, 23) (24, 7) (24, 0) (24, 12) (12, 1) (12, 22) (12, 24) (29, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in non-decreasing order. 

The sorted list of vertices based on the degree is as follows:
Vertex 26, Degree 2
Vertex 5, Degree 3
Vertex 7, Degree 3
Vertex 1, Degree 3
Vertex 15, Degree 3
Vertex 19, Degree 3
Vertex 20, Degree 3
Vertex 29, Degree 3
Vertex 6, Degree 3
Vertex 9, Degree 4
Vertex 18, Degree 5
Vertex 10, Degree 5
Vertex 27, Degree 5
Vertex 23, Degree 5
Vertex 25, Degree 5
Vertex 8, Degree 6
Vertex 3, Degree 6
Vertex 17, Degree 6
Vertex 21, Degree 6
Vertex 12, Degree 6
Vertex 22, Degree 6
Vertex 4, Degree 6
Vertex 14, Degree 6
Vertex 24, Degree 6
Vertex 0, Degree 7
Vertex 2, Degree 7
Vertex 11, Degree 7
Vertex 13, Degree 7
Vertex 16, Degree 7

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

1. (11, 16):
    - Check shared connections of vertices 11 and 16: (0, 2, 6, 13, 21)
    - Triangles formed: <11, 0, 2>, <11, 2, 21>

2. (11, 0):
    - Check shared connections of vertices 0 and 11: (2, 14, 22, 24)
    - Triangles formed: None

3. (11, 2):
    - Check shared connections of vertices 2 and 11: (0, 4, 13, 21)
    - Triangles formed: <2, 11, 21>

4. (16, 11):
    - Same as edge (11, 16)

5. (16, 29):
    - Check shared connections of vertices 16 and 29: None
    - Triangles formed: None

6. (16, 8):
    - Check shared connections of vertices 16 and 8: (10, 28)
    - Triangles formed: None

7. (16, 9):
    - Same as edge (9, 16)

8. (16, 10):
    - Same as edge (10, 16)

9. (15, 27):
    - Same as edge (27, 15)

...

After counting all triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<11, 0, 2> 
<11, 2, 21> 
<2, 11, 21> 
<8, 10, 16> 
<8, 10, 13> 
<12, 22, 24> 
<12, 22, 0> 
<5, 8, 13> 
<13, 10, 2> 
<13, 20, 5>
