Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 7), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 7), (4, 1), (4, 2), (7, 6), (6, 3), (6, 2), (0, 1)]

Now, we need to count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method by relabeling the vertices based on their degrees and checking for triangles. 

After relabeling the vertices based on their degrees from least to most:
Vertices: {1, 0, 2, 8, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 9}

Triangles found:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
