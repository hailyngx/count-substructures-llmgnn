Edges:
- 0: (6, 13, 2, 3)
- 1: (5, 7, 14)
- 2: (9, 7, 11, 8, 0, 14)
- 3: (4, 6, 10, 8, 0)
- 4: (7, 8, 11, 3)
- 5: (9, 1)
- 6: (9, 10, 3, 0)
- 7: (9, 4, 10, 14, 2, 1)
- 8: (4, 2, 3)
- 9: (5, 6, 14, 2, 7, 13, 1)
- 10: (7, 6, 12, 3, 13)
- 11: (4, 2)
- 12: (10)
- 13: (9, 10, 0, 14)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Sorted vertices by degrees:
- Vertex 12: degree 1
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 11: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 3
- Vertex 12: degree 1
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 10: degree 5
- Vertex 3: degree 5
- Vertex 0: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 6
- Vertex 7: degree 6
- Vertex 13: degree 4
- Vertex 14: degree 5

Triangles:
There are a total of 10 triangles in the graph: [10]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 14>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 14>, <2, 10, 13>, <2, 10, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 10, 13>, <6, 9, 10>
