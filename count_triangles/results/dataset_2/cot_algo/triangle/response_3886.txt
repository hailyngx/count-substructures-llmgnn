Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 8) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 15) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (0, 16) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 15) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 5) (19, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (17, 4) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 10) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 10) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 9) (12, 5) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 9) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges based on the provided information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: 
(11, 16), (11, 14), (11, 6), (11, 15), (16, 11), (16, 0), (16, 8), 
(1, 9), (1, 8), 
(3, 7), (3, 19), (3, 18), 
(8, 16), (8, 1), (8, 13), (8, 15), 
(13, 8), (13, 2), 
(2, 13), (2, 18), (2, 0), 
(18, 3), (18, 2), (18, 19), (18, 15), 
(5, 6), (5, 19), (5, 12), (5, 10), 
(6, 11), (6, 5), (6, 14), 
(0, 16), (0, 2), 
(14, 11), (14, 6), (14, 15), 
(19, 3), (19, 18), (19, 5), (19, 4), 
(7, 3), (7, 10), 
(17, 4), 
(4, 19), (4, 17), (4, 10), 
(9, 1), (9, 15), (9, 10), 
(15, 11), (15, 8), (15, 18), (15, 14), (15, 9), 
(12, 5), 
(10, 5), (10, 7), (10, 4), (10, 9)

Next, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes with their degree:
Node 12: 1
Node 7: 2
Node 17: 2
Node 13: 2
Node 2: 3
Node 0: 3
Node 1: 3
Node 14: 3
Node 16: 3
Node 6: 4
Node 9: 4
Node 3: 4
Node 18: 4
Node 8: 5
Node 5: 4
Node 4: 5
Node 19: 5
Node 15: 6
Node 10: 6
Node 11: 5

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
[Total number of triangles: 11]
Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 18>
<0, 2, 19>
<0, 18, 19>
<2, 5, 10>
<2, 5, 19>
<2, 18, 19>
<3, 7, 19>
<5, 10, 19>
<10, 15, 9>
<14, 11, 15>
<15, 8, 16>
