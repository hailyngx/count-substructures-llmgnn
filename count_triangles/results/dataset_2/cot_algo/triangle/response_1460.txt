By examining the edges and following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].  
The unique triangles found are as follows:  
<15, 21, 28>  
<18, 6, 28>  
<13, 9, 11>  
<10, 3, 1>  
<24, 4, 17>  
<10, 3, 25>  
<11, 9, 13>  
<7, 25, 3>  
<23, 15, 21>  
<26, 15, 23>  
<1, 10, 3>  
<12, 4, 17>  
<27, 17, 11>  
<7, 25, 28>
