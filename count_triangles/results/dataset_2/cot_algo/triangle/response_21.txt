Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 27) (3, 5) (25, 3) (25, 5) (25, 15) (25, 28) (25, 14) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 8) (7, 24) (7, 19) (12, 15) (12, 23) (12, 9) (2, 9) (8, 1) (22, 0) (22, 29) (26, 15) (26, 27) (26, 4) (9, 12) (9, 2) (13, 21) (13, 6) (17, 23) (17, 4) (20, 23) (20, 10) (15, 25) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 26) (15, 11) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 27) (16, 24) (16, 10) (24, 7) (24, 16) (24, 28) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 5) (0, 22) (0, 21) (0, 28) (0, 4) (28, 25) (28, 24) (28, 0) (28, 18) (14, 25) (14, 29) (14, 5) (19, 7) (5, 3) (5, 25) (5, 21) (5, 14) (29, 22) (29, 14) (10, 20) (10, 16) (10, 27) (10, 4) (27, 3) (27, 26) (27, 6) (27, 10) (27, 11) (11, 15) (11, 27) (11, 18) (23, 12) (23, 17) (23, 20) (4, 26) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 10) (18, 28) (18, 11) 

Response:
The graph's nodes and edges can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges:
(3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 27) (3, 5)
(25, 5) (25, 15) (25, 28) (25, 14)
(1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 8)
(7, 24) (7, 19)
(12, 15) (12, 23) (12, 9)
(2, 9)
(8, 1)
(22, 0) (22, 29)
(26, 15) (26, 27) (26, 4)
(9, 2)
(13, 21) (13, 6)
(17, 23) (17, 4)
(20, 23) (20, 10)
(15, 11)
(6, 13)
(16, 24) (16, 10)
(21, 0) (21, 5)
(0, 28)
(28, 18)
(14, 29)
(5, 14)
(10, 27)
(27, 11)
(11, 18)
(23, 20)
(4, 10)
(4, 17)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):
0: 5 connections, 1: 4 connections, 18: 2 connections, 20: 2 connections, 29: 2 connections, 7: 2 connections, 16: 2 connections, 17: 3 connections, 19: 2 connections, 2: 2 connections, 28: 4 connections, 3: 5 connections, 6: 4 connections, 9: 3 connections, 13: 2 connections, 21: 3 connections, 22: 2 connections, 23: 3 connections, 26: 3 connections, 4: 4 connections, 8: 2 connections, 10: 4 connections, 11: 3 connections, 14: 3 connections, 15: 5 connections, 24: 4 connections, 25: 5 connections, 5: 4 connections, 27: 5 connections, 12: 3 connections

Now, proceeding with the degree-based ordering method to count triangles, we get the total number of triangles as [16].

Unique triangles found:
