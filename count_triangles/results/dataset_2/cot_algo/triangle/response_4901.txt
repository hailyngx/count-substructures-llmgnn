Response:
The graph has been constructed with the given nodes and edges. 
Now, the vertices will be sorted based on their degree in ascending order and then relabeled accordingly.

The sorted vertices with their degrees are as follows:
Node 5: Degree 1
Node 17: Degree 1
Node 29: Degree 2
Node 12: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 15: Degree 2
Node 14: Degree 2
Node 19: Degree 3
Node 11: Degree 2
Node 22: Degree 4
Node 25: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 2
Node 24: Degree 3
Node 18: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 5
Node 10: Degree 3
Node 16: Degree 3
Node 28: Degree 3
Node 20: Degree 4
Node 23: Degree 4
Node 27: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 21: Degree 5
Node 26: Degree 3

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

After counting, the total number of triangles is [35].
