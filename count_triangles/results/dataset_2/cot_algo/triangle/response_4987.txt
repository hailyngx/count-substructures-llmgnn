Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 17) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 10) (0, 27) (0, 12) (0, 1) (3, 25) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 4) (25, 21) (6, 9) (6, 21) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 12) (10, 27) (10, 12) (10, 23) (17, 15) (17, 21) (17, 7) (28, 14) (28, 19) (29, 19) (22, 9) (22, 14) (26, 13) (26, 11) (13, 26) (13, 12) (13, 18) (21, 25) (21, 6) (21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 24) (20, 3) (20, 8) (8, 21) (8, 20) (8, 19) (8, 24) (19, 28) (19, 29) (19, 8) (19, 18) (18, 15) (18, 13) (18, 19) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 11) (5, 2) (14, 3) (14, 28) (14, 22) (14, 7) (24, 21) (24, 8) (24, 7) (24, 23) (1, 0) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 11) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 24) (16, 23) (16, 4) (4, 25) (4, 16) (4, 23) (4, 11) (23, 10) (23, 24) (23, 16) (23, 4) (11, 26) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 4) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, the sorted vertices based on their degree are as follows:

0 (degree 3), 1 (degree 1), 5 (degree 1), 6 (degree 2), 9 (degree 3), 16 (degree 2), 7 (degree 3), 2 (degree 3), 28 (degree 2), 29 (degree 2), 17 (degree 3), 26 (degree 2), 15 (degree 3), 3 (degree 4), 25 (degree 3), 21 (degree 5), 8 (degree 4), 24 (degree 4), 20 (degree 2), 19 (degree 4), 18 (degree 3), 14 (degree 4), 22 (degree 2), 13 (degree 3), 11 (degree 4), 10 (degree 3), 12 (degree 6), 23 (degree 4), 4 (degree 4).

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and looking at the given edges, we can count the triangles and list them in the format <node1, node2, node3>:

Total number of triangles: [13]
Unique triangles:
