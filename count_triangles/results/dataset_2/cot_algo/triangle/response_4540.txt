Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 24) (9, 23) (9, 0) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 14) (3, 18) (12, 27) (12, 14) (12, 18) (27, 12) (27, 28) (27, 13) (5, 24) (5, 20) (13, 1) (13, 27) (13, 11) (13, 7) (11, 13) (11, 20) (11, 15) (11, 25) (18, 3) (18, 12) (18, 24) (26, 16) (26, 0) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 22) (17, 4) (17, 21) (20, 6) (20, 5) (20, 11) (20, 17) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 21) (21, 17) (21, 10) (21, 22) (21, 15) (8, 22) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 29) (23, 9) (28, 27) (7, 13) (7, 29) (29, 19) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 15) (29, 14) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 29) (14, 2) (16, 26) (16, 17) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 24) (4, 17) (25, 11) (0, 9) (0, 26) (0, 29) (24, 9) (24, 5) (24, 18) (24, 2) (15, 11) (15, 21) (15, 29) (15, 22) (22, 17) (22, 21) (22, 8) (22, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 8 has degree 1
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Nodes 3, 4, 5, 7, 16, 18, 23, 25, 26, 28 have degree 2
- Nodes 0, 2, 10, 15 have degree 3
- Nodes 12, 13, 14, 17, 21, 24 have degree 4
- Nodes 6, 9, 11, 20, 22 have degree 5
- Nodes 19, 27, 29 have degree 5

Since there are 30 nodes in total, we can see that this list contains all nodes.

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Triangle <6, 9, 0>
- Triangle <6, 9, 24>
- Triangle <6, 9, 27>
- Triangle <6, 19, 2>
- Triangle <6, 19, 29>
- Triangle <6, 20, 5>
- Triangle <9, 0, 26>
- Triangle <9, 24, 5>
- Triangle <9, 24, 18>
- Triangle <9, 27, 13>
- Triangle <1, 10, 21>
- Triangle <3, 14, 2>
- Triangle <3, 18, 24>
- Triangle <12, 27, 13>
- Triangle <12, 14, 2>
- Triangle <27, 13, 29>
- Triangle <5, 24, 18>
- Triangle <13, 7, 29>
- Triangle <13, 11, 25>
- Triangle <18, 12, 14>
- Triangle <17, 20, 11>
- Triangle <17, 20, 5>
- Triangle <17, 20, 6>
- Triangle <17, 20, 11>
- Triangle <17, 20, 5>
- Triangle <17, 20, 6>
- Triangle <17, 20, 11>
- Triangle <17, 20, 5>
- Triangle <17, 21, 10>
- Triangle <17, 21, 22>
- Triangle <17, 21, 15>
- Triangle <17, 4, 21>
- Triangle <20, 6, 9>
- Triangle <20, 6, 10>
- Triangle <20, 11, 25>
- Triangle <20, 17, 16>
- Triangle <20, 17, 22>
- Triangle <10, 6, 19>
- Triangle <21, 15, 29>
- Triangle <21, 15, 22>
- Triangle <19, 2, 14>
- Triangle <19, 29, 7>
- Triangle <19, 29, 0>
- Triangle <23, 9, 0>
- Triangle <7, 29, 0>
- Triangle <27, 13, 29>
- Triangle <29, 14, 2>
- Triangle <14, 2, 24>
- Triangle <16, 26, 0>
- Triangle <16, 17, 22>
- Triangle <2, 14, 24>
- Triangle <11, 15, 22>
