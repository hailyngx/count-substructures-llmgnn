Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 14) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 2) (14, 3) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 14) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 5) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 19) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 5) (18, 14) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 0) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 10) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (2, 15) (2, 9) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 12) 

Response:
The graph has the following connections:

Node 0: 7, 13, 19
Node 1: 4, 8, 10, 16
Node 2: 9, 15
Node 3: 14, 15, 17
Node 4: 1, 5, 10
Node 5: 4, 7, 11
Node 6: 8, 9, 10, 19
Node 7: 0, 5, 14
Node 8: 1, 6, 13
Node 9: 2, 6, 19
Node 10: 1, 4, 6, 12, 16
Node 11: 5, 16
Node 12: 10, 14, 16
Node 13: 0, 8
Node 14: 3, 7, 12, 17, 18
Node 15: 2, 3, 16
Node 16: 1, 10, 11, 12, 15
Node 17: 3, 14
Node 18: 14
Node 19: 0, 6, 9

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are ordered as follows:
0 < 2 < 18 < 11 < 17 < 9 < 13 < 3 < 8 < 7 < 12 <10 < 1 < 5 < 4 < 14 < 15 < 19 < 16 < 6

Using this ordering, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph:

Total number of triangles: [20]

Unique triangles: 
<4, 10, 16>
<1, 10, 16>
<0, 13, 8>
<0, 7, 14>
<0, 19, 6>
<6, 9, 19>
<6, 10, 12>
<7, 5, 14>
<14, 12, 16>
<3, 15, 14>
<3, 15, 16>
<3, 17, 14>
<3, 17, 15>
<8, 1, 16>
<10, 12, 16>
<4, 1, 16>
<4, 5, 11>
<9, 6, 19>
<14, 17, 3>
<14, 18, 3>
