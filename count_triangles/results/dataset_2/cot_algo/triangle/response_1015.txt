Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 12
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 11, 3, 10, and 14
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 14, 13, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 11, and 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 13, 2, 9, 10, and 0
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 5, and 2
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 11, 0, and 9
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 7, 3, 10, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 6, and 12
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 2
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 13, 6, 9, and 14
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8 and 10
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 2
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 10, 11, and 2
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 11, and 5

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method by sorting the vertices based on their degrees:
Nodes with degrees:
0: 2
1: 5
2: 5
3: 4
4: 2
5: 3
6: 4
7: 5
8: 6
9: 4
10: 5
11: 4
12: 3
13: 4
14: 3

Ordered vertices:
0, 4, 12, 5, 14, 6, 3, 11, 9, 2, 13, 10, 1, 7, 8

Using the ordered vertices, we will count the number of triangles. The triangles found are:
<1, 8, 13>
<1, 8, 2>
<1, 8, 6>
<1, 14, 7>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 8, 13>
<2, 8, 6>
<2, 13, 5>
<3, 7, 11>
<3, 7, 10>
<3, 6, 1>
<5, 12, 4>
<6, 3, 1>
<6, 3, 2>
<8, 13, 1>
<8, 13, 2>
<10, 7, 4>
<10, 7, 11>
<10, 7, 14>
<10, 11, 9>
<13, 1, 14>
<13, 1, 2>

There are 23 triangles in total. So, the output would be:
[23]
