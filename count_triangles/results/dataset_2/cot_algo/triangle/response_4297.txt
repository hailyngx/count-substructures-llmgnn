Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 1) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 14) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method ensures that each triangle is only counted once. 

The vertices sorted by their degrees are: 9, 8, 6, 12, 7, 4, 0, 14, 13, 1, 11, 5, 3, 2, 10.

After relabeling the vertices, the edges to be considered are: (0, 13), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 11), (0, 12), (1, 11), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 12), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 12), (2, 13), (3, 6), (3, 11), (3, 5), (3, 13), (3, 14), (4, 13), (4, 5), (4, 14), (4, 11), (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 12), (5, 14), (6, 10), (6, 12), (6, 13), (7, 13), (7, 12), (8, 12), (8, 13), (8, 14), (9, 12), (10, 12), (10, 14), (11, 12), (11, 13), (12, 13), (12, 14), (13, 14).

There are a total of 21 triangles in the graph.

The total number of triangles: [21]
The unique triangles are: <0, 6, 12>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 11, 14>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 11, 12>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 12, 13>, <3, 6, 13>, <3, 11, 12>, <3, 13, 14>, <4, 5, 14>, <4, 11, 13>, <5, 12, 13>, <6, 10, 12>, <6, 13, 14>, <7, 12, 13>, <8, 12, 13>, <8, 13, 14>, <9, 12, 13>, <10, 12, 14>, <11, 12, 13>.
