Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, the Degree-Based Ordering method can be used to count the number of triangles. Let's first sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Vertices: 
Node 8 - Degree 4
Node 0 - Degree 4
Node 9 - Degree 4
Node 3 - Degree 4
Node 5 - Degree 3
Node 1 - Degree 3
Node 2 - Degree 3
Node 4 - Degree 8
Node 7 - Degree 8
Node 6 - Degree 7

Next, let's identify and count the triangles by checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge.

Triangles: 
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 4>
<7, 4, 5>
<7, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [13]
