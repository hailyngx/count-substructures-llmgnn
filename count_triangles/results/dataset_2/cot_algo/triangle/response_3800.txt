Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 29) (27, 22) (14, 17) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 23) (17, 22) (17, 11) (7, 21) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 1) (21, 15) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 10) (21, 29) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 24) (8, 16) (8, 26) (1, 7) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 24) (26, 8) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 18) (0, 4) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 18) (20, 7) (20, 0) (20, 11) (5, 19) (6, 7) (6, 1) (24, 8) (24, 1) (24, 26) (19, 5) (19, 29) (19, 12) (3, 21) (3, 23) (3, 12) (18, 14) (18, 26) (18, 0) (10, 21) (10, 13) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 25) (16, 2) (22, 27) (22, 17) (28, 8) (28, 13) (28, 25) (28, 2) (11, 17) (11, 20) (23, 17) (23, 3) (29, 27) (29, 21) (29, 19) (29, 12) (2, 16) (2, 28) (13, 10) (13, 28) (13, 25) (25, 0) (25, 16) (25, 28) (25, 13) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 29) 

Response:
The vertices and their connections are as follows:

0: 4, 20, 18  
1: 7, 6, 26, 24  
2: 16, 28  
3: 21, 23, 12  
4: 8, 0, 16  
5: 19  
6: 7, 1  
7: 21, 20, 6, 1  
8: 4, 26, 24, 16, 28  
10: 21, 13  
11: 17, 20  
12: 19, 3, 29  
13: 10, 28, 25  
14: 17, 18  
15: 27, 21  
16: 4, 8, 2, 25  
17: 14, 23, 22, 11  
18: 14, 26, 0  
19: 5, 29, 12  
20: 7, 11, 0  
21: 15, 7, 3, 10, 29  
22: 27, 17  
23: 17, 3  
24: 8, 1, 26  
25: 0, 16, 28, 13  
26: 8, 1, 18, 24  
27: 15, 29, 22  
28: 8, 2, 25, 13  
29: 27, 21, 19, 12  

By rearranging the vertices based on their degrees from least to most connections, we get the following order: 

5, 10, 20, 5, 11, 12, 2, 4, 14, 23, 3, 13, 10, 22, 0, 19, 15, 1, 7, 6, 26, 8, 16, 17, 18, 25, 21, 24, 27, 29, 28

Now, we count the number of triangles:

[145]

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 3, 21>
<8, 13, 28>
<15, 21, 27>
<15, 21, 29>
<16, 25, 28>
<17, 22, 27>
<17, 23, 3>
<18, 26, 0>
<20, 7, 21>
<24, 26, 8>
