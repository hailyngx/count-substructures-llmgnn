Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 15) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 18) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 10) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 12) (9, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 19) (17, 11) (17, 0) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 10) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 19) (18, 6) (18, 19) (18, 14) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 3) (0, 6) (0, 17) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 0) (14, 18) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 19) (2, 16) (2, 4) (2, 1) 

Response:
Edges sorted by the lower labeled vertex:
(0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 17) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 15) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 16) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 19) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 12) (7, 15) (7, 16) (7, 19) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 15) (9, 8) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 12) (11, 17) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 15) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 19) (14, 18) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 12) (16, 2) (16, 7) (17, 0) (17, 11) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 19) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 18)
