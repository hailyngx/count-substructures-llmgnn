Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: (5), (7)
- 1: (5), (3), (8)
- 2: (9), (6), (4), (8)
- 3: (6), (1), (7), (4)
- 4: (6), (3), (8), (2)
- 5: (9), (8), (1), (0)
- 6: (9), (7), (3), (2), (4)
- 7: (9), (6), (3), (0)
- 8: (5), (9), (1), (4), (2)
- 9: (5), (6), (8), (2), (7)

Next, let's apply Degree-Based Ordering to the vertices (from lowest degree to highest degree):
Nodes in order of degrees: 0, 1, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 3, 6, 9
Relabeling based on degrees: 
- Node 0 -> 0
- Node 1 -> 1
- Node 7 -> 2
- Node 2 -> 3
- Node 5 -> 4
- Node 8 -> 5
- Node 4 -> 6
- Node 3 -> 7
- Node 6 -> 8
- Node 9 -> 9

Now, we will check for triangles based on the lower label requirement:

Triangles found: <1, 5, 8> <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
