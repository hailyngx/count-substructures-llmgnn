Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (14, 11) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 0) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 12) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 12) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]

Edges: 
- 0: [4, 8, 12, 2]
- 1: [8, 2, 13, 12]
- 2: [9, 5, 1, 13, 0]
- 3: [7, 11, 12]
- 4: [0, 10, 5, 11]
- 5: [4, 7, 2]
- 6: [9, 7, 12, 8]
- 7: [6, 3, 11, 10, 5]
- 8: [6, 10, 0, 1]
- 9: [6, 2, 11, 10]
- 10: [9, 4, 7, 8]
- 11: [9, 4, 7, 3, 14]
- 12: [6, 3, 1, 13, 0]
- 13: [1, 14, 2, 12]
- 14: [11, 13]

Now, let's sort the nodes based on the number of connections they have:
Nodes sorted by degree: [14, 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 13, 4, 2, 11, 6, 12, 7, 9]

Based on the sorted list, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
[Total number of triangles: 4]
<0, 4, 10>
<2, 9, 11>
<9, 10, 11>
<1, 8, 13>
