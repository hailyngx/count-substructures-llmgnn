Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 9) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are as follows:
Node 7: degree 5
Nodes 0, 5, 6, 2, 8, 9: degree 4
Nodes 1, 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 6

Now, let's count the triangles:
- For the edge (4, 7):
  Node 4 has connections with: 0, 5, 1, 6
  Node 7 has connections with: 3, 6, 2, 8
  Shared connections: 6
  Triangle: <4, 7, 6>

- For the edge (4, 0):
  Node 4 has connections with: 7, 5, 1, 6
  Node 0 has connections with: 3, 9
  Shared connections: None
  
- For the edge (4, 5):
  Node 4 has connections with: 7, 0, 1, 6
  Node 5 has connections with: None
  Shared connections: None

- For the edge (4, 1):
  Node 4 has connections with: 7, 0, 5, 6
  Node 1 has connections with: 3, 2, 9, 8
  Shared connections: None
  
- For the edge (4, 6):
  Node 4 has connections with: 7, 0, 5, 1
  Node 6 has connections with: 7, 8
  Shared connections: 7
  Triangle: <4, 7, 6>

Since we are only considering the triangles once by following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles is [2].
