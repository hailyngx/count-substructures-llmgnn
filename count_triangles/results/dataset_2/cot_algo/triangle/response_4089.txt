Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method works as follows:

1. Sort the nodes by the number of connections each node has:
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 3

2. Relabel the nodes accordingly:
- Node 8 (degree 2) becomes Node 0
- Node 4 (degree 3) becomes Node 1
- Node 2 (degree 3) becomes Node 2
- Node 0 (degree 3) becomes Node 3
- Node 6 (degree 4) becomes Node 4
- Node 1 (degree 4) becomes Node 5
- Node 5 (degree 4) becomes Node 6
- Node 3 (degree 5) becomes Node 7
- Node 9 (degree 5) becomes Node 8
- Node 7 (degree 5) becomes Node 9

3. Count triangles by following the edges with the lower labeled node having fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 6): Check shared connections between nodes 0 and 6: 7
- Edge (0, 4): Check shared connections between nodes 0 and 4: 1
- Edge (0, 7): Check shared connections between nodes 0 and 7: 6, 3
- Edge (1, 4): Check shared connections between nodes 1 and 4: 5
- Edge (2, 3): Check shared connections between nodes 2 and 3:
- Edge (2, 9): Check shared connections between nodes 2 and 9: 5
- Edge (3, 9): Check shared connections between nodes 3 and 9: 7, 8
- Edge (3, 7): Check shared connections between nodes 3 and 7: 5, 9
- Edge (5, 6): Check shared connections between nodes 5 and 6: 4
- Edge (5, 4): Check shared connections between nodes 5 and 4:
- Edge (5, 7): Check shared connections between nodes 5 and 7: 6
- Edge (6, 7): Check shared connections between nodes 6 and 7: 5
- Edge (6, 1): Check shared connections between nodes 6 and 1: 5
- Edge (7, 9): Check shared connections between nodes 7 and 9: 3
- Edge (7, 1): Check shared connections between nodes 7 and 1: 6
- Edge (9, 8): Check shared connections between nodes 9 and 8: 3

The total number of triangles is [7]. 
The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 7>, <3, 7, 9>, and <5, 6, 7>.
