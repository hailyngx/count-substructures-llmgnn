Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first construct the graph. Then, we'll apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

The given edges are:
(5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) 
(9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
(1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) 
(3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) 
(4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) 
(8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) 
(6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) 
(2, 1) (2, 0) 
(0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
(7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6)

Now, sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) from least to most:
2, 4, 0, 8, 7, 9, 6, 3, 1, 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will proceed with the edges in the following order:
(2, 0), (4, 9), (0, 1), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 5), (3, 5), (1, 5), (5, 9), (6, 1), (4, 3), (6, 7), (0, 6), (5, 7), (1, 3), (8, 3), (7, 8), (1, 2), (3, 4), (1, 8).

After counting the triangles, the result is:
[19]

And the unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 5>, <3, 5, 1>, <3, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <0, 2, 1>, <5, 9, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 5>, <3, 8, 1>, <3, 8, 7>, <6, 7, 5>, <1, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 5>, <3, 8, 9>, <0, 1, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <8, 1, 9>, <5, 6, 1>, <8, 7, 9>
