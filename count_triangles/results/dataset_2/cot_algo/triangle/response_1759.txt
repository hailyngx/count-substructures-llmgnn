Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their respective connections:
0: [24, 18]
1: [15, 29, 20, 22]
2: [14, 13, 17, 11]
3: [15, 21, 28, 6]
4: [11, 29, 17]
5: [8, 22, 17]
6: [14, 3, 10, 20]
7: [21, 27, 18]
8: [19, 28, 5]
9: [24]
10: [6, 21, 28, 16]
11: [4, 2]
12: [16, 18, 23]
13: [21, 28, 29, 2, 25]
14: [26, 6, 2]
15: [3, 1, 23]
16: [12, 23, 10]
17: [19, 4, 2, 5]
18: [0, 12, 27]
19: [8, 17]
20: [26, 6, 1]
21: [3, 7, 10, 13]
22: [1, 5]
23: [15, 12, 16]
24: [9, 0]
25: [13]
26: [14, 20, 27]
27: [26, 7, 18]
28: [8, 13, 10, 3]
29: [1, 4, 13]

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices sorted by the number of connections are:
9 < 7 < 25 < 0 < 2 < 22 < 5 < 17 < 19 < 4 < 11 < 12 < 20 < 26 < 7 < 27 < 1 < 8 < 29 < 15 < 23 < 6 < 10 < 28 < 3 < 13 < 14 < 21 < 18 < 16

After checking for triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10]. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 15, 23>
<2, 13, 17>
<2, 13, 28>
<6, 10, 21>
<6, 10, 28>
<6, 13, 21>
<6, 14, 26>
<6, 14, 2>
<6, 20, 1>
<10, 16, 23>
