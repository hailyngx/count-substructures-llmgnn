Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 8) (3, 16) (3, 1) (3, 4) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 14) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 5) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 0) (7, 17) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 7) (17, 2) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 18) (19, 12) (18, 15) (18, 19) (9, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 2) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 6) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 6) (12, 19) (12, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 2), (0, 7), (1, 3), (1, 13), (1, 14), (2, 6), (2, 10), (2, 17), (3, 4), (3, 16), (4, 5), (5, 8), (5, 12), (6, 10), (6, 14), (7, 17), (8, 13), (8, 16), (8, 19), (9, 14), (10, 15), (10, 19), (12, 19), (12, 5), (13, 14), (13, 17), (14, 15), (14, 6), (15, 18), (16, 11), (16, 3), (16, 8), (17, 11), (17, 13), (17, 2), (17, 7), (18, 15), (18, 19), (19, 8), (19, 10)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method by sorting the vertices based on their degree:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 12: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 11: 2 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 18: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 16: 3 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Node 19: 4 connections

Now, we will check for triangles in the graph based on the sorted vertices. 

There is a total of 36 triangles in the graph.
