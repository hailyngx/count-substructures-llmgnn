Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 6) (2, 29) (2, 5) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 8) (7, 29) (7, 25) (7, 8) (21, 28) (21, 13) (21, 19) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 22) (3, 1) (3, 27) (12, 27) (12, 8) (27, 3) (27, 12) (27, 25) (8, 29) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 23) (8, 18) (23, 8) (23, 10) (23, 0) (23, 13) (26, 22) (26, 6) (15, 9) (15, 24) (20, 24) (19, 21) (19, 9) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 4) (22, 1) (22, 26) (22, 14) (17, 16) (17, 1) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 4) (25, 10) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 0) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 24) (6, 16) (6, 26) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 16) (13, 21) (13, 23) (13, 6) (0, 23) (0, 28) (0, 9) (0, 4) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 18) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 10) (10, 23) (10, 25) (10, 18) (10, 24) (4, 28) (4, 25) (4, 0) (24, 15) (24, 20) (24, 5) (24, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their number of connections from least to most. Here is the sorted list of nodes with their connections:

(11: 2), (16: 4), (17: 2), (13: 4), (6: 4), (2: 2), (29: 4), (5: 3), (7: 3), (25: 4), (8: 5), (21: 3), (28: 3), (19: 2), (1: 3), (3: 2), (27: 3), (12: 2), (23: 4), (18: 4), (0: 4), (26: 2), (15: 2), (9: 3), (24: 4), (20: 2), (14: 3), (10: 4), (4: 3)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Looking at the sorted list, we will analyze the edges in the following order:

Edges with vertices (11, 16), (17, 16), (13, 16), (6, 16), (2, 29), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 19), (2, 1), (3, 27), (3, 12), (3, 23), (3, 0), (12, 27), (12, 8), (27, 23), (27, 0), (27, 9), (8, 23), (8, 18), (8, 26), (21, 28), (21, 19), (21, 9), (1, 17), (1, 22), (1, 4), (13, 21), (13, 23), (13, 14), (0, 28), (0, 9), (0, 24), (14, 22), (14, 18), (14, 10), (9, 24), (9, 20), (5, 18), (5, 15), (24, 20), (19, 28), (19, 10), (28, 18)

After analyzing the shared connections, we find that the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].

The unique triangles found are <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 29>, <3, 12, 27>, <3, 27, 23>, <3, 27, 0>, <8, 18, 23>, <8, 23, 27>, <13, 14, 22>, <0, 9, 24>, <5, 15, 18>.
