Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method proceeds as follows:
- Count the number of connections for each node:  
Node 0: 3 connections  
Node 1: 2 connections  
Node 2: 4 connections  
Node 3: 3 connections  
Node 4: 4 connections  
Node 5: 4 connections  
Node 6: 4 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 8: 4 connections  
Node 9: 6 connections  
Node 10: 4 connections  
Node 11: 4 connections  
Node 12: 3 connections  
Node 13: 5 connections  
Node 14: 4 connections  

- Sorting the nodes by their connections in increasing order:
(1, 3, 0), (11, 12, 14, 10, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), (9), (13)

- Relabeling the nodes accordingly:
Node 0: 0  
Node 1: 1  
Node 2: 2  
Node 3: 3  
Node 4: 4  
Node 5: 5  
Node 6: 6  
Node 7: 7  
Node 8: 8  
Node 9: 9  
Node 10: 10  
Node 11: 11  
Node 12: 12  
Node 13: 13  
Node 14: 14
