Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps us count the number of triangles efficiently. Let's apply this method to the given graph:

1. Sort the vertices by their degrees in ascending order. 
- Vertex 2: degree 1
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 2
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertices 5, 6: degree 4
- Vertices 0, 1: degree 5
- Vertices 8, 9: degree 6
- Vertex 4: degree 7

2. Relabel the vertices according to their degrees:
- Vertex 2 (degree 1) -> Vertex A
- Vertex 7 (degree 2) -> Vertex B
- Vertex 7 (degree 2) -> Vertex C
- Vertex 3 (degree 3) -> Vertex D
- Vertices 5, 6 (degree 4) -> Vertices E, F
- Vertices 0, 1 (degree 5) -> Vertices G, H
- Vertices 8, 9 (degree 6) -> Vertices I, J
- Vertex 4 (degree 7) -> Vertex K

3. Proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
- Edge (A, H): No triangle
- Edge (B, F): No triangle
- Edge (C, E): No triangle
- Edge (D, J): No triangle
- Edge (E, F): Triangle formed with vertex C <C, E, F>
- Edge (G, H): Triangle formed with vertex A <A, G, H>
- Edge (I, J): Triangle formed with vertex D <D, J, I>
- Edge (K, H): No triangle
- Edge (K, E): Triangle formed with vertices C, F <C, K, E>
- Edge (K, I): Triangle formed with vertices D, J <D, K, J>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
