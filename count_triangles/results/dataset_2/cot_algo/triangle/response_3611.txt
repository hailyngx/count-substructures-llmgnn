Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 27) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 5) (17, 7) (22, 2) (22, 27) (22, 16) (22, 20) (23, 10) (23, 9) (4, 20) (4, 26) (8, 28) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 27) (26, 4) (26, 1) (26, 11) (21, 19) (28, 8) (28, 12) (28, 18) (28, 5) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 25) (5, 17) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 16) (9, 23) (9, 27) (9, 19) (10, 23) (10, 3) (12, 28) (12, 24) (12, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 20) (6, 0) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 16) (11, 26) (11, 29) (25, 13) (25, 18) (0, 6) (27, 14) (27, 22) (27, 1) (27, 9) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 6) (24, 12) (24, 7) (24, 29) (7, 17) (7, 24) (7, 18) (18, 28) (18, 5) (18, 25) (18, 7) (18, 16) (19, 21) (19, 9) (19, 20) (16, 22) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 18) (15, 6) (15, 29) (20, 22) (20, 4) (20, 6) (20, 19) (29, 11) (29, 24) (29, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of their connections. 

Here is the list of vertices with their degrees in ascending order:
(0: 1), (7: 1), (10: 2), (23: 2), (4: 2), (21: 2), (17: 3), (11: 3), (12: 3), (25: 3), (8: 3), (9: 3), (3: 3), (24: 3), (14: 3), (15: 3), (18: 5), (19: 3), (13: 4), (20: 4), (27: 4), (2: 4), (5: 5), (29: 3), (6: 5), (1: 5), (16: 4), (26: 4), (22: 4), (28: 4)

Now, let's count the triangles. We'll start with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. For edge (14, 13):
   Shared connections: {17}
   
2. For edge (14, 17):
   Shared connections: {}
   
3. For edge (14, 27):
   Shared connections: {}
   
4. For edge (17, 5):
   Shared connections: {}
   
5. For edge (22, 16):
   Shared connections: {}
   
6. For edge (23, 9):
   Shared connections: {}
   
7. For edge (4, 20):
   Shared connections: {}
   
8. For edge (4, 26):
   Shared connections: {1}
   
9. For edge (8, 28):
   Shared connections: {}
   
10. For edge (1, 26):
    Shared connections: {6}
    
11. For edge (1, 27):
    Shared connections: {}
    
12. For edge (21, 19):
    Shared connections: {}
    
13. For edge (21, 19):
    Shared connections: {}
    
14. For edge (28, 8):
    Shared connections: {}
    
15. For edge (13, 25):
    Shared connections: {}
    
16. For edge (13, 5):
    Shared connections: {14}
   
17. For edge (5, 28):
    Shared connections: {18}
    
18. For edge (9, 23):
    Shared connections: {}
    
19. For edge (9, 19):
    Shared connections: {}
    
20. For edge (10, 23):
    Shared connections: {}
    
21. For edge (12, 28):
    Shared connections: {}
    
22. For edge (6, 1):
    Shared connections: {}
    
23. For edge (6, 3):
    Shared connections: {}
    
24. For edge (2, 22):
    Shared connections: {}
    
25. For edge (11, 26):
    Shared connections: {}
   
26. For edge (0, 6):
    Shared connections: {}
    
27. For edge (27, 14):
    Shared connections: {}
    
28. For edge (3, 10):
    Shared connections: {}
    
29. For edge (7, 17):
    Shared connections: {}
    
30. For edge (18, 25):
    Shared connections: {}

Total triangles: [3]

Unique triangles: <5, 28, 18>, <13, 14, 5>, <1, 6, 26>
