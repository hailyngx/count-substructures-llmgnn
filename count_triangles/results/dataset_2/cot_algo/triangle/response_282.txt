Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections. Here, we list the vertices based on the number of connections in increasing order:

0: 5 connections  
6: 2 connections  
8: 3 connections  
2: 3 connections  
3: 4 connections  
9: 4 connections  
8: 4 connections  
6: 4 connections  
4: 6 connections  
1: 7 connections  
7: 8 connections  

Now, we will list the triangles found in the graph:

Total number of triangles: [12]  
Unique triangles:  
<0, 1, 4>  
<0, 1, 5>  
<0, 2, 8>  
<0, 2, 9>  
<0, 4, 7>  
<0, 4, 8>  
<0, 4, 9>  
<0, 6, 1>  
<1, 3, 7>  
<1, 4, 7>  
<1, 5, 7>  
<4, 7, 9>
