Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to efficiently count the number of triangles in the graph. 

Let's first sort the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 3 has degree 2
- Vertex 0 has degree 2
- Vertex 4 has degree 3
- Vertex 7 has degree 4
- Vertex 9 has degree 4
- Vertex 2 has degree 4
- Vertex 5 has degree 5
- Vertex 1 has degree 6
- Vertex 8 has degree 6
- Vertex 6 has degree 7

Now, we will count the triangles formed by considering the edges in the order specified and the sorted vertices. 

Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <1, 2, 6>
3. <1, 2, 8>
4. <1, 4, 5>
5. <1, 5, 7>
6. <1, 7, 9>
7. <2, 4, 8>
8. <2, 5, 6>
9. <5, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [9]
