(16, 18) (16, 29)
(13, 0)
(28, 14) (28, 1)

After relabeling the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order, we get:
0, 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 11, 12, 8, 13, 6, 9, 7, 14, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 29, 20, 23, 24, 25, 22, 26, 27, 28

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
We only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
