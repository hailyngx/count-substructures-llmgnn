Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (7, 8, 1)
- 1: (5, 0)
- 2: (6, 4, 3)
- 3: (5, 6, 4, 2, 8)
- 4: (5, 9, 7, 3, 2)
- 5: (9, 1, 4, 3, 7)
- 6: (9, 7, 3, 2, 8)
- 7: (5, 9, 6, 4, 0)
- 8: (6, 0, 3)
- 9: (5, 6, 4, 7)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
0 (degree 3), 1 (degree 2), 8 (degree 3), 2 (degree 5), 7 (degree 5), 9 (degree 4), 5 (degree 5), 6 (degree 5), 3 (degree 5), 4 (degree 5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now consider the edges starting from the edge involving the vertex with the lower label and fewer connections.

Checking the edges following the degree-based ordering:
- Edge (2, 6): Form a triangle with shared connection 3.
- Edge (0, 8): No triangle formed.

Count the total number of triangles: [1]
List of triangles found: <2, 3, 6>.
