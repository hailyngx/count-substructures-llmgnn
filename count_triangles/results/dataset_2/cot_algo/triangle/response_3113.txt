Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 3) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 14) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. Let's follow the steps given:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections (degree):
   - Vertex 4: degree 4
   - Vertices 7, 10, 13, 5, 6, 0, 14, 3, 2: degree 5
   - Vertices 8, 9, 11, 1, 12: degree 6

2. Relabel the vertices from least to most connections:
   - Vertex 4: new label 0
   - Vertices 7, 10, 13, 5, 6, 0, 14, 3, 2: new labels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
   - Vertices 8, 9, 11, 1, 12: new labels 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

3. Check each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
   - Edge (4, 8): OK (vertex 4 has fewer connections)
     Shared connections: [9, 13, 11] forming the triangle <4, 8, 13>
   - Edge (4, 9): OK (vertex 4 has fewer connections)
     Shared connections: [7, 0, 1] forming the triangle <4, 9, 7>
   - Edge (4, 5): OK (vertex 4 has fewer connections)
     Shared connections: [0, 6, 12] forming the triangle <4, 5, 0>
   - Edge (4, 3): OK (vertex 4 has fewer connections)
     Shared connections: [10, 13, 14] forming the triangle <4, 3, 13>
   - Remaining edges do not qualify for forming triangles.

4. Total number of triangles inside brackets []: [4]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 4.
