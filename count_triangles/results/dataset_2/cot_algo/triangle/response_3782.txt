Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 4) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the nodes by their connections and then looking for shared connections between nodes connected by an edge.

After relabeling the nodes based on their connections, the sorted list of nodes is: 
0 - 4 connections
1 - 4 connections
3 - 4 connections
5 - 5 connections
9 - 5 connections
7 - 6 connections
6 - 6 connections
8 - 6 connections
2 - 7 connections

By examining each edge with the lower labeled node having fewer connections, we can find the triangles:

- Triangle <1, 2, 3> formed by edges (1, 3) and (1, 2)
- Triangle <1, 3, 8> formed by edges (1, 8) and (3, 8)
- Triangle <1, 6, 8> formed by edges (1, 6) and (1, 8)
- Triangle <1, 4, 6> formed by edges (1, 4) and (4, 6)
- Triangle <1, 4, 8> formed by edges (1, 8) and (1, 4)
- Triangle <3, 2, 5> formed by edges (3, 2) and (2, 5)
- Triangle <5, 7, 2> formed by edges (5, 7) and (7, 2)
- Triangle <5, 7, 8> formed by edges (5, 7) and (8, 7)
- Triangle <6, 4, 1> formed by edges (6, 4) and (4, 1)
- Triangle <6, 4, 8> formed by edges (6, 4) and (4, 8)
- Triangle <6, 5, 8> formed by edges (6, 5) and (5, 8)
- Triangle <6, 5, 1> formed by edges (6, 5) and (5, 1)
- Triangle <6, 8, 5> formed by edges (6, 8) and (8, 5)
- Triangle <9, 0, 7> formed by edges (9, 0) and (0, 7)
- Triangle <9, 7, 5> formed by edges (9, 7) and (7, 5)
- Triangle <9, 7, 2> formed by edges (9, 7) and (7, 2)

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [16].
