Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their degrees. Here is the list of nodes with their degrees provided in parentheses:

Node 5 (4), Node 9 (5), Node 10 (4), Node 11 (1), Node 8 (4), Node 13 (5), Node 4 (5), Node 6 (4), Node 0 (4), Node 14 (5), Node 7 (4), Node 12 (2), Node 2 (6), Node 3 (3), Node 1 (5)

Now, we will relabel the nodes according to their degrees in ascending order:

Node 11 (1), Node 12 (2), Node 3 (3), Node 5 (4), Node 10 (4), Node 8 (4), Node 6 (4), Node 0 (4), Node 7 (4), Node 4 (5), Node 9 (5), Node 13 (5), Node 1 (5), Node 14 (5), Node 2 (6)

By following the method of proceeding only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can now evaluate the triangles in the graph. Here is the count of triangles and the unique triangles found:

Total number of triangles: [9]

Unique triangles:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 7, 13>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 7, 13>
<2, 6, 14>
<3, 9, 10>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 9, 14>
<10, 13, 14>
