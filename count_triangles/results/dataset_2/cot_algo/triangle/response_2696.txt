Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's construct the graph and count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Sorted nodes with their corresponding degrees:
0 (4 connections)
7 (3 connections)
4 (4 connections)
8 (3 connections)
1 (4 connections)
3 (4 connections)
2 (4 connections)
9 (4 connections)
6 (4 connections)
5 (7 connections)

Triangles found:
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 5>
<1, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 1>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 1, 5>
<4, 8, 2>
<5, 9, 6>
<5, 9, 1>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [15]
