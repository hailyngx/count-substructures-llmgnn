Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 27) (3, 12) (3, 22) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 25) (15, 14) (2, 29) (2, 12) (2, 21) (29, 2) (29, 25) (29, 23) (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 16) (9, 15) (9, 5) (9, 4) (8, 6) (13, 26) (13, 6) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 22) (27, 3) (27, 12) (27, 4) (0, 21) (0, 17) (0, 26) (20, 23) (20, 10) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 26) (21, 2) (21, 0) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 19) (26, 13) (26, 0) (26, 7) (1, 17) (1, 6) (17, 0) (17, 1) (17, 18) (4, 9) (4, 27) (4, 22) (11, 14) (6, 15) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 1) (10, 20) (10, 23) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 18) (22, 3) (22, 12) (22, 4) (22, 16) (22, 24) (25, 15) (25, 29) (25, 5) (19, 28) (19, 16) (18, 17) (18, 14) (18, 24) (16, 5) (16, 22) (16, 19) (24, 22) (24, 18) (24, 23) (23, 29) (23, 20) (23, 10) (23, 24) 

Response:
The sorted nodes based on their degrees are as follows:
Nodes with 0 connections: [30]
Nodes with 1 connection: [1, 8, 11, 18, 20]
Nodes with 2 connections: [13, 19, 28, 10]
Nodes with 3 connections: [16, 24, 5, 1]
Nodes with 4 connections: [0, 8, 13, 18, 26, 1, 6, 14, 11]
Nodes with 5 connections: [6, 7, 4, 17, 29, 1, 9, 12, 15]
Nodes with 6 connections: [21, 27]
Nodes with 7 connections: [22, 2]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:
- For nodes with 0 connections, no triangles can be formed.
- For nodes with 1 connection, no triangles can be formed.
- For nodes with 2 connections, no triangles can be formed.
- For nodes with 3 connections:
    * Node 16: Using its connections 5, 19, no triangles can be formed.
    * Node 24: Using its connections 18, 22, no triangles can be formed.
    * Node 5: Using its connections 9, 25, no triangles can be formed.
    * Node 1: Using its connections 17, 6, no triangles can be formed.
- For nodes with 4 connections:
    * Nodes 0, 8, 13, 18, 26, 6, 14, 11: No triangles can be formed.
- For nodes with 5 connections:
    * Node 21: Forms a triangle with nodes 2, 29.
    * Node 27: Forms a triangle with nodes 2, 12.
- For nodes with 6 connections:
    * Node 22 forms a triangle with nodes 3, 12.
    * Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 3, 27.
- For nodes with 7 connections:
    * No triangles can be formed.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are: <2, 3, 27>, <2, 12, 27>, <2, 12, 3>, <5, 9, 25>.
