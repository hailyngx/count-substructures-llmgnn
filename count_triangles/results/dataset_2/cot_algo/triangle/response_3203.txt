Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 0) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 4) (3, 9) (3, 13) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 14) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 1)
(1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 14)
(2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 11)
(3, 9) (3, 13)
(4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13)
(5, 2) (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 13)
(6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 10)
(7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 13)
(8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14)
(9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5)
(10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14)
(11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 10)
(12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 10)
(13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 7)
(14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 10)

Next, we will list the nodes by their degrees in ascending order and assign new labels accordingly:

Nodes by degree: 
Node 8 : Degree 2
Node 3 : Degree 2
Node 12 : Degree 2
Node 14 : Degree 2
Node 0 : Degree 4
Node 1 : Degree 4
Node 6 : Degree 4
Node 13 : Degree 4
Node 2 : Degree 4
Node 7 : Degree 5
Node 11 : Degree 4
Node 9 : Degree 5
Node 4 : Degree 5
Node 5 : Degree 5
Node 10 : Degree 6

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 16]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 10, 12>
<0, 10, 6>
<0, 11, 2>
<1, 14, 4>
<2, 11, 5>
<3, 13, 5>
<4, 13, 5>
<4, 9, 13>
<7, 10, 6>
<7, 10, 14>
<7, 10, 8>
<8, 14, 4>
<9, 5, 2>
<9, 5, 11>
