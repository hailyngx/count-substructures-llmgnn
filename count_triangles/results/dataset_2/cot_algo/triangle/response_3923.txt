Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (13, 3) (13, 14) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 14) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 3) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 12) 

Response:
The graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. Next, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections to use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph.

Here is the list of vertices sorted by their degree:
```
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 13: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 10: 3 connections
Vertex 12: 4 connections
Vertex 14: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 6 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 11: 5 connections
Vertex 5: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 6 connections
Vertex 4: 6 connections
```

Now, we will count the triangles by considering each edge and the shared connections between the vertices of each edge.

Count of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles:
```
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 3, 11>
<0, 3, 1>
<0, 4, 12>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 6, 10>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 0>
<3, 13, 14>
<7, 6, 10>
<3, 9, 12>
