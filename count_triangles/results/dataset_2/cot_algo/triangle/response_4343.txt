Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in the given graph. 

By sorting the nodes based on their connections from least to most, we assign labels to the nodes as follows:
Node 5 (degree 5) - Label 0
Node 9 (degree 4) - Label 1
Node 6 (degree 2) - Label 2
Node 1 (degree 5) - Label 3
Node 3 (degree 3) - Label 4
Node 4 (degree 6) - Label 5
Node 8 (degree 4) - Label 6
Node 2 (degree 3) - Label 7
Node 0 (degree 6) - Label 8
Node 7 (degree 3) - Label 9

Based on the edges and the labels assigned, we proceed with counting the triangles. 

The total number of triangles is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 0, 8>
