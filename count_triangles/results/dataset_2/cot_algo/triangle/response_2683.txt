Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges.

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 3), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 5), (4, 1), (4, 6), (7, 9), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 1), (7, 8), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 2), (0, 9), (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 1), (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 7), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 1), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 8), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 8)

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method by sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Node: 0 (Degree: 4)
Node: 2 (Degree: 4)
Node: 6 (Degree: 4)
Node: 3 (Degree: 5)
Node: 1 (Degree: 6)
Node: 9 (Degree: 6)
Node: 4 (Degree: 6)
Node: 7 (Degree: 6)
Node: 5 (Degree: 6)
Node: 8 (Degree: 7)

Comparing each edge with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections, we find the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 9, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 12]
