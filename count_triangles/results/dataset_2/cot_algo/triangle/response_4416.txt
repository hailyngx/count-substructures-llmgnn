Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (2, 9), (2, 4), (8, 9), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 3), (9, 2), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 1), (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 7), (6, 0), (6, 8), (6, 1), (6, 7), (3, 0), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 4), (7, 8), (7, 1), (7, 6), (7, 3), (7, 5), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 7), (5, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5)

Next, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes with degrees: 
0 (3), 1 (4), 2 (2), 3 (5), 4 (4), 5 (4), 6 (4), 7 (5), 8 (5), 9 (6)

Now, we will re-label the nodes according to their degrees:
Node with the least connections will be labeled as 0, the next as 1, and so on.

Nodes after re-labeling:
2 (0), 0 (1), 1 (2), 5 (3), 4 (4), 6 (5), 7 (6), 3 (7), 8 (8), 9 (9)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

Triangles: 
<0, 1, 3>, <1, 3, 4>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
