Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 13) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 11) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 1) (14, 4) (14, 9) (14, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections. After relabeling the vertices according to their degree, we can begin counting the triangles. 

Here is the list of edges with the labeled vertices based on their degree (from least connected to most connected):

Edges:
(4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) 
(7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) 
(6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) 
(12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (5, 7) (5, 6) 
(5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) 
(2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) 
(8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (0, 12) (0, 2) 
(0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) 
(3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 13) 
(13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 11) (10, 2) (10, 8) 
(10, 0) (10, 1) (14, 4) (14, 9) (14, 1) 
(1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 14)

Now, let's find the triangles by checking the shared connections between vertices of each edge. The total number of triangles in this graph is [10].

Unique triangles found:
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 8, 10>
<2, 8, 0>
<2, 10, 0>
<2, 10, 1>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 8, 0>
<5, 8, 10>
<5, 11, 3>
<8, 9, 11>
