Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 7), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 1), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 1),... and so on.

Next, we sort the vertices based on their degree:
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 6
Node 5: Degree 6
Node 1: Degree 7
Node 4: Degree 7

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles and list them:
Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 2>, <3, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 1>, <3, 2, 4>, <7, 4, 1>, <7, 1, 5>, <7, 5, 6>
