Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 6) (5, 1) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 8) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (3, 6) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and connections:

0: 4, 10, 14, 1  
1: 6, 7, 5, 0, 2, 13  
2: 4, 7, 10, 12, 1, 13  
3: 6  
4: 7, 12, 0, 11, 2  
5: 6, 1  
6: 5, 1, 14, 10, 3  
7: 4, 10, 2, 1  
8: 11, 14, 12  
9: 14, 12  
10: 6, 7, 11, 0, 2  
11: 4, 10, 14, 8, 12  
12: 9, 4, 11, 8, 2  
13: 1, 2  
14: 6, 9, 11, 0, 8  

Using the degree-based ordering method, the vertices are relabeled from 0 to 14 as follows:

0: 3  
1: 5  
2: 6  
3: 0  
4: 4  
5: 1  
6: 9  
7: 7  
8: 13  
9: 8  
10: 2  
11: 10  
12: 12  
13: 11  
14: 14  

Now, we will count the triangles:

Triangles: [41]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 12>, <0, 4, 14>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 10>, <0, 4, 11>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 12, 9>, <0, 12, 11>, <0, 12, 8>, <0, 11, 14>, <0, 11, 8>, <0, 11, 12>, <0, 11, 10>, <0, 14, 8>, <0, 14, 11>, <0, 14, 1>, <0, 14, 10>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 10, 2>, <0, 10, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 13>, <1, 6, 13>, <4, 7, 2>, <4, 7, 10>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 2, 13>, <4, 2, 1>, <4, 10, 7>, <4, 10, 11>, <4, 10, 2>, <4, 11, 8>, <4, 11, 12>, <4, 12, 9>, <4, 12, 11>, <4, 12, 8>, <7, 10, 2>
