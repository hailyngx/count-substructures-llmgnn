Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 0) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then we relabel the vertices accordingly. 

Here is the sorted list of vertices with their degrees:
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 6
- Node 13: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 6
- Node 8: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 6

Now, we will count the triangles by examining each edge in the graph. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Calculating the total number of triangles, we find that there are [14] triangles. 

The unique triangles found are:
- <7, 0, 12>
- <9, 2, 11>
- <8, 0, 13>
- <6, 4, 14>
- <1, 3, 11>
- <10, 6, 14>
- <1, 11, 3>
- <4, 6, 14>
- <5, 2, 13>
- <10, 2, 6>
- <10, 14, 4>
- <0, 7, 12>
- <2, 4, 11>
- <13, 0, 8>
