Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 0), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 8), (8, 9), (8, 2), (8, 3), (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 0), (1, 7), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 0), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 1), (0, 9), (0, 6), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 0)

Next, we need to sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 1: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 0: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 9: degree 5
Node 5: degree 6

Now, let's count the triangles:
1. (1, 6) - shared neighbor: 0 => Triangle: <0, 1, 6>
2. (1, 7) - shared neighbor: None
3. (1, 9) - shared neighbor: None
4. (1, 0) - shared neighbor: None
5. (6, 7) - shared neighbor: None
6. (6, 3) - shared neighbor: None
7. (6, 4) - shared neighbor: None
8. (6, 0) - shared neighbor: None
9. (2, 8) - shared neighbor: 9 => Triangle: <2, 8, 9>
10. (2, 9) - shared neighbor: None
11. (5, 4) - shared neighbor: None
12. (5, 7) - shared neighbor: None
13. (5, 3) - shared neighbor: None
14. (5, 9) - shared neighbor: None

Total number of triangles: [2]

Triangles found: <0, 1, 6>, <2, 8, 9>
