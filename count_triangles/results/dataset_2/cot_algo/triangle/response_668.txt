Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 19) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 19) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 18) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 6) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 7) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 7) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (3, 19) (3, 4) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 2) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 1) (4, 3) (4, 14) (12, 10) (12, 18) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 12) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 1) (0, 17) (0, 19) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 3) (19, 0) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 4) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 6) 

Response:
The graph consists of 20 nodes and 60 edges. Let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 12: 2 connections
Vertex 17: 4 connections
Vertex 18: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 11: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 13: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 10: 4 connections
Vertex 14: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 6 connections
Vertex 15: 6 connections
Vertex 16: 4 connections
Vertex 19: 5 connections

Now, we will go through the edges to count the triangles:

1. Triangles involving Vertex 0:
   - None

2. Triangles involving Vertex 3:
   - None

3. Triangles involving Vertex 4:

6. Triangles involving Vertex 12:
   - None

7. Triangles involving Vertex 17:
   - None

8. Triangles involving Vertex 18:
   - None

9. Triangles involving Vertex 5:
   - None

10. Triangles involving Vertex 11:
   - None

11. Triangles involving Vertex 6:
   - <6, 1, 15>

12. Triangles involving Vertex 1:
   - <1, 6, 15>

13. Triangles involving Vertex 13:
   - <13, 15, 8>

14. Triangles involving Vertex 2:
   - <2, 17, 1> 

15. Triangles involving Vertex 10:
   - None

16. Triangles involving Vertex 14:

17. Triangles involving Vertex 8:
   - <8, 13, 15>

18. Triangles involving Vertex 15:
   - <15, 13, 8>

19. Triangles involving Vertex 16:
   - None

20. Triangles involving Vertex 19:
   - None

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [9]

The unique triangles found are: <6, 1, 15>, <1, 6, 15>, <13, 15, 8>, <2, 17, 1>, <14, 6, 4>, <8, 13, 15>, <15, 13, 8>
