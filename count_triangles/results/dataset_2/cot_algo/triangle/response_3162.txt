Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the triangles in the given graph:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 5: degree 5
Node 9: degree 5
Node 1: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 2: degree 5
Node 0: degree 4
Node 7: degree 6
Node 6: degree 4

We will start counting triangles based on the edges provided. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found:
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <2, 0, 5>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <5, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
