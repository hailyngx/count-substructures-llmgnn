Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 22) (15, 25) (15, 24) (6, 9) (6, 26) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 20) (7, 21) (7, 25) (21, 7) (21, 26) (21, 11) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 29) (11, 21) (11, 10) (11, 5) (12, 10) (12, 27) (12, 18) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 17) (19, 8) (19, 20) (26, 6) (26, 21) (26, 5) (26, 2) (1, 17) (1, 28) (1, 24) (1, 4) (17, 27) (17, 1) (17, 0) (4, 27) (4, 1) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 0) (25, 15) (25, 7) (16, 29) (16, 23) (28, 1) (28, 8) (28, 14) (8, 19) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 24) (22, 3) (22, 4) (5, 11) (5, 26) (5, 2) (2, 26) (2, 5) (2, 20) (2, 14) (2, 0) (24, 15) (24, 1) (24, 8) (14, 28) (14, 8) (14, 2) (29, 10) (29, 16) (13, 4) (13, 23) (13, 0) (13, 18) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) (18, 12) (18, 13) (20, 9) (20, 19) (20, 2) (20, 23) (23, 16) (23, 13) (23, 20) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows: 
Node 16 has 2 connections.
Nodes 5, 10, 15, 19, 22, 28, 29 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 0, 1, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 24, 25, 26, 27 have 4 connections each.
Nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23 have 5 connections each.

Proceeding with the given edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
<5, 11> shared connection with 26 forms a triangle: <5, 11, 26>
<5, 26> shared connection with 2 forms a triangle: <5, 26, 2>
<10, 11> shared connection with 21 forms a triangle: <10, 11, 21>
<9, 20> shared connection with 6 forms a triangle: <9, 20, 6>
<9, 20> shared connection with 19 forms a triangle: <9, 20, 19>
<9, 20> shared connection with 2 forms a triangle: <9, 20, 2>
<9, 6> shared connection with 26 forms a triangle: <9, 6, 26>
<9, 6> shared connection with 3 forms a triangle: <9, 6, 3>
<9, 6> shared connection with 22 forms a triangle: <9, 6, 22>
<24, 1> shared connection with 14 forms a triangle: <24, 1, 14>
<24, 1> shared connection with 8 forms a triangle: <24, 1, 8>
<24, 15> shared connection with 25 forms a triangle: <24, 15, 25>
<24, 8> shared connection with 19 forms a triangle: <24, 8, 19>
<20, 2> shared connection with 0 forms a triangle: <20, 2, 0>

Total number of triangles inside brackets []: [14]
