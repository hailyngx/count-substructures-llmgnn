Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 6) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 6) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 14) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented with the following nodes and edges:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]

Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 11), (5, 3), (5, 14), 
(9, 14), (9, 7), (9, 0), (9, 12), 
(4, 13), (4, 1), (4, 3), 
(7, 9), (7, 3), (7, 2), 
(1, 3), (1, 14), (1, 10), (1, 0), (1, 8), 
(3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 13), (3, 12), 
(10, 0), (10, 6), (10, 8), 
(11, 14), (11, 6), 
(8, 10), (8, 2), (8, 6), 
(12, 3), (12, 0), 
(2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 14), 
(13, 4), (13, 3), 
(0, 1), (0, 10), (0, 12), 
(6, 11), (6, 8)

Next, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:

Nodes sorted by degree: 
[5, 4, 7, 11, 14, 13, 6, 12, 2, 0, 10, 8, 9, 1, 3]

Now, we can start counting the triangles. 

Triangles: 
[28]

Unique triangles:
<5, 9, 14>, <5, 3, 14>, <5, 11, 14>, <5, 9, 11>, <5, 9, 3>, <5, 3, 13>, <5, 4, 13>, <5, 3, 4>, <7, 9, 3>, <7, 9, 2>, <7, 3, 2>, <1, 3, 14>, <1, 3, 0>, <1, 10, 0>, <1, 10, 8>, <3, 4, 13>, <3, 4, 12>, <3, 12, 0>, <3, 7, 2>, <10, 6, 8>, <11, 6, 8>, <12, 0, 9>, <12, 0, 3>, <12, 9, 3>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 14>, <13, 4, 3>
