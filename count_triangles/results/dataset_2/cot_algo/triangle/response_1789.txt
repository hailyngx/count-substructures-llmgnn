Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 21) (9, 3) (8, 28) (8, 10) (8, 25) (13, 23) (13, 14) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 29) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 28) (15, 6) (15, 20) (15, 28) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 14) (7, 27) (12, 7) (12, 29) (11, 2) (28, 8) (28, 20) (28, 15) (28, 18) (25, 8) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 19) (25, 22) (1, 6) (1, 14) (3, 9) (3, 21) (3, 29) (21, 9) (21, 3) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 10) (2, 6) (2, 11) (23, 13) (23, 5) (23, 18) (26, 0) (26, 25) (26, 29) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 1) (5, 23) (5, 4) (19, 25) (19, 4) (19, 17) (17, 19) (17, 22) (18, 28) (18, 23) (24, 29) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 19) (29, 0) (29, 12) (29, 3) (29, 26) (29, 24) (27, 20) (27, 7) (27, 10) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 27) (10, 22) (22, 25) (22, 16) (22, 17) (22, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method aims to count triangles efficiently in a graph.

After arranging the nodes by their degree in increasing order, we have:
Nodes: 16, 18, 24, 5, 13, 11, 21, 4, 12, 1, 3, 7, 19, 0, 2, 14, 6, 9, 15, 23, 27, 17, 29, 25, 8, 10, 20, 22, 28, 26

Now, checking the edges, we will only consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (6, 9)
- Edge (6, 1)
- Edge (6, 15)
- Edge (6, 2)
- Edge (8, 28)
- Edge (13, 23)
- Edge (0, 20)
- Edge (7, 12)
- Edge (11, 2)
- Edge (16, 0)
- Edge (5, 23)
- Edge (17, 19)
- Edge (18, 28)
- Edge (24, 29)

Counting the triangles formed by these edges, we find:
1. <6, 9, 4>
2. <6, 1, 14>
3. <6, 15, 20>
4. <6, 2, 11>
5. <8, 28, 18>
6. <13, 23, 5>
7. <0, 20, 15>
8. <7, 12, 29>
9. <11, 2, 6>
10. <16, 0, 20>
11. <5, 23, 13>
12. <17, 19, 4>
13. <18, 28, 8>
14. <24, 29, 27>

Therefore, there are [14] triangles in the given graph.
