Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: 3, 5, 6, 9
- 1: 2, 3, 4, 8
- 2: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8
- 3: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8
- 4: 1, 6, 9
- 5: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7
- 6: 0, 2, 4, 5
- 7: 5, 9
- 8: 1, 2, 3, 9
- 9: 0, 4, 7, 8

Next, we apply the Degree-Based Ordering method. Sorting the nodes by their degree:

Nodes: 7, 0, 6, 8, 4, 1, 5, 2, 9, 3

Now, we will count the triangles based on the edge connections:

- For the edge (1, 2): no triangles
- For the edge (0, 3): triangle <0, 3, 5>
- For the edge (6, 0): triangle <0, 6, 5>
- For the edge (8, 9): no triangles
- For the edge (4, 9): no triangles
- For the edge (1, 4): no triangles
- For the edge (4, 6): triangle <4, 6, 5>
- For the edge (8, 1): triangle <8, 1, 3>

Counting the total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 6, 5>, <8, 1, 3>
