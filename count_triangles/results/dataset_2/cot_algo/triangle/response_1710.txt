Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 9) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 14) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (5, 12, 3, 9, 1)
- 1: (7, 6, 12, 9, 14)
- 2: (11, 13, 14)
- 3: (4, 7, 0, 9)
- 4: (12, 10, 3)
- 5: (7, 10, 6, 0)
- 6: (11, 13, 5, 1)
- 7: (3, 5, 1)
- 8: (10, 13, 9, 12)
- 9: (8, 0, 14, 3, 1)
- 10: (5, 4, 12, 8, 13)
- 11: (14, 6, 2)
- 12: (4, 10, 8, 0, 1)
- 13: (10, 8, 2, 6)
- 14: (11, 9, 1, 2)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree from least to most connected:
Nodes in degree-based order: 2, 8, 11, 5, 6, 4, 7, 13, 0, 1, 14, 9, 3, 12, 10

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will count the triangles by traversing the edges and looking for shared connections.  

The total number of triangles in the graph is: [17]

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 5, 7>
<0, 1, 12>
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 6, 11>
<1, 9, 14>
<2, 11, 14>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 9, 14>
<3, 4, 7>
<6, 11, 13>
<8, 10, 12>
<8, 10, 13>
<8, 12, 13>
<8, 9, 12>
<8, 9, 13>
