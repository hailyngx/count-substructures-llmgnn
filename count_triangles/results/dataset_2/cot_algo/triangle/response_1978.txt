Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 3) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 13) (5, 14) (5, 1) (5, 10) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 10) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 12) 

Response:
The graph is as follows after sorting the nodes by their degree:
```
Nodes: 9, 14, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 3, 7, 1, 12, 0, 6, 8, 13
Edges: (9, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (2, 4) (5, 14) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 2) (3, 2) (3, 11) (7, 4) (1, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 6) (13, 3)
```

After checking for shared connections between nodes connected by edges with the lowest labeled node having fewer connections, we find the triangles:
- <0, 6, 7>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 3, 2>
- <0, 3, 11>
- <0, 13, 3>
- <4, 7, 1>
- <4, 14, 5>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <3, 2, 11>
- <5, 10, 8>
- <10, 8, 11>
- <3, 13, 12>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [12].
