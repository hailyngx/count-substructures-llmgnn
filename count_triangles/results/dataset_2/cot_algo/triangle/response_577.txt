Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 27) (4, 22) (4, 29) (7, 0) (7, 29) (7, 20) (7, 14) (10, 21) (10, 14) (17, 22) (17, 18) (0, 7) (0, 20) (0, 5) (20, 7) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 5) (24, 26) (24, 1) (24, 19) (24, 2) (26, 24) (26, 2) (26, 25) (27, 4) (27, 25) (16, 1) (16, 25) (28, 22) (28, 2) (28, 23) (21, 10) (21, 9) (21, 14) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 16) (25, 13) (25, 29) (22, 4) (22, 17) (22, 28) (2, 24) (2, 26) (2, 28) (2, 6) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 9) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 13) (19, 24) (19, 15) (19, 9) (5, 0) (5, 20) (23, 28) (23, 29) (3, 20) (29, 4) (29, 7) (29, 25) (29, 23) (29, 14) (9, 21) (9, 12) (9, 19) (9, 11) (1, 24) (1, 16) (1, 18) (13, 25) (13, 15) (13, 11) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 6) (11, 12) (11, 9) (11, 13) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 18) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 21) (14, 29) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Nodes sorted by their degree:
(1) 19 - degree 3
(2) 16, 17, 27 - degree 1
(3) 18, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28 - degree 2
(4) 0, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 15, 21, 29 - degree 4
(5) 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 20 - degree 3

Counting triangles:
- Triangle <0, 4, 29>
- Triangle <0, 5, 20>
- Triangle <0, 7, 29>
- Triangle <2, 24, 26>
- Triangle <3, 20, 29>
- Triangle <4, 7, 29>
- Triangle <9, 12, 15>
- Triangle <9, 19, 24>
- Triangle <10, 14, 21>
- Triangle <13, 15, 25>
- Triangle <18, 1, 24>
- Triangle <18, 6, 15>
- Triangle <18, 6, 18>
- Triangle <18, 6, 2>
- Triangle <19, 9, 24>
- Triangle <21, 10, 14>
- Triangle <25, 13, 15>
- Triangle <25, 26, 2>
- Triangle <25, 26, 24>
- Triangle <25, 27, 4>
- Triangle <25, 27, 25>

Total number of triangles: [20]
