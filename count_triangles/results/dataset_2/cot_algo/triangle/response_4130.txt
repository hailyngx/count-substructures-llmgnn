Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0)
