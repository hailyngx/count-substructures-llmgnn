Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 10) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 9) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
- 0: 5, 2, 3, 11, 12
- 1: 4, 7, 9
- 2: 8, 12, 13, 0
- 3: 8, 6, 7, 0, 14
- 4: 8, 9, 10, 1, 6
- 5: 8, 0, 10
- 6: 4, 7, 3
- 7: 6, 3, 10, 9, 1
- 8: 4, 5, 10, 14, 3, 2
- 9: 4, 11, 7, 1, 10
- 10: 4, 5, 12, 7, 9
- 11: 0, 9
- 12: 2, 13, 10, 0
- 13: 2, 12, 14
- 14: 8, 3, 13

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Sorted nodes: 13, 11, 1, 6, 5, 7, 10, 12, 2, 9, 0, 3, 14, 4, 8
