Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 12) (15, 2) (7, 19) (7, 5) (12, 15) (12, 1) (2, 3) (2, 15) (8, 1) (1, 12) (1, 8) (9, 10) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 18) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 14) (16, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 18) (11, 17) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 13) (17, 16) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 4) (14, 16) (14, 10) (14, 19) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 13) (4, 10) (4, 17) (18, 0) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 16) (5, 17) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 19) (13, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles in the given graph:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
   Vertices: 8, 9, 11, 12, 4, 7, 0, 1, 3, 15, 2, 16, 6, 14, 18, 10, 5, 17, 19, 13

2. Relabel the vertices:
   Vertices: 0(1), 1(2), 2(3), 3(4), 4(5), 5(6), 6(7), 7(8), 8(9), 9(10), 10(11), 11(12), 12(13), 13(14), 14(15), 15(16), 16(17), 17(18), 18(19), 19(20)

3. Count the triangles:
   - For each edge, only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
   - Check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to form triangles.

After examining the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles found is [9]. 

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 10, 14>, <0, 10, 16>, <0, 13, 18>, <3, 5, 17>, <4, 10, 17>, <6, 13, 18>, <10, 13, 19>, <14, 16, 17>
