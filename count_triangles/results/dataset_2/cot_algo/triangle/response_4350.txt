Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 7) (15, 9) (4, 14) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 13) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 18) (5, 10) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 16) (1, 14) (1, 13) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 2) (13, 7) (13, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 18) (16, 9) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 11) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 19) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 11) (12, 3) (12, 0) (11, 18) (11, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections, assigning new labels accordingly, and finding triangles using this approach.

After sorting the vertices by their degree, we have the following labels for the 20 nodes:

Node 0: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 2
Node 12: Degree 2
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 4
Node 15: Degree 2
Node 16: Degree 4
Node 17: Degree 4
Node 18: Degree 4
Node 19: Degree 4

Now, let's look at the given edges and count the number of triangles formed:

Total number of triangles: [15]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 12>
<0, 3, 16>
<2, 3, 19>
<2, 5, 17>
<5, 6, 16>
<5, 6, 19>
<7, 13, 1>
<7, 15, 9>
<8, 14, 1>
<10, 17, 2>
<11, 9, 18>
<13, 7, 15>
<14, 8, 1>
<16, 18, 11>
