Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 15) (7, 3) (7, 16) (7, 5) (12, 5) (12, 15) (4, 8) (4, 10) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 0) (0, 8) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 19) (17, 8) (17, 11) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 15) (10, 16) (10, 14) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 11) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 16) (16, 2) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 19) (11, 13) (11, 17) (11, 15) (11, 19) (5, 7) (5, 12) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method aims to count triangles in the graph efficiently. 

First, we need to sort the vertices by their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order:

Nodes: 0 - 1 connection
Nodes: 4, 5, 17, 18 - 2 connections
Nodes: 7, 12, 16, 19 - 3 connections
Nodes: 1, 6, 11 - 4 connections
Nodes: 3, 13 - 5 connections
Nodes: 10, 15 - 5 connections
Nodes: 2, 8, 9 - 6 connections
Nodes: 14 - 7 connections

Next, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Let's check these edges for shared connections:

- Edge (6, 14): Shared connection with node 2 -> Triangle <2, 6, 14>
- Edge (6, 3): Shared connection with node 7 -> Triangle <3, 6, 7>
- Edge (9, 8): No shared connections
- Edge (9, 1): No shared connections
- Edge (9, 13): Shared connection with node 2 -> Triangle <2, 9, 13>
- Edge (1, 9): No shared connections

- Edge (13, 19): No shared connections
- Edge (17, 8): No shared connections

- Edge (10, 16): Shared connection with nodes 2, 7 -> Triangles <2, 10, 16>, <7, 10, 16>
- Edge (10, 14): Shared connection with nodes 2, 16 -> Triangles <2, 10, 14>, <10, 14, 16>
- Edge (15, 18): Shared connection with node 2 -> Triangle <2, 15, 18>

- Edge (19, 16): Shared connection with nodes 2, 10 -> Triangle <2, 10, 19>
- Edge (16, 2): Shared connection with nodes 10, 14 -> Triangles <2, 10, 16>, <2, 14, 16>
- Edge (16, 7): Shared connection with node 10 -> Triangle <7, 10, 16>

- Edge (11, 13): Shared connection with node 15 -> Triangle <11, 13, 15>
- Edge (11, 17): No shared connections
- Edge (11, 15): Shared connection with node 13 -> Triangle <11, 13, 15>
- Edge (11, 19): Shared connection with node 13 -> Triangle <11, 13, 19>

- Edge (14, 2): Shared connection with nodes 10, 13 -> Triangles <2, 13, 14>, <2, 10, 14>
- Edge (14, 10): Shared connection with nodes 2, 16 -> Triangles <2, 10, 14>, <10, 14, 16>

Based on the analysis above, we have found the following unique triangles:
<2, 6, 14>, <3, 6, 7>, <2, 9, 13>, <2, 10, 16>, <2, 10, 14>, <2, 15, 18>, <7, 10, 16>, <2, 4, 10>, <13, 15, 11>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
