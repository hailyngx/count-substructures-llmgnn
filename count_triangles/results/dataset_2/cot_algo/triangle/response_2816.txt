Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 11) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 0) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 12) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) 
(9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) 
(4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 3) 
(7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) 
(8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 0) 
(13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) 
(6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 12) 
(3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) 
(11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) 
(14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 11) 
(1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) 
(2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 10) 
(12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 0) 
(10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) 
(0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 12)

Next, let's construct the Degree-Based Ordering as follows:
Nodes by degree: {2, 10, 13, 14, 6, 12, 3, 11, 7, 8, 0, 1, 5, 9, 4}

Now, counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
[17]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 1, 11>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 10>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 14>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 12>
<0, 8, 13>
<1, 5, 9>
