Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections. Then, for each edge, we check if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections before proceeding. 

After sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections, the labels are as follows: 
Node 0 (Degree 2)  
Node 2 (Degree 4)  
Node 7 (Degree 4)  
Node 3 (Degree 4)  
Node 8 (Degree 4)  
Node 6 (Degree 4)  
Node 9 (Degree 4)  
Node 1 (Degree 5)  
Node 5 (Degree 5)  
Node 4 (Degree 7)  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering the edges of the graph, we can find the number of triangles and list the unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [8]  
Unique triangles:  
<1, 3, 4>  
<1, 4, 7>  
<1, 4, 5>  
<1, 4, 6>  
<1, 4, 9>  
<3, 4, 7>  
<3, 4, 9>  
<4, 6, 7>
