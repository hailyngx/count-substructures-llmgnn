Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 13) (11, 5) (11, 9) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 10) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 1) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 
- 0: 8, 6, 2, 1
- 1: 8, 2, 0, 10, 12
- 2: 4, 0, 1, 3, 7
- 3: 6, 2, 13
- 4: 9, 13, 14, 2
- 5: 6, 13, 12, 11, 14
- 6: 5, 10, 3, 12, 0
- 7: 2, 14, 10
- 8: 10, 0, 12, 1
- 9: 4, 11, 14
- 10: 8, 6, 7, 1
- 11: 5, 9
- 12: 8, 5, 6, 14, 1
- 13: 5, 4, 3
- 14: 5, 9, 4, 7, 12

Now, we count the number of triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method: 

Triangles: [16]

Unique Triangles:
<5, 6, 10>
<6, 5, 12>
<4, 2, 14>
<5, 12, 14>
<3, 2, 6>
<9, 4, 14>
<9, 11, 5>
<0, 1, 8>
<1, 8, 12>
<2, 7, 14>
<2, 0, 8>
<2, 1, 10>
<10, 7, 14>
<10, 6, 8>
<6, 0, 2>
<1, 10, 12>
