Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 9) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 3) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 9) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 9) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. 

Here is the list of unique triangles found in the given graph <0, 3, 6>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 6, 10>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 10>, <1, 6, 13>, <1, 6, 0>, <1, 10, 6>, <3, 0, 6>, <3, 0, 7>, <3, 0, 8>, <3, 7, 4>, <3, 7, 11>.

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
