Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
Nodes sorted by degree (number of connections):
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 6
