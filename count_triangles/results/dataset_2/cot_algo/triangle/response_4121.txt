```

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The triangles found in the graph are:
- <1, 25, 29>
- <1, 25, 28>
- <3, 11, 22>
- <3, 19, 23>
- <3, 19, 17>
- <4, 8, 15>
- <4, 10, 22>
- <4, 10, 12>
- <4, 24, 15>
- <5, 23, 22>
- <5, 23, 19>
- <6, 14, 2>
- <7, 9, 0>
- <7, 9, 13>
- <9, 16, 19>
- <10, 12, 20>
- <13, 21, 28>
- <17, 19, 23>
- <17, 19, 16>
- <18, 13, 0>
- <20, 27, 26>
- <24, 4, 15>
