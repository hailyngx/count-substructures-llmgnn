Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 0), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 0), 
(4, 3), (7, 9), (7, 0), (7, 3), (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 8), (3, 4), 
(3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 8), (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 2), (6, 5), (6, 1), 
(6, 2), (6, 0), (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 6), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 4), 
(0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 6)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method where we sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes by degree: [4, 5, 7, 3, 6, 8, 1, 2, 0, 9]

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph:

Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
