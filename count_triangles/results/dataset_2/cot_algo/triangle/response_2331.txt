Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 11) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 2) (1, 10) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 11) (13, 3) (13, 9) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 4) (15, 10) (15, 16) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 14) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 12) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 3) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 12) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 4) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 8) (11, 19) (14, 9) (14, 16) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 3) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the given nodes and edges, and the vertices have been relabeled based on their degree:

Vertices: 
0(4), 1(2), 2(4), 3(3), 4(4), 5(1), 6(2), 7(4), 8(4), 9(3), 10(4), 11(4), 12(5), 13(2), 14(2), 15(2), 16(3), 17(3), 18(2), 19(3)

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [26]
Unique Triangles:
<0, 3, 12>
<0, 8, 12>
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 12, 16>
<0, 12, 3>
<0, 12, 8>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 10, 4>
<1, 2, 10>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 10>
<2, 4, 3>
<2, 4, 1>
<2, 7, 6>
<2, 7, 10>
<3, 4, 12>
<3, 4, 16>
<4, 10, 7>
<8, 12, 3>
<8, 12, 11>
<8, 12, 0>
<9, 13, 14>
<11, 17, 19>
<12, 16, 14>
