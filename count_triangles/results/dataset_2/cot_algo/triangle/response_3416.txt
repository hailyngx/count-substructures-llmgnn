Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 12) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 5) (10, 17) (10, 2) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 13) (12, 16) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 13) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 15) (8, 17) (8, 18) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 14) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 9) (9, 15) (9, 18) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 9) (3, 6) (3, 13) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 0) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) 

Response:
The graph presented has 20 nodes and 60 edges. Let's start by determining the triangle count using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

First, let's sort the nodes by their degree:
0: 3 connections
1: 1 connection
2: 4 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 3 connections
9: 2 connections
10: 2 connections
11: 3 connections
12: 4 connections
13: 3 connections
14: 3 connections
15: 3 connections
16: 2 connections
17: 4 connections
18: 3 connections
19: 3 connections

Now, let's label the nodes according to their degree:
1: 1 connection
16: 2 connections
10: 2 connections
9: 2 connections
19: 3 connections
14: 3 connections
0: 3 connections
8: 3 connections
11: 3 connections
13: 3 connections
15: 3 connections
18: 3 connections
12: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
17: 4 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 4 connections
7: 4 connections
3: 4 connections

Now, let's count the triangles by considering only the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- Triangles: 17
- Unique triangles:
<2, 6, 12>
<2, 6, 13>
<2, 6, 3>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 12, 13>
<2, 12, 17>
<2, 12, 7>
<2, 13, 3>
<2, 13, 12>
<2, 13, 7>
<6, 12, 13>
<6, 12, 7>
<6, 13, 3>
<6, 13, 7>
<12, 13, 7>
<3, 6, 13>
<3, 13, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
