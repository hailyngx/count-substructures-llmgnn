Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:  

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Edges:  
- 0: (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6)  
- 1: (8, 4), (8, 9), (8, 5), (8, 3), (8, 1), (8, 7)  
- 2: (5, 4), (5, 8), (5, 2)  
- 3: (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 0)  
- 4: (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 9)  
- 5: (7, 8), (7, 1)  
- 6: (9, 4), (9, 8), (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3)  
- 7: (1, 8), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 2)  
- 8: (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 9)  
- 9: (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 1)  

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:  

Nodes sorted by degree:  
7, 2, 5, 3, 6, 9, 0, 1, 8, 4  

Relabeled nodes:  
0 → 8, 1 → 2, 2 → 5, 3 → 3, 4 → 6, 5 → 9, 6 → 0, 7 → 1, 8 → 7, 9 → 4  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:  

Triangles found:  
<1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <7, 8, 9>  

Total number of triangles: [7]
