Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
By arranging the nodes and their connections:

Nodes: 

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 

(0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7)

(1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 9)

(2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9)

(3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9)

(4, 3), (4, 7)

(5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 7), (5, 9)

(6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3)

(7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 5)

(8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 9)

(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 8)

By sorting the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes with the least connections:
4, 8, 6, 7, 0, 1, 9, 2, 3, 5

Now, let's count the number of triangles: 

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found: 

<0, 1, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
