Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, the new labels are as follows:
Vertices in increasing order of connections: 8, 5, 9, 6, 3, 2, 7, 0, 1, 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, considering only edges where the vertex with the lesser label has fewer connections:
1. Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 (Labeled as 8) has fewer connections.
   Shared connections with Vertex 8 (Labeled as 1): None

2. Edge (5, 9): Vertex 5 (Labeled as 5) has fewer connections.
   Shared connections with Vertex 9 (Labeled as 3): None

3. Edge (5, 2): Vertex 5 (Labeled as 5) has fewer connections.
   Shared connections with Vertex 2 (Labeled as 6): None

4. Edge (5, 4): Vertex 5 (Labeled as 5) has fewer connections.
   Shared connections with Vertex 4 (Labeled as 10): None

5. Edge (5, 0): Vertex 5 (Labeled as 5) has fewer connections.
   Shared connections with Vertex 0 (Labeled as 7): None

6. Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 (Labeled as 5) has fewer connections.
   Shared connections with Vertex 7 (Labeled as 6): (4)

7. Edge (6, 1): Vertex 6 (Labeled as 4) has fewer connections.
   Shared connections with Vertex 1 (Labeled as 8): None

8. Edge (6, 3): Vertex 6 (Labeled as 4) has fewer connections.
   Shared connections with Vertex 3 (Labeled as 5): None

9. Edge (6, 4): Vertex 6 (Labeled as 4) has fewer connections.
   Shared connections with Vertex 4 (Labeled as 10): (0, 1)

10. Edge (1, 0): Vertex 1 (Labeled as 8) has fewer connections.
   Shared connections with Vertex 0 (Labeled as 7): None

After going through the edges, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1], and the unique triangle found is <4, 0, 1>.
