Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 16) (15, 10) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 0) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 1) (17, 9) (17, 10) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (18, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 11) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 16) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 8) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 19) (16, 3) (16, 6) (16, 14) (16, 13) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 19) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 11) (8, 5) (8, 1) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 8) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 

Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 18: 2 connections
Vertex 12: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 15: 2 connections
Vertex 14: 2 connections
Vertex 17: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 19: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 13: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 5 connections
Vertex 11: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 0: 5 connections
Vertex 10: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 6 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now examine the edges with the vertex having the lower label having fewer connections: 
<3, 10> has 0 shared connections.
<3, 16> has 0 shared connections.
<15, 10> has 2 shared connections: 10, 1 (forming triangle <15, 10, 1>).
