Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 11) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 17) (12, 13) (12, 7) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 15) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 16) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (10, 5) (10, 9) (15, 2) (15, 14) (15, 19) (17, 13) (17, 7) (17, 2) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 18) (4, 9) (4, 3) (18, 19) (18, 11) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 6) (16, 9) (16, 2) (16, 14) (3, 6) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 18) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 10), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 11), (9, 10), (9, 16), (8, 13), 
(8, 2), (8, 19), (8, 6), (13, 8), (13, 17), (13, 12), (13, 11), 
(7, 12), (7, 19), (7, 1), (7, 17), (12, 13), (12, 7), (2, 8), (2, 16), 
(2, 17), (2, 15), (0, 14), (14, 0), (14, 1), (14, 15), (14, 16), 
(6, 8), (6, 1), (6, 3), (10, 5), (10, 9), (15, 2), (15, 14), 
(15, 19), (17, 13), (17, 7), (17, 2), (19, 8), (19, 7), (19, 15), 
(19, 18), (4, 9), (4, 3), (18, 19), (18, 11), (1, 7), (1, 14), 
(1, 6), (16, 9), (16, 2), (16, 14), (3, 6), (3, 4), (11, 9), 
(11, 13), (11, 18)

Next, we will reorder the nodes by their degree:
0 (degree 2)
3 (degree 2)
5 (degree 2)
10 (degree 2)
12 (degree 2)
17 (degree 3)
18 (degree 2)
4 (degree 2)
6 (degree 3)
11 (degree 3)
16 (degree 3)
1 (degree 4)
7 (degree 4)
14 (degree 4)
15 (degree 4)
2 (degree 4)
9 (degree 5)
19 (degree 5)
8 (degree 5)
13 (degree 5)

Now, we count the triangles:
- Triangle <2, 8, 19>
- Triangle <2, 13, 17>
- Triangle <2, 15, 19>
- Triangle <2, 8, 6>
- Triangle <4, 9, 11>
- Triangle <7, 1, 14>
- Triangle <7, 13, 17>
- Triangle <7, 12, 13>
- Triangle <9, 5, 10>
- Triangle <9, 16, 2>
- Triangle <9, 16, 14>
- Triangle <13, 8, 6>
- Triangle <13, 8, 19>
- Triangle <14, 0, 1>
- Triangle <14, 0, 16>
- Triangle <14, 1, 6>
- Triangle <14, 15, 19>
- Triangle <15, 2, 8>
- Triangle <15, 2, 16>
- Triangle <15, 14, 0>
- Triangle <17, 2, 8>
- Triangle <17, 2, 13>
- Triangle <17, 2, 15>
- Triangle <18, 11, 9>
- Triangle <19, 8, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [25].
