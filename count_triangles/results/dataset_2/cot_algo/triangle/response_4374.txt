Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 9) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 8) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 16) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 18) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 19) (11, 3) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 1) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 10) (17, 3) (17, 0) (8, 15) (8, 16) (8, 18) (16, 9) (16, 8) (14, 5) (14, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 14) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 8) (18, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 18) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
(0, 10), (0, 12), (0, 17), (0, 18), (0, 1)
(1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 12), (1, 14)
(2, 12)
(3, 9), (3, 11), (3, 13), (3, 17)
(4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 13), (4, 1)
(5, 12), (5, 1), (5, 14)
(6, 15), (6, 19), (6, 4)
(7, 4), (7, 18)
(8, 15), (8, 16), (8, 18)
(9, 3), (9, 16)
(10, 0), (10, 18), (10, 19)
(11, 3)
(12, 0), (12, 1), (12, 5), (12, 2)
(13, 3), (13, 4), (13, 18)
(14, 5), (14, 1)
(15, 19), (15, 6), (15, 8)
(16, 9), (16, 8)
(17, 3), (17, 0)
(18, 7), (18, 10), (18, 0), (18, 8), (18, 13)
(19, 15), (19, 6), (19, 10)

Now, let's list the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes by Degree: [2 -> 7 -> 11 -> 12 -> 14 -> 16 -> 17 -> 18 -> 19 -> 0 -> 5 -> 6 -> 8 -> 9 -> 13 -> 15 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 10]

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method: 

Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 12>
<0, 10, 12>
<0, 12, 17>
<1, 5, 12>
<1, 4, 13>
<1, 5, 14>
<4, 6, 15>
<4, 7, 18>
<4, 13, 18>
<6, 15, 19>
<8, 15, 19>
