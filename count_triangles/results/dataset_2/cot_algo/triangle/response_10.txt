Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 19) (9, 17) (9, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (18, 16) (5, 4) (5, 16) (13, 7) (3, 11) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 15) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 16) (12, 2) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 19) (1, 11) (1, 8) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 17) (15, 6) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 16) (14, 8) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 13) (7, 8) (7, 17) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 8) (0, 8) (17, 9) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 7) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 15) 

Response:
The graph based on the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:

- 15 - 6, 11, 15, 19
- 16 - 4, 5, 15, 18
- 17 - 7, 9, 12, 17, 19
- 18 - 16
- 19 - 6, 12, 15, 17

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, the triangles and their counts are as follows:

Triangles:
