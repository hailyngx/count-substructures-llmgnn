Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 8) (6, 9) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 19) (10, 9) (10, 17) (10, 13) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 4) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 18) (4, 17) (4, 19) (18, 17) (18, 8) (18, 1) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 15) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 19) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 8) (1, 18) (1, 12) (0, 17) (0, 5) (15, 17) (15, 13) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 3) (19, 14) (12, 1) (12, 14) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 12) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are labeled from 0 to 19.

Next, we will sort the nodes by their number of connections:
- Node 2 has 0 connections.
- Nodes 8, 6, 12, and 16 have 1 connection each.
- Nodes 1, 5, 13, 15, 18, 3, and 4 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 0, 7, 10, and 14 have 3 connections each.
- Nodes 9 and 11 have 4 connections each.
- Node 17 has 5 connections.
- Node 19 has 6 connections.

Now, we will look at the edges and count the triangles.

There are a total of 4 triangles in this graph:
1. <0, 5, 17>
2. <1, 14, 19>
3. <4, 7, 19>
4. <5, 10, 13>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [4].
