Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
The graph has the following structure:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 2), (1, 6), (1, 4), (1, 8), (2, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 0), (3, 4), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 9), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 8), (4, 0), (5, 6), (5, 3), (5, 8), (5, 2), (5, 0), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 0), (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 7), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 0)

Now to count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes by degree: (0: 5), (1: 3), (2: 4), (3: 3), (4: 5), (5: 5), (6: 3), (7: 3), (8: 5), (9: 4)

Relabeled nodes: 1, 7, 3, 6, 2, 4, 9, 8, 5, 0

Triangles found: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 8, 4>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 0, 5>, <2, 0, 3>, <2, 3, 5>, <4, 0, 9>, <4, 1, 8>, <4, 8, 5>, <4, 3, 0>, <4, 8, 5>, <5, 0, 2>, <5, 0, 3>, <5, 2, 3>, <5, 3, 4>, <6, 2, 0>, <9, 0, 7>, <9, 0, 4>, <9, 0, 7>, <9, 7, 8>, <9, 7, 4>

Total number of triangles: [22]
