Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 18) (10, 15) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 13) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 6) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 6) (9, 10) (9, 18) (13, 17) (13, 11) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 19) (18, 11) (19, 10) (19, 18) (19, 0) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 11) (14, 16) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 16) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 12) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 0) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 6) (5, 3) (5, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be used to count the number of triangles in the graph. Let's follow the steps mentioned earlier to find the total number of triangles in the graph:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
   - Node 5 is connected to 2 nodes.
   - Nodes 7, 8, 13, 14, and 17 are connected to 3 nodes each.
   - Nodes 0, 2, 6, 9, 16, and 19 are connected to 4 nodes each.
   - Nodes 1, 4, and 18 are connected to 5 nodes each.
   - Nodes 3, 10, 11, and 15 are connected to 6 nodes each.
   
2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   - Node 5 => Node 0
   - Nodes 7, 8, 13, 14, and 17 => Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
   - Nodes 0, 2, 6, 9, 16, and 19 => Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11
   - Nodes 1, 4, and 18 => Nodes 12, 13, and 14
   - Nodes 3, 10, 11, and 15 => Nodes 15, 16, 17, and 18

3. Count the triangles:
   - Considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
     - <0, 3, 5>
     - <0, 6, 8>
     - <1, 5, 7>
     - <1, 8, 11>
     - <2, 3, 4>
     - <4, 14, 16>
     - <6, 7, 13>
     - <6, 9, 16>
     - <7, 9, 10>
     - <8, 13, 14>
     - <12, 13, 15>
     - <12, 15, 17>
     - <13, 15, 18>
     - <15, 16, 17>
     - <16, 17, 18>

4. Output:
   - The total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
   - The unique triangles found are: 
     - <0, 3, 5>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 8, 11>, <2, 3, 4>, <4, 14, 16>, <6, 7, 13>, <6, 9, 16>, <7, 9, 10>, <8, 13, 14>, <12, 13, 15>, <12, 15, 17>, <13, 15, 18>, <15, 16, 17>, <16, 17, 18>.
