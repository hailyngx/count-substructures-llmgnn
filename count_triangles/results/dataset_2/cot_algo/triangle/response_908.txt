Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 27) (4, 15) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 10) (21, 7) (21, 3) (18, 11) (18, 25) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 20) (22, 12) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 21) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 23) (12, 22) (12, 5) (27, 4) (27, 10) (27, 20) (6, 24) (6, 20) (28, 3) (28, 0) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 26) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 19) (10, 7) (10, 27) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 9) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 2) (11, 18) (11, 23) (11, 14) (11, 8) (23, 3) (23, 11) (23, 9) (17, 13) (17, 25) (17, 8) (2, 22) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 16) (2, 25) (20, 22) (20, 27) (20, 6) (20, 29) (29, 20) (29, 26) (25, 18) (25, 17) (25, 2) (14, 22) (14, 11) (14, 26) (14, 16) (26, 5) (26, 29) (26, 14) (26, 16) (19, 13) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 28) (24, 6) (9, 10) (9, 23) (9, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 16) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 26) (16, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles is as follows:

Nodes in ascending order of degree:
Node 21: degree 2
Node 6: degree 2
Node 27: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 24: degree 1
Node 7: degree 4
Node 18: degree 2
Node 25: degree 4
Node 13: degree 3
Node 29: degree 2
Node 15: degree 3
Node 19: degree 1
Node 8: degree 4
Node 17: degree 3
Node 26: degree 4
Node 0: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 4: degree 3
Node 22: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 20: degree 4
Node 23: degree 3
Node 11: degree 4
Node 12: degree 2
Node 16: degree 4
Node 28: degree 2

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we will proceed with counting triangles:
