Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 8) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 11) (2, 13) (2, 3) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 3) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 14) (19, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 16) (9, 18) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 6) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (11, 17) (11, 1) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 0) (14, 5) (14, 8) (15, 7) (16, 4) (16, 8) (6, 13) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are:

Vertex 5: degree 2
Vertex 6: degree 1
Vertex 11: degree 1
Vertex 14: degree 2
Vertex 15: degree 1
Vertex 16: degree 2
Vertex 19: degree 1
Vertex 0: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 9: degree 1
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 10: degree 4
Vertex 18: degree 3
Vertex 12: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 5
Vertex 3: degree 4
Vertex 17: degree 4
Vertex 13: degree 5
Vertex 4: degree 5
Vertex 8: degree 4

By following the degree-based ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph. 

The total number of triangles is [17].

The triangles found are:
<0, 13, 6>
<0, 13, 12>
<0, 13, 17>
<0, 13, 2>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 11>
<0, 1, 12>
<1, 3, 0>
<1, 3, 10>
<1, 3, 18>
<1, 12, 0>
<1, 12, 17>
<11, 1, 12>
<13, 0, 3>
<13, 0, 12>
<13, 2, 3>
<13, 17, 11>
<16, 4, 7>
