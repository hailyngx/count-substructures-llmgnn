Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph by listing the nodes and their connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 6, 7, 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 2, 4, 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 3, 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 2, 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 8, 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 8, 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 8, 0.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 2, 3, 0.

Next, we will sort the nodes by their degree:

1. Node 7 (Degree: 2)
2. Node 5 (Degree: 3)
3. Node 1 (Degree: 4)
4. Node 6 (Degree: 4)
5. Node 2 (Degree: 4)
6. Node 4 (Degree: 4)
7. Node 3 (Degree: 4)
8. Node 0 (Degree: 5)
9. Node 9 (Degree: 4)
10. Node 8 (Degree: 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

- Triangle <1, 2, 3>
- Triangle <1, 2, 4>
- Triangle <1, 3, 4>
- Triangle <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle <0, 7, 8>
- Triangle <2, 3, 9>
- Triangle <2, 4, 9>
- Triangle <3, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
