Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 4) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 10) (12, 5) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 11) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: [3, 11, 4, 9]
- 1: [3, 6, 10, 13, 7]
- 2: [8, 10, 11]
- 3: [1, 7, 0, 9, 5]
- 4: [0, 5, 10, 14]
- 5: [3, 8, 12, 4, 7]
- 6: [1, 8, 13, 12]
- 7: [3, 8, 5, 10, 1]
- 8: [2, 5, 11, 6, 7]
- 9: [3, 0, 13, 11]
- 10: [1, 2, 4, 7]
- 11: [0, 14, 2, 8, 9]
- 12: [5, 6]
- 13: [1, 9, 6]
- 14: [11, 4]

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by degree: 12, 14, 2, 6, 13, 10, 4, 0, 9, 1, 7, 12, 8, 5, 3
Triangles: 
- Total number of triangles: [12]
- Unique triangles: <3, 5, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, <4, 10, 11>, <0, 4, 14>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 7, 10>, <2, 8, 11>, <6, 8, 13>, <5, 7, 8>, <8, 11, 9>, <6, 12, 5>, <0, 11, 9>
