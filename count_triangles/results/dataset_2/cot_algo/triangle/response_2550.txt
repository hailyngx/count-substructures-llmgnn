Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 19) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 8) (15, 8) (15, 12) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 2) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 16) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 17) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 19) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 0) (10, 5) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 17) (19, 16) (19, 7) (19, 6) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 4) (1, 16) (1, 0) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 8) (13, 9) (13, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting the number of triangles is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their degree in ascending order:
   Node 1 - Degree: 2
   Node 10 - Degree: 1
   Node 11 - Degree: 3
   Node 12 - Degree: 3
   Node 13 - Degree: 2
   Node 14 - Degree: 3
   Node 15 - Degree: 2
   Node 16 - Degree: 3
   Node 17 - Degree: 4
   Node 18 - Degree: 4
   Node 19 - Degree: 4
   Node 2 - Degree: 4
   Node 3 - Degree: 3
   Node 4 - Degree: 3
   Node 5 - Degree: 4
   Node 6 - Degree: 4
   Node 7 - Degree: 4
   Node 8 - Degree: 3
   Node 9 - Degree: 4
   Node 0 - Degree: 2

2. Relabel the vertices based on their sorted degree:
   Node 0 - Degree: 2
   Node 10 - Degree: 1
   Node 1 - Degree: 2
   Node 2 - Degree: 4
   Node 3 - Degree: 3
   Node 4 - Degree: 3
   Node 5 - Degree: 4
   Node 6 - Degree: 4
   Node 7 - Degree: 4
   Node 8 - Degree: 3
   Node 9 - Degree: 4
   Node 11 - Degree: 3
   Node 12 - Degree: 3
   Node 13 - Degree: 2
   Node 14 - Degree: 3
   Node 15 - Degree: 2
   Node 16 - Degree: 3
   Node 17 - Degree: 4
   Node 18 - Degree: 4
   Node 19 - Degree: 4

3. Count the triangles:
   - Triangles: [<2, 11, 14>, <2, 13, 9>, <2, 13, 2>, <2, 13, 7>, <2, 7, 19>, <2, 7, 6>, <2, 7, 4>, <2, 7, 18>, <5, 6, 18>, <5, 6, 19>, <5, 9, 17>, <5, 9, 13>, <6, 7, 19>, <12, 4, 7>, <12, 4, 5>, <12, 5, 10>, <12, 5, 9>, <18, 2, 11>, <18, 6, 19>, <18, 6, 7>, <18, 17, 3>]

Total number of triangles: [21]
