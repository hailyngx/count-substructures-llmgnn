Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and the given 40 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) 
(9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) 
(6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) 
(4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) 
(7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) 
(1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) 
(3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) 
(8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
(0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
(2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their connections:

Nodes sorted by degree: 3, 2, 9, 8, 6, 7, 1, 4, 0, 5

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- We will go through each edge and only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 7, 5>, <4, 8, 5>
