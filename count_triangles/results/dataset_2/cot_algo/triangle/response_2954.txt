Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 14) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 9) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 12) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Let's analyze the graph by sorting the vertices based on their number of connections.

Vertices sorted by their degree:  

Node 12 has degree 3  
Node 4 has degree 3  
Node 9 has degree 3  
Node 0 has degree 4  
Node 13 has degree 4  
Node 8 has degree 5  
Node 7 has degree 5  
Node 1 has degree 5  
Node 11 has degree 5  
Node 6 has degree 5  
Node 3 has degree 6  
Node 14 has degree 6  
Node 10 has degree 6  
Node 2 has degree 6  
Node 5 has degree 6  

Now, we will explore the edges following the rule that the vertex with the lower label should have fewer connections:
