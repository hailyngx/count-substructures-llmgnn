Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 5) (27, 15) (27, 17) (27, 13) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 1) (29, 2) (29, 0) (29, 3) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 28) (7, 23) (7, 8) (12, 21) (12, 11) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 21) (9, 0) (9, 19) (22, 9) (22, 11) (22, 10) (22, 20) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 23) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 14) (13, 27) (13, 25) (13, 4) (17, 27) (17, 6) (17, 24) (17, 21) (3, 29) (3, 28) (0, 29) (0, 9) (0, 18) (0, 6) (10, 22) (10, 5) (10, 25) (16, 20) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 24) (6, 14) (24, 17) (24, 6) (24, 14) (24, 25) (11, 12) (11, 22) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 10) (4, 13) (4, 23) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 24) (23, 15) (23, 7) (23, 28) (23, 4) (23, 19) (19, 9) (19, 23) (25, 13) (25, 10) (25, 24) (21, 12) (21, 9) (21, 17) (21, 18) (18, 0) (18, 21) (20, 22) (20, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to first sort the vertices based on their degrees.

Below is the vertices sorted by their degrees in ascending order:
Vertices: 28, 7, 4, 16, 11, 5, 14, 1, 12, 19, 2, 20, 17, 25, 21, 3, 26, 28, 13, 27, 6, 10, 0, 18, 8, 22, 24, 29, 9, 15

Next, we will go through each edge and check for shared connections between the vertices to identify the triangles.

After analyzing the graph, we have found the following unique triangles:
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 24>
<0, 6, 17>
<0, 6, 14>
<0, 9, 22>
<0, 9, 21>
<0, 9, 19>
<0, 9, 8>
<0, 9, 18>
<6, 10, 24>
<6, 10, 25>
<6, 17, 24>
<6, 17, 21>
<6, 17, 14>
<9, 21, 17>
<9, 21, 12>
<10, 22, 20>
<10, 22, 25>
<13, 17, 27>
<13, 17, 24>
<13, 17, 21>
<14, 17, 21>
<15, 1, 2>
<15, 1, 5>
<15, 1, 26>
<15, 1, 23>
<15, 1, 15>
<15, 23, 4>
<15, 23, 28>
<15, 23, 19>
<15, 23, 7>
<19, 23, 9>
<21, 17, 24>
<22, 10, 25>
<28, 26, 3>
<28, 26, 1>
<28, 26, 2>
<28, 3, 29>
<28, 3, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [39].
