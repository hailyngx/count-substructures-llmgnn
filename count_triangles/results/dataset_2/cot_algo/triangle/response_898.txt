Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 17) (5, 17) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 16) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 13) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (12, 3) (12, 7) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 17) (18, 16) (18, 1) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 13) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 16) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 6) (17, 15) (17, 5) (17, 8) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Vertex 0 -> 4 connections
Vertex 1 -> 4 connections
Vertex 2 -> 2 connections
Vertex 4 -> 4 connections
Vertex 5 -> 2 connections
Vertex 6 -> 3 connections
Vertex 7 -> 4 connections
Vertex 8 -> 3 connections
Vertex 9 -> 3 connections
Vertex 10 -> 2 connections
Vertex 11 -> 3 connections
Vertex 12 -> 2 connections
Vertex 13 -> 3 connections
Vertex 14 -> 4 connections
Vertex 15 -> 4 connections
Vertex 16 -> 4 connections
Vertex 17 -> 3 connections
Vertex 18 -> 3 connections
Vertex 19 -> 3 connections
Vertex 3 -> 5 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's count the number of triangles by examining the edges:

Number of triangles: [46]
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 14>, <0, 4, 11>, <0, 4, 19>, <0, 11, 7>, <0, 11, 14>, <0, 14, 4>, <0, 14, 11>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 18>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 6, 13>, <2, 6, 1>, <2, 6, 13>, <2, 9, 8>, <2, 9, 16>, <3, 14, 4>, <3, 14, 15>, <3, 14, 15>, <3, 14, 16>, <3, 15, 14>, <3, 15, 17>, <3, 15, 8>, <3, 15, 14>, <3, 16, 9>, <3, 16, 18>, <3, 16, 6>, <3, 16, 9>, <4, 11, 7>, <4, 11, 0>, <4, 11, 7>, <4, 11, 13>, <4, 14, 0>, <4, 14, 3>, <4, 14, 0>, <6, 1, 2>, <6, 1, 13>, <6, 1, 18>, <6, 13, 1>, <6, 13, 7>, <6, 13, 19>, <7, 11, 0>, <7, 11, 4>, <7, 11, 13>, <7, 11, 13>, <7, 11, 13>, <7, 12, 3>, <7, 12, 11>, <8, 9, 2>, <8, 9, 16>.
