Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 4) (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 13) (9, 19) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 6) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 19) (2, 19) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 6) (7, 1) (7, 14) (7, 17) (12, 14) (12, 1) (4, 15) (4, 18) (4, 14) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 17) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 1) (0, 3) (0, 19) (0, 6) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 0) (14, 16) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 4) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree in non-decreasing order and then relabeling them accordingly. The nodes with their degrees are as follows:
Node 2: degree 1
Node 5: degree 2
Node 17: degree 3
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 0: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 18: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 15: degree 4
Node 9: degree 5
Node 13: degree 5
Node 19: degree 6
Node 14: degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider each edge and check for triangles formed by shared connections. 

The total number of triangles is [16], and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 10>
<0, 3, 19>
<0, 6, 16>
<1, 7, 17>
<1, 12, 14>
<1, 7, 14>
<1, 8, 13>
<2, 13, 19>
<4, 14, 18>
<4, 14, 16>
<5, 8, 13>
<6, 10, 16>
<6, 14, 18>
<8, 13, 19>
<9, 13, 19>
<9, 5, 8>
