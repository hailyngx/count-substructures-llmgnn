Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 0) (0, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 2) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- Node 0: (13)
- Node 1: (9, 7, 8, 10, 2)
- Node 2: (10, 3, 1, 4)
- Node 3: (7, 10, 2, 4)
- Node 4: (5, 13, 3, 2)
- Node 5: (6, 12, 13, 11, 4)
- Node 6: (5, 7, 12)
- Node 7: (6, 12, 3, 1)
- Node 8: (9, 12, 14, 10, 1)
- Node 9: (8, 11, 14, 1)
- Node 10: (8, 3, 2, 14, 1)
- Node 11: (9, 5, 14)
- Node 12: (6, 7, 5, 14, 8)
- Node 13: (5, 4, 0)
- Node 14: (9, 12, 8, 10, 11)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees and relabel them accordingly:
Nodes by degree: 0 (1), 6 (3), 13 (4), 11 (3), 2 (4), 3 (4), 9 (4), 10 (5), 4 (4), 8 (5), 7 (4), 5 (5), 14 (5), 1 (5), 12 (5)

After relabeling, the new node order would be: 0, 6, 13, 11, 2, 3, 9, 10, 4, 8, 7, 5, 14, 1, 12
