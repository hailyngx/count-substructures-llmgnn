Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 12) (11, 17) (16, 21) (16, 17) (16, 3) (1, 21) (1, 26) (21, 16) (21, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (27, 15) (27, 20) (15, 27) (15, 14) (15, 2) (8, 26) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 18) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 6) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 28) (18, 25) (26, 1) (26, 8) (26, 22) (26, 4) (6, 2) (6, 28) (6, 3) (6, 22) (28, 18) (28, 6) (28, 22) (22, 26) (22, 6) (22, 28) (22, 29) (4, 26) (4, 14) (5, 12) (5, 29) (5, 20) (19, 10) (19, 20) (19, 23) (20, 27) (20, 5) (20, 19) (29, 22) (29, 5) (29, 25) (23, 19) (23, 7) (23, 10) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 23) (7, 14) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 16) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 9) (24, 12) (24, 9) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 24) (9, 17) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 17) (25, 18) (25, 29) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 23) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is as follows:
Vertices: [24, 5, 4, 13, 1, 28, 2, 8, 7,
 23, 10, 17, 0, 22, 6, 21, 18, 3, 15,
 14, 27, 26, 12, 19, 20, 29, 9, 11, 16, 25]

Therefore, the triangles in the graph are:
[<3, 6, 14>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 9, 14>, <10, 19, 23>, <12, 24, 9>, <12, 17, 24>]

The total number of triangles is [6].
