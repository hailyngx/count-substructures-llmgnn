Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's construct a graph with the provided information and then count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Edges: 
(5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) 
(9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) 
(4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) 
(7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) 
(1, 5) (1, 9) 
(3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) 
(6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) 
(8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) 
(2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) 
(0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices by their degree:
Node 1: degree 2
Node 3: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 8: degree 5
Node 0: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 9: degree 6

Sorted vertices:
[1, 3, 7, 5, 2, 6, 8, 0, 4, 9]

Triangles found:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 8, 2>
<0, 8, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<4, 9, 5>
<4, 9, 1>
<4, 9, 0>
<7, 4, 9>
<7, 4, 8>
<7, 4, 0>
<8, 6, 2>
<8, 6, 9>
<8, 6, 7>
<8, 6, 4>
<8, 6, 5>
<8, 6, 0>
<8, 2, 5>
<8, 2, 6>
<8, 2, 0>
<8, 2, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 6>

Total number of triangles: [26]
