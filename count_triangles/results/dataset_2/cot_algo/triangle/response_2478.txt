Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles in the given graph. Let's construct the graph with nodes and edges first:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 5), (0, 2), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 8), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 2), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

Node 0: degree 2
Node 7: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 5: degree 6
Node 4: degree 5
Node 2: degree 6
Node 1: degree 6

Starting with the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we can count the triangles. 

<0, 2, 1>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 1>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 4>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 0>
<2, 5, 4>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 3>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 8, 5>
<5, 7, 1>
<5, 7, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [19].
