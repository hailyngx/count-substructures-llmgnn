Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 5) (10, 13) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows with 15 nodes and 60 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: 
(5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14)
(9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3)
(4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1)
(7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2)
(6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13)
(8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 1)
(0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1)
(14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11)
(2, 7) (2, 12)
(12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3)
(11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14)
(3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12)
(1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0)
(13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 10)
(10, 5) (10, 13)

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by degree: 
0 (degree 4) -> A
2 (degree 2) -> B
10 (degree 2) -> C
13 (degree 4) -> D
11 (degree 4) -> E
12 (degree 4) -> F
7 (degree 4) -> G
4 (degree 4) -> H
1 (degree 5) -> I
9 (degree 3) -> J
3 (degree 5) -> K
8 (degree 5) -> L
6 (degree 6) -> M
5 (degree 7) -> N
14 (degree 5) -> O

Triangles found based on the sorted vertices:
[55]
<5, 9, 6>, <5, 9, 3>, <5, 12, 3>, <5, 12, 2>, <5, 14, 6>, <5, 14, 8>, <5, 14, 0>, <5, 14, 11>, <9, 3, 7>, <4, 8, 6>, <4, 8, 1>, <4, 8, 0>, <4, 8, 14>, <4, 1, 0>, <7, 11, 0>, <7, 3, 12>, <7, 6, 11>, <6, 14, 8>, <6, 14, 0>, <6, 14, 11>, <6, 7, 11>, <8, 14, 0>, <8, 14, 11>, <0, 11, 14>, <12, 2, 7>, <12, 2, 3>, <12, 7, 3>, <13, 4, 8>, <13, 4, 1>, <13, 4, 6>, <13, 6, 8>, <13, 6, 11>, <13, 6, 12>, <10, 13, 4>
