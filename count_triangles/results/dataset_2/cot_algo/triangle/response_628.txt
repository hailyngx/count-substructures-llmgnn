Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Degree of each node:  
Node 0: 4  
Node 1: 5  
Node 2: 2  
Node 3: 3  
Node 4: 6  
Node 5: 4  
Node 6: 5  
Node 7: 3  
Node 8: 4  
Node 9: 5  

Nodes sorted by degree: 2, 3, 7, 0, 8, 5, 9, 1, 6, 4  

Edges with lower labeled vertex having fewer connections (sorted by vertex label):  
(0, 4)  
(0, 6)  
(0, 8)  
(2, 4)  
(3, 4)  
(3, 5)  
(5, 7)  
(5, 9)  
(1, 6)  
(1, 4)
