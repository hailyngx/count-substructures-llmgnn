Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by the number of connections (degree) they have in ascending order. 

The sorted list of nodes from least to most connections is: 
2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 5, 3, 1, 8, 0

Now, we will investigate each edge to count the triangles:

- Edge (2, 3): Both nodes 2 and 3 have 2 connections. Since 2 < 3, we proceed.
  - Shared connections with node 2: 6
  - Triangle formed: <2, 3, 6>

- Edge (5, 8): Node 5 has 4 connections and node 8 has 5 connections. Since 5 < 8, we proceed.
  - Shared connections with node 5: 4
  - Triangle formed: <5, 8, 4>

- Edge (6, 7): Node 6 has 4 connections and node 7 has 4 connections. Since 6 < 7, we proceed.
  - Shared connections with node 6: 0
  - Triangle formed: <6, 7, 0>

- Edge (7, 8): Node 7 has 4 connections and node 8 has 5 connections. Since 7 < 8, we proceed.
  - Shared connections with node 7: 0, 8
  - Triangle formed: <7, 8, 0>, <7, 8, 8>

- Edge (9, 7): Node 9 has 4 connections and node 7 has 4 connections. Since 9 > 7, we don't proceed.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
Unique triangles found are: <2, 3, 6>, <5, 8, 4>, <6, 7, 0>, <7, 8, 0>, <7, 8, 8>.
