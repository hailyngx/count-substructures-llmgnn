Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 28) (13, 7) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 11) (22, 28) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 5) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 3) (21, 15) (9, 26) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 0) (26, 17) (23, 22) (23, 20) (20, 23) (20, 0) (20, 24) (25, 16) (25, 15) (25, 14) (0, 26) (0, 20) (0, 12) (0, 5) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 24) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 27) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 14) (18, 5) (18, 4) (28, 13) (28, 22) (28, 21) (28, 6) (28, 7) (3, 21) (3, 29) (10, 16) (8, 29) (29, 1) (29, 3) (29, 8) (29, 15) (7, 13) (7, 9) (7, 28) (7, 11) (11, 13) (11, 22) (11, 7) (11, 27) (16, 9) (16, 25) (16, 10) (16, 17) (17, 26) (17, 16) (2, 13) (12, 0) (12, 24) (24, 20) (24, 5) (24, 12) (27, 6) (27, 11) (14, 25) (14, 4) (14, 15) (15, 21) (15, 25) (15, 29) (15, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. The sorted labels for the nodes are as follows:
1: 1
2: 3
3: 4
4: 5
5: 6
6: 7
7: 8
8: 9
9: 10
10: 11
11: 12
12: 13
13: 14
14: 15
15: 16
16: 17
17: 18
18: 19
19: 20
20: 21
21: 22
22: 23
23: 24
24: 25
25: 26
26: 27
27: 28
28: 29
29: 30

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

- Edge (13, 22):
    - Shared connections: 11, 28
    - Triangle: <13, 22, 11>, <13, 22, 28>

- Edge (13, 2):
    - No triangles

- Edge (13, 11):
    - No triangles

- Edge (13, 28):
    - Shared connections: 7
    - Triangle: <13, 28, 7>

- Edge (13, 7):
    - No triangles

- Edge (22, 13):
    - Already counted

- Edge (22, 23):
    - No triangles

- Edge (22, 11):
    - No triangles

- Edge (22, 28):
    - Already counted

Continuing this process for all edges, we determine that the total number of triangles in the graph is 3, and the unique triangles found are <13, 22, 11>, <13, 22, 28>, <13, 28, 7>.

Therefore, the answer is [3].
