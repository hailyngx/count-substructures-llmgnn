Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows with its nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(6, 3), (6, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (7, 9),
(7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 8), (7, 5), (7, 1), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 8),
(3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 8), (8, 7), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 2), (5, 7),
(5, 3), (5, 0), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 0), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 5), (0, 2)

Now, let's proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph. 

Vertices sorted by degree (least to most):
Node 6 (Degree 2)
Node 5 (Degree 2)
Node 2 (Degree 2)
Node 4 (Degree 3)
Node 8 (Degree 4)
Node 0 (Degree 5)
Node 6 (Degree 5)
Node 1 (Degree 6)
Node 3 (Degree 6)
Node 9 (Degree 7)

Triangles in the graph: [18]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 7, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, 
<3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 0>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 1>, <7, 8, 3>, 
<7, 9, 0>, <7, 9, 1>, <8, 2, 0>, <0, 5, 7>
