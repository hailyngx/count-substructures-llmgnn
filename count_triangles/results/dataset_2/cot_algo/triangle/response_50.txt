Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 6) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 11) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 6) 

Response:
The graph representation based on the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 15
Edges: 60
Edge List:
(8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) 
(13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) 
(7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) 
(12, 7) (12, 14) 
(2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 4) 
(0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 6) 
(14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) 
(3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) 
(11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) 
(9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 1) 
(4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) 
(1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) 
(6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) 
(5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 11) 
(10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 6)

Now, I will construct the graph with nodes and edges sorted by the number of connections each node has. 

The vertices in order of their degrees are: 
Vertices: 12, 14, 13, 10, 1, 5, 7, 0, 6, 12, 3, 11, 2, 4, 8 
(For simplicity, let's assume the numbering starts from 0 to 14.)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

[Total number of triangles: 10]

Unique Triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 6, 10>
<0, 6, 11>
<0, 8, 13>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 7, 11>
<3, 9, 11>
<4, 6, 10>
<4, 9, 11>
