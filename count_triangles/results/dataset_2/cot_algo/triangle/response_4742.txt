Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (1, 25) (1, 22) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 12) (25, 1) (25, 3) (25, 14) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 22) (20, 4) (20, 6) (22, 1) (22, 15) (22, 17) (26, 16) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 7) (19, 4) (19, 10) (16, 26) (16, 28) (16, 21) (28, 16) (28, 0) (28, 23) (27, 8) (27, 17) (21, 16) (21, 0) (7, 9) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 24) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 2) (29, 24) (29, 18) (29, 10) (18, 15) (18, 29) (18, 23) (18, 8) (23, 28) (23, 18) (23, 4) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 24) (4, 20) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 10) (6, 20) (6, 8) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 29) (10, 2) (10, 4) (24, 7) (24, 29) (24, 2) (24, 17) (17, 22) (17, 27) (17, 24) (12, 3) (12, 14) (8, 27) (8, 18) (8, 0) (8, 6) (14, 25) (14, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then re-labeling them accordingly.

After sorting the nodes, the new labels for the graph are as follows:
0 - 8 connections
1 - 3 connections
2 - 4 connections
3 - 4 connections
4 - 5 connections
5 - 2 connections
6 - 2 connections
7 - 5 connections
8 - 5 connections
9 - 4 connections
10 - 5 connections
11 - 4 connections
12 - 2 connections
13 - 4 connections
14 - 2 connections
15 - 4 connections
16 - 4 connections
17 - 3 connections
18 - 4 connections
19 - 3 connections
20 - 2 connections
21 - 2 connections
22 - 3 connections
23 - 3 connections
24 - 4 connections
25 - 3 connections
26 - 2 connections
27 - 2 connections
28 - 4 connections
29 - 4 connections

Now, we can count the triangles in the graph based on the connections between the vertices with the lower labels.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [78].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<5, 7, 13>
<1, 3, 25>
<15, 18, 22>
<4, 10, 19>
<16, 21, 28>
<7, 11, 13>
<2, 9, 11>
<2, 10, 24>
<8, 18, 23>
