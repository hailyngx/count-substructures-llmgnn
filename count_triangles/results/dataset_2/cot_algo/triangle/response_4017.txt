Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: 
(0, 2), (0, 8), (0, 23), (0, 29), 
(1, 26), (1, 29), 
(2, 19), 
(3, 5), (3, 28), 
(4, 9), (4, 10), (4, 19), 
(5, 13), (5, 27), 
(6, 15), (6, 16), (6, 18), (6, 21), 
(7, 20), (7, 28), 
(8, 25), 
(9, 17), (9, 24), (9, 27), 
(10, 13), (10, 18), (10, 27), (10, 4), 
(11, 14), (11, 23), (11, 27), (11, 29), 
(12, 29), 
(13, 18), (13, 25), 
(14, 15), (14, 17), (14, 19), (14, 11), 
(15, 25), 
(16, 21), (16, 24), 
(17, 24), (17, 9), 
(18, 28), 
(19, 2), (19, 23), (19, 4), 
(20, 7), 
(21, 28), 
(24, 16), 
(25, 8), 
(26, 1), 
(27, 28)

Next, let's sort the nodes by their degree:

Nodes with degree:
0: 4, 1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 4, 5: 2, 6: 4, 7: 2, 8: 2, 9: 4, 10: 4, 11: 4, 12: 1, 13: 4, 14: 4, 15: 3, 16: 3, 17: 2, 18: 4, 19: 4, 20: 1, 21: 3, 22: 0, 23: 3, 24: 3, 25: 2, 26: 1, 27: 5, 28: 5, 29: 4

Now, let's count the number of triangles and list them:

Total number of triangles: [20]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 19>
<0, 8, 25>
<0, 23, 19>
<0, 29, 11>
<1, 26, 29>
<4, 9, 27>
<4, 18, 10>
<4, 19, 2>
<5, 3, 28>
<6, 15, 25>
<6, 18, 10>
<6, 21, 28>
<9, 17, 24>
<9, 27, 28>
<10, 13, 18>
<11, 14, 17>
<11, 27, 29>
