Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 14) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 10) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 11) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 5) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 3) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (3, 8) (3, 10) (4, 9) (4, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the graph. 

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the vertices are relabeled as follows:
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 12: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 6
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 14: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 6
Node 8: Degree 5

Following the method described in the initial question, counting the triangles gives [75]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 10>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 13>
<1, 11, 13>
<3, 10, 13>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 11>
<5, 7, 13>
<8, 11, 13>
<8, 11, 7>
<8, 11, 14>
<8, 13, 14>
<12, 1, 11>
<12, 1, 13>
<12, 7, 14>
<12, 9, 14>
<12, 0, 9>
<12, 0, 6>
<13, 14, 7>
<2, 9, 14>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
