Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 16) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 18) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 17) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (1, 0) (1, 19) (17, 13) (17, 11) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 16) (18, 15) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 16) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 2) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 19) (16, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method of counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections, also known as degrees.

Here is the list of vertices sorted by their degrees:
Vertices: 
0 (degree 5)
1 (degree 2)
3 (degree 3)
14 (degree 1)
18 (degree 2)
19 (degree 3)
12 (degree 3)
2 (degree 4)
4 (degree 4)
6 (degree 4)
8 (degree 2)
13 (degree 3)
9 (degree 3)
11 (degree 4)
15 (degree 4)
16 (degree 4)
5 (degree 5)
7 (degree 3)
17 (degree 3)
10 (degree 1)

Now, let's count the triangles by considering the edges in the graph:
Total triangles = 8

[Total number of triangles: 8]
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 12>, <0, 4, 19>, <2, 4, 19>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 15>, <6, 15, 16>, <9, 13, 17>
