Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be used to count the number of triangles in the given graph. 

Let's first sort the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 3

Now, we will look at each edge and find the triangles formed by shared connections between the two vertices of the edge:

1. For edge (5, 6):
   Node 5: 4 connections, Node 6: 4 connections
   They have 2 shared connections: (5, 8) and (6, 8)
   Triangle 1: <5, 6, 8>

2. For edge (5, 2):
   Node 5: 4 connections, Node 2: 3 connections
   They have no shared connections. Skip.

3. For edge (5, 8):
   Node 5: 4 connections, Node 8: 6 connections
   They have 3 shared connections: (5, 8), (6, 8), and (7, 8)
   Triangles 2 and 3: <5, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 8>

4. For edge (5, 4):
   Node 5: 4 connections, Node 4: 4 connections
   They have no shared connections. Skip.

(Continuing the same process for the remaining edges...)

After examining all the edges, we have found the following unique triangles:
- Triangle 1: <5, 6, 8>
- Triangle 2: <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
