Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 6: 5 connections

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

- Starting with the edge (3, 8):
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 5, and 2.
    - There is a triangle between nodes 3, 4, and 8. (3, 4, 8)

- Moving to the edge (1, 2):
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 4, 8, and 7.
    - There is a triangle between nodes 1, 2, and 8. (1, 2, 8)

- Analyzing the edge (3, 6):
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 2, and 3.
    - There is a triangle between nodes 3, 4, and 6. (3, 4, 6)

- Considering the edge (0, 7):
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 7, and 5.
    - Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 1.
    - There is a triangle between nodes 0, 7, and 5. (0, 7, 5)

The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are: <3, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 8>, <3, 4, 6>, and <0, 7, 5>.
