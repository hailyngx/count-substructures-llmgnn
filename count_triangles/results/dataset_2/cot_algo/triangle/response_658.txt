Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (7), (8)
- 1: (7), (3), (4), (5), (9), (2)
- 2: (5), (1), (3), (7), (9)
- 3: (8), (4), (1), (2), (6)
- 4: (1), (7), (3)
- 5: (1), (9), (2)
- 6: (3), (7), (9)
- 7: (6), (4), (0), (8), (2), (1)
- 8: (7), (0), (3)
- 9: (5), (2), (9), (6), (1)

After sorting by the number of connections, the nodes will be labeled as follows:
0: 2 connections
8: 3 connections
5: 3 connections
4: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
9: 5 connections
3: 5 connections
7: 6 connections
1: 6 connections
2: 6 connections

Using Degree-Based Ordering and checking shared connections, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
<5, 9, 2>
<6, 7, 4>
<6, 9, 5>
<7, 8, 0>
