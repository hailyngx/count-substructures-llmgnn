Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 6) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 12) (11, 15) (17, 18) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (19, 4) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 16) (13, 3) (0, 1) (0, 16) (16, 19) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 10) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 14) (12, 11) (12, 5) (10, 16) (10, 8) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 15) (14, 18) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 14) (18, 8) (8, 16) (8, 10) (8, 18) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows with 20 nodes and 60 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: (4, 19), (4, 6), (7, 14), (7, 9), (7, 1), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 0), (3, 1), (3, 11), (3, 6), (3, 13), (11, 3), (11, 19), (11, 18), (11, 12), (11, 15), (17, 18), (5, 19), (5, 2), (5, 12), (5, 14), (19, 4), (19, 11), (19, 5), (19, 16), (13, 3), (0, 1), (0, 16), (16, 19), (16, 0), (16, 8), (16, 10), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 15), (6, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 14), (15, 11), (15, 6), (15, 14), (12, 11), (12, 5), (10, 16), (10, 8), (14, 7), (14, 5), (14, 2), (14, 15), (14, 18), (18, 11), (18, 17), (18, 14), (18, 8), (8, 16), (8, 10), (8, 18), (9, 7)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices by their number of connections (degree):
0(2), 9(1), 2(3), 4(2), 6(4), 13(1), 5(4), 14(5), 15(3), 17(1), 7(4), 10(2), 1(4), 3(6), 8(3), 11(6), 12(2), 16(4), 18(5), 19(4)

Triangles (with vertices in increasing order) found after applying the Degree-Based Ordering method: 
<2, 6, 15>, <3, 6, 15>, <2, 6, 14>, <2, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 11>, <6, 11, 15>, <3, 11, 15>, <1, 11, 15>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 12>, <5, 12, 14>, <5, 14, 18>, <11, 14, 18>, <11, 15, 18>, <14, 15, 18>, <0, 1, 16>, <0, 16, 19>, <1, 16, 19>, <8, 16, 19>

Total number of triangles: [19]
