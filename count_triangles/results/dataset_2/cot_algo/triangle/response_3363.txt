Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 14) (5, 8) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (3, 7) (3, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 13) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 
- 0: (4, 8), (5, 6), (6, 3), (9, 0)
- 1: (10, 1), (11, 9), (12, 1), (13, 1)
- 2: (2, 8), (7, 2), (9, 2), (14, 2)
- 3: (3, 6), (7, 3)
- 4: (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 6)
- 5: (5, 8), (5, 0)
- 6: (6, 4), (6, 3)
- 7: (7, 10), (7, 12), (7, 3), (9, 7)
- 8: (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 12)
- 9: (9, 11), (9, 7), (9, 2), (9, 0), (9, 14), (9, 1)
- 10: (10, 8), (10, 7)
- 11: (11, 9), (11, 13), (11, 8), (11, 12)
- 12: (12, 11), (12, 8), (12, 7), (12, 14), (12, 1)
- 13: (13, 11), (13, 6), (13, 14), (13, 1)
- 14: (14, 12), (14, 2), (14, 9), (14, 13)

Now let's proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles. 

Vertices sorted by degree: 3, 5, 10, 12, 13, 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 2, 8, 11, 14

Triangles found: 
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <0, 6, 4>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <0, 9, 1>
- <1, 9, 11>
- <1, 9, 13>
- <2, 7, 9>
- <2, 9, 14>
- <4, 6, 3>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <7, 9, 11>
- <7, 9, 12>
- <9, 11, 12>
- <9, 11, 13>

Total number of triangles: [15]
