Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 5) (6, 9) (6, 19) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 17) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 10) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 5) (17, 9) (17, 18) (12, 4) (12, 7) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 16) (14, 0) (14, 13) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 18) (19, 6) (19, 4) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 8) (2, 10) (2, 13) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: (14, 18, 8, 1)
- 1: (15, 0, 8)
- 2: (10, 13)
- 3: (15, 7, 9, 8)
- 4: (6, 7, 12, 19, 10)
- 5: (15, 10)
- 6: (9, 19, 4, 13)
- 7: (16, 3, 4, 12)
- 8: (0, 1, 3, 18)
- 9: (3, 6, 17)
- 10: (4, 2, 5)
- 11: (16)
- 12: (4, 7)
- 13: (6, 14, 2)
- 14: (16, 0, 13)
- 15: (3, 1, 5)
- 16: (11, 7, 14)
- 17: (9, 18)
- 18: (17, 8, 0)
- 19: (6, 4)

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by connections: 11 < 2 < 5 < 18 < 1 < 17 < 12 < 19 < 10 < 13 < 15 < 9 < 6 < 0 < 8 < 3 < 4 < 7 < 14 < 16

Number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles found: <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 13>, <4, 6, 19>, <3, 4, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 8, 18>, <1, 8, 15>, <7, 12, 4>, <6, 13, 14>, <0, 1, 15>, <3, 8, 18>, <3, 8, 15>
