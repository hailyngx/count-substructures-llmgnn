Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 4, 8, 3, 6, 9.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are: 
<4, 5, 9>, <4, 3, 9>, <4, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 6, 8>.
