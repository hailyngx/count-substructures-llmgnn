Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 9) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 9) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 11) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 15) (2, 4) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 12) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 18) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 8) (12, 4) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 6) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 15) (18, 9) (18, 15) (15, 2) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 17) (19, 15) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their degree (number of connections) from least to most. 

After arranging the nodes accordingly, we get the following updated list:
```
Node 2: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 12: degree 2
Node 18: degree 2
Node 16: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 0: degree 3
Node 19: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 4: degree 5
Node 11: degree 5
Node 17: degree 5
Node 7: degree 5
Node 15: degree 5
```

Now, we will count the triangles based on this degree ordering:

1. For each edge, we will only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
   - Triangles involving Node 1: (1, 3, 11), (1, 13, 11) 

2. No more triangles can be formed based on the given edges.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 11> and <1, 13, 11>.
