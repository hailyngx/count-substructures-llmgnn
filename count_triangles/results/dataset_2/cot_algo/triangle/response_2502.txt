Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 9) (29, 12) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 26) (15, 0) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 21) (6, 22) (6, 19) (28, 7) (28, 22) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 23) (4, 14) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 16) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 5) (21, 20) (9, 29) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 23) (8, 27) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 1) (12, 29) (12, 3) (12, 16) (12, 5) (16, 18) (16, 12) (16, 13) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 5) (26, 15) (26, 10) (26, 17) (7, 28) (7, 19) (7, 14) (0, 15) (0, 23) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 16) (1, 20) (1, 19) (25, 5) (25, 23) (25, 14) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 25) (24, 2) (24, 14) (22, 6) (22, 28) (22, 11) (23, 4) (23, 9) (23, 0) (23, 25) (23, 14) (27, 8) (27, 17) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 25) (14, 24) (14, 23) (17, 26) (17, 27) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:


```
0: 15, 23
1: 19, 20
2: 10, 13, 24, 29
3: 11, 12
4: 9, 13, 14, 18, 23
5: 10, 11, 12, 25
6: 19, 22
7: 14, 19, 28
8: 27
9: 4, 18, 23, 29
10: 2, 5, 26
11: 3, 5, 22
12: 3, 5, 16, 29
13: 2, 4, 16
14: 4, 7, 14, 23, 24, 25
15: 0, 19, 20, 26
16: 12, 13, 18
17: 26, 27
18: 4, 9, 16
19: 1, 6, 7, 15
20: 1, 15, 21
21: 20
22: 6, 11, 28
23: 0, 4, 9, 14, 25
24: 2, 14
25: 5, 14, 23
26: 10, 15, 17
27: 8, 17
28: 7, 22
29: 2, 9, 12
```

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

The vertices sorted by their degree are: 8, 21, 27, 0, 1, 28, 3, 6, 7, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 5, 16, 26, 11, 25, 4, 9, 12, 19, 13, 15, 29, 10, 2, 23, 14.

Counting the number of triangles: 
There are 18 triangles in total.

Output: [18]
Unique triangles: <2, 9, 29>, <3, 5, 12>, <4, 13, 16>, <4, 14, 23>, <4, 18, 9>, <5, 10, 26>, <5, 11, 22>, <5, 12, 3>, <5, 14, 25>, <6, 19, 7>, <7, 14, 25>, <9, 18, 4>, <10, 2, 26>, <11, 22, 5>, <13, 4, 16>, <14, 4, 23>, <14, 23, 25>, <15, 20, 1>.
