Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 1), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9), (7, 5), (7, 1), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 8), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 9), (3, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 2), (6, 8), (9, 7), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 8), (8, 4), (8, 1), (8, 6), (8, 9), (8, 2), (5, 7), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 0), (2, 6), (2, 8), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 5)

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method by sorting the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

Ordered nodes: 2, 0, 5, 9, 8, 3, 6, 1, 7, 4

Now, we will count the number of triangles and list the unique triangles below:

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<4, 7, 1>
<4, 7, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<0, 3, 5>
<6, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
