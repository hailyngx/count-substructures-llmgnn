Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 9) (2, 6) (18, 4) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 12) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 12) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 9) (16, 19) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 1) (19, 16) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) (8, 7) (8, 17) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 8) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 17) (10, 7) (10, 12) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 10) (17, 8) (17, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
The given graph with nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
(2, 9), (2, 6), (18, 4), (4, 18), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 1), (3, 0), (3, 14), (3, 12), 
(11, 14), (11, 5), (11, 6), (15, 16), (15, 5), (15, 12), (16, 15), (16, 7), (16, 9), (16, 19), 
(7, 16), (7, 10), (7, 9), (7, 8), (14, 3), (14, 11), (14, 1), (19, 16), (0, 4), (0, 3), 
(0, 13), (0, 6), (8, 7), (8, 17), (8, 1), (9, 2), (9, 16), (9, 7), (9, 12), (1, 4), 
(1, 14), (1, 8), (5, 4), (5, 11), (5, 15), (5, 17), (10, 7), (10, 12), (12, 3), (12, 15), 
(12, 9), (12, 10), (17, 8), (17, 5), (6, 2), (6, 11), (6, 0), (6, 13), (13, 0), (13, 6)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:
(10, 11, 13, 18) - 1 connection
(0, 8, 17, 19) - 2 connections
(1, 3, 7, 12) - 3 connections
(5, 6, 14) - 4 connections
(2, 15) - 5 connections
(4, 9, 16) - 6 connections

Let's count the triangles and unique triangles: 
[28]
<0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 15>, <0, 6, 13>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 8, 17>, <0, 12, 3>, <0, 12, 15>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 14>, <1, 5, 11>, <1, 5, 17>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 10>, <3, 7, 12>, <4, 5, 11>, <4, 5, 15>, <4, 9, 12>, <5, 11, 15>, <5, 17, 8>, <7, 8, 17>, <9, 12, 10>
