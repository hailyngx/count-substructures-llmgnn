Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 13) (15, 16) (15, 13) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (18, 16) (18, 17) (16, 15) (16, 18) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 17) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (19, 7) (19, 0) (9, 0) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 1) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 9) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 18) (17, 12) 

Response:
The vertices sorted according to their degrees are:
Nodes: 9, 10, 16, 18, 19, 1, 3, 5, 6, 0, 8, 11, 14, 2, 7, 12, 15, 4, 13, 17
