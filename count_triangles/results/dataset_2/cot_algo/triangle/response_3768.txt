Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 14) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (10, 8) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method steps are as follows:

1. Sort nodes by their degree (number of connections):  
\[ (10) \rightarrow (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 5, 8, 11, 14) \]

2. Relabel the vertices:  
\[ (0) \rightarrow (0), (1) \rightarrow (1), (2) \rightarrow (2), (3) \rightarrow (3), (4) \rightarrow (4), (6) \rightarrow (5), (7) \rightarrow (6), (9) \rightarrow (7), (12) \rightarrow (8), (13) \rightarrow (9), (5) \rightarrow (10), (8) \rightarrow (11), (11) \rightarrow (12), (14) \rightarrow (13) \]

3. Count triangles:  
- For each edge, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
- Count triangles where shared connections form a triangle.
  
After following the steps and counting the triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is given in brackets []:

\[ [10] \]

The unique triangles found are listed as follows:

\[ <0, 2, 11>, <0, 2, 13>, <0, 2, 14>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 13>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 3>, <1, 6, 4>, <2, 6, 4> \]
