Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 3) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 5) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 10) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 10) (11, 1) (11, 7) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 7) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 9) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps to efficiently count the number of triangles in the graph. Let's follow the steps:

1. Sort vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):
   - Node 11: 2 connections
   - Node 4: 3 connections
   - Node 8: 3 connections
   - Node 10: 4 connections
   - Node 7: 5 connections
   - Node 0: 5 connections
   - Node 13: 5 connections
   - Node 3: 6 connections
   - Node 1: 6 connections
   - Node 14: 6 connections
   - Node 5: 6 connections
   - Node 6: 6 connections
   - Node 9: 6 connections
   - Node 2: 6 connections
   - Node 12: 6 connections

2. Label the vertices based on their sorted order:
   - Node 11: 0
   - Node 4: 1
   - Node 8: 2
   - Node 10: 3
   - Node 7: 4
   - Node 0: 5
   - Node 13: 6
   - Node 3: 7
   - Node 1: 8
   - Node 14: 9
   - Node 5: 10
   - Node 6: 11
   - Node 9: 12
   - Node 2: 13
   - Node 12: 14

3. Calculate the number of triangles formed:
   - Total triangles: 15

4. List of unique triangles:
   - <0, 2, 8>
   - <0, 2, 12>
   - <0, 5, 6>
   - <0, 6, 13>
   - <0, 6, 14>
   - <0, 13, 6>
   - <1, 4, 12>
   - <1, 4, 5>
   - <1, 5, 4>
   - <2, 5, 6>
   - <2, 6, 13>
   - <2, 6, 14>
   - <3, 5, 9>
   - <3, 5, 12>
   - <4, 5, 12>

5. Output:
   - The total number of triangles is [15].
