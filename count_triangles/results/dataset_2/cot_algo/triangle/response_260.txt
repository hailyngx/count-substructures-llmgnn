Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes and their connections based on the given edges are listed as follows:

0 - 9, 1, 3, 6, 8  
1 - 7, 6, 0, 8  
2 - 6, 8  
3 - 7, 6, 8  
4 - 5, 9, 7, 6  
5 - 9, 6, 8, 4  
6 - 5, 4, 1, 3, 2, 0  
7 - 9, 4, 1, 3  
8 - 5, 1, 3, 2, 0  
9 - 5, 4, 7, 0  

By sorting the nodes based on their degree:
2 - 2  
3 - 3  
7 - 3  
0 - 5  
1 - 4  
8 - 5  
9 - 4  
4 - 4  
5 - 4  
6 - 6  

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Looking at the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
  - (5, 9): Shared connections are 4, 6 -> <4, 5, 9> forms a triangle.  
  - (5, 6): Shared connections are 4 -> <4, 5, 6> forms a triangle.  
  - (5, 8): No triangle can be formed as 5 and 8 have 4 and 5 connections respectively.
  - (5, 4): Shared connections are 6 -> <4, 5, 6> forms a triangle.  
  - (9, 4): Shared connections are 7 -> <4, 7, 9> forms a triangle.  
  - (9, 7): Shared connections are 4 -> <4, 7, 9> forms a triangle.  
  - (9, 0): Shared connections are 1 -> <0, 1, 9> forms a triangle.  
  - (4, 5): Shared connections are 6 -> <4, 5, 6> forms a triangle.  
  - (4, 6): Shared connections are 5 -> <4, 5, 6> forms a triangle.  
  - (4, 7): Shared connections are 9 -> <4, 7, 9> forms a triangle.  

The total number of triangles is [6].
The unique triangles found are <4, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 7, 9>, <0, 1, 9>.
