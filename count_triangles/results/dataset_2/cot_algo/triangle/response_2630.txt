Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 14) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 14) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 14) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges can be represented as follows:

```
0 ---- 2
:      | \
:      |   \
5 --- 10 --- 14
:      |   / |  
:      | /   |
1 ----- 6 --- 11
:      | \
4 --- 7 - 8
:     /
9 --- 13
:     \
12 --- 3
```

By sorting the vertices by their degree, we get the following labeling: 

```
12(2) ---- 3(3)
:           |  \
:           |    \
9(4) --- 13(4) --- 14(4)
:           |    / |  
:           |  /   |
4(5) --- 8(5) --- 11(5)
:           /  \
0(5) --- 2(5) --- 6(5)
:           \
1(5) -------- 7(5) --- 10(5)
```

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's count the number of triangles:

1. Triangle <3, 8, 13>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
3. Triangle <2, 6, 10>
4. Triangle <6, 10, 14>
5. Triangle <4, 7, 8>
6. Triangle <7, 8, 13>

Total number of triangles: [6]

Triangles found:
<3, 8, 13>
<0, 2, 6>
<2, 6, 10>
<6, 10, 14>
<4, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 13>
