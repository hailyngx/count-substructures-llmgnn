Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 17) (4, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 14) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 12) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 19) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 1) (10, 15) (10, 19) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 1) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 18) (18, 15) (18, 9) (18, 12) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 16) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (1, 7) (1, 19) (1, 16) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: 
- Node 0: 4, 2, 8
- Node 1: 7, 5, 19, 16
- Node 2: 7, 8, 12, 0
- Node 3: 15, 16, 13
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 7, 19
- Node 6: 15, 17, 14
- Node 7: 2, 5, 1
- Node 8: 9, 2, 14, 0
- Node 9: 8, 18, 11, 12
- Node 10: 15, 19
- Node 11: 9, 13
- Node 12: 9, 2, 18
- Node 13: 3, 11, 14
- Node 14: 6, 8, 13
- Node 15: 3, 10, 18, 6, 17
- Node 16: 3, 17, 1
- Node 17: 15, 6, 16
- Node 18: 9, 12, 15
- Node 19: 5, 10, 1

Applying Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes sorted by degrees: 4, 10, 17, 19, 11, 0, 1, 18, 16, 3, 12, 14, 7, 5, 13, 9, 2, 8, 6, 15
