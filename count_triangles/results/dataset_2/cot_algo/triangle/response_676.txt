Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 19) (9, 18) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 15) (2, 3) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 15) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 19) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (7, 1) (19, 6) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 17) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 17) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 1) (17, 8) (17, 19) (17, 15) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: (11, 16), (11, 3), (11, 8), (11, 4), (16, 11), (6, 5), (6, 14), (6, 19), (9, 18), (8, 11), (8, 13), (8, 5), (8, 17), (8, 12), (13, 8), (13, 15), (2, 3), (18, 9), (18, 14), (18, 12), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 19), (5, 15), (0, 14), (0, 12), (14, 6), (14, 18), (14, 0), (14, 3), (14, 19), (3, 11), (3, 2), (3, 14), (3, 10), (7, 1), (19, 6), (19, 5), (19, 14), (19, 17), (10, 3), (10, 12), (10, 1), (1, 7), (1, 10), (1, 12), (4, 11), (4, 15), (15, 13), (15, 5), (15, 4), (15, 17), (12, 8), (12, 18), (12, 0), (12, 10), (12, 1), (17, 8), (17, 19), (17, 15)

Now, we will calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices by number of connections (degree):
0: 3
1: 3
2: 2
3: 5
4: 3
5: 5
6: 4
7: 2
8: 6
9: 2
10: 3
11: 4
12: 5
13: 3
14: 6
15: 5
16: 1
17: 3
18: 4
19: 4

Triangles found: 
[<3, 4, 11>, <3, 5, 15>, <3, 10, 12>, <3, 11, 14>, <3, 11, 16>, <3, 15, 17>, <4, 8, 11>, <4, 8, 15>, <5, 8, 15>, <5, 8, 17>, <5, 14, 19>, <6, 14, 19>, <8, 12, 14>, <8, 12, 18>, <8, 12, 1>, <8, 12, 10>, <8, 13, 15>, <8, 17, 19>, <12, 10, 1>, <12, 10, 3>]

Total number of triangles: [19]
