Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 13) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 14) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 0) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees from least to most and then relabeling them accordingly. 

Here is the list of vertices with their degrees:
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 6
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 5
Node 14: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 4

The edges to consider with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections are:
(4, 8), (2, 8), (2, 10), (2, 12), (7, 0), (2, 12), (2, 8)

Now, we count the triangles formed by these edges, and the total number of triangles is [12].

The triangles found are:
<4, 8, 12>, <2, 8, 12>, <2, 8, 10>, <0, 7, 13>, <2, 8, 12>, <2, 8, 12>, <4, 8, 12>, <2, 8, 12>, <4, 8, 12>, <0, 7, 13>, <0, 7, 13>, <2, 8, 10>
