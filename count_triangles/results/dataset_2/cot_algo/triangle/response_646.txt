Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 15) (14, 0) (14, 10) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 13) (1, 6) (1, 8) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 19) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 19) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 18) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 15) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (9, 4) (9, 17) (5, 3) (5, 18) (5, 10) (18, 6) (18, 15) (18, 8) (18, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 4) (17, 7) (17, 8) (17, 9) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (0, 14), (0, 3), (0, 15), (1, 6), (1, 8), (2, 7), (2, 12), (2, 19), (3, 0), (3, 11), (3, 6), (3, 5), (4, 9), (4, 13), (4, 10), (5, 3), (5, 18), (5, 10), (6, 3), (6, 1), (6, 18), (6, 19), (7, 12), (7, 10), (7, 2), (7, 13), (7, 17), (8, 12), (8, 1), (8, 17), (8, 18), (9, 4), (9, 17), (10, 7), (10, 14), (10, 4), (10, 5), (11, 3), (11, 13), (13, 7), (13, 11), (13, 4), (14, 0), (14, 10), (15, 0), (15, 19), (15, 18), (17, 7), (17, 8), (17, 9), (18, 6), (18, 15), (18, 8), (18, 5), (19, 6), (19, 2), (19, 15)

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degrees (number of connections):

Node 16 (Degree 0)
Node 1 (Degree 2)
Node 9 (Degree 2)
Node 14 (Degree 2)
Node 16 (Degree 2)
Node 5 (Degree 3)
Node 11 (Degree 3)
Node 12 (Degree 3)
Node 0 (Degree 3)
Node 13 (Degree 3)
Node 4 (Degree 3)
Node 15 (Degree 3)
Node 8 (Degree 4)
Node 10 (Degree 4)
Node 17 (Degree 4)
Node 2 (Degree 4)
Node 6 (Degree 4)
Node 3 (Degree 5)
Node 19 (Degree 4)
Node 7 (Degree 5)

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

Triangles: [49]

Unique triangles:
