Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 9) (15, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (2, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (17, 13) (17, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 19) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 0) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 16) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 6) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 14) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (14, 16) (14, 12) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 17) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in increasing order:
```
Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 3
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 3: degree 5
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 5: degree 5
Vertex 6: degree 4
Vertex 7: degree 5
Vertex 8: degree 3
Vertex 9: degree 5
Vertex 10: degree 3
Vertex 11: degree 4
Vertex 12: degree 3
Vertex 13: degree 5
Vertex 14: degree 2
Vertex 15: degree 3
Vertex 16: degree 3
Vertex 17: degree 3
Vertex 18: degree 4
Vertex 19: degree 4
```

2. Relabel the vertices according to their sorted degrees:
```
Vertex 0 -> Vertex 1
Vertex 1 -> Vertex 2
Vertex 2 -> Vertex 3
Vertex 3 -> Vertex 6
Vertex 4 -> Vertex 4
Vertex 5 -> Vertex 7
Vertex 6 -> Vertex 5
Vertex 7 -> Vertex 8
Vertex 8 -> Vertex 9
Vertex 9 -> Vertex 10
Vertex 10 -> Vertex 11
Vertex 11 -> Vertex 12
Vertex 12 -> Vertex 13
Vertex 13 -> Vertex 14
Vertex 14 -> Vertex 15
Vertex 15 -> Vertex 16
Vertex 16 -> Vertex 17
Vertex 17 -> Vertex 18
Vertex 18 -> Vertex 19
Vertex 19 -> Vertex 20
```

3. Count the number of triangles based on the relabeled vertices:
```
There are 8 triangles in the graph.
```

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
```
<7, 11, 14>
<5, 7, 16>
<5, 7, 11>
<5, 11, 14>
<5, 7, 6>
<11, 0, 4>
<5, 13, 17>
<9, 13, 17>
```
