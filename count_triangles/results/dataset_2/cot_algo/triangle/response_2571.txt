Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 10) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 11) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 2) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
Let's sort the nodes by their number of connections:

Node 7: Degree 1
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 10: Degree 2
Node 12: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 14: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 11: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 5

Now, let's search for triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Starting with the edge (6, 9): Check for shared connections. No triangle is formed.
2. Proceed to the edge (6, 5): Shared connection with node 3. Triangle found: <3, 5, 6>.
