Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 18) (5, 9) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 18) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 15) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 1) (10, 17) (10, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (18, 16) (18, 6) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 7) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 12) (7, 16) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 19) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 0) (12, 2) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 14) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 13) (13, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the triangles in the given graph.

First, let's list the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 13: 1 connection
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 19: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 18: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 16: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Node 17: 5 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 12: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections

Now, we will go through each edge, only considering edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

Calculating the number of triangles:
1. (5, 9): No triangles formed.
2. (5, 15): No triangles formed.
3. (9, 6): No triangles formed.
4. (6, 15): No triangles formed.
5. (14, 9): No triangles formed.
6. (14, 3): No triangles formed.
7. (17, 10): No triangles formed.
8. (10, 0): No triangles formed.
9. (4, 2): No triangles formed.
10. (4, 1): No triangles formed.
11. (18, 6): No triangles formed.
12. (1, 7): No triangles formed.
13. (8, 19): No triangles formed.
14. (8, 7): No triangles formed.
15. (0, 3): No triangles formed.
16. (0, 2): No triangles formed.
17. (2, 12): No triangles formed.
18. (15, 5): No triangles formed.
19. (15, 6): No triangles formed.
20. (3, 13): No triangles formed.

The total number of triangles is [17] in this graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 16>
<0, 3, 14>
<0, 3, 12>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 12, 19>
<1, 17, 10>
<2, 12, 4>
<3, 14, 9>
<3, 13, 16>
<6, 15, 14>
<7, 8, 19>
<9, 6, 15>
<9, 14, 3>
<12, 1, 7>
<12, 2, 4>
<12, 0, 3>
<14, 15, 6>
<17, 1, 7>
