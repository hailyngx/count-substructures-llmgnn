Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 15) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 19) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 12) (13, 10) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 2) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 18) (1, 2) (3, 19) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 18) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 18) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 10) (18, 15) (15, 16) (15, 4) (15, 18) 

Response:
The given edges can be represented as a graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges as follows:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(11, 19) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 15) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 15) (7, 16) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (9, 19) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 12) (13, 10) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 2) (19, 3) (2, 1) (17, 18) (3, 14)

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to find the number of triangles in the graph.
