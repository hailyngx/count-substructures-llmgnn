Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

1. Edge (0, 15) - Proceed
    Shared connections with 0 and 15: 2, 24
    Triangle found: <0, 2, 15>
2. Edge (0, 24) - Proceed
    Shared connections with 0 and 24: 15, 9
    Triangle found: <0, 15, 24>
3. Edge (27, 0) - Skip because vertex with lower label has more connections (both have 5 connections)
4. Edge (27, 18) - Proceed
    Shared connections with 27 and 18: 20
    Triangle found: <18, 20, 27>
5. Edge (27, 28) - Proceed
    Shared connections with 27 and 28: None
