Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (16, 22) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 19) (15, 22) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 25) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 28) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 29) (13, 9) (13, 27) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 20) (0, 12) (0, 6) (20, 0) (20, 2) (20, 28) (28, 7) (28, 20) (28, 18) (29, 13) (29, 1) (29, 21) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 22) (24, 22) (26, 2) (27, 4) (27, 13) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 17) (9, 25) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 26) (22, 16) (22, 15) (22, 17) (22, 24) (21, 29) (21, 14) (14, 11) (14, 21) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 25) (5, 12) (5, 25) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 6) (6, 0) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 23) (6, 1) (25, 4) (25, 9) (25, 14) (25, 5) (25, 12) (1, 8) (1, 29) (1, 6) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 25) (12, 18) (12, 23) (18, 28) (18, 14) (18, 12) (23, 14) (23, 6) (23, 12) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is: 

\(16 < 11 < 3 < 8 < 15 < 7 < 13 < 0 < 20 < 28 < 29 < 4 < 2 < 22 < 17 < 27 < 9 < 19 < 6 < 1 < 25 < 14 < 12 < 18 < 23 < 5 < 24 < 21\)

Therefore, we will consider the edges in the following order:
\(16 < 11\), \(3 < 7\), \(3 < 0\), \(3 < 19\), \(8 < 13\), \(15 < 22\), \(0 < 4\), \(0 < 20\), \(0 < 28\), \(16 < 22\), \(20 < 2\), \(7 < 4\), \(7 < 28\), \(13 < 29\), \(4 < 27\), \(2 < 26\), \(22 < 24\), \(17 < 6\), \(9 < 17\), \(25 < 5\), \(1 < 29\), \(6 < 23\), \(12 < 18\), \(14 < 21\).

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find that there are:

\[9\] triangles in the graph.

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 25>, <0, 6, 12>, <0, 6, 17>, <0, 6, 19>, <4, 25, 5>, <4, 27, 13>, <13, 9, 17>, <14, 18, 12>.
