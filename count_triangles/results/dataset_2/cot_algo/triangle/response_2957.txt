Response:
The given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: [(14, 17), (14, 3), (14, 10), (17, 14), (17, 13), (7, 12), (7, 0), (7, 5), (12, 7), (12, 19), (2, 9), (8, 19), (4, 18), (4, 11), (4, 6), (4, 15), (18, 4), (18, 6), (18, 1), (0, 7), (5, 7), (5, 13), (5, 16), (13, 17), (13, 5), (13, 15), (13, 6), (3, 14), (3, 11), (3, 10), (3, 9), (3, 19), (11, 4), (11, 3), (11, 19), (11, 9), (19, 12), (19, 8), (19, 3), (19, 11), (19, 1), (16, 5), (16, 1), (16, 9), (15, 4), (15, 13), (15, 6), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 11), (9, 16), (1, 18), (1, 19), (1, 16), (10, 14), (10, 3), (6, 4), (6, 18), (6, 13), (6, 15)]

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by their degree:
Vertex 0 - Degree 2
Vertex 2 - Degree 1
Vertex 8 - Degree 1
Vertex 16 - Degree 3
Vertex 17 - Degree 2
Vertex 14 - Degree 3
Vertex 10 - Degree 2
Vertex 7 - Degree 3
Vertex 12 - Degree 2
Vertex 1 - Degree 3
Vertex 5 - Degree 4
Vertex 13 - Degree 5
Vertex 3 - Degree 5
Vertex 11 - Degree 4
Vertex 19 - Degree 5
Vertex 9 - Degree 4
Vertex 6 - Degree 4
Vertex 4 - Degree 5
Vertex 18 - Degree 4
Vertex 15 - Degree 3

Triangles found:
Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles: <3, 5, 13>, <4, 6, 18>, <0, 7, 5>, <3, 11, 19>, <0, 7, 12>, <13, 5, 16>, <4, 15, 6>
