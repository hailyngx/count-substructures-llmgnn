Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 5) 

Response:
Given the list of edges, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (1, 7, 5)
- 1: (0, 3, 8, 9)
- 2: (4, 6, 8, 9)
- 3: (1, 4, 6, 8, 9)
- 4: (2, 3, 5, 7, 8)
- 5: (0, 4, 6)
- 6: (2, 3, 5, 9)
- 7: (0, 4)
- 8: (1, 2, 3, 4, 9)
- 9: (1, 2, 3, 6, 8)

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degree from the least connected to the most connected nodes:

Degree-based ordering:
0 (Degree 3)
7 (Degree 2)
5 (Degree 3)
4 (Degree 4)
2 (Degree 4)
1 (Degree 4)
3 (Degree 5)
6 (Degree 4)
8 (Degree 5)
9 (Degree 5)

Now we will list the triangles based on the shared connections between vertices:

Triangles:
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <1, 3, 8>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
