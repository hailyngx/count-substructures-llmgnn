Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's sort the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:

Nodes with degree 1: 0, 2, 9
Nodes with degree 2: 4, 5
Nodes with degree 3: 8
Nodes with degree 4: 7
Nodes with degree 5: 3, 6
Nodes with degree 6: 1

Now, we will count the triangles by looking at each edge and checking for shared neighbors:

Triangles: [10]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <3, 5, 7>
