Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to efficiently count the number of triangles in a graph. Let's follow the steps to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Count the number of connections for each node:
   - Node 0: 4 connections
   - Node 1: 3 connections
   - Node 2: 4 connections
   - Node 3: 4 connections
   - Node 4: 4 connections
   - Node 5: 4 connections
   - Node 6: 4 connections
   - Node 7: 3 connections
   - Node 8: 3 connections
   - Node 9: 4 connections
   - Node 10: 2 connections
   - Node 11: 3 connections
   - Node 12: 1 connection
   - Node 13: 4 connections
   - Node 14: 3 connections
   - Node 15: 4 connections
   - Node 16: 3 connections
   - Node 17: 5 connections
   - Node 18: 4 connections
   - Node 19: 4 connections
   - Node 20: 2 connections
   - Node 21: 4 connections
   - Node 22: 4 connections
   - Node 23: 3 connections
   - Node 24: 3 connections
   - Node 25: 4 connections
   - Node 26: 3 connections
   - Node 27: 3 connections
   - Node 28: 1 connection
   - Node 29: 4 connections

2. Relabel the nodes based on their connection counts:
   - Node 12 (1 connection) will be relabeled as 0
   - Node 10 (2 connections) will be relabeled as 1 and so on

3. List the edges with the lower labeled vertex first:
   [(0, 4), (0, 18), (0, 16), (0, 2), (1, 10), (1, 26), (1, 11), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 17), (2, 11), (3, 1), (3, 21), (3, 17), (4, 18), (4, 2), (4, 0), (5, 7), (5, 25), (5, 9), (5, 25), (6, 7), (6, 23), (6, 29), (7, 13), (7, 5), (8, 2), (8, 9), (9, 10), 
    (9, 14), (9, 5), (11, 26), (11, 2), (11, 27), (13, 7), (13, 18), (13, 17), (14, 15), (14, 9), (15, 16), (15, 21), (15, 17), (15, 14), (16, 0), (16, 18), (17, 27), (17, 13), (18, 22), (18, 16), (19, 12), (19, 27), (19, 23), (19, 24), (20, 24), (20, 25), 
    (21, 28), (21, 3), (21, 15), (22, 0), (22, 18), (22, 29), (23, 6), (23, 19), (23, 25), (24, 29), (24, 19), (24, 20), (25, 1), (25, 20), (25, 23), (26, 10), (26, 14), (26, 11), (27, 11), (27, 19), (27, 17), (28, 21), (29, 6), (29, 22), (29, 24)]

4. Count the triangles formed by these edges:
   - Triangles: 10
   
5. Output: 
   - The total number of triangles: [10]
   - Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 18>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 16, 18>, <0, 16, 2>, <0, 18, 22>, <2, 4, 18>, <4, 18, 22>, <5, 7, 13>, <15, 16, 18>, <19, 23, 27>
