Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 12) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 0) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 3) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 11) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 0) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed. Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 11: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will analyze the edges in the graph.

The triangles found are:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 11>
<0, 6, 11>
<1, 12, 13>
<1, 12, 11>
<1, 12, 14>
<1, 11, 14>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 7, 14>
<5, 8, 11>
<5, 8, 2>
<5, 8, 0>
<5, 10, 13>
<6, 7, 14>
<9, 1, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
