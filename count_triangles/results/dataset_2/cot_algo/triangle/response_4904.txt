Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 12) (8, 1) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 18) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 18) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 2) (7, 10) (7, 16) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 19) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 2) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (18, 13) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 5) (2, 17) (2, 15) (2, 5) (2, 6) (5, 16) (5, 2) (9, 3) (0, 1) (0, 17) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 0) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed as follows:

Nodes:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 

Edges:
1: {3, 15, 13, 0, 8}
3: {1, 10, 9, 12}
8: {1}
13: {1, 4, 18}
10: {3, 11, 17, 7}
11: {10, 19, 18}
17: {10, 0, 2}
7: {10, 16}
12: {3, 4, 19}
15: {1, 0, 2}
4: {13, 12, 0}
18: {13, 11, 19, 6}
19: {11, 12, 18, 16}
16: {7, 19, 5}
2: {17, 15, 5, 6}
5: {16, 2}
9: {3}
0: {1, 17, 15, 4, 6}
6: {18, 2, 0}

Next, we perform Degree-Based Ordering:

Nodes sorted by degree: 8, 9, 7, 5, 2, 16, 14, 3, 12, 13, 1, 10, 11, 17, 19, 15, 0, 4, 18, 6

Next, we list the triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 15]
<1, 10, 17>, <0, 6, 17>, <0, 4, 6>, <10, 11, 19>, <4, 12, 19>, <2, 5, 6>, <0, 4, 12>, <13, 18, 19>, <0, 4, 12>, <1, 3, 15>, <2, 6, 18>, <0, 15, 17>, <1, 13, 18>, <10, 11, 18>, <3, 9, 10>
