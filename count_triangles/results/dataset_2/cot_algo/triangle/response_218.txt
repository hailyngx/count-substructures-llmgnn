Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 10) (5, 8) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 14) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 0) 

Response:
The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
Node 0: Degree 6
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 6
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 10: Degree 7
Node 11: Degree 6
Node 12: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 6
Node 14: Degree 2

Next, we sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes in order: 6, 14, 5, 9, 3, 2, 8, 12, 0, 1, 4, 13, 11, 7, 10

After relabeling based on the degree order, the edges that can form triangles are:
(7, 10) with common edge 11, forming triangle <7, 10, 11>.
(7, 10) with common edge 0, forming triangle <7, 10, 0>.
(7, 10) with common edge 1, forming triangle <7, 10, 1>.
(7, 11) with common edge 10, forming triangle <7, 11, 10>.
(7, 11) with common edge 1, forming triangle <7, 11, 1>.
(9, 10) with common edge 1, forming triangle <9, 10, 1>.
(0, 10) with common edge 11, forming triangle <0, 10, 11>.
(0, 10) with common edge 1, forming triangle <0, 10, 1>.
(0, 11) with common edge 10, forming triangle <0, 11, 10>.
(0, 11) with common edge 1, forming triangle <0, 11, 1>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9], and the unique triangles found are <7, 10, 11>, <7, 10, 0>, <7, 10, 1>, <7, 11, 10>, <7, 11, 1>, <9, 10, 1>, <0, 10, 11>, <0, 10, 1>, <0, 11, 10>.
