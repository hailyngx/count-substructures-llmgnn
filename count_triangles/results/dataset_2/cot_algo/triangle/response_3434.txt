Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 5) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 6) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (4, 13) (4, 3) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 4) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (1, 0) (1, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort the nodes by their number of connections from least to most:  
Node 10: degree 4  
Node 11: degree 4  
Node 14: degree 4  
Node 8: degree 4  
Node 12: degree 4  
Node 0: degree 4  
Node 13: degree 5  
Node 5: degree 5  
Node 7: degree 5  
Node 9: degree 5  
Node 6: degree 5  
Node 3: degree 6  
Node 2: degree 5  
Node 1: degree 2  
Node 4: degree 3  

2. Relabel the nodes according to their degree in ascending order starting from 0:  
Node 1 (degree 2) --> Node 0  
Node 4 (degree 3) --> Node 1  
Node 10 (degree 4) --> Node 2  
Node 11 (degree 4) --> Node 3  
Node 14 (degree 4) --> Node 4  
Node 8 (degree 4) --> Node 5  
Node 12 (degree 4) --> Node 6  
Node 0 (degree 4) --> Node 7  
Node 13 (degree 5) --> Node 8  
Node 5 (degree 5) --> Node 9  
Node 7 (degree 5) --> Node 10  
Node 9 (degree 5) --> Node 11  
Node 6 (degree 5) --> Node 12  
Node 3 (degree 6) --> Node 13  
Node 2 (degree 5) --> Node 14  

3. Count the number of triangles:
[5]

Unique triangles found:  
<1, 12, 6>  
<6, 12, 3>  
<3, 12, 1>  
<1, 0, 9>  
<1, 0, 14>
