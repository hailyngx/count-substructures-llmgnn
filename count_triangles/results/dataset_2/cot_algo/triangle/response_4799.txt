Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 15) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 11) (0, 6) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 10) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 11) (19, 0) (19, 5) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 16) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 18) (2, 12) (2, 11) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 17) (3, 7) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 4) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 1) (17, 8) (17, 18) 

Response:
The nodes and edges of the graph can be represented as:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: {(0, 6), (0, 19), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 16), (1, 18), (2, 11), (2, 12), (3, 4), (3, 7), (4, 11), (4, 13), (4, 3), (5, 11), (5, 12), (5, 19), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 12), (7, 13), (7, 3), (10, 14), (10, 15), (10, 7), (11, 2), (11, 4), (11, 5), (11, 7), (12, 2), (12, 5), (12, 7), (12, 11), (13, 4), (13, 7), (14, 10), (14, 16), (15, 9), (15, 10), (15, 16), (16, 1), (16, 14), (16, 15), (17, 8), (17, 18), (18, 1), (18, 17), (18, 9), (19, 0), (19, 5)}

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes sorted by degree: [4, 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 18, 19, 10, 12, 14, 16, 1, 6, 9, 15, 17, 7, 11, 13]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles:
Total number of triangles: [11]

Unique triangles:
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 19>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 16>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 7, 11>
<5, 11, 12>
<7, 10, 14>
<10, 15, 16>
<11, 2, 12>
