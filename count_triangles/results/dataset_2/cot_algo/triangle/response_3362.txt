Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 1) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 24) (21, 16) (21, 0) (2, 29) (2, 16) (29, 2) (29, 6) (29, 0) (29, 24) (20, 25) (20, 27) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 16) (25, 28) (25, 10) (22, 23) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 14) (23, 3) (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 27) (28, 9) (28, 25) (28, 0) (28, 12) (17, 8) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 20) (19, 5) (19, 3) (19, 6) (18, 26) (18, 11) (16, 21) (16, 2) (16, 25) (16, 8) (6, 29) (6, 19) (6, 12) (3, 22) (3, 23) (3, 19) (3, 12) (0, 21) (0, 29) (0, 13) (0, 28) (0, 5) (8, 17) (8, 16) (8, 14) (8, 10) (14, 23) (14, 8) (14, 7) (10, 25) (10, 8) (10, 4) (27, 20) (27, 13) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 12) (7, 1) (7, 14) (4, 26) (4, 10) (4, 24) (24, 1) (24, 29) (24, 4) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted list of vertices along with their degrees is as follows:

(7, 2) (17, 2) (5, 3) (22, 3) (27, 3) (2, 4) (20, 4) (4, 4) (21, 4) (14, 4) (9, 4) (10, 4) (18, 4) (1, 4) (26, 4) (11, 4) (8, 4) (13, 4) (3, 4) (28, 4) (29, 4) (25, 4) (16, 4) (6, 4) (0, 5) (19, 5) (23, 5) (12, 5) (24, 5)

Based on this ordering, we will now count the triangles formed by shared connections. 

The total number of triangles is [30].

The unique triangles found are:
<9, 1, 28>
<1, 24, 4>
<21, 0, 29>
<20, 25, 16>
<22, 23, 3>
<26, 13, 0>
<27, 20, 13>
<3, 19, 6>
<8, 10, 25>
<14, 7, 1>
<11, 12, 28>
