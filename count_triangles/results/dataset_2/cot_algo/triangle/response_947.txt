Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 8) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 4) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 13) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 1) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 9) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their number of connections. Here is the sorted list of nodes:  

Node 7: degree 6  
Node 12: degree 4  
Node 11: degree 4  
Node 1: degree 4  
Node 14: degree 3  
Node 3: degree 3  
Node 8: degree 3  
Node 4: degree 4  
Node 9: degree 3  
Node 6: degree 3  
Node 10: degree 3  
Node 2: degree 4  
Node 0: degree 3  
Node 5: degree 3  
Node 13: degree 3  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check each edge where the lower labeled node has fewer connections. By doing so, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.  

The total number of triangles in the graph is [32].  

Here are the unique triangles found:  
<4, 11, 13>  
<0, 2, 4>  
<1, 4, 5>  
<0, 4, 10>  
<1, 4, 10>  
<1, 4, 11>  
<1, 5, 2>
