Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 7) (27, 3) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 18) (0, 27) (0, 17) (0, 22) (0, 5) (22, 0) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 2) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 17) (1, 20) (1, 14) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 29) (20, 28) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 24) (26, 22) (26, 13) (26, 5) (26, 10) (13, 26) (13, 12) (13, 25) (13, 16) (11, 2) (28, 20) (28, 9) (4, 27) (4, 6) (7, 15) (7, 25) (25, 13) (25, 7) (25, 10) (17, 0) (17, 23) (17, 5) (17, 8) (9, 28) (9, 29) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 5) (2, 22) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 16) (5, 0) (5, 26) (5, 17) (5, 29) (10, 26) (10, 25) (10, 6) (10, 8) (18, 27) (18, 14) (18, 6) (18, 21) (19, 2) (19, 12) (24, 14) (21, 18) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 12) (12, 22) (12, 13) (12, 19) (12, 8) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 18) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections in ascending order, and then re-labeling them accordingly.

Here is the sorted list of vertices with their respective degrees:
(3: 3),
(15: 3),
(27: 4),
(0: 4),
(22: 5),
(20: 4),
(14: 3),
(26: 4),
(13: 4),
(1: 2),
(23: 2),
(17: 4),
(2: 5),
(5: 5),
(10: 4),
(18: 4),
(19: 2),
(24: 1),
(21: 1),
(29: 3),
(9: 2),
(4: 2),
(7: 2),
(25: 3),
(11: 1),
(28: 2),
(6: 3),
(16: 3),
(12: 4),
(8: 3)

Now, we will go through the given edges, ensuring we only count triangles where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

<3, 15, 27>, <3, 15, 7>, <3, 15, 20>, <3, 15, 16>, 
<15, 20, 29>, <15, 20, 28>, 
<27, 0, 17>, <27, 0, 22>, <27, 0, 5>, 
<0, 22, 23>, <0, 22, 2>, <0, 22, 12>, 
<20, 1, 14>,
<22, 23, 17>, <22, 23, 5>, <22, 23, 17>, 
<1, 14, 18>, 
<1, 14, 24>, 
<26, 13, 12>, 
<26, 13, 25>, <26, 13, 16>, 
<13, 12, 19>, 
<28, 9, 29>, 
<10, 6, 4>, <10, 6, 18>, 
<18, 14, 24>, 
<12, 19, 2>, <12, 19, 16>, 

There are a total of 25 triangles in this graph.
