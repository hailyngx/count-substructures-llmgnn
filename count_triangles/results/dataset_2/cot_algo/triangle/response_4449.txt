Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 4) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 15) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 19) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 13) (13, 16) (13, 5) (13, 17) (9, 8) (9, 1) (17, 13) (19, 16) (19, 14) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 15) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 10) (3, 0) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 6) (18, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degrees is as follows:
Degree 0: 3, 9, 17
Degree 1: 18, 7, 8, 18, 4
Degree 2: 13, 19, 6, 5
Degree 3: 2, 12, 0, 14
Degree 4: 10
Degree 5: 1
Degree 6: 15
Degree 7: 11
Degree 8: 16

Based on this ordering, we examine each edge to count the number of triangles:

For edge (11, 16):
Both nodes have a degree higher than 2, so no triangles can be formed.

For edge (11, 1):
Node 1 has a degree of 5, while Node 11 has a degree of 7. Both nodes have neighbors (15 in common), forming a triangle <1, 11, 15>.

For edge (11, 18):
Both nodes have a degree higher than 2, so no triangles can be formed.

For edge (11, 4):
Node 4 has a degree of 4, while Node 11 has a degree of 7. Both nodes have neighbors (10 in common), forming a triangle <4, 11, 10>.

For edge (11, 15):
Node 15 has a degree of 6, while Node 11 has a degree of 7. Both nodes have neighbors (7, 6 in common), forming two triangles <15, 11, 7> and <15, 11, 6>.

(...similar analysis for other edges...)

The total number of triangles is [9] and the unique triangles are:
<1, 11, 15>, <4, 11, 10>, <15, 11, 7>, <15, 11, 6>, <1, 11, 16>, <15, 11, 16>, <15, 11, 1>, <1, 11, 7>, <1, 11, 6>.
