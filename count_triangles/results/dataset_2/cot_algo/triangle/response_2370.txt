Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 2) (16, 8) (16, 9) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 17) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 10) (3, 15) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 17) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 13) (7, 17) (10, 11) (10, 9) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 18) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 8) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 14) (2, 11) (2, 18) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 2) (8, 16) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 6) (19, 1) (19, 0) (0, 19) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (13, 7) (13, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Nodes sorted by their number of connections (degree):
Node 19: 2 connections
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 13: 2 connections
Node 16: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 17: 5 connections

Now, let's count the triangles:

Triangles: [8]
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 9, 15>
<4, 7, 17>
<4, 9, 15>
<5, 12, 3>
<5, 12, 1>
<5, 17, 7>
<8, 14, 6>
