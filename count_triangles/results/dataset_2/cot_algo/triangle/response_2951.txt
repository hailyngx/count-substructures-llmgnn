Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 14) (5, 19) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 1) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 2) (8, 16) (8, 19) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 0) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 18) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 19) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 1) (13, 12) (13, 1) (18, 11) (18, 0) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (17, 5) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be visualized as:
```
    0 -- 5 -- 19 -- 1 -- 13
    |    |    |    |    |
    12 -- 4 -- 10   2    |
    |    |    |    |    |
    18   3 -- 6 -- 9    15
         |    |    |    |
         7 -- 16   14   |
              |    |    |
              8    11   17
```

First, we sort the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes by degree: [(1, 3), (13, 3), (2, 3), (17, 1), (18, 2), (19, 3), (16, 4), (0, 3), (12, 3), (7, 5), (3, 4), (9, 3), (6, 4), (15, 3), (14, 3), (10, 3), (8, 3), (4, 3), (5, 5), (11, 2)]

Now, we relabel the nodes according to their degree:
New node labels: {17: 0, 11: 1, 18: 2, 4: 3, 10: 4, 16: 5, 1: 6, 13: 7, 2: 8, 19: 9, 0: 10, 15: 11, 9: 12, 7: 13, 14: 14, 8: 15, 3: 16, 12: 17, 6: 18, 5: 19}

Using the degree-based ordering method, we find the triangles in the graph:
- Triangles: [8]
- Unique triangles: <4, 5, 8>
