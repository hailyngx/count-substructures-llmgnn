Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. 

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new vertex labels should be as follows:
- Node 5: 0 connections (label: 1)
- Node 9: 1 connection (label: 2)
- Node 6: 2 connections (label: 3)
- Node 8: 2 connections (label: 4)
- Node 7: 2 connections (label: 5)
- Node 1: 3 connections (label: 6)
- Node 2: 3 connections (label: 7)
- Node 0: 4 connections (label: 8)
- Node 4: 5 connections (label: 9)
- Node 3: 6 connections (label: 10)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Triangle <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle <0, 3, 6>
- Triangle <0, 3, 8>
- Triangle <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle <0, 5, 3>
- Triangle <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle <1, 2, 3>
- Triangle <1, 2, 6>
- Triangle <3, 2, 6>
- Triangle <3, 2, 8>
- Triangle <3, 4, 7>
- Triangle <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle <3, 5, 9>
- Triangle <4, 7, 9>
