Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 0) (15, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 19) (17, 1) (17, 5) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 0) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 18) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 18) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 6) (18, 12) (18, 1) (18, 5) (6, 15) (6, 19) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 13) (2, 0) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 16) (16, 9) (16, 4) (4, 11) (4, 16) 

Response:
Based on the given graph information, the degrees of each node are as follows:
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 16: 2 connections
Node 17: 3 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 19: 3 connections

Sorting the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following relabeling:
Node 2, Node 4, Node 6, Node 16
Node 1, Node 5, Node 17, Node 18, Node 12, Node 14, Node 8
Node 3, Node 7, Node 10, Node 0, Node 19
Node 11, Node 13, Node 15, Node 9

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine the edges and count the triangles formed:

Triangles:
<3, 11, 4>
<3, 15, 7>
<3, 15, 0>
<3, 15, 6>
<8, 11, 4>
<8, 13, 10>
<13, 19, 5>
<7, 15, 0>
<1, 17, 5>
<1, 14, 12>
<2, 13, 19>
<9, 15, 14>

Total number of triangles: [12]
