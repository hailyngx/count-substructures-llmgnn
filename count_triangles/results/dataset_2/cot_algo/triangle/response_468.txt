Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 5) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 14) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 10) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 5) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 4) 

Response:
For this graph, we will first assign labels to each node based on their degree in ascending order. The nodes are as follows with their corresponding degrees:
(3: 3) (9: 4) (5: 4) (4: 6) (11: 4) (0: 5) (13: 4) (8: 4) (1: 3) (2: 3) (12: 5) (6: 4) (14: 3) (7: 4) (10: 3)

Now, let's list the edges in the format where the lower labeled vertex comes first:
(3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 14) (7, 10) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 13) (12, 13)

Next, we will count the triangles formed by shared connections between the vertices:

Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 12>
<2, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 9>
<6, 7, 14>
<7, 10, 14>
<8, 9, 11>
<10, 7, 2>
<11, 13, 12>
<12, 13, 4>
