Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
