Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 10) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 14) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 13) 

Response:
The given graph has the following edges:
- (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) 
- (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) 
- (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 2) 
- (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) 
- (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) 
- (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) 
- (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 
- (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 10) 
- (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 12) 
- (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 10) 
- (12, 11) (12, 13) 
- (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) 
- (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 14) 
- (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 13)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices and their degrees:
- Node 6: 1
- Node 12: 2
- Node 8: 3
- Node 10: 3
- Node 2: 4
- Node 5: 4
- Node 11: 4
- Node 12: 4
- Node 0: 5
- Node 9: 5
- Node 13: 5
- Node 1: 6
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 6
- Node 7: 6

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The total number of triangles is [12].

The unique triangles are:
<1, 2, 14>
<1, 10, 14>
<1, 8, 10>
<1, 8, 14>
<1, 8, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<3, 2, 1>
<3, 2, 5>
<3, 2, 14>
<14, 4, 5>
<14, 4, 11>
<14, 5, 10>
