Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 14) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 10) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 10) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 14) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:  

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}  
Edges:  
- 0: {7, 11, 4}  
- 1: {5, 6, 2, 7, 12, 10}  
- 2: {9, 1, 7, 11}  
- 3: {9, 6, 12, 11, 10}  
- 4: {6, 13, 0}  
- 5: {9, 1}  
- 6: {1, 3, 4}  
- 7: {2, 12, 0, 14, 1}  
- 8: {9, 14}  
- 9: {5, 8, 2, 11, 3}  
- 10: {12, 13, 3, 1, 14}  
- 11: {9, 2, 12, 3, 0}  
- 12: {7, 13, 10, 11, 3, 1}  
- 13: {12, 4, 10}  
- 14: {8, 7, 10}  

Now, we will label the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order:  
Nodes by degrees: {0, 5, 8, 4, 6, 13, 10, 9, 14, 1, 2, 3, 7, 12, 11}  

Now, we will count the number of triangles based on the degree-based ordering:  
Triangles: [9]  
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 6> <1, 3, 12> <1, 7, 12> <1, 10, 14> <2, 9, 11> <3, 9, 11> <3, 10, 12> <4, 6, 13> <7, 10, 12>
