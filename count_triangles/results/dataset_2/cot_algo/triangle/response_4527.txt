Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 4) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 1) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 3) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree. The degrees of each node are as follows:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 6
Node 10: degree 5
Node 11: degree 5
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4

The nodes sorted by degree are:
Nodes in order: 6, 7, 0, 13, 12, 14, 5, 8, 3, 1, 2, 4, 10, 11, 9
