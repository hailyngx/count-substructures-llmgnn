Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (3, 12) (15, 11) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 9) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 8) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 1) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 0) (19, 14) (19, 18) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 6) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 10) (9, 7) (9, 17) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:
```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (3, 16) (3, 12) (15, 11) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 9) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 8) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 1) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 0) (19, 14) (19, 18) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 6) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 10) (9, 7) (9, 17)
```

Now, let's list the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices by degree: 
```
Vertex 15: Degree 1
Vertex 8: Degree 1
Vertex 19: Degree 2
Vertex 10: Degree 2
Vertex 0: Degree 3
Vertex 2: Degree 3
Vertex 5: Degree 3
Vertex 6: Degree 3
Vertex 9: Degree 3
Vertex 12: Degree 3
Vertex 16: Degree 3
Vertex 1: Degree 4
Vertex 11: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 4
Vertex 17: Degree 4
Vertex 14: Degree 5
Vertex 18: Degree 6
Vertex 4: Degree 7
Vertex 7: Degree 7
Vertex 13: Degree 7
```

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through each edge to count the number of triangles. 

After counting, the total number of triangles is [28]. 
The unique triangles found are:
```
<1, 6, 11>
<1, 6, 13>
<1, 7, 13>
<1, 11, 0>
<1, 11, 13>
<2, 12, 18>
<4, 5, 13>
<5, 13, 18>
<7, 13, 14>
<9, 7, 17>
<9, 17, 14>
<0, 11, 13>
<11, 10, 16>
<11, 1, 6>
<11, 1, 7>
<11, 1, 13>
<11, 0, 14>
<11, 13, 0>
<13, 0, 14>
<13, 4, 7>
<13, 4, 12>
