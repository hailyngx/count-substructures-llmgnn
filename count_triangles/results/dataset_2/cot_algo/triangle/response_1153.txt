Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with nodes and edges first:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (9, 0), (9, 6), (6, 0)
- 1: (9, 1), (6, 1)
- 2: (5, 2), (6, 2), (4, 2), (0, 2)
- 3: (5, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3)
- 4: (4, 8), (4, 2)
- 5: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (9, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (3, 5)
- 6: (9, 6), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 0), (7, 6), (0, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6)
- 7: (6, 7), (7, 3), (7, 8), (8, 7)
- 8: (9, 8), (4, 8), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 3)
- 9: (5, 9), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)

Next, we will sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) from least to most:

Vertices by degree: 4, 1, 3, 7, 2, 8, 0, 9, 6, 5

Now, we will relabel the vertices:

Relabeled vertices: 
4 (0), 1 (1), 3 (2), 7 (3), 2 (4), 8 (5), 0 (6), 9 (7), 6 (8), 5 (9)

We will now apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:

Triangles []
- Total triangles: [6]

Unique triangles <>
<5, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<7, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 2, 5>
