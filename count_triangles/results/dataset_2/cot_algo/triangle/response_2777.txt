Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 2) (11, 19) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 14) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 3) (16, 15) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (9, 0) (9, 19) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 13) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 16) (15, 19) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 13) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 12) (3, 18) (3, 13) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 18) (13, 4) (13, 16) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections each vertex has. Here are the vertices sorted in increasing order of connections:

0 (degree 2)
11 (degree 2)
18 (degree 2)
9 (degree 2)
10 (degree 2)
12 (degree 2)
7 (degree 3)
5 (degree 3)
6 (degree 3)
1 (degree 3)
19 (degree 4)
8 (degree 4)
17 (degree 4)
4 (degree 5)
2 (degree 5)
16 (degree 5)
13 (degree 6)
15 (degree 6)
14 (degree 6)
3 (degree 7)

Now we will check for triangles by looking at the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found:
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 12>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 17>
<2, 10, 12>
<4, 8, 15>
<7, 14, 15>
<13, 16, 18>
<13, 18, 19>

Total number of triangles: [9]
