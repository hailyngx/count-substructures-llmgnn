Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 10) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 19) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (7, 6) (7, 17) (12, 5) (12, 14) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 14) (18, 11) (18, 4) (0, 8) (5, 17) (5, 12) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 17) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 17) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 4) (2, 15) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges:
- 0: {8}
- 1: {11, 16, 17, 6}
- 2: {15}
- 3: {11, 15, 4}
- 4: {3, 18, 14}
- 5: {12, 17}
- 6: {9, 1, 7, 13, 8}
- 7: {6, 17}
- 8: {0, 6, 9}
- 9: {6, 8, 19}
- 10: {16, 17, 14}
- 11: {1, 16, 3, 18}
- 12: {5, 14}
- 13: {16, 15, 6}
- 14: {10, 12, 4}
- 15: {3, 19, 13, 2}
- 16: {11, 1, 13, 10}
- 17: {10, 1, 5, 7, 19}
- 18: {11, 4}
- 19: {15, 9, 17}

Degree-Based Ordering:
- Node ordering: {0, 2, 5, 7, 12, 18, 19, 4, 14, 8, 9, 3, 13, 10, 6, 1, 17, 15, 16, 11}

Triangles:
[<1, 17, 10>, <1, 17, 14>, <1, 17, 5>, <1, 6, 13>, <1, 6, 17>, <1, 11, 16>, <1, 11, 3>, <1, 16, 11>, <1, 16, 13>, <17, 5, 12>, <17, 5, 7>, <17, 10, 14>, <17, 10, 16>, <16, 11, 13>, <19, 9, 17>, <9, 6, 13>, <4, 18, 11>, <4, 18, 14>, <17, 10, 1>, <15, 19, 9>, <15, 13, 6>]
