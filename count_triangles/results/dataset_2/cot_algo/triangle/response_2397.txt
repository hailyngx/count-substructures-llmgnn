Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 7) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 6) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 13) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 5) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 6) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 12, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 14, and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 10, 12, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 10, 0, 9, 4, and 13.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 12, 3, 1, and 14.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 10, 11, 0, 1, and 5.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 10, 8, 7, 14, and 13.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 11, 9, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 3, 1.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 3, 6, 12, 2, and 5.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 13, 5, 8.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 10, 2, 0, 4, 13, 14.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 11, 12, 3, and 6.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 12, 6, and 1.

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

We will order the vertices based on the number of connections in ascending order: <1, 7, 9, 0, 8, 4, 5, 2, 13, 14, 3, 6, 10, 11, 12>.

Counting the triangles and listing them only once:
- Total number of triangles: [18]
- Unique triangles: <0, 2, 10>, <0, 3, 12>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 5, 10>, <1, 4, 14>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 9, 14>, <3, 4, 12>, <3, 4, 13>, <4, 12, 14>, <4, 12, 13>, <4, 12, 3>, <5, 10, 11>, <6, 10, 13>, <6, 10, 12>, <6, 10, 3>, <6, 12, 13>, <6, 13, 11>.
