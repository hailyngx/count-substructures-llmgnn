Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph in a more readable format:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (7, 1), (1, 7), (8, 0), (0, 8)
- 1: (9, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (0, 1), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 5)
- 2: (6, 2), (9, 2), (4, 2), (7, 2), (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 3)
- 3: (6, 3), (4, 3), (2, 3), (3, 6)
- 4: (6, 4), (7, 4), (1, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (4, 6), (4, 7)
- 5: (6, 5), (1, 5), (8, 5), (5, 6)
- 6: (9, 6), (5, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), (4, 6), (6, 9)
- 7: (9, 7), (4, 7), (0, 7), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 2)
- 8: (6, 8), (0, 8), (8, 6), (8, 0), (8, 5)
- 9: (6, 9), (9, 6), (2, 9), (1, 9), (9, 2), (9, 1), (7, 9)

Next, we sort the nodes by the number of connections they have:

Nodes sorted by their degree:
0: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
5: 4 connections
8: 5 connections
7: 6 connections
1: 7 connections
9: 7 connections
4: 7 connections
2: 9 connections
6: 9 connections

Now, we can use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:

[Number of triangles: 10]

Unique triangles:
<7, 9, 1>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<8, 0, 5>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 1, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<6, 9, 2>
