Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 13) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows:
Vertices: 8, 2, 7, 6, 13, 1, 5, 3, 12, 15, 16, 4, 9, 10, 11

Calculating the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (5, 12):
   The vertex with the lower label (5) has 3 connections: 0, 11, 12
   The other vertex (12) has 5 connections: 3, 5, 6, 7, 13
   Shared connections: 5, 12, 3
   Triangle formed: <5, 12, 3>

2. Edge (5, 11):
   The vertex with the lower label (5) has 3 connections: 0, 11, 12
   The other vertex (11) has 4 connections: 9, 10, 11, 14
   Shared connections: 11, 5
   Triangle formed: <5, 11, 9>

3. Edge (5, 0):
   The vertex with the lower label (0) has 4 connections: 1, 4, 7, 5
   The other vertex (5) has 3 connections: 11, 12, 0
   Shared connections: 5, 0
   Triangle formed: <5, 0, 1>

The total number of triangles is [3].
The unique triangles found are: <5, 12, 3>, <5, 11, 9>, <5, 0, 1>.
