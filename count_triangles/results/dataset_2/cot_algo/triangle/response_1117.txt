Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 17) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 4) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 16) (4, 2) (4, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (17, 1) (17, 11) (17, 15) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 15) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 6) (15, 17) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 12) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 14) (14, 19) (14, 6) (14, 12) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 0) (16, 18) (16, 13) (12, 10) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we need to first sort the nodes by their degrees. Then we will go through each edge and find the triangles formed by shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

Here is the sorted list of nodes by their degrees:
Nodes: (node, degree)
(7, 2), (4, 2), (8, 2), (9, 3), (10, 2), (13, 3), (14, 3), (16, 2), (18, 3), (2, 3), (5, 3), (6, 4), (1, 4), (3, 4), (17, 3), (0, 4), (11, 3), (12, 4), (15, 4), (19, 3)

Now, we will go through each edge to count the triangles:

Triangles: 
[10]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 3, 17>, <1, 15, 19>, <1, 17, 11>, <1, 7, 3>, <11, 17, 15>, <9, 0, 13>, <9, 2, 4>, <0, 12, 15>, <12, 14, 19>, <6, 13, 16>
