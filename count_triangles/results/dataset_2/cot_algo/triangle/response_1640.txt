Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 5) (11, 8) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 16) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 16) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 4) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 15) (7, 0) (7, 16) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 9) (12, 18) (18, 1) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 13) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 17) (19, 18) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 9) (15, 0) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 14) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 18) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: 
(0, 15), (0, 16), (0, 17), (0, 7), 
(1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 18),
(2, 13), (2, 16), (2, 19), (2, 8),
(3, 4), (3, 10),
(4, 9), (4, 10), (4, 17),
(5, 6), (5, 10), (5, 18),
(6, 13),
(7, 16),
(8, 11), (8, 16),
(9, 14), (9, 16),
(10, 19), 
(11, 8),
(12, 18),
(13, 18),
(14, 9),
(16, 7), 
(17, 19)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

Nodes by degree: 
Node 15: 1
Node 12: 1
Node 14: 1
Node 11: 1
Node 6: 1
Node 7: 1
Node 5: 2
Node 3: 2
Node 2: 4
Node 1: 3
Node 13: 3
Node 0: 4
Node 11: 1
Node 14: 1
Node 9: 4
Node 8: 4
Node 4: 5
Node 10: 4
Node 17: 4
Node 18: 5
Node 16: 5
Node 19: 5

Next, we will count the triangles formed in the graph:

Triangles: [<10, 3, 4>, <2, 8, 16>, <4, 9, 14>, <18, 13, 2>, <1, 8, 11>, <4, 9, 16>, <4, 17, 19>, <9, 1, 18>, <9, 4, 16>, <18, 5, 10>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
