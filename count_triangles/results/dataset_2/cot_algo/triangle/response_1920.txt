Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 4) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 2) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degrees is: 

Node 0: 4 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 12: 5 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 3: 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:

1. For the edge (0, 2): Node 0 has 4 connections and Node 2 has 4 connections. Both have the same number of connections, so proceed.
2. For the edge (0, 5): Node 0 has 4 connections and Node 5 has 4 connections. Both have the same number of connections, so proceed.
3. For the edge (0, 12): Node 0 has 4 connections and Node 12 has 5 connections. Since Node 0 has fewer connections, proceed.
    Check for shared connections between Node 0 and Node 12: (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) - Forming a triangle <0, 7, 12>.

... (continue checking other edges) ...

Total number of triangles found: [6]

Unique triangles: <0, 7, 12>, <0, 5, 12>, <5, 6, 10>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 10, 11>, <6, 10, 12>.
