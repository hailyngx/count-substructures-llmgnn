Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 18) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 8) (0, 4) (0, 18) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 10) (1, 17) (1, 7) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 19) (17, 7) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 8) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 12) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 18) (8, 14) (8, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 2) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 10) (7, 1) (7, 17) (2, 10) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) from least to most. Based on the provided edges, the sorted vertices are: 

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 10: 4 connections
Vertex 11: 2 connections
Vertex 12: 3 connections
Vertex 13: 5 connections
Vertex 14: 3 connections
Vertex 15: 2 connections
Vertex 16: 3 connections
Vertex 17: 4 connections
Vertex 18: 3 connections
Vertex 19: 3 connections

Now we'll identify the triangles using the sorted vertices and edges. 

Triangles found in the graph:

[Total number of triangles: 37]
<4, 13, 17>, <6, 8, 9>, <0, 4, 18>, <0, 8, 18>, <3, 9, 12>, <3, 9, 15>, <3, 12, 6>, <3, 15, 18>, <9, 13, 17>, <9, 6, 8>, <13, 16, 17>, <13, 4, 17>, <13, 12, 6>, <13, 12, 3>, <13, 17, 6>, <13, 17, 19>, <15, 18, 3>, <0, 10, 18>, <0, 14, 18>, <6, 12, 3>, <6, 12, 13>, <6, 8, 14>, <6, 8, 17>, <9, 8, 6>, <9, 8, 14>, <9, 8, 17>, <9, 16, 13>, <9, 13, 12>, <10, 14, 8>, <10, 14, 19>, <10, 4, 13>, <10, 2, 14>, <14, 8, 17>, <17, 1, 7>, <17, 6, 8>, <17, 6, 13>
