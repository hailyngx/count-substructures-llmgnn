Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 2) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 9) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 14) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 1) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 10) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 1) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree, so let's first calculate the degree of each vertex in the graph:

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 5
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 4

Now, we will relabel the nodes in ascending order of their degrees:
- Node 5: label 0
- Node 6: label 1
- Node 7: label 2
- Node 12: label 3
- Node 0: label 4
- Node 4: label 5
- Node 11: label 6
- Node 8: label 7
- Node 14: label 8
- Node 2: label 9
- Node 9: label 10
- Node 3: label 11
- Node 13: label 12
- Node 1: label 13
- Node 10: label 14

Next, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:
[10]  

<0, 5, 13>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 11>
<0, 7, 10>
<1, 8, 13>
<1, 13, 14>
<2, 6, 14>
<2, 9, 10>
<3, 9, 11>
<3, 9, 12>
