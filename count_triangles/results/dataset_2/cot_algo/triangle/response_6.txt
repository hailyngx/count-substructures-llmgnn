Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, let's first construct the graph with the provided edges:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (5, 6), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 7), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 0), (2, 8), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 0), (8, 9), (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 7), (8, 1), (0, 6), (0, 2), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 4), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 1), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 8), (1, 7), (3, 9), (3, 2), (3, 0), (3, 7), (3, 4), (4, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3)

Next, we sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes by degree: 5, 4, 9, 1, 2, 7, 8, 3, 6, 0

Now, we will check each edge to count the triangles. We will only count triangles where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Trianges: 
1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <0, 2, 1>
3. <0, 6, 4>
4. <0, 6, 1>
5. <0, 6, 5>
6. <0, 8, 7>
7. <0, 8, 1>
8. <1, 2, 8>
9. <1, 7, 8>
10. <2, 3, 9>
11. <2, 8, 9>
12. <3, 4, 0>
13. <3, 7, 0>
14. <4, 6, 0>
15. <6, 5, 0>
16. <7, 8, 0>
17. <7, 1, 0>
18. <8, 9, 0>

Total number of triangles: [18]
