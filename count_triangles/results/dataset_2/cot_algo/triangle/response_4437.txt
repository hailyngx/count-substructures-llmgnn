Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 9) (1, 13) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 10) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 11) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 2) (19, 13) (19, 14) (9, 16) (9, 2) (12, 18) (12, 15) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 17) (15, 12) (15, 14) (18, 1) (18, 12) (14, 19) (14, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most, relabeling the vertices accordingly, and then checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge to count triangles.

Here is the list of unique triangles found along with the total number of triangles in the given graph:

Vertices sorted by degree (number of connections):
Vertices: 19, 12, 9, 0, 8, 3, 7, 4, 5, 1, 15, 14, 18, 16, 10, 11, 13, 6, 17, 2

Unique triangles (<vertex1, vertex2, vertex3>):
<13, 1, 7>
<13, 1, 5>
<1, 7, 2>
