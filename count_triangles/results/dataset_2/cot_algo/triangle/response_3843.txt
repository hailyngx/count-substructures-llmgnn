Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 12) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, the Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degrees and then counting the triangles.

The nodes and their degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 3

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted list of nodes is:
0 < 10 < 14 < 8 < 9 < 11 < 12 < 6 < 13 < 4 < 3 < 1 < 5 < 7 < 2

Using this ordering, we will count the number of triangles:

Calculating the triangles:
- For (0, 1):
    - Shared connections: None
- For (0, 3):
    - Shared connections: 1
- For (0, 1):
    - Shared connections: None
- For (0, 3):
    - Shared connections: 1
- For (1, 3):
    - Shared connections: 6
    - Triangle: <1, 3, 6>
- For (1, 6):
    - Shared connections: 5
    - Triangle: <1, 5, 6>
- For (3, 6):
    - Shared connections: 5
    - Triangle: <3, 5, 6>

Total number of triangles: [3]

The unique triangles found are: <1, 3, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 6>.
