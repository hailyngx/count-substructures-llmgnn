Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 22) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 28) (9, 11) (2, 29) (2, 16) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 14) (18, 12) (18, 25) (22, 5) (22, 9) (22, 8) (15, 16) (15, 24) (20, 12) (4, 10) (28, 9) (28, 29) (28, 0) (28, 13) (17, 3) (17, 21) (17, 7) (19, 5) (19, 29) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 6) (16, 2) (16, 15) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 14) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 8) (6, 19) (6, 14) (23, 25) (23, 10) (26, 21) (26, 27) (26, 7) (21, 17) (21, 16) (21, 26) (21, 11) (21, 25) (0, 28) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 8) (24, 2) (24, 15) (24, 16) (11, 9) (11, 21) (14, 29) (14, 16) (14, 6) (14, 10) (27, 29) (27, 26) (12, 18) (12, 20) (12, 1) (13, 28) (25, 18) (25, 23) (25, 21) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 26) (7, 8) (10, 4) (10, 23) (10, 14) (8, 22) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges is as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 19), (5, 22), (5, 3), (9, 22), (9, 28), (9, 11), (2, 29), (2, 16), (2, 24), (29, 28), (29, 27), (29, 19), (29, 14), (18, 12), (18, 25), (22, 8), (15, 16), (15, 24), (20, 12), (4, 10), (28, 0), (28, 13), (17, 21), (17, 7), (19, 1), (19, 6), (16, 21), (16, 14), (1, 8), (6, 14), (23, 25), (23, 10), (26, 27), (26, 11)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes sorted by degree: [0, 4, 13, 18, 5, 15, 20, 23, 6, 7, 10, 12, 1, 2, 3, 8, 14, 19, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 9, 11, 16, 22, 28, 29, 17]

Now, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles:
Total number of triangles: [40]

Unique triangles:
<7, 8, 19>
<7, 8, 21>
<7, 14, 16>
<10, 14, 16>
<10, 14, 29>
<10, 16, 21>
<10, 21, 25>
<11, 21, 26>
<12, 18, 25>
<16, 21, 25>
<16, 21, 26>
<16, 24, 15>
<16, 24, 2>
<16, 24, 21>
<18, 25, 21>
<19, 7, 14>
<19, 7, 21>
<19, 7, 8>
<19, 14, 29>
<19, 21, 16>
<20, 12, 18>
<22, 5, 9>
<23, 10, 14>
<23, 10, 4>
<24, 15, 16>
<24, 16, 14>
<25, 18, 12>
<26, 21, 17>
<26, 21, 16>
<26, 27, 29>
<29, 14, 16>
