Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 1) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 19) (10, 16) (15, 10) (15, 19) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 14) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 5) (11, 2) (11, 6) (11, 0) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 3) (14, 19) (14, 6) (14, 16) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 3) (13, 1) (16, 10) (16, 14) (0, 11) (0, 5) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 17), (4, 2), (7, 4), (7, 12), (7, 19), (7, 10), (7, 9), (12, 7), (12, 2), (12, 3), (2, 4), (2, 12), (2, 8), (2, 11), (8, 2), (8, 1), (10, 7), (10, 15), (10, 19), (10, 16), (15, 10), (15, 19), (19, 7), (19, 10), (19, 15), (19, 14), (1, 8), (1, 6), (1, 13), (6, 1), (6, 14), (6, 3), (6, 11), (17, 4), (17, 9), (17, 5), (11, 2), (11, 6), (11, 0), (5, 17), (5, 0), (5, 3), (14, 19), (14, 6), (14, 16), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 17), (9, 3), (13, 1), (16, 10), (16, 14), (0, 11), (0, 5), (3, 12), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 9)

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Sorting vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
  Nodes with their degrees: {0: 2, 1: 3, 18: 0, 19: 4, 17: 3, 16: 2, 15: 2, 14: 3, 13: 1, 12: 3, 11: 3, 10: 4, 9: 4, 8: 2, 7: 4, 6: 4, 5: 3, 4: 4, 3: 4, 2: 4}

- Relabeling the vertices based on their degrees:
  Relabeled nodes (in ascending order of degrees): {18: 0, 13: 1, 16: 2, 8: 3, 0: 4, 1: 5, 15: 6, 6: 7, 5: 8, 11: 9, 12: 10, 17: 11, 14: 12, 2: 13, 3: 14, 7: 15, 10: 16, 9: 17, 19: 18, 4: 19}

- Counting triangles:
  - Triangles: [37] 
  - Unique triangles: <2, 4, 19>, <4, 10, 17>, <1, 3, 12>, <4, 9, 17>, <3, 6, 14>, <7, 10, 19>, <2, 12, 3>, <2, 6, 14>, <10, 14, 19>, <7, 9, 17>, <12, 2, 8>, <9, 3, 6>, <1, 6, 14>, <4, 7, 9>, <10, 16, 14>, <6, 14, 16>, <7, 12, 2>, <10, 15, 19>, <2, 11, 6>, <5, 9, 17>, <5, 14, 19>, <4, 7, 12>, <7, 9, 3>, <18, 1, 8>, <8, 2, 11>, <0, 11, 2>, <0, 5, 3>, <3, 5, 17>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 8, 2>, <1, 6, 3>, <1, 13, 6>, <3, 12, 2>, <15, 10, 19>, <12, 3, 6>, <11, 2, 6>
