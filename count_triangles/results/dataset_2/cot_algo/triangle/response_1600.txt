Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 6) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 9) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 3) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 2) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 6) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 9) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 3) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 2) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0)

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:

Nodes by degree (from least to most connections):
{2, 3, 0, 12, 8, 5, 4, 10, 1, 9, 6, 14, 7, 13, 11}

Edges to consider based on the above ordering:
(0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 14) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 14) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (12, 7) (12, 9) (12, 14) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 3)

Counting the triangles:
There are a total of [6] triangles.
Unique triangles found: <0, 6, 2>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 6>, <5, 6, 11>, <9, 12, 7>, <11, 13, 6>.
