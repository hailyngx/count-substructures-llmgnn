Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 9) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 9) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 10) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
The graph with the sorted vertices and corresponding degrees is as follows:

Vertices:  
0 (degree 4)  
2 (degree 5)  
6 (degree 3)  
8 (degree 3)  
13 (degree 3)  
7 (degree 4)  
1 (degree 5)  
12 (degree 5)  
14 (degree 4)  
3 (degree 4)  
5 (degree 4)  
11 (degree 5)  
9 (degree 6)  
4 (degree 6)  
10 (degree 3)  

Based on this ordering, we will count the number of triangles:

1. For the edge (4, 7), vertices 4 and 7 share connections with vertices 5 and 11 forming the triangle <4, 5, 11>.
2. For the edge (4, 5), no triangle is formed.
3. For the edge (4, 1), no triangle is formed.
4. For the edge (4, 11), no triangle is formed.
5. For the edge (4, 3), vertices 4 and 3 share connection with vertex 1 forming the triangle <3, 4, 1>.
6. For the edge (7, 4), no triangle is formed.
7. For the edge (7, 12), no triangle is formed.
8. For the edge (7, 0), no triangle is formed.
9. For the edge (7, 5), vertices 7 and 5 share connection with vertex 11 forming the triangle <5, 7, 11>.
10. For the edge (1, 4), no triangle is formed.
11. For the edge (1, 3), vertices 1 and 3 share connection with vertices 11 and 9 forming the triangle <1, 3, 9>.
12. For the edge (1, 2), vertices 1 and 2 share connection with vertex 12 forming the triangle <1, 2, 12>.
13. For the edge (1, 14), vertices 1 and 14 share connection with vertices 0 and 6 forming the triangle <1, 14, 6>.
14. For the edge (1, 12), no triangle is formed.
15. For the edge (3, 4), no triangle is formed.
16. For the edge (3, 1), no triangle is formed.
17. For the edge (3, 11), no triangle is formed.
18. For the edge (3, 9), vertices 3 and 9 share connection with vertex 11 forming the triangle <3, 9, 11>.

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [4].
