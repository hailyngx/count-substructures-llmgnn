Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 15) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 17) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 3) (10, 6) (10, 13) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 11) (3, 19) (3, 17) (3, 16) (17, 0) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 11) (11, 0) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 17) (7, 18) (7, 14) (7, 15) (7, 13) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 7) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 12) (1, 19) (1, 4) (16, 2) (16, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be used to count the triangles in the given graph:

- Sort the vertices based on the number of connections:
Node 12: 1 connections
Node 14: 2 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 16: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 19: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 11: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 15: 5 connections

Based on the sorted vertices, we will now count the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 9, 11>
2. Triangle <0, 9, 17>
3. Triangle <0, 11, 19>
4. Triangle <1, 4, 19>
5. Triangle <2, 5, 6>
6. Triangle <2, 5, 15>
7. Triangle <2, 6, 15>
8. Triangle <3, 16, 19>
9. Triangle <4, 9, 11>
10. Triangle <5, 6, 15>
11. Triangle <7, 13, 14>
12. Triangle <8, 17, 19>
13. Triangle <9, 11, 17>
14. Triangle <9, 11, 18>
15. Triangle <9, 11, 4>
16. Triangle <9, 11, 0>
17. Triangle <9, 18, 15>
18. Triangle <13, 7, 10>
19. Triangle <15, 18, 7>

Total number of triangles: [19]
