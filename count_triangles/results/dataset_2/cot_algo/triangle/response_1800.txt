Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 3), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 2), (8, 0), (8, 6), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 0), (0, 6), (0, 2), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 1), (3, 7)

Now let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
0 (degree 2), 1 (degree 2), 5 (degree 2), 7 (degree 2), 8 (degree 3), 4 (degree 4), 6 (degree 4), 2 (degree 6), 9 (degree 7), 3 (degree 7)

We will now go through each edge while considering vertices with lower degrees first and count the number of triangles formed:
- Edge (5, 2): No triangle
- Edge (5, 3): Triangle formed with node 9: <5, 3, 9>
- Edge (9, 8): Triangle formed with nodes 4 and 6: <9, 8, 4>, <9, 8, 6>
- Edge (4, 7): No triangle
- Edge (4, 8): Triangle formed with node 9: <4, 8, 9>
- Edge (8, 0): No triangle
- Edge (8, 6): Triangle formed with node 4: <8, 6, 4>
- Edge (0, 6): No triangle
- Edge (0, 2): No triangle
- Edge (2, 5): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: <5, 3, 9>, <9, 8, 4>, <9, 8, 6>, <4, 8, 9>, <8, 6, 4>
