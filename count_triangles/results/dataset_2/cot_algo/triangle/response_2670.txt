Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 29) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 21) (3, 6) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 23) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 24) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 16) (2, 17) (29, 13) (29, 2) (29, 24) (29, 10) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 11) (20, 26) (23, 4) (23, 2) (23, 1) (23, 28) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 26) (9, 21) (26, 20) (26, 9) (26, 27) (0, 4) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 5) (27, 26) (27, 0) (27, 25) (14, 0) (14, 6) (19, 28) (19, 10) (19, 16) (1, 23) (1, 25) (1, 5) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 1) (25, 12) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 21) (21, 22) (21, 9) (21, 16) (21, 11) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 10) (24, 7) (24, 29) (24, 18) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 11) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 11) (12, 25) (12, 28) (10, 29) (10, 19) (10, 5) (18, 24) (18, 28) (11, 8) (11, 21) (11, 17) (11, 6) (28, 23) (28, 19) (28, 12) (28, 18) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 14), (0, 27), (1, 5), (1, 23), (1, 25), ..., (28, 19), (28, 23)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Degree of each node:
0: 4
1: 3
2: 4
...
29: 4

Node ordering based on degree:
1, 23, 25, 19, 10, 16, 26, 3, 15, 18, 20, 4, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 21, 27, 5, 8, 9, 17, 24, 28, 0, 2, 13, 22, 29

Now, let's find the triangles:

1. (1, 23):
Triangles: <1, 2, 16>, <1, 2, 17>, <1, 16, 19>, <1, 23, 28>

2. (1, 25):
Triangles: <1, 5, 10>, <1, 5, 11>, <1, 5, 25>

3. (23, 1):
Triangles: <23, 0, 27>, <23, 1, 25>, <23, 1, 28>

4. (23, 2):
Triangles: <2, 17, 11>, <2, 17, 16>, <2, 16, 19>

5. (25, 1):
Triangles: <1, 5, 10>, <1, 5, 11>, <1, 5, 25>

6. (25, 12):
Triangles: <25, 1, 5>

Total number of triangles: [15]
