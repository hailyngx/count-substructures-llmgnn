Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be used to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Here is the calculation process:
- Sort the vertices from least to most connections:
    Node 5 (5 connections)
    Node 4 (4 connections)
    Node 7 (3 connections)
    Node 6 (3 connections)
    Node 8 (5 connections)
    Node 9 (4 connections)
    Node 2 (4 connections)
    Node 0 (4 connections)
    Node 1 (4 connections)
    Node 3 (4 connections)

- Relabel the nodes in increasing order by their connections:
    Node 7 (3 connections)
    Node 6 (3 connections)
    Node 9 (4 connections)
    Node 2 (4 connections)
    Node 0 (4 connections)
    Node 1 (4 connections)
    Node 3 (4 connections)
    Node 4 (4 connections)
    Node 8 (5 connections)
    Node 5 (5 connections)

- Proceed with edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
    (0, 1): Forms triangle with 5 -> <0, 1, 5>
    (4, 7): Forms triangle with 0 and 1 -> <0, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 7>
    (4, 8): Forms triangle with 0 and 1 -> <0, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 8>
    (7, 0): Forms triangle with 1 and 8 -> <0, 7, 1>, <1, 7, 0>
    (7, 2): Forms triangle with 1 -> <1, 7, 2>
    (6, 2): Forms triangle with 3 -> <3, 6, 2>

- Total number of triangles: [8]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 8.
