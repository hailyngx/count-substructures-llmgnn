Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 14) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 8) (10, 9) (10, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. 

The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is as follows:
Node 5: degree 3
Node 10: degree 2
Node 11: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 8: degree 3
Node 14: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 7: degree 4
Node 12: degree 5
Node 13: degree 5

Now, we will go through the edges to count the triangles. We will only proceed if the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections than the higher labeled vertex. 

Triangles in the graph are formed by the following unique combinations of vertices:
<0, 4, 12>
<0, 4, 14>
<0, 6, 14>
<0, 9, 3>
<1, 7, 12>
<1, 7, 13>
<1, 8, 14>
<1, 10, 9>
<3, 7, 12>
<3, 7, 13>
<3, 8, 11>
<4, 6, 12>
<4, 6, 14>
<4, 8, 14>
<4, 12, 14>
<5, 12, 13>
<6, 9, 12>
<6, 9, 14>
<7, 8, 14>
<8, 11, 13>

Count of triangles in the graph: [19]
