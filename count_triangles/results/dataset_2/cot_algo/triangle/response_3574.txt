Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 24) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (10, 17) (10, 3) (11, 6) (11, 20) (26, 13) (26, 15) (26, 16) (0, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 22) (13, 26) (13, 29) (13, 7) (4, 21) (27, 28) (27, 6) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (25, 15) (25, 18) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 22) (19, 21) (22, 8) (22, 19) (22, 6) (16, 14) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 5) (24, 1) (24, 16) (24, 23) (24, 20) (7, 13) (7, 9) (7, 29) (7, 6) (29, 13) (29, 7) (29, 12) (15, 26) (15, 0) (15, 25) (15, 28) (5, 8) (5, 16) (5, 18) (6, 11) (6, 27) (6, 22) (6, 7) (21, 4) (21, 19) (18, 25) (18, 5) (18, 12) (20, 11) (20, 24) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 29) (12, 18) (28, 27) (28, 15) (23, 24) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the nodes based on their number of connections from least to most:

Nodes by degrees:
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 11: 2 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 25: 2 connections
Node 28: 2 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 20: 2 connections
Node 23: 1 connection
Node 27: 2 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 21: 2 connections
Node 22: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 26: 4 connections
Node 12: 5 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 24: 4 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 16: 4 connections
Node 29: 3 connections
Node 17: 3 connections


Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 28]
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 12, 29>
<0, 14, 19>
<0, 14, 16>
<0, 15, 25>
<1, 2, 17>
<1, 2, 24>
<1, 3, 10>
<2, 8, 22>
<2, 19, 21>
<3, 7, 9>
<6, 11, 20>
<6, 7, 29>
<6, 22, 27>
<8, 9, 5>
<12, 14, 17>
<12, 14, 0>
<12, 14, 16>
<12, 18, 5>
<13, 26, 15>
<13, 7, 9>
<14, 16, 26>
<15, 25, 28>
<16, 24, 20>
