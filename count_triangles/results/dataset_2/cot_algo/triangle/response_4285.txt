Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (2, 1) (2, 8) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 0) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 12) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 12) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is:  

0 (degree 5)  
14 (degree 2)  
2 (degree 2)  
7 (degree 4)  
4 (degree 4)  
12 (degree 3)  
1 (degree 5)  
8 (degree 4)  
13 (degree 6)  
6 (degree 4)  
5 (degree 4)  
11 (degree 4)  
3 (degree 2)  
9 (degree 4)  
10 (degree 4)  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:  
[15]

The unique triangles found in the graph are:  
<0, 3, 4>  
<0, 8, 13>  
<0, 2, 8>  
<0, 6, 10>  
<0, 6, 12>  
<0, 6, 13>  
<0, 10, 12>  
<1, 7, 9>  
<1, 7, 13>  
<1, 9, 13>  
<1, 5, 13>  
<1, 5, 10>  
<1, 5, 12>  
<2, 1, 14>  
<4, 7, 13>  
<4, 3, 11>
