Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 0) (13, 27) (22, 4) (22, 11) (27, 13) (27, 12) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 20) (12, 21) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 20) (7, 23) (2, 8) (2, 23) (2, 10) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 1) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 0) (28, 4) (4, 22) (4, 28) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 19) (3, 6) (3, 21) (3, 9) (21, 12) (21, 3) (9, 18) (9, 3) (9, 29) (9, 24) (29, 9) (29, 16) (19, 13) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 17) (16, 12) (16, 7) (16, 29) (16, 14) (23, 7) (23, 2) (23, 26) (23, 17) (26, 23) (26, 17) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 23) (17, 26) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 10) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 22) (11, 7) (11, 20) (5, 8) (5, 25) (5, 1) (20, 12) (20, 7) (20, 11) (24, 9) (25, 5) (25, 14) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 5) (14, 2) (14, 16) (14, 25) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the nodes based on their degrees. Let's first find the degrees of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 5
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 4
- Node 20: degree 4
- Node 21: degree 3
- Node 22: degree 2
- Node 23: degree 4
- Node 24: degree 1
- Node 25: degree 3
- Node 26: degree 2
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 28: degree 2
- Node 29: degree 3

Sorted nodes based on their degrees:
24, 28, 22, 21, 18, 14, 0, 1, 5, 3, 6, 9, 10, 13, 25, 26, 2, 7, 8, 12, 16, 17, 19, 20, 27, 23, 4, 11, 29

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. For each edge, check if the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- (13, 10): Proceed
- (13, 19): Proceed
- (13, 0): Proceed
- (13, 27): Proceed
- (22, 4): Proceed
- (22, 11): Proceed
- (27, 13): Proceed
- (27, 12): Proceed
- (12, 27): Not needed (already counted)
...

After checking all edges, the total number of triangles found is [25]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 14, 25>
<2, 8, 19>
<2, 10, 13>
<0, 6, 10>
<7, 11, 20>
<9, 18, 19>
<3, 6, 17>
<3, 9, 29>
<21, 3, 9>
<17, 19, 26>
<16, 12, 29>
<17, 23, 26>
<16, 14, 25>
<0, 13, 27>
<7, 20, 11>
<12, 16, 14>
<7, 16, 29>
<1, 10, 13>
<5, 1, 8>
<2, 23, 26>
<20, 7, 11>
<7, 12, 16>
<12, 20, 7>
<17, 6, 3>
<19, 18, 9>
