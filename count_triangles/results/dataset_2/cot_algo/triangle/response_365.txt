Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 12) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7)
(13, 10) (10, 11) (10, 2)
(11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4)
(3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2)
(0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9)
(7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5)
(14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 5)
(1, 2) (1, 9)
(2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4)
(9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12)
(12, 14) (12, 6)
(5, 7)

Now, let's calculate the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by their degrees:
1. 5 connections: 0
2. 5 connections: 7
3. 4 connections: 2
4. 4 connections: 9
5. 3 connections: 3, 4, 6, 10, 11
6. 2 connections: 1, 12, 14
7. 1 connection: 5, 8, 13

Triangular relationships found:
1. <0, 7, 9>
2. <0, 11, 4>
3. <2, 3, 4>
4. <2, 9, 1>
5. <3, 4, 2>
6. <9, 7, 5>
7. <12, 14, 2>

[Total number of triangles: 7]
