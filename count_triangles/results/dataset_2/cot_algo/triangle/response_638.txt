Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 10) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) 

Response:
Let's first list the nodes based on their connections in ascending order:

0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 13   
4: 2, 6, 10, 11   
5: 2, 3, 6, 14   
8: 9, 10, 12   
1: 0, 7, 11, 14   
7: 1, 6, 11, 12   
9: 8, 12, 13, 14   
2: 0, 4, 5, 10, 11   
10: 2, 4, 8   
3: 0, 5   
6: 0, 4, 5, 7   
11: 1, 2, 4, 7, 12   
12: 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14   
13: 0, 9, 12   
14: 1, 5, 9, 12   

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. (0, 1) - shared connection: 7 -> triangle <0, 1, 7>
2. (0, 2) - shared connection: none
3. (0, 3) - shared connection: none
4. (0, 6) - shared connection: none
5. (0, 13) - shared connection: none
6. (2, 4) - shared connection: none
7. (2, 10) - shared connection: none
8. (4, 10) - shared connection: none
9. (1, 11) - shared connection: none
10. (1, 14) - shared connection: none
11. (7, 12) - shared connection: none
12. (9, 12) - shared connection: none
13. (9, 14) - shared connection: none

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1]. The unique triangle found is <0, 1, 7>.
