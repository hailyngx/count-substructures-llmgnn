Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 19) (13, 14) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 17) (4, 5) (18, 9) (18, 1) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 6) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 2) (15, 10) (15, 0) (7, 8) (16, 13) (16, 12) (2, 17) (2, 5) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 19) (6, 1) (6, 14) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 14) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 19) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 5) (3, 8) 

Response:
The graph given can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
(0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 15) (0, 5)
(1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 18)
(2, 5) (2, 17)
(3, 8)
(4, 5)
(5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8)
(6, 1) (6, 14)
(7, 8)
(8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14)
(9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 18)
(10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 15)
(11, 0) (11, 10) (11, 17) (11, 19)
(12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 19)
(13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 16) (13, 19)
(14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 19)
(15, 0) (15, 10)
(16, 12) (16, 13)
(17, 1) (17, 2) (17, 11)
(18, 1) (18, 9)
(19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 13) (19, 14)

Next, we will sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and assign new labels accordingly:
Nodes by degree: 
{3, 4, 6, 7, 15, 16, 18, 0, 2, 9, 17, 1, 5, 12, 19, 13, 14, 8, 10, 11}

Now, we consider the edges for triangles in the specific order to only count each triangle once:

[Total number of triangles]: [18]

<0, 1, 10>
<0, 1, 17>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 12>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 11>
<0, 5, 15>
<0, 10, 11>
<0, 11, 12>
<1, 10, 11>
<1, 10, 15>
<1, 10, 9>
<1, 11, 17>
<1, 17, 2>
<2, 5, 17>
<5, 8, 14>
<13, 14, 19>
