Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- 0: {5, 9, 1, 2}
- 1: {9, 6, 4, 3, 0, 8}
- 2: {6, 4, 8, 0}
- 3: {5, 6, 7, 1}
- 4: {8, 1, 2}
- 5: {9, 0, 3}
- 6: {9, 1, 3, 2}
- 7: {3, 8}
- 8: {9, 4, 7, 1, 2}
- 9: {5, 6, 8, 1, 0}

The Degree-Based Ordering after sorting nodes by their number of connections:
Labels: {7, 2, 4, 0, 3, 6, 8, 1, 9, 5}

Triangles:
- Triangle <5, 9, 0>
- Triangle <1, 9, 6>
- Triangle <1, 9, 8>
- Triangle <1, 9, 0>
- Triangle <1, 6, 3>
- Triangle <1, 6, 2>
- Triangle <1, 4, 8>
- Triangle <1, 4, 2>
- Triangle <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle <1, 3, 8>
- Triangle <1, 3, 0>
- Triangle <1, 8, 2>
- Triangle <1, 8, 4>
- Triangle <1, 8, 7>
- Triangle <1, 8, 0>
- Triangle <3, 7, 8>
- Triangle <3, 8, 2>
