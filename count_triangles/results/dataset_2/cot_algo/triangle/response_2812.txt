Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 20) (3, 26) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 23) (15, 18) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 21) (18, 15) (18, 2) (18, 27) (18, 21) (1, 26) (1, 29) (1, 14) (1, 7) (26, 3) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 10) (26, 0) (20, 3) (20, 15) (20, 23) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 23) (5, 16) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 19) (28, 3) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 25) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 4) (16, 19) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 10) (27, 18) (11, 24) (11, 25) (11, 29) (23, 15) (23, 20) (23, 5) (23, 21) (17, 13) (8, 19) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 14) (6, 24) (6, 22) (6, 0) (24, 11) (24, 6) (24, 0) (24, 22) (10, 26) (10, 4) (29, 1) (29, 11) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 26) (0, 6) (0, 24) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 25) (22, 6) (22, 24) (7, 1) (7, 5) (25, 28) (25, 11) (25, 14) (21, 2) (21, 18) (21, 23) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

After sorting the nodes by their degrees in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, the new labels are:
```
Node 0: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 14: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 22: Degree 2
Node 25: Degree 3
Node 10: Degree 2
Node 29: Degree 2
Node 11: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 1
Node 17: Degree 1
Node 27: Degree 2
Node 13: Degree 4
Node 19: Degree 5
Node 16: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 18: Degree 5
Node 21: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 28: Degree 4
Node 20: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 26: Degree 5
Node 23: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 0
Node 24: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 0
Node 15: Degree 4
```

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Looking at the edges, we can identify the following unique triangles: <3, 0, 26>, <3, 15, 20>, <3, 18, 21>, <0, 6, 24>, <0, 15, 20>, <26, 4, 19>, <26, 28, 16>, <26, 10, 4>, <20, 5, 23>.
  
Therefore, there are 9 triangles in total as shown inside brackets: [9].
