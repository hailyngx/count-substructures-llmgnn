Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph. 

The sorted list of nodes based on their degrees is as follows:
Node 5 - Degree 4
Node 0 - Degree 2
Node 8 - Degree 2
Node 9 - Degree 2
Node 1 - Degree 3
Node 3 - Degree 3
Node 2 - Degree 4
Node 4 - Degree 6
Node 6 - Degree 4
Node 7 - Degree 6

Based on the sorted list, we will count the triangles by considering the edges in the order specified. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [20].

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 7, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 7, 5>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 5>
<3, 7, 5>
<3, 2, 4>
<3, 2, 5>
<2, 8, 5>
<2, 9, 7>
<6, 1, 4>
<6, 7, 5>
