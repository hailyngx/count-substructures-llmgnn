Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to first list the nodes by their degree in ascending order.

The degrees of the nodes in the given graph are as follows:
Node 0: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 5

Now, we can sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes in ascending order: 2, 1, 3, 5, 8, 6, 4, 0, 7, 9

Following the method, we will count the triangles by checking shared connections for each edge starting from the node with the lower label.

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 8>
