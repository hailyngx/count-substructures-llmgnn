Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
All right, let's construct the graph and count the number of triangles in it. 

The vertices are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are as follows:
- 0: {8, 5, 3, 1}
- 1: {4, 6, 9, 5}
- 2: {9, 8, 3}
- 3: {4, 8, 2, 0}
- 4: {7, 9, 1, 3}
- 5: {7, 6, 1, 0}
- 6: {9, 5, 1, 8}
- 7: {4, 9, 5}
- 8: {6, 9, 2, 0, 3}
- 9: {4, 7, 6, 8, 2, 1}

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Triangles: [10]

Unique triangles: 
<4, 1, 9>
<9, 1, 6>
<9, 1, 4>
<3, 0, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<8, 6, 9>
<8, 6, 5>
<8, 2, 9>
<8, 2, 3>
<0, 5, 8>
