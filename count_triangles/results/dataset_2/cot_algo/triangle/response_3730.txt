Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 28) (9, 20) (9, 7) (1, 23) (1, 0) (1, 27) (3, 5) (3, 13) (20, 9) (20, 25) (20, 22) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 22) (25, 18) (25, 11) (4, 13) (4, 16) (18, 25) (18, 24) (18, 8) (21, 28) (21, 13) (21, 0) (28, 9) (28, 21) (28, 19) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 2) (29, 27) (29, 8) (22, 20) (22, 25) (22, 26) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 6) (26, 7) (10, 26) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 12) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 21) (13, 17) (8, 18) (8, 29) (8, 19) (8, 11) (19, 28) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 27) (16, 4) (16, 2) (7, 9) (7, 26) (7, 15) (11, 5) (11, 25) (11, 8) (24, 18) (24, 2) (27, 1) (27, 29) (27, 19) (27, 2) (6, 26) (6, 14) (6, 0) (14, 20) (14, 19) (14, 6) (0, 1) (0, 21) (0, 17) (0, 6) (2, 17) (2, 16) (2, 24) (2, 27) (23, 1) (12, 15) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed based on the given information and the degree-based ordering method has been applied to count the triangles. 

The number of triangles found in the graph is: [52]
