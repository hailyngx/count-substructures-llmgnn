Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 8) (27, 4) (27, 24) (4, 27) (4, 5) (4, 29) (4, 6) (7, 15) (7, 6) (1, 26) (1, 25) (1, 16) (1, 5) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 18) (26, 20) (26, 17) (19, 26) (19, 9) (11, 23) (11, 17) (11, 2) (28, 8) (28, 13) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 13) (13, 28) (13, 5) (13, 29) (18, 26) (18, 29) (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 7) (21, 3) (21, 25) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 20) (3, 23) (10, 22) (10, 16) (23, 11) (23, 3) (23, 14) (23, 12) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 20) (2, 24) (2, 17) (12, 23) (12, 2) (12, 29) (22, 10) (8, 15) (8, 28) (8, 14) (0, 3) (0, 24) (9, 19) (9, 25) (9, 20) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 9) (20, 26) (20, 3) (20, 2) (20, 9) (20, 16) (14, 23) (14, 8) (24, 27) (24, 2) (24, 0) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 20) (17, 26) (17, 11) (17, 2) (29, 4) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the nodes based on the number of connections each node has. 
After sorting the nodes based on the number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are:
0:14, 1:7, 2:11, 3:10, 4:9, 5:10, 6:9, 7:7, 8:8, 9:6, 10:4, 11:5, 12:6, 13:6, 14:4, 15:6, 16:5, 17:3, 18:3, 19:3, 20:5, 21:3, 22:1, 23:5, 24:4, 25:5, 26:5, 27:3, 28:3, 29:6

Following the degree-based ordering, we proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
Checking for triangles formed by shared connections:
<0, 3, 20>
<0, 24, 2>
<1, 26, 18>
<1, 5, 13>
<1, 16, 20>
<2, 11, 17>
<3, 20, 26>
<4, 6, 15>
<5, 4, 6>
<5, 13, 28>
<6, 4, 27>
<8, 14, 23>
<9, 19, 26>
<10, 16, 20>
<11, 2, 17>
<12, 2, 24>
<13, 5, 28>
<13, 29, 12>
<14, 8, 28>
<16, 1, 26>
<20, 3, 23>
