Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 15) (6, 18) (6, 16) (1, 17) (1, 10) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 16) (4, 15) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 12) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 15) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 18) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 19) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 13) (15, 16) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 15) (18, 6) (18, 17) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 2) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. Below is the list of vertices and their corresponding degrees:

Vertices sorted by degree:
(1) 17: degree 3
(2) 19: degree 3
(3) 6: degree 3
(4) 16: degree 3
(5) 18: degree 3
(6) 9: degree 2
(7) 15: degree 4
(8) 5: degree 4
(9) 11: degree 2
(10) 7: degree 4
(11) 2: degree 4
(12) 12: degree 3
(13) 1: degree 4
(14) 14: degree 2
(15) 0: degree 4
(16) 8: degree 5
(17) 3: degree 4
(18) 10: degree 5
(19) 4: degree 5
(20) 13: degree 4

Based on the ordering, we will now consider the edges:
