Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 0) (22, 11) (22, 10) (22, 15) (14, 17) (14, 5) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 15) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 20) (0, 24) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 2) (15, 22) (15, 17) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 25) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 7) (26, 13) (26, 7) (27, 23) (27, 7) (27, 16) (7, 18) (7, 26) (7, 27) (25, 15) (25, 9) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 25) (9, 29) (29, 9) (29, 6) (8, 11) (8, 12) (28, 19) (28, 24) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 29) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 20) (2, 23) (2, 10) (16, 17) (16, 27) (16, 19) (16, 10) (24, 0) (24, 28) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 10) (10, 22) (10, 2) (10, 16) (10, 12) (11, 13) (11, 22) (11, 4) (11, 8) (23, 27) (23, 2) (23, 19) (19, 28) (19, 16) (19, 23) (21, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections). 

Here are the vertices sorted by their degree in ascending order:

Vertices: 
1. 1 (degree: 1)
2. 9 (degree: 2)
3. 4 (degree: 2)
4. 5 (degree: 2)
5. 7 (degree: 3)
6. 8 (degree: 3)
7. 10 (degree: 4)
8. 12 (degree: 4)
9. 18 (degree: 4)
10. 19 (degree: 4)
11. 21 (degree: 4)
12. 23 (degree: 4)
13. 25 (degree: 4)
14. 28 (degree: 4)
15. 29 (degree: 4)
16. 0 (degree: 5)
17. 2 (degree: 5)
18. 6 (degree: 5)
19. 11 (degree: 5)
20. 13 (degree: 5)
21. 15 (degree: 5)
22. 17 (degree: 5)
23. 20 (degree: 5)
24. 26 (degree: 5)
25. 3 (degree: 6)
26. 16 (degree: 6)
27. 22 (degree: 6)
28. 24 (degree: 6)
29. 27 (degree: 6)
30. 14 (degree: 6)

Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

[The total number of triangles is: 13]

<0, 20, 2>
<0, 24, 28>
<5, 12, 10>
<7, 26, 13>
<7, 27, 16>
<9, 25, 15>
<9, 25, 29>
<10, 12, 8>

<17, 14, 5>
<16, 17, 15>
