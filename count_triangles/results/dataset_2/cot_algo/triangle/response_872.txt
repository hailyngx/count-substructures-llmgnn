Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 16) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 19) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 18) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 19) (2, 11) (2, 4) (18, 17) (6, 10) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 16) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 19) (13, 17) (13, 15) (0, 17) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 12) (12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 8) (12, 19) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 8) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 15) (7, 15) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 6) (8, 12) (8, 15) 

Response:
Let's construct a graph with 20 nodes and the given 60 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: [17, 3, 4, 16, 12]
- 1: [14, 3, 10]
- 2: [19, 11, 4]
- 3: [5, 1, 0]
- 4: [2, 0, 16]
- 5: [9, 3, 10]
- 6: [10]
- 7: [15]
- 8: [12, 15]
- 9: [5, 11, 14, 16]
- 10: [5, 1, 6]
- 11: [9, 2, 19]
- 12: [0, 16, 8, 19]
- 13: [17, 15]
- 14: [9, 1, 19]
- 15: [13, 19, 7, 8]
- 16: [9, 4, 0, 12]
- 17: [13, 0, 18]
- 18: [17]
- 19: [14, 2, 11, 12, 15]

Next, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Sort vertices by their number of connections:
[18] < [6] < [7] < [2, 12] < [5, 8, 11, 13] < [1, 4, 10, 16, 19] < [0, 3, 9, 14] < [17, 15]

2. Count triangles and output the total number of triangles and unique triangles:
Total triangles: [19]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 16, 9>
<0, 16, 4>
<0, 16, 12>
<0, 4, 16>
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 4, 16>
<3, 5, 10>
<3, 1, 10>
<3, 1, 14>
<9, 5, 10>
<9, 5, 3>
<9, 14, 1>
<9, 14, 19>
<9, 14, 1>
<14, 1, 3>
<14, 1, 19>
<14, 1, 10>
<17, 13, 15>
<17, 13, 19>
<17, 0, 3>
