Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 13) (7, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 5) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 3) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 2) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order.

The sorted vertices with their degree are as follows:
0: 5
2: 3
7: 2
8: 2
5: 4
4: 3
12: 4
10: 3
1: 5
14: 5
11: 4
9: 4
6: 7
3: 5
13: 5

Now, we will count the number of triangles by examining each edge. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, as described earlier.

Calculating the total number of triangles: 
Triangles = 57

Therefore, there are [57] triangles in the given graph.

Some of the unique triangles found are as follows:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 12>
<0, 1, 14>
<0, 5, 14>
<0, 6, 12>
<0, 6, 14>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 12>
<1, 9, 13>
<3, 6, 13>
...
and so on.
