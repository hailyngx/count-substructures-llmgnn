Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 25) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 24) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 19) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 3) (23, 22) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 20) (4, 17) (4, 26) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 29) (26, 4) (26, 28) (26, 11) (26, 0) (28, 26) (28, 8) (28, 13) (17, 4) (17, 2) (20, 4) (20, 1) (20, 14) (20, 24) (3, 22) (3, 21) (21, 3) (21, 24) (7, 9) (25, 15) (25, 19) (25, 11) (6, 10) (6, 11) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 28) (11, 26) (11, 25) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 24) (14, 5) (14, 20) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (24, 5) (24, 20) (24, 21) (24, 11) (24, 13) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 19) (0, 26) (1, 20) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 12) (29, 18) (29, 16) (29, 13) (29, 12) (13, 28) (13, 24) (13, 29) (19, 9) (19, 25) (19, 2) (19, 1) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 16) (16, 18) (16, 29) (16, 10) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 29) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, ..., 28, 29
Edges: (15, 25), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 24), (5, 14), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 19), (22, 23), (22, 4), (22, 3), (23, 22), (4, 18), (4, 20), (4, 17), (4, 26), (18, 16), (18, 29), (26, 28), (26, 11), (26, 0), (28, 13), (17, 2), (20, 1), (20, 24), (3, 21), (7, 9), (25, 15), (6, 10), (8, 28), (11, 6), (14, 12), (21, 24), (25, 19), (14, 10), (11, 25), (13, 29), (10, 16), (2, 19), (29, 18), (1, 12), (12, 14)

To count triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices and their degrees:
0(1), 1(3), 2(3), 3(2), 4(5), 5(4), 6(2), 7(1), 8(3), 9(3), 10(3), 11(5), 12(3), 13(2), 14(5), 15(1), 16(3), 17(2), 18(3), 19(4), 20(3), 21(2), 22(3), 23(1), 24(5), 25(3), 26(4), 28(3), 29(4)

Now, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles. 

The total number of triangles is [].

The unique triangles found are: 
<4, 22, 23>,
<4, 11, 26>,
<4, 18, 16>,
<5, 14, 20>,
<5, 14, 11>,
<5, 10, 16>,
<5, 24, 21>,
<9, 19, 25>,
<11, 25, 6>,
<14, 10, 16>,
<14, 10, 12>,
<14, 24, 13>,
<26, 0, 11>,
<26, 0, 1>,
<26, 11, 25>,
<28, 8, 13>,
<29, 18, 16>,
<29, 12, 1>,
<29, 12, 14>.
