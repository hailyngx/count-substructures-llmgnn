Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 27) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 23) (1, 3) (1, 22) (1, 12) (20, 25) (20, 18) (20, 2) (20, 19) (25, 9) (25, 20) (25, 18) (21, 13) (21, 14) (21, 4) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 22) (26, 28) (26, 10) (16, 9) (16, 28) (16, 18) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 27) (19, 20) (19, 5) (7, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 26) (10, 2) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 29) (24, 11) (24, 8) (24, 22) (29, 11) (29, 22) (29, 14) (13, 21) (13, 2) (8, 6) (8, 24) (14, 21) (14, 29) (14, 12) (23, 9) (12, 1) (12, 14) (27, 3) (27, 6) (27, 5) (0, 5) (0, 17) (0, 4) (17, 0) (17, 2) (2, 20) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 17) (18, 20) (18, 25) (18, 16) (4, 15) (4, 21) (4, 11) (4, 0) (22, 1) (22, 28) (22, 24) (22, 29) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29
Edges: (3, 15), (3, 1), (3, 27), (15, 5), (15, 4), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 27), (6, 8), (9, 25), (9, 16), (9, 23), (1, 22), (20, 18), (20, 2), (20, 19), (21, 13), (21, 14), (21, 4), (28, 26), (28, 22), (26, 10), (16, 28), (16, 18), (19, 7), (10, 26), (11, 29), (29, 14), (8, 24), (23, 12), (27, 5), (0, 17), (2, 13)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):
Nodes sorted by degree: 7, 17, 3, 29, 23, 12, 6, 25, 10, 26, 18, 22, 24, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 4, 5, 15, 1, 9, 21, 27, 28, 0, 2

Triangles found: [32]
Unique triangles: <1, 3, 27>, <2, 10, 26>, <4, 21, 29>, <5, 15, 19>, <6, 9, 25>, <8, 24, 22>, <16, 18, 28>, <0, 5, 19>, <0, 4, 21>, <6, 8, 24>, <9, 10, 26>, <15, 5, 19>, <3, 1, 22>, <16, 9, 25>, <27, 3, 1>, <27, 6, 5>, <9, 16, 28>, <29, 14, 21>, <10, 6, 9>, <20, 18, 25>, <13, 21, 14>, <12, 1, 22>, <27, 3, 15>, <17, 0, 4>, <20, 2, 13>, <20, 18, 16>, <5, 15, 4>, <6, 10, 26>, <21, 13, 2>, <5, 19, 7>, <22, 24, 8>
