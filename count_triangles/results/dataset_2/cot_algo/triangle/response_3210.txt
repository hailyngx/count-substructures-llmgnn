Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 5) (7, 11) (7, 19) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 15) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 17) (5, 14) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 9) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 9) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 6) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 14) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 15) (15, 2) (15, 14) (18, 13) (18, 10) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 0) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort the vertices by their degree in ascending order. Then the highest degree vertex is labeled as 0, the second highest as 1, and so on.

The sorted vertices in this graph are:
0: 10, 16, 17
1: 7, 11, 15, 18
2: 2, 4, 6, 14, 19
3: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8
4: 9, 13
5: 12

Next, we look at each edge's vertices and only consider the cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Based on the given edges and the labeled vertices, the total number of triangles in the graph is [22].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 10>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 10>
<0, 5, 16>
<0, 10, 17>
<1, 7, 11>
<1, 11, 18>
<2, 3, 14>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 14>
<2, 6, 15>
<3, 9, 12>
<4, 6, 14>
<5, 9, 12>
<5, 10, 17>
<5, 12, 14>
<5, 12, 16>
<6, 14, 15>
<9, 12, 16>
<9, 13, 18>
<11, 7, 19>
<13, 9, 18>
