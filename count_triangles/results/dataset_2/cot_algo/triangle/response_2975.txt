Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 6) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 9) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 14) (11, 14) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 10)
