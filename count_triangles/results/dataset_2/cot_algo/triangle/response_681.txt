Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 4) (7, 28) (18, 4) (18, 22) (18, 28) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 10) (22, 8) (20, 0) (20, 21) (20, 14) (25, 8) (25, 15) (25, 21) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 24) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 27) (0, 20) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 24) (28, 7) (28, 18) (28, 3) (28, 13) (29, 1) (29, 26) (29, 15) (14, 20) (14, 0) (14, 13) (1, 29) (1, 26) (26, 29) (26, 1) (26, 16) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 19) (17, 12) (17, 21) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 10) (5, 27) (11, 19) (23, 16) (23, 10) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 13) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 23) (16, 24) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 16) (19, 2) (19, 11) (13, 28) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 21) (21, 20) (21, 25) (21, 17) (21, 5) (21, 13) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 9) (27, 5) (8, 18) (8, 22) (8, 25) (10, 22) (10, 5) (10, 23) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections and then relabeling the vertices accordingly. 

After relabeling the nodes with their degrees in ascending order, the new graph with relabeled nodes and the same edges is as follows: 
Node 0 has degree 6
Node 1 has degree 2
Node 2 has degree 3
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 2
Node 5 has degree 6
Node 6 has degree 3
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 3
Node 10 has degree 4
Node 11 has degree 1
Node 12 has degree 3
Node 13 has degree 4
Node 14 has degree 3
Node 15 has degree 3
Node 16 has degree 4
Node 17 has degree 3
Node 18 has degree 4
Node 19 has degree 2
Node 20 has degree 3
Node 21 has degree 5
Node 22 has degree 4
Node 23 has degree 2
Node 24 has degree 3
Node 25 has degree 4
Node 26 has degree 3
Node 27 has degree 2
Node 28 has degree 4
Node 29 has degree 3

Now, we will consider the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. 

The triangles in the graph are:
