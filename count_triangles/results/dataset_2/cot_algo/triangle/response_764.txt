Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 2) (15, 16) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 16) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 16) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (6, 14) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 15) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 14) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (9, 0) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 19) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 13) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 14) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 11) (13, 4) (13, 16) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: (6, 7, 9, 11)
- 1: (14, 15, 17)
- 2: (5, 15, 18)
- 3: (8, 12, 15)
- 4: (7, 13, 16, 19)
- 5: (2, 10, 11, 12)
- 6: (0, 14)
- 7: (0, 4, 19)
- 8: (3, 15)
- 9: (0)
- 10: (5, 17)
- 11: (0, 5, 12)
- 12: (3, 5, 11)
- 13: (4, 16)
- 14: (1, 6, 19)
- 15: (2, 3, 15, 16)
- 16: (4, 15, 17, 18, 13)
- 17: (1, 10, 16)
- 18: (2, 16)
- 19: (4, 7, 14)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices are: 9, 6, 1, 8, 3, 0, 2, 10, 11, 12, 5, 7, 4, 13, 16, 17, 18, 15, 14, 19.

Based on the sorted vertices, the triangles in the graph are: 
- <0, 11, 5>
- <1, 14, 17>
- <2, 5, 15>
- <3, 8, 15>
- <4, 13, 16>
- <7, 19, 4>
- <14, 19, 6>
- <16, 17, 18>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
