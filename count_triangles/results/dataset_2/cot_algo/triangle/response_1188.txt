Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 8) (29, 3) (6, 8) (6, 16) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 12) (20, 26) (20, 11) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 16) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 3) (11, 1) (28, 11) (28, 23) (3, 29) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 19) (4, 27) (4, 12) (4, 15) (27, 25) (27, 4) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 17) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 12) (15, 4) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 5) (22, 2) (22, 8) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 23) (14, 27) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 7) (10, 24) (26, 20) (26, 10) (26, 7) (18, 9) (18, 27) (16, 6) (16, 25) (16, 17) (16, 23) (24, 10) (7, 29) (7, 10) (7, 26) (17, 27) (17, 16) (17, 21) (23, 28) (23, 12) (23, 16) (0, 9) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (19, 3) (19, 0) (13, 25) (13, 3) (13, 15) (5, 15) (5, 21) (8, 29) (8, 6) (8, 22) (8, 0) (21, 17) (21, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(2, 29), (2, 22), (2, 10), (29, 7), (29, 8), (29, 3), (6, 8), (6, 16), (9, 18), (9, 0), (9, 12), (20, 26), (20, 11), (25, 27), (25, 13), (25, 16), (11, 28), (11, 1), (3, 19), (4, 15), (4, 14), (1, 15), (1, 0), (15, 13), (22, 8), (12, 23), (17, 21), (23, 16), (0, 8), (21, 5), (24, 10)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

0 (4), 1 (3), 4 (3), 5 (2), 6 (2), 7 (3), 9 (3), 2 (3), 3 (4), 8 (4), 10 (4), 11 (4), 12 (4), 13 (3), 15 (4), 19 (2), 22 (2), 26 (3), 27 (5), 14 (2), 17 (3), 18 (2), 16 (4), 21 (2), 23 (3), 24 (1), 25 (3), 28 (2), 29 (4)

Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [26]

Unique triangles found:
<5, 15, 0>, <5, 21, 17>, <6, 8, 22>, <6, 16, 23>, <9, 0, 15>, <9, 12, 4>, <9, 12, 23>, <10, 26, 7>, <11, 1, 15>, <11, 20, 26>, <11, 3, 29>, <13, 15, 4>, <13, 15, 25>, <16, 17, 27>, <16, 23, 12>, <17, 21, 5>, <18, 9, 27>, <18, 27, 4>, <19, 0, 9>, <19, 0, 15>, <22, 8, 29>, <25, 13, 3>, <25, 16, 6>, <27, 4, 15>, <27, 17, 21>, <29, 2, 10>
