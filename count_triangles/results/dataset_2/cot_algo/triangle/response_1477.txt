Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 17) (18, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 17) (13, 2) (13, 1) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 6) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 0) (1, 5) (1, 13) (6, 16) (6, 15) (6, 8) (6, 12) (0, 19) (0, 10) (0, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 19) (9, 18) (9, 0) (12, 11) (12, 6) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 17) (17, 7) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 2) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 19) (0, 10) (0, 9)
(1, 13) (1, 5)
(2, 17) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 16)
(3, 15) (3, 4)
(4, 5) (4, 3)
(5, 17) (5, 1) (5, 11)
(6, 12) (6, 15) (6, 8) (6, 16)
(7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 17)
(8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 6)
(9, 18) (9, 0)
(10, 0) (10, 8)
(11, 16) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 12)
(12, 11) (12, 6)
(13, 1) (13, 2)
(14, 19) (14, 7) (14, 8)
(15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 6)
(16, 2) (16, 6) (16, 11) (16, 15)
(17, 2) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 7)
(18, 9)
(19, 0) (19, 7) (19, 14)

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph.
