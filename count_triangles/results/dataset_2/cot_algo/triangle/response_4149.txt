Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 20) (1, 2) (1, 7) (21, 10) (21, 17) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 3) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 28) (27, 20) (4, 27) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 16) (2, 1) (2, 12) (6, 28) (28, 27) (28, 6) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 20) (14, 0) (14, 15) (17, 21) (17, 29) (17, 23) (17, 11) (29, 17) (29, 7) (29, 5) (11, 28) (11, 17) (11, 24) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 26) (16, 8) (16, 28) (16, 13) (16, 26) (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 20) (22, 4) (22, 9) (22, 10) (13, 16) (13, 25) (13, 24) (26, 3) (26, 16) (10, 21) (10, 22) (10, 19) (10, 23) (12, 2) (24, 11) (24, 13) (24, 7) (24, 5) (7, 1) (7, 29) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 5) (15, 4) (15, 14) (15, 9) (15, 19) (19, 10) (19, 15) (25, 13) (20, 1) (20, 27) (20, 28) (20, 9) (20, 23) (5, 8) (5, 29) (5, 24) (5, 7) (23, 17) (23, 10) (23, 20) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the provided nodes and edges. 

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Node 21, 6, 12, 9, 19, 25, 0, 3, 2, 1, 22, 26, 10, 4, 8, 13, 15, 23, 5, 29, 7, 11, 24, 14, 16, 20, 27, 17, 28

Triangles found based on the shared connections are:
<0, 1, 20>
<0, 4, 27>
<0, 14, 15>
<1, 2, 12>
<4, 8, 16>
<4, 9, 22>
<5, 7, 24>
<5, 7, 29>
<5, 24, 29>
<7, 11, 24>
<10, 17, 23>
<13, 16, 26>
<15, 19, 20>
<17, 21, 29>
<20, 21, 23>
<20, 23, 27>
<27, 28, 20>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
