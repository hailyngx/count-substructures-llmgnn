Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 11) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 2) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
0: 6, 11, 14, 4, 8, 2
1: 9, 3, 11, 4
2: 0, 11, 10
3: 1, 14, 6
4: 1, 0, 14, 12, 10
5: 9, 6, 8, 12, 10
6: 5, 3, 7, 0, 13
7: 9, 6, 14, 11
8: 5, 9, 0
9: 5, 8, 1, 7, 12
10: 5, 4, 2
11: 1, 0, 7, 2
12: 5, 9, 4
13: 6, 14
14: 3, 0, 7, 4, 13

Next, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees in increasing order:
Vertices sorted by degree: 2, 13, 5, 12, 3, 1, 11, 4, 8, 7, 6, 14, 0, 9, 10

Now, we will count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 12]
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 11>
<0, 2, 10>
<0, 4, 14>
<0, 6, 13>
<0, 6, 14>
<1, 3, 14>
<1, 4, 12>
<4, 5, 10>
<4, 8, 12>
<5, 9, 12>
<6, 7, 14>
