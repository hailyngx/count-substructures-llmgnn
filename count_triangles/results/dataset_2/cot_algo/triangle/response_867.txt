Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 10) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 10) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: 
(0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) 
(1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) 
(2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) 
(3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) 
(4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) 
(5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) 
(6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) 
(7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 14) 
(8, 4) (8, 2) 
(9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 7) 
(10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) 
(11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 14) 
(12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 10) 
(13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 5) 
(14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 10)

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:
Degree 2: {0, 1, 8, 14}
Degree 3: {3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
Degree 4: {10}
Degree 5: {2, 4, 12}
Degree 6: {6, 9}

Using the degree-based ordering, we will count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 8]
<0, 2, 11>
<0, 2, 12>
<1, 3, 12>
<2, 6, 12>
<2, 10, 12>
<4, 9, 12>
<4, 10, 12>
<9, 13, 14>
