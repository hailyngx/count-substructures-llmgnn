Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 13) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 10) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 8) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges. 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (9, 1), (3, 0), (14, 0), (1, 0)
- 1: (9, 1), (3, 1), (8, 1), (0, 1), (2, 1)
- 2: (5, 2), (1, 2), (6, 2), (12, 2), (13, 2)
- 3: (9, 3), (4, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (8, 3)
- 4: (7, 4), (14, 4), (6, 4), (3, 4)
- 5: (9, 5), (6, 5), (2, 5), (8, 5)
- 6: (5, 6), (4, 6), (2, 6), (13, 6)
- 7: (9, 7), (4, 7), (12, 7)
- 8: (5, 8), (1, 8), (3, 8), (11, 8), (10, 8)
- 9: (5, 9), (14, 9), (3, 9), (1, 9), (7, 9), (0, 9)
- 10: (12, 10), (14, 10), (8, 10)
- 11: (13, 11), (8, 11)
- 12: (7, 12), (2, 12), (10, 12)
- 13: (6, 13), (2, 13), (11, 13)
- 14: (9, 14), (4, 14), (0, 14), (10, 14)

Next, we will sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections):
Nodes by degree: [11, 7, 10, 13, 0, 12, 5, 4, 6, 3, 1, 14, 8, 2, 9]

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [21]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 9, 14>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 13>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 14>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 11>, <3, 8, 10>, <4, 6, 13>, <4, 9, 14>, <5, 6, 13>, <5, 8, 11>, <6, 7, 12>, <8, 10, 12>, <8, 10, 14>
