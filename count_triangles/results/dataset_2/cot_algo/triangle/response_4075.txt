Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

0: 20, 9, 22, 2
1: 26, 8, 7
2: 15, 0, 26, 3
3: 29, 16, 2, 10
4: 16
5: 15, 29, 23
6: 20, 18, 13
7: 1, 16, 10
8: 12, 1
9: 0, 24
10: 7, 14, 3, 22, 24
11: 18, 14, 21
12: 22, 8
13: 28, 6
14: 26, 29, 11, 24, 10
15: 27, 2, 25, 5
16: 4, 28, 7, 3
17: 26, 19
18: 11, 6
19: 23, 17
20: 0, 22, 6
21: 11
22: 12, 0, 20, 10
23: 25, 5, 19
24: 14, 9, 10, 17
25: 15, 23
26: 1, 14, 2, 17
27: 15
28: 29, 16, 13
29: 28, 5, 3, 14

After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, we have the following list:

4: 16
7: 1, 10, 16
8: 12
9: 0, 24
11: 18, 21
12: 22
13: 6, 28
14: 11, 17, 26
15: 5, 27
16: 3, 7, 29
17: 19, 24, 26
18: 6, 11
19: 17, 23
20: 0, 6, 22
21: 11
22: 0, 10, 12, 20
23: 5, 19, 25
24: 9, 10, 14, 17
25: 15, 23
26: 2, 14, 17
27: 15
28: 13, 16, 29
29: 3, 5, 14, 28

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 47]

Here are the unique triangles found:
<2, 3, 10>
<0, 2, 15>
<0, 14, 26>
<2, 3, 16>
<5, 23, 25>
<3, 10, 24>
<5, 14, 29>
<0, 6, 20>
<6, 10, 22>
<6, 13, 28>
<7, 16, 29>
<11, 14, 17>
<11, 18, 21>
<14, 17, 26>
<16, 28, 29>
<19, 23, 25>
<9, 10, 24>
