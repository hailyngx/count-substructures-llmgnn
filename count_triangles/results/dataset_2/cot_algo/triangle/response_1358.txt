Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the vertices in ascending order is as follows:
Node 3 - Degree: 3
Node 1 - Degree: 3
Node 8 - Degree: 2
Node 9 - Degree: 4
Node 2 - Degree: 4
Node 5 - Degree: 4
Node 0 - Degree: 4
Node 6 - Degree: 5
Node 7 - Degree: 6
Node 4 - Degree: 6

Using the degree-based ordering method, we analyze the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

Triangles found:
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 6>
<3, 0, 9>
<0, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
