Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 17) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 16) (13, 5) (13, 3) (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 9) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 19) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 12) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 11) (16, 8) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 3) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 11) (14, 3) (12, 18) (12, 0) (3, 13) (3, 16) (3, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections). Then we will relabel the nodes and count the triangles formed in the graph.

After sorting the nodes based on degree, the new node order is:   
Node 0: degree 4  
Node 9: degree 4  
Node 11: degree 4  
Node 12: degree 4  
Node 13: degree 4  
Node 2: degree 5  
Node 4: degree 5  
Node 7: degree 5  
Node 10: degree 5  
Node 1: degree 6  
Node 5: degree 6  
Node 8: degree 6  
Node 14: degree 6  
Node 15: degree 6  
Node 16: degree 6  
Node 18: degree 6  
Node 3: degree 7  
Node 6: degree 7  
Node 17: degree 8  
Node 19: degree 8  

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the edges. Since we have sorted the nodes, we will only consider the edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections.

Triangles found:  
<1, 9, 4>  
<0, 7, 17>  
<2, 8, 16>  
<5, 13, 19>  
<2, 0, 12>  
<1, 15, 19>  
<8, 16, 10>  
<3, 14, 16>  

Total number of triangles: [8]
