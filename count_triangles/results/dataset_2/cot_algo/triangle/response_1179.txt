Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 10) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 4) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 12) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 14) (12, 19) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 4) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 10) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 15) (1, 16) (1, 11) (1, 10) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 13) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 13) (15, 17) (15, 14) (10, 9) (10, 19) (10, 18) (10, 1) (2, 4) (13, 3) (13, 14) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows with its connections:

Nodes:
0: 7, 3, 11, 5
1: 16, 11, 10
2: 4
3: 0, 16, 13
4: 5, 16, 2
5: 0, 7, 4
6: 17, 11, 8
7: 0, 5, 8
8: 6, 7, 19, 14
9: 18, 17, 10
10: 9, 19, 18, 1
11: 6, 0, 1
12: 19, 16
13: 3, 14
14: 8, 15, 13
15: 17, 14
16: 12, 1, 3, 18, 4
17: 6, 9, 15
18: 9, 16, 10
19: 8, 10, 12
