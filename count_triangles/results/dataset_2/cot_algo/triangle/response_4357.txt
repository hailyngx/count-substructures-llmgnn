Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 19) (9, 2) (9, 20) (9, 0) (10, 21) (10, 18) (10, 22) (11, 28) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 2) (7, 11) (7, 23) (7, 18) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 1) (28, 11) (28, 16) (26, 25) (26, 8) (26, 13) (4, 11) (4, 27) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (27, 4) (27, 25) (27, 5) (16, 28) (16, 3) (16, 2) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 20) (15, 1) (20, 9) (20, 1) (20, 29) (20, 23) (29, 20) (29, 0) (29, 22) (29, 14) (21, 10) (21, 24) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 23) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 29) (14, 2) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 18) (8, 26) (8, 17) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 23) (24, 21) (24, 0) (24, 18) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 14) (5, 4) (5, 27) (0, 9) (0, 29) (0, 24) (3, 16) (3, 19) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 17) (18, 24) (18, 13) (22, 10) (22, 29) (23, 7) (23, 20) (23, 25) (23, 19) (13, 26) (13, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. The sorted vertices with their respective degrees are as follows:

(5: 2), (6: 2), (8: 2), (9: 3), (13: 2), (15: 1), (16: 3), (17: 3), (21: 2), (24: 3), (28: 3), (3: 2), (26: 3), (4: 4), (7: 4), (12: 3), (19: 3), (1: 4), (25: 3), (2: 4), (10: 3), (14: 4), (27: 3), (0: 3), (20: 4), (29: 4), (18: 5), (22: 2), (11: 4), (23: 4)

Now, let's count the number of triangles:
