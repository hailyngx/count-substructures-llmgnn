Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) first. Then for each edge, we only consider the case where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections to ensure each triangle is only counted once. 

After relabeling the vertices based on their degree in increasing order, the sorted list is:
Node 5 (degree 4) - Label 0
Node 9 (degree 5) - Label 1
Node 4 (degree 5) - Label 2
Node 7 (degree 5) - Label 3
Node 1 (degree 3) - Label 4
Node 3 (degree 3) - Label 5
Node 8 (degree 3) - Label 6
Node 6 (degree 6) - Label 7
Node 0 (degree 4) - Label 8
Node 2 (degree 3) - Label 9

Now, we will count the triangles based on the sorted vertices:

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
