Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 18) (4, 18) (4, 1) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 3) (13, 12) (13, 11) (15, 16) (15, 0) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 10) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (14, 2) (14, 12) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 0) (17, 9) (17, 6) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 12) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 15) (0, 6) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 19) (12, 1) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 18) (10, 2) (10, 16) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 17) 
(2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) 
(8, 0) (8, 18)
(4, 18) (4, 1)
(18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 3)
(13, 12) (13, 11)
(15, 16) (15, 0)
(16, 7) (16, 10) 
(7, 18)
(11, 6) 
(14, 12) 
(17, 6)
(19, 1) (19, 12)
(0, 6)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes: 17, 16, 7, 10, 1, 5, 4, 3, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19, 9, 18, 6, 0, 8, 2, 12

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles and find the unique triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 20]

Unique triangles:
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 18>
<1, 12, 19>
<2, 7, 16>
<2, 8, 18>
<2, 10, 16>
<2, 12, 14>
<3, 5, 9>
<6, 11, 17>
<12, 13, 14>
