Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied to the given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges by sorting the nodes based on their degree. The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 3

The sorted labels based on degree are:
Node 4 (degree 3) -> labeled as node 0
Node 9 (degree 3) -> labeled as node 1
Node 6 (degree 4) -> labeled as node 2
Node 8 (degree 4) -> labeled as node 3
Node 0 (degree 4) -> labeled as node 4
Node 5 (degree 5) -> labeled as node 5
Node 2 (degree 5) -> labeled as node 6
Node 7 (degree 5) -> labeled as node 7
Node 1 (degree 5) -> labeled as node 8
Node 3 (degree 5) -> labeled as node 9

Now, we analyze the edges in increasing order of the labels of the nodes:
1. From node 0 to node 4, there are no connections with lower labeled nodes for node 0.
2. From node 0 to node 9, there are no connections with lower labeled nodes for node 0.
3. From node 0 to node 6, there are no connections with lower labeled nodes for node 0.
4. From node 0 to node 8, there are no connections with lower labeled nodes for node 0.
5. From node 1 to node 8, there are no connections with lower labeled nodes for node 1.
6. From node 1 to node 3, there are no connections with lower labeled nodes for node 1.
7. From node 1 to node 9, there are no connections with lower labeled nodes for node 1.
8. From node 1 to node 5, there are no connections with lower labeled nodes for node 1.
9. From node 2 to node 7, there are no connections with lower labeled nodes for node 2.
10. From node 2 to node 5, there are no connections with lower labeled nodes for node 2.
11. From node 3 to node 8, there are no connections with lower labeled nodes for node 3.
12. From node 4 to node 8, there are no connections with lower labeled nodes for node 4.
13. From node 5 to node 7, there are no connections with lower labeled nodes for node 5.
14. From node 6 to node 7, there are no connections with lower labeled nodes for node 6.
15. From node 8 to node 7, there are no connections with lower labeled nodes for node 8.

Hence, there are no triangles found in this graph following the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Output: [0]
