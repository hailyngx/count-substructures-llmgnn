Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given graph and edges, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 0), (9, 7), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 8), (4, 2), (4, 5), (8, 6), (8, 4), (8, 0), (5, 6), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 2), (5, 0), (5, 7), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 0), (0, 6), (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 5), (0, 2), (0, 7), (7, 9), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 0)

Next, let's sort the nodes by their number of connections (degree):
Nodes in sorted order: 6, 9, 1, 4, 8, 2, 7, 3, 5, 0

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

[Total number of triangles: 12]

<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 8, 6>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<0, 2, 5>
