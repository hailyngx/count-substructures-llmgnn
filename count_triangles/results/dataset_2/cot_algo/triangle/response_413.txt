Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph by listing the nodes and their connections:

Nodes and their connections:
0: 5, 9, 3
1: 4, 7, 6, 2
2: 5, 4, 8, 6, 1
3: 7, 8, 6, 0
4: 8, 1, 2
5: 9, 6, 2, 0
6: 5, 8, 1, 3, 2
7: 9, 3, 1
8: 9, 4, 2, 6, 3
9: 5, 8, 7, 0

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degree:
Node degree: 0<1<3<4<5<7<8<9<2<6
Relabeled nodes:
0: 5
1: 1
2: 3
3: 7
4: 4
5: 9
6: 8
7: 2
8: 0
9: 6

We will now count the triangles:
Triangles: <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [6]
