Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 19) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 15) (1, 4) (1, 18) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 18) (18, 1) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 18) (15, 17) (15, 0) (8, 14) (8, 17) (19, 14) (19, 3) (19, 18) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (7, 5) (7, 16) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 10) (2, 9) (2, 11) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 0) (0, 9) (0, 15) (0, 12) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 2) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: (5, 13), (5, 17), (5, 7), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 13), (9, 0), (14, 17), (14, 8), (14, 19), (17, 5), (17, 14), (17, 8), (17, 15), (1, 4), (1, 18), (3, 16), (3, 19), (3, 4), (4, 9), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 18), (18, 1), (18, 4), (18, 19), (18, 16), (18, 13), (13, 5), (13, 9), (13, 18), (15, 17), (15, 0), (8, 14), (8, 17), (19, 14), (19, 3), (19, 18), (6, 10), (6, 11), (6, 12), (7, 5), (7, 16), (16, 3), (16, 18), (16, 7), (16, 10), (2, 9), (2, 11), (12, 6), (12, 10), (12, 0), (0, 9), (0, 15), (0, 12), (10, 6), (10, 16), (10, 12), (11, 6), (11, 2)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method. The vertices sorted by their degree are:
(1) {2, 11, 15, 19}
(2) {1, 6, 7, 8, 12}
(3) {0, 3, 10, 16}
(4) {5, 13}
(5) {4, 14, 18}
(6) {9, 17}
(7) {11}
(8) {4, 14, 18}
(9) {0, 5, 13}
(10) {6, 12}
(11) {6}
(12) {0, 10}
(13) {5, 9, 18}
(14) {8, 17, 19}
(15) {17}

Now, counting the triangles:
[Number of triangles]: 12
<Triangles>: <0, 5, 13>, <0, 9, 13>, <0, 12, 10>, <1, 4, 18>, <3, 4, 18>, <3, 4, 16>, <4, 18, 13>, <6, 10, 12>, <7, 16, 10>, <8, 14, 17>, <14, 17, 19>, <16, 18, 3>
