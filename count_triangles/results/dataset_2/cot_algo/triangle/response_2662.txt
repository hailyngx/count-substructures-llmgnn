Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 17) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 6) (11, 18) (11, 15) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 12) (12, 9) (12, 6) (16, 17) (16, 19) (15, 7) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 14) (19, 16) (19, 15) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 16) (10, 3) (10, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 13) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 12) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
The given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: (4, 7), (4, 14), (4, 1), (4, 6), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 15), (7, 17), (2, 18), (2, 8), (2, 0), (18, 2), (18, 11), (18, 6), (18, 13), (8, 2), (8, 9), (3, 17), (3, 10), (3, 6), (11, 18), (11, 15), (0, 7), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 9), (9, 8), (9, 0), (9, 10), (9, 12), (12, 9), (12, 6), (16, 17), (16, 19), (15, 7), (15, 11), (15, 19), (15, 13), (15, 14), (19, 16), (19, 15), (17, 7), (17, 3), (17, 16), (10, 3), (10, 9), (1, 4), (1, 0), (1, 13), (14, 4), (14, 15), (14, 13), (6, 4), (6, 18), (6, 3), (6, 12), (13, 18), (13, 15), (13, 1), (13, 14)

After relabeling the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order, the new ordering is:

Nodes: 10, 1, 3, 9, 6, 4, 8, 0, 15, 7, 5, 17, 18, 14, 13, 12, 16, 11, 2, 19

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 2, 18>, <0, 7, 15>, <2, 6, 18>, <7, 13, 15>, <9, 10, 12>, <13, 14, 15>
