Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 22) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 27) (4, 0) (4, 29) (4, 2) (7, 23) (7, 26) (21, 28) (21, 18) (21, 29) (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 27) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 16) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 0) (1, 16) (1, 18) (26, 7) (26, 15) (26, 20) (28, 21) (28, 12) (28, 10) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 18) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 20) (11, 9) (11, 23) (11, 15) (23, 7) (23, 11) (23, 27) (17, 25) (17, 22) (25, 13) (25, 17) (25, 10) (22, 5) (22, 14) (22, 17) (22, 19) (19, 22) (19, 3) (19, 12) (18, 21) (18, 1) (18, 0) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (16, 13) (16, 1) (16, 24) (16, 15) (24, 16) (24, 3) (15, 26) (15, 11) (15, 16) (3, 19) (3, 2) (3, 24) (20, 26) (20, 14) (20, 12) (12, 28) (12, 19) (12, 20) (10, 6) (10, 28) (10, 25) (10, 2) (27, 9) (27, 8) (27, 23) (29, 4) (29, 21) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections). The sorted list of nodes is as follows: 

Node 28: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 17: degree 3
Node 19: degree 3
Node 15: degree 3
Node 24: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 20: degree 3
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 11: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 6: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 5: degree 3
Node 25: degree 3
Node 26: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 21: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 18: degree 3
Node 22: degree 4
Node 27: degree 3
Node 16: degree 4
Node 23: degree 3
Node 29: degree 2

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles based on the given method. 

The total number of triangles is [38].
