Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 14) (8, 19) (8, 16) (13, 12) (13, 19) (13, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 3) (2, 18) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 19) (11, 12) (11, 15) (1, 4) (1, 18) (1, 0) (17, 5) (17, 15) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 11) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 14) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 10) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 12) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 0) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 14) (10, 16) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
The graph's nodes with their respective connections are as follows:  

Node 0: 1, 12, 15  
Node 1: 0, 4, 18  
Node 2: 16, 18  
Node 3: 6, 9, 12  
Node 4: 1, 5, 7  
Node 5: 4, 6, 11, 17, 19  
Node 6: 3, 5  
Node 7: 4, 14  
Node 8: 16, 19  
Node 9: 3, 9, 11, 14, 15  
Node 10: 16  
Node 11: 5, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19  
Node 12: 0, 3, 11, 13, 14  
Node 13: 12, 14, 19  
Node 14: 7, 9, 12, 13  
Node 15: 0, 9, 11, 15, 17  
Node 16: 2, 8, 10  
Node 17: 5, 11, 15  
Node 18: 1, 2  
Node 19: 5, 8, 11, 13, 19  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the nodes are relabeled as below:  
Node 0: 0 with degree 3  
Node 1: 1 with degree 3  
Node 2: 2 with degree 2  
Node 3: 3 with degree 3  
Node 4: 4 with degree 3  
Node 5: 5 with degree 5  
Node 6: 6 with degree 2  
Node 7: 7 with degree 2  
Node 8: 8 with degree 2  
Node 9: 9 with degree 5  
Node 10: 10 with degree 1  
Node 11: 11 with degree 6  
Node 12: 12 with degree 5  
Node 13: 13 with degree 3  
Node 14: 14 with degree 4  
Node 15: 15 with degree 5  
Node 16: 16 with degree 3  
Node 17: 17 with degree 3  
Node 18: 18 with degree 2  
Node 19: 19 with degree 5  

After sorting the edges based on the labels, we get:  
(0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 15) (1, 4) (1, 18) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 17) (9, 14) (9, 15) (11, 17) (12, 13) (12 14) (12, 0) (13, 14) (15, 17)  

Now, let's find the triangles and count them.  

Total number of triangles: [18]  
Unique triangles: <3, 11, 17>, <3, 12, 14>, <3, 9, 14>, <3, 9, 15>, <5, 11, 15>, <5, 11, 19>, <5, 17, 15>, <12, 13, 14>, <12, 14, 3>, <12, 14, 9>, <12, 0, 15>, <12, 11, 15>, <13, 14, 9>, <0, 12, 15>, <1, 4, 18>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 11>
