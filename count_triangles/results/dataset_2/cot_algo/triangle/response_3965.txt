Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 16) (14, 7) (14, 9) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 0) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 18) (5, 3) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 19) (2, 9) (1, 17) (1, 8) (1, 6) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 2) (13, 17) (13, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 9) (18, 8) (16, 15) (16, 17) (16, 12) (7, 15) (7, 14) (7, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 12) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will now be applied to count the triangles in the given graph. 

Vertices sorted by their number of connections (degree):
```
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 14: 2 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 11: 2 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 13: 2 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 18: 1 connection
Node 16: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
```

Starting to count the triangles now:
```
[Total Number of Triangles: 19]
```

Unique triangles found:
```
