Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph efficiently. Let's start by organizing the vertices based on their degrees:

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 5

Following the method of checking each edge starting from the node with the lower label, we find the total number of triangles to be 9. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <0, 7, 5>
- <0, 3, 2>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <2, 7, 4>
- <5, 1, 7>
- <5, 1, 6>
