Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. The sorted list of vertices is: 

Node 4: Degree 2  
Node 6: Degree 3  
Node 1: Degree 4  
Node 0: Degree 4  
Node 7: Degree 4  
Node 5: Degree 4  
Node 3: Degree 5  
Node 9: Degree 5  
Node 2: Degree 6  
Node 8: Degree 6  

Following this order, we will examine each edge to count the number of triangles. 

After analyzing all the edges, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 3>  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 3, 5>  
<0, 7, 9>  
<1, 2, 8>  
<1, 3, 5>  
<2, 5, 8>  
<5, 7, 8>
