Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 5 has degree 3  
Node 6 has degree 6  
Node 9 has degree 4  
Node 1 has degree 4  
Node 3 has degree 4  
Node 7 has degree 4  
Node 0 has degree 4  
Node 2 has degree 4  
Node 8 has degree 3  
Node 4 has degree 4  


The sorted vertices by their degrees are therefore:  
5, 8  
9, 1, 3, 7, 0, 2, 4  
6  


Now we will check each edge according to the rule we discussed earlier.

Starting with edge (5, 9):  
Both nodes have the same degree. No triangle is formed.  

Next, edge (5, 2):  
Node 5 has a lower degree than node 2.  
Checking for shared connections of 5 and 2: Node 7  
Formed triangle: <5, 2, 7>  

Continue with other edges following the same steps.

The total number of triangles is [12] found through the following unique triangles:  
<0, 3, 4>  
<0, 6, 4>  
<0, 6, 8>  
<0, 8, 1>  
<1, 3, 2>  
<1, 3, 6>  
<1, 6, 7>  
<2, 3, 4>  
<4, 6, 3>  
<5, 2, 7>  
<7, 6, 9>  
<7, 9, 5>
