Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 11) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 14) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 14) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 10) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 14) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 15
Edges: 60

Edges:
(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 9), (0, 12),
(1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 11),
(2, 3), (2, 9), (2, 11), (2, 14),
(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2),
(4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 11), (4, 12),
(5, 8), (5, 10), (5, 13), (5, 14),
(6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 12), (6, 14),
(7, 0), (7, 8), (7, 10), (7, 13),
(8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 11),
(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 13),
(10, 5), (10, 7), (10, 14),
(11, 1), (11, 4), (11, 8), (11, 14), (11, 2),
(12, 0), (12, 4), (12, 6),
(13, 5), (13, 7), (13, 9), (13, 14),
(14, 2), (14, 5), (14, 6), (14, 10), (14, 11)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Nodes sorted by degree: [3, 10, 2, 9, 8, 6, 13, 1, 5, 12, 0, 4, 11, 14, 7]
Relabeling nodes accordingly: 
0 -> 0, 1 -> 1, 2 -> 2, 3 -> 3, 4 -> 4, 5 -> 5, 6 -> 6, 7 -> 7, 8 -> 8, 9 -> 9, 10 -> 10, 11 -> 11, 12 -> 12, 13 -> 13, 14 -> 14

Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 2>, <0, 3, 1>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 11>, <0, 4, 12>, <1, 3, 2>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 4>, <1, 6, 11>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 11, 14>
