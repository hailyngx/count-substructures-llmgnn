Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly. Let's apply this method:

Node 4 has degree 3.
Node 7 has degree 3.
Node 6 has degree 2.
Node 1 has degree 2.
Node 5 has degree 2.
Node 2 has degree 4.
Node 8 has degree 5.
Node 0 has degree 5.
Node 3 has degree 6.
Node 9 has degree 7.

The relabeled nodes are:
Node 4 → Node 0
Node 7 → Node 1
Node 6 → Node 2
Node 1 → Node 3
Node 5 → Node 4
Node 2 → Node 5
Node 8 → Node 6
Node 0 → Node 7
Node 3 → Node 8
Node 9 → Node 9

Using the relabeled nodes, we can identify the triangles in the graph:

Triangles found:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 7, 4>
<3, 1, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 0>
<8, 5, 0>
<8, 7, 5>
<8, 4, 0>
<8, 2, 5>
<8, 2, 0>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 4>
<9, 7, 5>
<9, 8, 5>
<9, 6, 2>
<9, 0, 4>
<9, 3, 0>
<5, 7, 0>
