Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 3) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (4)
- 1: (4, 6, 9, 3, 2, 8)
- 2: (1, 5, 8)
- 3: (4, 9, 1, 0, 5)
- 4: (7, 0, 3, 5, 1)
- 5: (4, 3, 2, 8)
- 6: (7, 9, 1)
- 7: (4, 6, 8)
- 8: (7, 9, 1, 5, 2)
- 9: (6, 8, 3, 1)

Next, we will perform Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes(sorted by degree): 0, 2, 7, 5, 6, 9, 8, 3, 1, 4

Now, let's go through each edge and count the number of triangles: (denoted by [])
[16]

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 9, 6>
<1, 9, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 5>
<5, 8, 2>
<8, 9, 6>
