Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (8, 10) (8, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 11) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes and edges are as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
(5, 12), (5, 11), (5, 14), (9, 4), (9, 10), (9, 3), (9, 12), (4, 9), (4, 13), (4, 10), 
(8, 10), (8, 3), (7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 14), (7, 13), (7, 1), (12, 5), (12, 9), (12, 2), 
(12, 11), (3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 11), (3, 0), (3, 10), (11, 5), (11, 12), (11, 3), (11, 1), 
(0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 1), (0, 2), (2, 12), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 14), (14, 5), (14, 7), 
(14, 2), (14, 6), (1, 7), (1, 11), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 13), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 14), 
(10, 9), (10, 4), (10, 8), (10, 3), (10, 13), (13, 4), (13, 7), (13, 1), (13, 10)

Next, we will label the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes by degree (in ascending order): 
0 (degree: 4), 6 (degree: 3), 8 (degree: 2), 5 (degree: 3), 14 (degree: 4), 9 (degree: 4), 13 (degree: 4), 1 (degree: 4), 12 (degree: 4), 4 (degree: 4), 10 (degree: 5), 11 (degree: 4), 7 (degree: 5), 3 (degree: 5), 2 (degree: 5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method with the given edges, we find the total number of triangles is [16]. 
The unique triangles found are:
<2, 3, 10>, <2, 14, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 12>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 7, 13>, <7, 13, 1>, <3, 8, 10>, <3, 10, 9>, <4, 10, 9>, <4, 13, 7>, <4, 10, 8>, <6, 7, 14>, <5, 12, 11>
