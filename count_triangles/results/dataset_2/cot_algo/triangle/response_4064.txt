Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 16) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 7) (17, 3) (17, 4) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 15) (18, 10) (18, 19) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 2) (3, 17) (3, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (15, 16) (15, 6) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 14) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 15) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 16) (14, 4) 

Response:

Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 12: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 17: 3 connections
Vertex 15: 2 connections
Vertex 18: 2 connections
Vertex 11: 3 connections
Vertex 0 : 4 connections
Vertex 19: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 10: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 16: 4 connections
Vertex 13: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 14: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.

Number of triangles: [10]
