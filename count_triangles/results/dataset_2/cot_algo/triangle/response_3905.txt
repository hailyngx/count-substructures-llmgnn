Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 19) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 13) (4, 16) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 16) (0, 14) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 15) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 19) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 7) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 1) (16, 14) (16, 4) (16, 18) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 1) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 13) 

Response:
Given graph with labeled nodes and its corresponding edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: [(5, 6), (5, 2), (9, 8), (9, 18), (9, 7), (14, 17), (14, 0), (14, 3), (14, 16), (17, 14), (17, 19), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 12), (4, 13), (4, 16), (18, 9), (18, 10), (18, 15), (18, 16), (0, 14), (3, 14), (11, 8), (11, 12), (11, 2), (11, 15), (8, 9), (8, 11), (8, 19), (13, 4), (13, 2), (13, 15), (13, 7), (19, 17), (19, 8), (19, 10), (19, 1), (16, 14), (16, 4), (16, 18), (1, 6), (1, 19), (1, 10), (2, 5), (2, 11), (2, 13), (2, 12), (12, 6), (12, 11), (12, 2), (7, 9), (7, 6), (7, 13), (10, 18), (10, 19), (10, 1), (15, 18), (15, 11), (15, 13)]

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Relabel the nodes by their degree:
Nodes (Degree): {17 (2), 6 (4), 13 (4), 0 (1), 18 (4), 7 (3), 16 (3), 15 (3), 3 (1), 1 (3), 19 (4), 14 (4), 4 (2), 5 (2), 2 (4), 11 (4), 12 (3), 10 (3), 8 (3), 9 (4)}

2. Sorting the nodes by degree in ascending order:
Nodes (Degree): {0 (1), 3 (1), 4 (2), 5 (2), 7 (3), 10 (3), 12 (3), 15 (3), 16 (3), 1 (3), 8 (3), 9 (4), 11 (4), 13 (4), 14 (4), 17 (4), 18 (4), 2 (4), 6 (4), 19 (4)}

3. Counting triangles by examining edges:
- Triangles: 28
- Unique triangles: <2, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 12>, <5, 6, 1>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 13>, <5, 6, 2>, <5, 6, 9>, <9, 8, 11>, <9, 8, 19>, <9, 8, 7>, <9, 8, 15>, <9, 18, 10>, <9, 18, 16>, <9, 18, 15>, <14, 17, 19>, <14, 17, 8>, <14, 17, 15>, <17, 14, 0>, <17, 14, 16>, <17, 19, 10>, <17, 19, 1>, <6, 1, 19>, <4, 13, 2>, <4, 13, 7>, <18, 10, 1>, <11, 2, 12>, <11, 15, 13>, <8, 19, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [28].
