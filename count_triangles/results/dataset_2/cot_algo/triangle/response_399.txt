Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 24) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 18) (27, 28) (27, 8) (1, 26) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 10) (3, 19) (3, 12) (20, 7) (20, 19) (26, 1) (26, 2) (26, 15) (26, 25) (2, 26) (2, 16) (2, 4) (8, 27) (8, 5) (8, 11) (19, 3) (19, 20) (4, 2) (4, 28) (18, 27) (18, 23) (7, 20) (7, 25) (7, 6) (7, 22) (7, 9) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 17) (25, 15) (28, 27) (28, 4) (17, 25) (17, 12) (17, 15) (22, 7) (22, 16) (22, 6) (22, 29) (11, 8) (11, 24) (11, 21) (24, 0) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 10) (15, 26) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 6) (13, 1) (13, 21) (13, 29) (13, 6) (21, 0) (21, 11) (21, 13) (21, 5) (5, 8) (5, 21) (16, 2) (16, 22) (6, 7) (6, 22) (6, 15) (6, 13) (14, 1) (23, 18) (23, 9) (12, 3) (12, 17) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 23) (10, 3) (10, 24) (29, 22) (29, 13) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 30
Edges: 90
Edges:
- Node 0: 27, 21, 24, 9
- Node 27: 0, 24, 18, 28, 8
- Node 1: 26, 14, 13
- Node 3: 10, 19, 12
- Node 20: 7, 19
- Node 26: 1, 2, 15, 25
- Node 2: 26, 16, 4
- Node 8: 27, 5, 11
- Node 19: 3, 20
- Node 4: 2, 28
- Node 18: 27, 23
- Node 7: 20, 25, 6, 22, 9
- Node 25: 26, 7, 17, 15
- Node 28: 27, 4
- Node 17: 25, 12, 15
- Node 22: 7, 16, 6, 29
- Node 11: 8, 24, 21
- Node 24: 0, 27, 11, 10
- Node 15: 26, 25, 17, 6
- Node 13: 1, 21, 29, 6
- Node 21: 0, 11, 13, 5
- Node 5: 8, 21
- Node 16: 2, 22
- Node 6: 7, 22, 15, 13
- Node 14: 1
- Node 23: 18, 9
- Node 12: 3, 17
- Node 9: 0, 7, 23
- Node 10: 3, 24
- Node 29: 22, 13

Now, by sorting the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order, we have:
Nodes in ascending order of degrees: 14, 16, 29, 5, 10, 2, 18, 4, 1, 12, 19, 28, 3, 20, 23, 9, 13, 17, 22, 11, 24, 26, 6, 21, 7, 15, 8, 25, 0, 27

Next, we will count the total number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [36]
Unique triangles found: <0, 7, 9>, <0, 7, 24>, <0, 9, 23>, <1, 13, 21>, <1, 13, 29>, <1, 14, 26>, <2, 4, 28>, <2, 16, 22>, <3, 10, 24>, <3, 12, 17>, <3, 12, 25>, <3, 17, 25>, <4, 16, 22>, <4, 16, 28>, <4, 22, 28>, <5, 8, 21>, <6, 13, 29>, <6, 15, 25>, <6, 15, 26>, <6, 22, 29>, <6, 13, 26>, <6, 13, 21>, <7, 15, 25>, <7, 20, 19>, <7, 20, 25>, <7, 20, 26>, <9, 10, 24>, <9, 23, 18>, <10, 24, 27>, <13, 21, 11>, <15, 17, 25>, <15, 17, 26>, <21, 24, 11>, <22, 28, 4>, <22, 29, 13>, <22, 29, 6>
