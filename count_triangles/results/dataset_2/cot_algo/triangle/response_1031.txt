Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 5) (15, 18) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 17) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 16) (18, 15) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 8) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 16) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 10) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 12) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 1) (5, 3) (5, 19) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 11) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (12, 18) (12, 1) (13, 7) (13, 11) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 1) (16, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 19) (6, 3) (6, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

First, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

Node 0: 1 edge
Node 5: 2 edges
Node 13: 2 edges
Node 12: 2 edges
Node 14: 2 edges
Node 11: 3 edges
Node 19: 3 edges
Node 6: 3 edges
Node 3: 3 edges
Node 1: 4 edges
Node 9: 4 edges
Node 7: 5 edges
Node 18: 5 edges
Node 2: 6 edges
Node 8: 6 edges
Node 4: 6 edges
Node 17: 6 edges
Node 16: 6 edges
Node 10: 4 edges
Node 15: 4 edges

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will start considering edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <3, 5, 19>
2. <3, 5, 6>
3. <3, 6, 16>
4. <13, 9, 11>
5. <13, 11, 14>
6. <12, 1, 17>
7. <12, 1, 16>
8. <12, 16, 14>
9. <14, 11, 13>
10. <11, 9, 7>
11. <11, 13, 7>
12. <7, 9, 0>
13. <7, 9, 8>
14. <7, 9, 11>
15. <7, 9, 17>
16. <7, 17, 4>
17. <18, 8, 2>
18. <18, 8, 19>
19. <18, 8, 10>
20. <18, 8, 12>
21. <18, 2, 15>
22. <18, 2, 16>
23. <18, 2, 8>
24. <18, 15, 2>
25. <16, 6, 3>
26. <16, 6, 4>
27. <16, 6, 3>
 
There are 27 triangles in total.
