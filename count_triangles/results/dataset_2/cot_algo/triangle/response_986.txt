Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 2) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 10) (10, 9) (10, 14) 

Response:
[Narrator: Degree-Based Ordering method]

Node 2: degree 3
Node 10: degree 2
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 12: degree 3
Node 14: degree 5
Node 7: degree 5
Node 0: degree 5
Node 11: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 9: degree 5
