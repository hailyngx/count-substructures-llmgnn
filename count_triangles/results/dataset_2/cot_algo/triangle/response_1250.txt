Now, let's calculate the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted by degree:
0: 3 connections
1: 2 connections
2: 3 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 2 connections
10: 4 connections
11: 2 connections
13: 3 connections
14: 3 connections
15: 3 connections
16: 3 connections
17: 3 connections
18: 2 connections
19: 3 connections
20: 4 connections
21: 4 connections
22: 3 connections
23: 3 connections
24: 3 connections
25: 4 connections
26: 5 connections
27: 3 connections
28: 3 connections
29: 3 connections

Triangles:
