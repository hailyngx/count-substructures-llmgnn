Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 10) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 10) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method steps are as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections (degree) in ascending order:
   - Nodes with 0 connections: 3
   - Nodes with 1 connection: 1, 13
   - Nodes with 2 connections: 4, 7
   - Nodes with 3 connections: 5, 6
   - Nodes with 4 connections: 9, 3
   - Nodes with 5 connections: 8
   - Nodes with 6 connections: 12
   - Nodes with 7 connections: 10
   - Nodes with 8 connections: 11
   - Nodes with 9 connections: 0
   - Nodes with 10 connections: 14
   Hence, the sorted list is: 3, 1, 13, 4, 7, 5, 6, 9, 3, 8, 12, 10, 11, 0, 14

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   - 3 -> 0, 1 -> 1, 13 -> 2, 4 -> 3, 7 -> 4, 5 -> 5, 6 -> 6, 9 -> 7, 3 -> 8, 8 -> 9, 12 -> 10, 10 -> 11, 11 -> 12, 0 -> 13, 14 -> 14

3. Process the edges:
   - (1, 0) - No action as both have the same number of connections
   - (1, 6) - No action as both have the same number of connections
   - (1, 11) - No action as both have the same number of connections
   - (1, 2) - No action as both have the same number of connections
   - (1, 4) - No action as both have the same number of connections
   - (1, 9) - No action as both have the same number of connections
   - (1, 8) - The vertex 1 has fewer connections, so proceed
     - Shared connections with vertex 8: 0, 9, 6
     - Triangles formed: <1, 0, 8>, <1, 9, 8>, <1, 6, 8>

   (Continuing for all edge pairs)
   - Total number of triangles: 8

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. 
The unique triangles found are: <1, 0, 8>, <1, 9, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <4, 9, 0>, <4, 3, 13>, <4, 12, 0>, <5, 11, 6>, <10, 12, 14>.
