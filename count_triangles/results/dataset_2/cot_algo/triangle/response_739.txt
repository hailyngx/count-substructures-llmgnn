Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 4) (13, 29) (22, 18) (22, 10) (15, 5) (15, 21) (27, 14) (4, 13) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 29) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (9, 1) (26, 24) (26, 14) (26, 6) (6, 26) (6, 18) (6, 19) (18, 22) (18, 6) (18, 11) (18, 28) (18, 25) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 8) (20, 23) (28, 18) (28, 29) (28, 17) (28, 5) (29, 13) (29, 4) (29, 28) (29, 23) (19, 6) (19, 23) (24, 26) (24, 16) (24, 0) (24, 10) (17, 28) (17, 5) (8, 12) (8, 14) (23, 20) (23, 29) (23, 19) (23, 3) (14, 27) (14, 26) (14, 8) (14, 16) (2, 21) (2, 25) (0, 24) (0, 16) (0, 25) (0, 5) (16, 12) (16, 24) (16, 14) (16, 0) (21, 13) (21, 15) (21, 2) (21, 11) (25, 18) (25, 2) (25, 0) (25, 1) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 10) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 25) (10, 22) (10, 24) (10, 3) (5, 15) (5, 28) (5, 17) (5, 0) (11, 18) (11, 21) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree or number of connections. 

Here is the sorted list of vertices with their degrees:
(0: 5), (1: 3), (2: 2), (3: 3), (4: 5), (5: 5), (6: 4), (7: 3), (8: 3), (9: 1), (10: 3), (11: 2), (12: 4), (13: 3), (14: 4), (15: 2), (16: 4), (17: 2), (18: 5), (19: 2), (20: 1), (21: 4), (22: 2), (23: 4), (24: 4), (25: 4), (26: 3), (27: 1), (28: 4), (29: 4)

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles based on this ordering:
1. For edge (13, 21):
No triangles formed.

2. For edge (13, 4):
Triangles: <13, 4, 12>, <4, 13, 29>, <4, 13, 7>

3. For edge (13, 29):
Triangles: <13, 29, 4>

4. For edge (22, 18):
No triangles formed.

5. For edge (22, 10):
No triangles formed.

6. For edge (15, 5):
No triangles formed.

7. Continue checking all edges...

After considering all edges, the total number of triangles in this graph is [16]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<13, 4, 12>, <4, 13, 29>, <4, 13, 7>, <13, 29, 4>, <4, 12, 16>, <4, 16, 8>, <4, 16, 14>, <7, 4, 12>, <7, 3, 23>, <10, 24, 0>, <18, 22, 6>, <18, 25, 0>, <18, 28, 29>, <18, 25, 2>, <23, 20, 29>, <23, 19, 6>.
