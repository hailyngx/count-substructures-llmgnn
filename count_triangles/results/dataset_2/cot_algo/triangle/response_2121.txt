Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 11) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (2, 14) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 9) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 9) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is as follows:
(2) -> 1 connections
(14) -> 2 connections
(0) -> 3 connections
(5) -> 3 connections
(2) -> 3 connections
(4) -> 4 connections
(6) -> 4 connections
(9) -> 4 connections
(7) -> 5 connections
(3) -> 5 connections
(13) -> 5 connections
(10) -> 5 connections
(11) -> 6 connections
(12) -> 6 connections
(8) -> 7 connections
