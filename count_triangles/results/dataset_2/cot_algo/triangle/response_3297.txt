Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 6) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 13) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (19, 8) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (13, 14) (0, 17) (0, 10) (0, 6) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 9) (12, 1) (12, 5) (10, 1) (10, 0) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 5) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (4, 16) (4, 1) (4, 15) (15, 16) (15, 17) (15, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with its nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
(11, 16), (11, 18), (11, 17), (11, 2), (16, 11), (16, 4), (16, 15), (16, 6), 
(14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 13), 
(17, 11), (17, 14), (17, 0), (17, 15), 
(1, 3), (1, 10), (1, 4), (1, 12), 
(3, 1), (3, 9), (3, 2), (3, 8), 
(5, 12), (5, 18), 
(19, 8), 
(8, 3), (8, 19), (8, 9), (8, 6), 
(9, 3), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 7), 
(13, 14), 
(0, 17), (0, 10), (0, 6), 
(2, 11), (2, 3), (2, 9), 
(12, 1), (12, 5), 
(10, 1), (10, 0), 
(18, 11), (18, 14), (18, 5), 
(6, 16), (6, 8), (6, 0), (6, 7), 
(7, 9), (7, 6), 
(4, 16), (4, 1), (4, 15), 
(15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 4)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in this graph:

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes sorted by degree: 19, 10, 5, 7, 13, 12, 18, 14, 0, 2, 4, 15, 1, 9, 3, 16, 6, 8, 17, 11

Triangles found: 
Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 11>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 15>, <1, 10, 0>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 0>
