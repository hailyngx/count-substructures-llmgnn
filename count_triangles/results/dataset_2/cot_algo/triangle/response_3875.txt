Node 1: 4
Node 2: 3
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 4
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 0
Node 7: 2
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 2
Node 10: 4
Node 11: 2
Node 12: 4
Node 13: 4
Node 14: 3
Node 15: 3
Node 16: 4
Node 17: 3
Node 18: 4
Node 19: 2
Node 20: 4
Node 21: 4
Node 22: 4
Node 23: 2
Node 24: 3
Node 25: 4
Node 26: 4

Node 29: 3

Sorted nodes based on number of connections:
Nodes with 0 connections: 6, 27
Nodes with 1 connection: 23, 29
Nodes with 2 connections: 9, 11, 19
Nodes with 3 connections: 2, 14, 15, 17, 23, 24, 28
