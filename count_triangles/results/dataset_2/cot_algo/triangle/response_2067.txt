Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 2) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 9) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 6) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 0) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 14) (10, 8) (10, 14) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 

Node 3 (Degree: 4)  
Node 13 (Degree: 4)  
Node 5 (Degree: 4)  
Node 1 (Degree: 4)  
Node 10 (Degree: 2)  
Node 6 (Degree: 5)  
Node 14 (Degree: 5)  
Node 0 (Degree: 5)  
Node 2 (Degree: 5)  
Node 11 (Degree: 5)  
Node 8 (Degree: 4)  
Node 12 (Degree: 3)  
Node 4 (Degree: 4)  
Node 7 (Degree: 5)  
Node 9 (Degree: 5)  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles.  

The total number of triangles is [13].

The unique triangles found are:  
<3, 9, 13>  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 6, 1>  
<0, 6, 14>  
<0, 6, 2>  
<0, 6, 3>  
<0, 5, 2>  
<0, 5, 7>  
<0, 1, 6>  
<0, 1, 14>  
<0, 1, 5>  
<11, 2, 13>  
<7, 4, 9>
