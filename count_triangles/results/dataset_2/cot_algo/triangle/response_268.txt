Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
   - Node 4: 2 connections (4, 7), (4, 1)
   - Node 6: 3 connections (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2)
   - Node 8: 4 connections (8, 9), (8, 7), (8, 3), (8, 2)
   - Node 5: 4 connections (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3)
   - Node 7: 4 connections (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 8)
   - Node 1: 5 connections (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 0)
   - Node 3: 5 connections (3, 5), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 8)
   - Node 0: 5 connections (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 9)
   - Node 9: 5 connections (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 7), (9, 0)
   - Node 2: 5 connections (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 8)

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly: 
   - Node 4 -> 1
   - Node 6 -> 2
   - Node 8 -> 3
   - Node 5 -> 4
   - Node 7 -> 5
   - Node 1 -> 6
   - Node 3 -> 7
   - Node 0 -> 8
   - Node 9 -> 9
   - Node 2 -> 10

3. Count the triangles:
   - The total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].

Unique triangles found in the graph: 
   - <3, 7, 8>
   - <3, 7, 2>
   - <2, 3, 1>
   - <1, 4, 5>
   - <5, 7, 8>
   - <1, 7, 8>
   - <2, 7, 8>
   - <3, 7, 9>
   - <1, 5, 7>
