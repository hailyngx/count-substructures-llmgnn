Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
