Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 12) (2, 27) (29, 9) (29, 24) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 27) (21, 10) (21, 5) (4, 18) (4, 5) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 25) (18, 1) (26, 18) (26, 6) (26, 17) (28, 17) (28, 27) (10, 21) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 20) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 8) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 20) (9, 29) (9, 8) (0, 15) (0, 16) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 13) (16, 0) (16, 25) (16, 6) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (11, 17) (11, 20) (23, 25) (23, 6) (3, 7) (3, 19) (1, 18) (1, 0) (1, 20) (1, 14) (1, 5) (20, 10) (20, 8) (20, 11) (20, 1) (17, 26) (17, 28) (17, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 25) (25, 18) (25, 16) (25, 23) (25, 13) (25, 24) (24, 29) (24, 25) (24, 27) (27, 2) (27, 7) (27, 28) (27, 24) (14, 12) (14, 1) (5, 21) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 1) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 3) (6, 26) (6, 16) (6, 23) 

Response:
Constructing the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges based on the given edge connections:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(2, 12), (2, 27), (29, 9), (29, 24), (7, 3), (7, 19), (7, 27), (21, 10), (21, 5), (4, 18), (4, 5), (18, 26), (18, 25), (18, 1), (26, 6), (26, 17), (28, 17), (28, 27), (10, 15), (10, 8), (10, 20), (15, 0), (15, 8), (8, 9), (8, 20), (9, 29), (0, 16), (0, 1), (0, 19), (0, 13), (16, 25), (12, 13), (12, 14), (11, 17), (11, 20), (23, 25), (3, 19), (1, 20), (1, 14), (20, 11), (17, 28), (13, 25), (25, 24), (27, 28), (14, 1), (19, 3), (6, 16), (6, 23)

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method:

The degrees of the nodes are:
0: 6, 1: 6, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 4, 6: 3, 7: 4, 8: 4, 9: 3, 10: 5, 11: 3, 12: 3, 13: 3, 14: 2, 15: 2, 16: 3, 17: 3, 18: 4, 19: 3, .... (degree of the other nodes)

Relabeling the nodes based on degree:
Nodes sorted by degree: 2, 14, 15, 23, 12, 13, 9, 3, 6, 11, 17, 16, 19, 27, 7, 8, 28, 24, 4, 5, 26, 18, 20, 10, 0, 1, 21, 25, 29, 22

Calculating the number of triangles:
- We will only consider edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections.

Triangles found:
<5, 21, 1>, <22, 9, 29>, <26, 17, 28>, <15, 8, 20>

Total number of triangles: [4]
