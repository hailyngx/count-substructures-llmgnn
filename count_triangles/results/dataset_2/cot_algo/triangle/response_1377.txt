Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
- 0: (9, 26), (9, 28), (9, 12), (26, 9), (26, 5), (26, 29), (26, 6), (3, 15), (3, 14), (3, 6), (15, 3), (15, 25), (15, 14), (10, 18), (10, 23), (10, 29), (17, 5), (7, 25), (12, 9), (12, 28), (12, 21), (0, 14), (0, 28), (0, 8), (0, 2), (14, 3), (14, 15), (14, 0), (14, 6), (22, 20), (1, 11), (1, 16), (1, 28), (20, 22), (20, 11), (25, 15), (25, 7), (25, 27), (25, 2), (6, 26), (6, 3), (6, 14), (6, 21), (6, 24), (21, 12), (21, 6), (21, 27), (21, 4), (19, 8), (19, 11), (19, 2), (23, 10), (23, 29), (8, 0), (8, 19), (27, 25), (27, 21), (16, 1), (16, 18), (5, 26), (5, 17), (5, 4), (24, 6), (24, 18), (11, 1), (11, 20), (11, 19), (11, 4), (28, 9), (28, 12), (28, 0), (28, 1), (28, 13), (2, 0), (2, 25), (2, 19), (2, 13), (13, 28), (13, 2), (13, 4), (29, 26), (29, 10), (29, 23), (18, 10), (18, 16), (18, 24), (4, 21), (4, 5), (4, 11), (4, 13)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by degree: 
1. 7 nodes: 7
2. 5 nodes: 0, 17, 22, 24, 27
3. 4 nodes: 1, 20, 2, 3
4. 3 nodes: 11, 13, 16, 18, 19, 23
5. 2 nodes: 10, 21, 25, 29, 5, 6, 8, 12, 15, 28, 4, 9

Count of triangles: [66]
