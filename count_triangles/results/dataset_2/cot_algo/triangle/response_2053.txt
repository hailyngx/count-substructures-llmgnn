Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 18) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 2) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (8, 3) (8, 19) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 19) (19, 8) (19, 9) (19, 11) (19, 16) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 13) (4, 11) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 4) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 6) (16, 10) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 15) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 18) (10, 16) (10, 2) (18, 12) (18, 6) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 15) (15, 2) (15, 17) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

Edges:
- 0: [17, 4, 2]
- 1: [3, 2, 5]
- 2: [1, 0, 13, 10, 15]
- 3: [1, 4, 9, 8]
- 4: [0, 3, 12, 13, 11]
- 5: [1, 14]
- 6: [7, 16, 18]
- 7: [12, 11, 6]
- 8: [3, 19]
- 9: [3, 19, 17]
- 10: [16, 2]
- 11: [7, 19, 4]
- 12: [7, 4, 16, 18]
- 13: [4, 2]
- 14: [5]
- 15: [2, 17]
- 16: [12, 19, 6, 10]
- 17: [0, 9, 15]
- 18: [12, 6]
- 19: [8, 9, 11, 16]

Now, let's calculate the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [<0, 2, 15>, <0, 2, 13>, <0, 2, 17>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 4, 17>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 13, 15>, <6, 12, 18>, <6, 16, 18>]

Total number of triangles: [10]
