Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 8) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 19) (18, 2) (18, 0) (7, 19) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 16) (15, 10) (15, 14) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 19) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 9) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 17) (6, 3) (6, 8) (14, 15) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 17) (4, 3) (4, 16) (4, 19) (13, 3) (13, 7) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 19) 

Response:
The graph for the given 20 nodes and 60 edges is constructed as below:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 3), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 18),
(1, 3), (1, 5),
(2, 5), (2, 18), (2, 19),
(3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 13),
(4, 3), (4, 16), (4, 19),
(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 17),
(6, 3), (6, 8),
(7, 13), (7, 19),
(8, 1), (8, 6), (8, 9), (8, 11),
(9, 0), (9, 8), (9, 16), (9, 17), (9, 19),
(10, 0), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 15),
(11, 10), (11, 8),
(12, 10), (12, 16),
(13, 3), (13, 7),
(14, 15),
(15, 10), (15, 14),
(16, 4), (16, 9), (16, 12),
(17, 5), (17, 9), (17, 19),
(18, 0), (18, 2),
(19, 2), (19, 4), (19, 7), (19, 9), (19, 17)

Now, we apply the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node degrees:
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 11: 2 connections
Node 12: 2 connections
Node 13: 2 connections
Node 14: 1 connection
Node 15: 2 connections
Node 16: 3 connections
Node 17: 3 connections
Node 18: 2 connections
Node 19: 5 connections

After relabeling based on degree:
Nodes sorted by degree: 14, 6, 7, 11, 12, 1, 18, 3, 4, 5, 2, 16, 15, 0, 10, 8, 17, 13, 19, 9

Counting triangles (cycles of length 3) using the given edges and the sorted vertices:
Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 9, 19>
<1, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 16>
<3, 9, 17>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 9, 19>
<5, 9, 17>
<9, 16, 17>
<9, 17, 19>
