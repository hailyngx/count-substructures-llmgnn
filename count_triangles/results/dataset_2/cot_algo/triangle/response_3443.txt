Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 10) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 12) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:

1. Node 0: 2 connections
2. Node 2: 3 connections
3. Node 3: 4 connections
4. Node 7: 4 connections
5. Node 11: 4 connections
6. Node 14: 4 connections
7. Node 6: 5 connections
8. Node 10: 5 connections
9. Node 5: 6 connections
10. Node 12: 6 connections
11. Node 9: 7 connections
12. Node 1: 8 connections
13. Node 8: 5 connections
14. Node 4: 6 connections
15. Node 13: 7 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the provided method.

[Total number of triangles: 3]

Unique triangles found:
<7, 1, 13>
<9, 6, 12>
<11, 2, 10>
