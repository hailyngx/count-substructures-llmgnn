Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 13) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 2), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 8), (7, 13), (7, 1), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 12), (6, 8), 
(9, 6), (9, 0), (10, 11), (10, 5), (11, 14), (11, 0), (11, 13), (11, 12), (2, 14), (8, 5), (1, 14), (12, 13), (3, 0)

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted by degree:
0(3), 2(3), 8(3), 10(2), 12(2), 13(4), 3(4), 6(4), 5(4), 11(5), 14(4), 1(5), 9(4), 7(6), 4(7)

Triangles:
[15]

Unique Triangles:
<4, 2, 7>, <4, 2, 13>, <4, 2, 14>, <4, 2, 1>, <4, 3, 7>, <4, 3, 2>, <4, 3, 1>, <4, 5, 2>, <4, 5, 1>, <4, 6, 9>, 
<4, 6, 1>, <4, 6, 12>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 13>, <4, 7, 1>
