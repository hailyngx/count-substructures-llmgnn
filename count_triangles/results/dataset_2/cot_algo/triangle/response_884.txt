The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 11) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 16) (14, 13) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 6) (3, 11) (3, 18) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 13) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 13) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 10) (15, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (6, 17) (6, 18) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 1) (18, 3) (18, 10) (18, 6) (13, 14) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 15) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges can be represented as shown below:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 11) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 9) 
(2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 16) (14, 13) (1, 17)

(5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 13) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 4) (15, 5) 
(15, 10) (15, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (6, 17) (6, 18) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) 
(9, 7) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 1) (18, 3) (18, 10) (18, 6) (13, 14) (13, 11) 
(13, 19) (13, 15) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9)

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes sorted by degree (smallest to largest):
1: 1, 3, 6, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19
2: 0, 5, 7, 8
3: 4, 9, 11, 14, 15
Edges processed in order:
(1, 17): Forms triangle with (1, 16) and (16, 17)
(3, 11): Forms triangle with (11, 8) and (8, 3)
(6, 18): Forms triangle with (18, 3) and (3, 6)
(10, 15): Forms triangle with (15, 5) and (5, 10)
(12, 14): Forms triangle with (14, 13) and (13, 12)
(16, 1): Forms triangle with (1, 9) and (9, 16)
