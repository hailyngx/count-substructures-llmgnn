Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 3), 
(9, 5), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 7), 
(4, 5), (4, 8), 
(7, 9), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 6), 
(6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 0), 
(8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 1), 
(0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 1), (0, 2), 
(3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 8), 
(2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 0), 
(1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 0)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
{4, 1, 6, 9, 2, 0, 7, 8, 3, 5}

Counting the triangles:

<0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 5>, <5, 8, 9>
