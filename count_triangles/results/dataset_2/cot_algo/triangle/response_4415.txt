Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
Let's first sort the vertices by their degree:

Node 5: 2 connections  
Node 9: 4 connections  
Node 6: 5 connections  
Node 4: 5 connections  
Node 7: 5 connections  
Node 8: 4 connections  
Node 2: 3 connections  
Node 3: 3 connections  
Node 0: 3 connections  
Node 1: 6 connections  

Now, we will list the edges based on the vertices with lower labels having fewer connections:

Edges:  
(5, 6)  
(5, 7)  
(9, 8)  
(9, 4)  
(9, 1)  
(9, 7)  
(6, 7)  
(6, 3)  
(4, 7)  
(4, 8)  
(4, 0)  
(7, 8)  
(2, 1)  
(2, 3)  
(3, 8)  
(0, 1)

Now, let's count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 9]

Unique triangles found:
<4, 7, 8>  
<1, 4, 7>  
<1, 4, 8>  
<1, 7, 8>  
<0, 1, 4>  
<0, 1, 8>  
<0, 1, 7>  
<1, 2, 3>  
<6, 7, 9>
