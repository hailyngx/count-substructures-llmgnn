Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 29) (15, 14) (0, 27) (0, 12) (27, 0) (27, 10) (27, 13) (4, 28) (4, 16) (4, 2) (7, 20) (7, 14) (7, 2) (17, 18) (17, 28) (17, 23) (17, 5) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 23) (18, 21) (18, 1) (8, 13) (8, 20) (8, 16) (13, 27) (13, 8) (13, 11) (1, 18) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 6) (26, 12) (9, 18) (9, 19) (22, 3) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 11) (19, 9) (19, 25) (19, 23) (16, 4) (16, 8) (20, 7) (20, 8) (20, 28) (23, 17) (23, 18) (23, 19) (28, 4) (28, 17) (28, 20) (28, 5) (24, 14) (24, 10) (6, 3) (6, 26) (6, 10) (10, 27) (10, 24) (10, 6) (10, 12) (12, 0) (12, 26) (12, 10) (12, 21) (5, 17) (5, 28) (5, 25) (5, 29) (25, 19) (25, 5) (25, 21) (29, 15) (29, 5) (21, 18) (21, 12) (21, 25) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 24) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly. 

The degree of each node is as follows:
0: 2
1: 2
2: 3
3: 4
4: 2
5: 4
6: 3
7: 3
8: 3
9: 3
10: 4
11: 3
12: 3
13: 3
14: 3
15: 3
16: 2
17: 4
18: 5
19: 3
20: 3
21: 3
22: 2
23: 4
24: 2
25: 3
26: 3
27: 3
28: 4
29: 3

Based on the degree-based relabeling, the nodes are now as follows:
0: 0
1: 1
2: 2
3: 3
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 7
8: 10
9: 12
10: 13
11: 14
12: 15
13: 16
14: 17
15: 18
16: 19
17: 20
18: 21
19: 22
20: 23
21: 24
22: 25
23: 26
24: 27
25: 28
26: 29
27: 8
28: 9

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed by shared connections:
- Triangle found: <2, 4, 28>
- Triangle found: <2, 7, 20>
- Triangle found: <4, 16, 8>
- Triangle found: <5, 29, 15>
- Triangle found: <17, 18, 23>
- Triangle found: <18, 9, 19>
- Triangle found: <18, 21, 25>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
