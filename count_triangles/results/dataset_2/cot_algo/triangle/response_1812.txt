Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 5) (15, 7) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 26) (4, 20) (7, 15) (7, 28) (7, 9) (7, 2) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 29) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 25) (1, 3) (1, 16) (10, 0) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 0) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 21) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 22) (5, 11) (6, 21) (6, 24) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 24) (21, 16) (21, 29) (24, 6) (24, 21) (24, 16) (24, 13) (26, 27) (26, 28) (26, 29) (28, 7) (28, 26) (28, 14) (20, 4) (20, 9) (29, 22) (29, 21) (29, 26) (18, 14) (18, 11) (19, 2) (19, 16) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 19) (2, 7) (2, 23) (2, 19) (2, 25) (14, 22) (14, 8) (14, 28) (14, 18) (12, 0) (12, 13) (13, 24) (13, 12) (25, 23) (25, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 20) (11, 5) (11, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections). 

Let's sort the nodes based on their degree and assign labels accordingly:

Node 3 - Degree 2
Node 15 - Degree 2
Node 0 - Degree 5
Node 27 - Degree 4
Node 4 - Degree 1
Node 7 - Degree 4
Node 22 - Degree 4
Node 23 - Degree 4
Node 1 - Degree 2
Node 10 - Degree 3
Node 17 - Degree 5
Node 8 - Degree 3
Node 5 - Degree 3
Node 6 - Degree 2
Node 21 - Degree 5
Node 24 - Degree 4
Node 26 - Degree 3
Node 28 - Degree 3
Node 20 - Degree 2
Node 29 - Degree 4
Node 18 - Degree 2
Node 19 - Degree 2
Node 16 - Degree 5
Node 2 - Degree 4
Node 14 - Degree 4
Node 12 - Degree 2
Node 13 - Degree 2
Node 25 - Degree 2
Node 9 - Degree 4
Node 11 - Degree 2

Now, let's count the triangles:

Triangles: [<9, 0, 17>, <0, 9, 7>, <0, 9, 20>, <0, 12, 13>, <0, 17, 21>, <1, 16, 17>, <2, 7, 23>, <2, 19, 16>, <2, 23, 25>, <5, 22, 23>, <5, 22, 29>, <7, 9, 17>, <7, 9, 28>, <7, 22, 23>, <7, 28, 14>, <16, 21, 24>, <16, 24, 13>, <17, 21, 29>]

Total number of triangles: [18]
