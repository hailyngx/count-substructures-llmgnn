Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 5) (2, 7) (2, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 12) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 12) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will now count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following labeling:
Node 2 - Degree 2
Node 14 - Degree 2
Node 0 - Degree 3
Node 5 - Degree 3
Node 10 - Degree 4
Node 12 - Degree 4
Node 1 - Degree 5
Node 3 - Degree 5
Node 7 - Degree 5
Node 11 - Degree 5
Node 13 - Degree 5
Node 4 - Degree 5
Node 6 - Degree 6
Node 8 - Degree 6
Node 9 - Degree 6

Now, we will check each edge while ensuring the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles found:
<0, 1, 12>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 10, 5>
<0, 10, 6>
<0, 10, 9>
<0, 11, 3>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 12>
<2, 7, 13>
<3, 10, 6>
<3, 10, 9>
<3, 11, 0>
<3, 11, 8>
<3, 11, 9>
<3, 12, 5>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 12>

Total number of triangles: [22]
