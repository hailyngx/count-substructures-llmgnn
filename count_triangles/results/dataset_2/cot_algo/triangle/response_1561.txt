Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 16) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 18) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 18) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 19) (15, 0) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 17) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 2) (4, 6) (4, 17) (12, 2) (2, 16) (2, 12) (2, 9) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 14) (14, 13) (14, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 4) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 10) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 11) (10, 5) (10, 19) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 13) (17, 5) (17, 15) (17, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us efficiently count triangles in this graph. Let's start by sorting the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order:

Vertices: (0, 9, 12, 4, 10, 19, 14, 8, 11, 3, 2, 5, 16, 7, 1, 18, 17, 13, 6, 15)

Now, let's count the triangles based on the given edges:

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <1, 16, 18>, <5, 13, 18>, <7, 11, 9>
