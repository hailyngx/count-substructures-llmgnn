Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 29) (15, 24) (27, 24) (27, 2) (27, 17) (27, 1) (6, 28) (6, 3) (6, 16) (9, 25) (9, 28) (9, 20) (5, 19) (5, 17) (17, 27) (17, 5) (17, 29) (17, 21) (29, 15) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 11) (7, 20) (7, 2) (12, 16) (12, 11) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 22) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 24) (13, 15) (13, 24) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 8) (19, 5) (19, 29) (19, 18) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 21) (10, 21) (10, 8) (10, 23) (21, 17) (21, 18) (21, 10) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 23) (16, 20) (3, 6) (3, 28) (25, 9) (25, 1) (25, 22) (25, 2) (22, 14) (22, 25) (22, 1) (20, 9) (20, 7) (20, 16) (23, 10) (23, 16) (1, 27) (1, 25) (1, 22) (1, 4) (24, 15) (24, 27) (24, 28) (24, 13) (8, 15) (8, 26) (8, 10) (11, 29) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 1) (2, 27) (2, 7) (2, 25) (2, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling them starting from 0. 

Here is the relabeled list of vertices:
0: 15
1: 27
2: 6
3: 9
4: 5
5: 17
6: 29
7: 7
8: 12
9: 0
10: 14
11: 28
12: 13
13: 26
14: 19
15: 18
16: 10
17: 16
18: 3
19: 21
20: 8
21: 11
22: 22
23: 20
24: 23
25: 25
26: 2
27: 24
28: 1
29: 4

Next, we will count the triangles by checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge:
1. Shared connections between vertices 0 (15) and 8 (26): (15, 24), (24, 27), (15, 27) => <15, 24, 27>
2. Shared connections between vertices 0 (15) and 13 (26): (15, 29), (29, 17), (15, 17) => <15, 29, 17>
3. Shared connections between vertices 13 (26) and 8 (26): (15, 24), (24, 27), (15, 27) => <15, 24, 27>
4. Shared connections between vertices 13 (26) and 24 (27): (13, 24), (13, 15), (15, 24) => <13, 24, 15>
5. Shared connections between vertices 24 (27) and 27 (24): (15, 24), (15, 27), (24, 15) => <15, 24, 27>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
