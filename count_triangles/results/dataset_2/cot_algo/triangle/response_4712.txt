To count the number of triangles in this graph, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections):
   - Vertex 26 has 2 connections.
   - Vertices 7, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 27, 29 have 3 connections.
   - Vertices 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 28 have 4 connections.
   - Vertices 0, 1, 6, 8, 11, 22, 25 have 5 connections.
   
2. Relabel the vertices from 0 to 29 considering their sorted order.

Proceed with counting triangles based on the edges and shared connections:

[Total number of triangles: 18]
Unique triangles found:
<0, 5, 11>
<0, 8, 11>
<0, 11, 22>
<0, 12, 25>
<1, 9, 12>
<2, 5, 17>
<4, 8, 23>
