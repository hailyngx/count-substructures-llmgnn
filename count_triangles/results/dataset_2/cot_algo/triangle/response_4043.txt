Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted list of vertices will be:  

0, 3, 5, 3, 4, 6, 6, 6, 7, 9  

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections. We will only count each triangle once.  

From the given edges, the triangles formed are:  

<0, 8, 3>  
<1, 4, 9>  
<1, 2, 9>  
<1, 7, 9>  
<2, 4, 9>  
<2, 8, 9>  
<5, 6, 8>  
<6, 7, 8>  
<6, 9, 7>  

There are a total of 9 triangles in the provided graph.  
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
