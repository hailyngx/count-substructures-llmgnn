Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (16, 17) (16, 2) (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 13) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 10) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 10) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 16) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 17) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (19, 5) (19, 1) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 17) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 13) (12, 18) (14, 9) (14, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) from least to most. 

The vertices with their degrees are as follows:
- Vertex 16 has degree 2
- Vertex 5 has degree 2
- Vertex 12 has degree 2
- Vertex 0 has degree 2
- Vertex 4 has degree 3
- Vertex 12 has degree 2
- Vertex 19 has degree 2
- Vertex 17 has degree 3
- Vertex 18 has degree 4
- Vertex 13 has degree 4
- Vertex 10 has degree 4
- Vertex 11 has degree 4
- Vertex 3 has degree 4
- Vertex 15 has degree 3
- Vertex 1 has degree 5
- Vertex 9 has degree 4
- Vertex 14 has degree 3
- Vertex 7 has degree 5
- Vertex 6 has degree 6
- Vertex 8 has degree 4

We will now relabel the vertices based on their degree, and then count the triangles. 

After relabeling, the graph becomes:
- Vertex 16 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 0
- Vertex 5 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 1
- Vertex 12 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 2
- Vertex 0 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 3
- Vertex 4 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 4
- Vertex 12 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 5
- Vertex 19 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 6
- Vertex 17 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 7
- Vertex 18 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 8
- Vertex 13 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 9
- Vertex 10 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 10
- Vertex 11 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 11
- Vertex 3 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 12
- Vertex 15 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 13
- Vertex 1 (degree 5) becomes Vertex 14
- Vertex 9 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 15
- Vertex 14 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 16
- Vertex 7 (degree 5) becomes Vertex 17
- Vertex 6 (degree 6) becomes Vertex 18
- Vertex 8 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 19

The edges now are:
(3, 14) (6, 8) (10, 13) (13, 9) (18, 12) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 4) (19, 1) (7, 11) (17, 16) (9, 6) (8, 1) (4, 10)

Counting the number of triangles, we find: [6]

The unique triangles found are: <9, 10, 13>, <1, 5, 19>, <1, 8, 6>, <13, 9, 10>, <1, 19, 5>, <6, 0, 3>.
