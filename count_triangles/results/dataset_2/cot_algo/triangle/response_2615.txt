Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps find triangles efficiently. Let's start by sorting the vertices based on their degrees, where the node with the lowest degree gets the smallest label:

Nodes degrees:
0: 4
1: 4
2: 4
3: 4
4: 3
5: 3
6: 4
7: 5
8: 4
9: 4
10: 2
11: 3
12: 4
13: 3
14: 5

Sorted labels:
10: Node 11
11: Node 5
12: Node 13
13: Node 10
14: Node 4
15: Node 0
16: Node 3
17: Node 1
18: Node 2
19: Node 6
20: Node 9
21: Node 8
22: Node 12
23: Node 7
24: Node 14

Now, let's go through the edges and count the triangles:

Triangles:
[18, 19, 20] <2, 6, 9>
[17, 16, 18] <1, 3, 2>
[16, 18, 19] <3, 2, 6>
[16, 17, 18] <3, 1, 2>
[0, 11, 12] <11, 5, 13>
[1, 3, 8] <5, 2, 9>
[1, 3, 16] <5, 2, 6>
[1, 3, 2] <5, 2, 3>
[1, 7, 12] <5, 7, 13>
[2, 4, 16] <6, 4, 3>
[3, 8, 9] <2, 9, 6>
[4, 8, 19] <6, 9, 2>
[5, 10, 11] <11, 0, 5>
[5, 10, 16] <11, 0, 6>
[5, 14, 19] <11, 9, 2>
[6, 14, 20] <13, 9, 6>
[7, 12, 24] <13, 7, 14>

Total number of triangles: [16]
