Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 3) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 3) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 11), (0, 12), (0, 14),
(1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 10), (1, 12),
(2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 11),
(3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 13), (3, 14),
(4, 13),
(5, 10), (5, 12), (5, 14),
(6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 12),
(7, 9),
(8, 10), (8, 11),
(9, 14),
(10, 11)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on the number of connections they have:

Sorted Nodes:
1 - Node 2 (Degree 3)
2 - Node 4 (Degree 1)
3 - Node 7 (Degree 1)
4 - Node 13 (Degree 2)
5 - Node 0 (Degree 5)
6 - Node 9 (Degree 3)
7 - Node 8 (Degree 4)
8 - Node 5 (Degree 3)
9 - Node 3 (Degree 5)
10 - Node 6 (Degree 5)
11 - Node 12 (Degree 4)
12 - Node 1 (Degree 4)
13 - Node 10 (Degree 5)
14 - Node 11 (Degree 5)
15 - Node 14 (Degree 5)

Now, we will count the triangles formed using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: 8
[6, 7, 9], [6, 8, 10], [6, 10, 11], [2, 5, 12], [2, 6, 12], [2, 6, 3], [0, 1, 12], [0, 4, 13] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
