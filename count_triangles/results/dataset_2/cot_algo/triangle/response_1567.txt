Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles in the given graph efficiently. 

Let's first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:
- Node 5: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 5
- Node 4: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 3
- Node 1: Degree 3
- Node 3: Degree 5
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 2: Degree 3
- Node 8: Degree 3
- Node 0: Degree 3

Given the edges, we will start by considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. We will then count the number of triangles formed by shared connections:

- Triangle <5, 9, 3> (formed by shared connection with vertex 6)
- Triangle <5, 9, 7> (formed by shared connection with vertex 4)
- Triangle <5, 9, 7> (formed by shared connection with vertex 1)
- Triangle <5, 9, 1> (formed by shared connection with vertex 3)

We have found 4 triangles in total.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
