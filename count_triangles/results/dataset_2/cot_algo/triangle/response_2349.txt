Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 14) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 8) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 6) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 2) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are:
(3 connections) -> 0, 7, 9
(4 connections) -> 1, 8, 12
(5 connections) -> 13, 6, 2
(6 connections) -> 5, 14
(7 connections) -> 10, 11
(9 connections) -> 4

Calculating the triangles based on the degree-based ordering method:
1. Edge (5, 4):
   - Shared connections with 5: 10, 2
   - Triangle formed: <2, 5, 4>

2. Edge (7, 5):
   - Shared connections with 7: 14
   - Triangle formed: <14, 7, 5>

3. Edge (10, 11):
   - Shared connections with 10: 5
   - Shared connections with 11: 8, 14
   - Triangles formed: <5, 10, 11>, <11, 8, 10>, <11, 14, 10>

4. Edge (12, 10):
   - Shared connections with 12: 3
   - Shared connections with 10: 5
   - Triangle formed: <3, 12, 10>

5. Edge (13, 12):
   - Shared connections with 13: 2, 6
   - Shared connections with 12: 10, 3
   - Triangle formed: <2, 12, 13>, <6, 12, 13>

6. Edge (13, 2):
   - Shared connections with 13: 6
   - Triangle formed: <6, 13, 2>

7. Edge (7, 14):
   - Shared connections with 7: 5
   - Shared connections with 14: 11, 6
   - Triangle formed: <11, 14, 7>, <6, 14, 7>

So, the total number of triangles is [8].
