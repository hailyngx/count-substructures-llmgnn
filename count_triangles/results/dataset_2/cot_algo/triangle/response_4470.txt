Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (4, 6) (4, 12) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 14) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and edges:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 14), (6, 10), (6, 4), (6, 8), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 13), (9, 0), (10, 13), (10, 5), (10, 14), (11, 0), (11, 2), (8, 5), (8, 14), (8, 3), (13, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 1), (7, 12), (7, 1), (12, 4), (0, 14), (14, 1), (4, 12), (2, 11), (2, 7)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees from least to most:
Nodes with degrees: [(12, 2), (11, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (4, 3), (7, 3), (10, 3), (13, 4), (8, 4), (3, 4), (9, 5), (5, 5), (6, 6), (2, 6), (14, 6)]

Now, we will list the edges in the format (lower labeled node, higher labeled node):
Edges to consider: (12, 4), (11, 0), (0, 14), (1, 13), (4, 12), (7, 1), (10, 13), (13, 1), (13, 2), (8, 5), (8, 14), (3, 9), (3, 5), (9, 2), (9, 13), (6, 9), (5, 6), (5, 10), (5, 8), (14, 0)

Calculating the triangles formed by shared connections between nodes:
Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles found: <1, 7, 13>, <3, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 10>, <5, 8, 14>, <6, 9, 13>, <8, 10, 14>, <3, 4, 12>, <0, 1, 14>, <2, 9, 13>
