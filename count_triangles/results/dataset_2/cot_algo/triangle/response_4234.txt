Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 12) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
