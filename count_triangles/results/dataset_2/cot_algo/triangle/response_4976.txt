Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 4) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 17) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (17, 15) (17, 19) (17, 18) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 16) (7, 11) (7, 13) (16, 9) (16, 5) (12, 2) (12, 14) (18, 8) (18, 17) (18, 1) (19, 17) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 16) (0, 3) (14, 12) (14, 6) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 4) (1, 8) (1, 18) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 6) 

Response:
Let's construct a graph with 20 nodes and the given edges:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (2, 8), (2, 12), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 4), (8, 9), (8, 11), (8, 1), (8, 18), (3, 11), (3, 0), (3, 9), (11, 7), (11, 13), (11, 5), (10, 15), (10, 6), (10, 4), (15, 17), (13, 7), (13, 4), (17, 19), (17, 18), (9, 16), (16, 5), (12, 14), (14, 6), (1, 18), (6, 4)

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections):
Nodes by degree: 
0 (1), 1 (2), 7 (2), 12 (2), 14 (2), 16 (2), 17 (2), 19 (2), 3 (3), 6 (3), 10 (3), 13 (3), 15 (3), 18 (3), 4 (4), 5 (4), 9 (4), 11 (5), 8 (6), 2 (7)

Next, we'll list the triangles based on the given method:
Triangles: 
<2, 8, 9>, <2, 5, 16>, <2, 5, 11>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 13>, <2, 12, 14>, <8, 1, 18>, <8, 9, 16>, <3, 0, 9>, <3, 9, 16>, <6, 4, 13>

Total number of triangles: [11]
