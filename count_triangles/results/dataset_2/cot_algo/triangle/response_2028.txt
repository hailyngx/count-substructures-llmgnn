Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order. Here is the list of vertices with their corresponding degrees:

Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 6
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 5
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4

Now, we will go through each edge, considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. By checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge, we will count the triangles.

After going through all the edges, we find the following triangles:

<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
