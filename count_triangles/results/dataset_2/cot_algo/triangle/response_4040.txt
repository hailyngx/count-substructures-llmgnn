Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are:  
Node 5: 3 connections  
Node 1: 4 connections  
Node 8: 4 connections  
Node 3: 4 connections  
Node 2: 5 connections  
Node 7: 5 connections  
Node 0: 5 connections  
Node 4: 6 connections  
Node 6: 6 connections  
Node 9: 6 connections  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
