Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 4) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 2) (0, 17) (0, 5) (7, 19) (7, 17) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 15) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 17) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 15) (12, 6) (12, 4) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 13) (16, 3) (16, 14) (16, 15) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 15) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 17) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 3) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 19) (17, 2) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 1) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 16) (15, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles efficiently. 

Let's start by sorting the vertices based on their degree:
0: 2 connections
16: 3 connections
14: 3 connections
18: 3 connections
13: 3 connections
3: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
11: 4 connections
1: 4 connections
7: 4 connections
9: 4 connections
12: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
8: 5 connections
4: 5 connections
10: 5 connections
15: 5 connections
5: 6 connections
17: 6 connections
19: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
(6, 1): No triangles
(6, 12): No triangles
(6, 8): No triangles
(9, 4): No triangles
(10, 11): No triangles
(10, 5): No triangles
(11, 10): No triangles
(11, 2): No triangles
(0, 17): No triangles
(0, 5): No triangles
(7, 19): No triangles
(7, 17): No triangles
(8, 6): No triangles
(8, 19): No triangles
(8, 15): No triangles
(19, 7): No triangles
(19, 18): No triangles
(19, 17): No triangles
(4, 9): No triangles
(4, 12): No triangles
(4, 13): No triangles
(4, 15): No triangles
(12, 6): No triangles
(12, 4): No triangles
(18, 19): No triangles
(18, 13): No triangles
(16, 3): No triangles
(16, 14): No triangles
(16, 15): No triangles
(1, 6): No triangles
(1, 2): No triangles
(1, 13): No triangles
(3, 16): No triangles
(3, 14): No triangles
(14, 16): No triangles
(14, 3): No triangles
(2, 11): No triangles
(2, 1): No triangles
(2, 17): No triangles
(5, 10): No triangles
(5, 0): No triangles
(5, 18): No triangles
(5, 3): No triangles
(17, 0): No triangles
(17, 7): No triangles
(17, 19): No triangles
(13, 4): No triangles
(13, 18): No triangles
(13, 1): No triangles
(15, 8): No triangles
(15, 4): No triangles
(15, 16): No triangles
(15, 14): No triangles

As we can see, there are no triangles formed by the given edges in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [0] and no unique triangles were found.
