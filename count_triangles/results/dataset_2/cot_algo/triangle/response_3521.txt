Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 7) 

Response:
The given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 11), (5, 4), (5, 0), 
(9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 10), (9, 1), 
(6, 10), (6, 3), (6, 8), 
(1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 0), 
(3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 12), 
(4, 5), (4, 1), (4, 8), (4, 13), (4, 0), (4, 10), 
(8, 9), (8, 6), (8, 4), (8, 2), 
(2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 12), (2, 14), 
(13, 4), (13, 11), (13, 10), (13, 0), 
(0, 5), (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 13), 
(7, 11), (7, 10), (7, 14), 
(12, 3), (12, 2), (12, 14), (12, 11), 
(11, 5), (11, 13), (11, 7), (11, 12), 
(14, 2), (14, 7), (14, 12), 
(10, 9), (10, 6), (10, 4), (10, 13), (10, 7)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Relabel the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices in increasing order of degree: {7, 6, 14, 5, 12, 2, 13, 3, 0, 10, 8, 11, 1, 9, 4}

Triangles found: 
<0, 1, 4>, 
<0, 4, 5>, 
<1, 4, 5>, 
<1, 4, 9>, 
<1, 4, 0>, 
<1, 4, 8>, 
<2, 8, 12>, 
<4, 8, 1>, 
<4, 8, 9>, 
<10, 13, 4>, 
<11, 13, 5>

Total number of triangles: [11]
