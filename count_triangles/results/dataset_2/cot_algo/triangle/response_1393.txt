Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 15) (0, 24) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 14) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 14) (7, 17) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 23) (18, 22) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 20) (18, 17) (22, 18) (22, 5) (22, 29) (23, 8) (23, 13) (23, 17) (23, 9) (21, 16) (21, 29) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 20) (15, 14) (20, 18) (20, 15) (20, 3) (20, 19) (5, 13) (5, 22) (5, 3) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 29) (28, 6) (28, 16) (26, 13) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 1) (16, 4) (16, 21) (16, 28) (16, 14) (29, 22) (29, 21) (29, 6) (24, 0) (19, 0) (19, 20) (25, 7) (25, 2) (1, 6) (1, 11) (12, 4) (12, 9) (9, 23) (9, 12) (9, 17) (2, 25) (2, 17) (14, 27) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 16) (3, 4) (3, 20) (3, 5) (17, 7) (17, 18) (17, 23) (17, 9) (17, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps count the number of triangles efficiently.

After sorting the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order, the new labeling of the nodes will be:
Node 0 -> degree 4
Node 27 -> degree 4
Node 4 -> degree 4
Node 7 -> degree 4
Node 8 -> degree 3
Node 13 -> degree 3
Node 18 -> degree 5
Node 22 -> degree 4
Node 23 -> degree 4
Node 21 -> degree 3
Node 15 -> degree 4
Node 20 -> degree 4
Node 5 -> degree 3
Node 6 -> degree 3
Node 28 -> degree 2
Node 26 -> degree 1
Node 11 -> degree 4
Node 16 -> degree 4
Node 29 -> degree 3
Node 24 -> degree 1
Node 19 -> degree 2
Node 25 -> degree 2
Node 1 -> degree 2
Node 12 -> degree 2
Node 9 -> degree 3
Node 2 -> degree 2
Node 3 -> degree 2
Node 17 -> degree 5

Please find the triangles below:
