Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 9) (3, 19) (22, 11) (22, 5) (22, 29) (23, 6) (23, 20) (23, 9) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 2) (0, 7) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 29) (14, 16) (26, 28) (26, 20) (26, 11) (28, 1) (28, 26) (28, 7) (28, 27) (28, 12) (17, 8) (17, 20) (17, 24) (17, 2) (20, 23) (20, 26) (20, 17) (20, 9) (20, 6) (7, 0) (7, 28) (7, 10) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 24) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 5) (25, 21) (27, 28) (27, 21) (27, 18) (6, 1) (6, 23) (6, 8) (6, 20) (5, 22) (5, 16) (5, 11) (5, 21) (10, 7) (21, 13) (21, 25) (21, 27) (21, 5) (21, 29) (24, 17) (24, 15) (24, 4) (18, 27) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 19) (19, 3) (19, 14) (19, 2) (4, 16) (4, 24) (9, 1) (9, 23) (9, 20) (9, 15) (12, 14) (12, 28) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 5) (29, 22) (29, 14) (29, 21) 

Response:
The graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. 

Let's calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

The vertices sorted by degree are:
(3) - 1 connection
(0, 10, 12, 18, 25) - 1 connection each
(4, 15, 24) - 2 connections each
(2, 27) - 3 connections each
(13, 16) - 4 connections each
(5, 7, 11, 19, 26) - 4 connections each
(6, 8, 9, 20, 21) - 5 connections each
(1, 29) - 6 connections each
(14) - 7 connections
(17, 22) - 8 connections each
(28) - 9 connections
(23) - 10 connections

Now, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [216]
