Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can list the nodes and their connections:

Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 9
Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 7
Node 2: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 8
Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 8, 9
Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 8
Node 7: Connected to nodes 1
Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6
Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes in degree-based order: 7, 0, 1, 2, 8, 4, 6, 3, 5, 9

Based on the sorted list, we will go through the edges and count the triangles. Starting with the lowest degree nodes, we'll check each edge:

Triangles:
[15]

Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
