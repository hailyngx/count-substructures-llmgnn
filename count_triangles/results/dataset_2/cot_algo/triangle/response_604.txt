Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 4
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 7
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, 3, 1
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 2, 8, 3
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 1, 4, 0
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 8, 2
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 7, 0
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, 3, 1

Next, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:

Nodes sorted by degrees: 0, 2, 7, 1, 8, 3, 4, 6, 9, 5

Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Node 0 (degree 2) is connected to nodes 6 and 8
- Node 2 (degree 2) is connected to nodes 5 and 7
- Node 7 (degree 3) is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 8
- Node 1 (degree 3) is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 4
- Node 8 (degree 4) is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, and 7
- Node 3 (degree 4) is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, and 7
- Node 4 (degree 5) is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, 3, and 1
- Node 6 (degree 5) is connected to nodes 5, 9, 1, 4, and 0
- Node 9 (degree 5) is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, 3, and 1
- Node 5 (degree 5) is connected to nodes 9, 6, 2, 8, and 3

Using this information, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<4, 6, 1>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 1, 9>
