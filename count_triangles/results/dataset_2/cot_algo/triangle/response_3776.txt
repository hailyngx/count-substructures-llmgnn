Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 10) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 2) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 2) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 11) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 12) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:  

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14  
Edges:  
- 0: (14), (10), (3), (1)  
- 1: (4), (13), (5), (0), (12)  
- 2: (7), (5), (14), (11)  
- 3: (8), (0), (12), (11)  
- 4: (1), (6)  
- 5: (6), (2), (12), (1), (10)  
- 6: (4), (5), (13)  
- 7: (12), (10), (2), (8)  
- 8: (7), (13), (10), (12), (3)  
- 9: (11), (13), (14)  
- 10: (7), (8), (5), (0)  
- 11: (9), (12), (3), (2)  
- 12: (7), (8), (5), (11), (3), (1)  
- 13: (6), (9), (8), (1)  
- 14: (9), (2), (0)  

Now, let's proceed with counting triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.  

Vertices sorted by their degree:  
Vertex 0: 4  
Vertex 1: 5  
Vertex 2: 4  
Vertex 3: 4  
Vertex 4: 2  
Vertex 5: 5  
Vertex 6: 3  
Vertex 7: 4  
Vertex 8: 5  
Vertex 9: 3  
Vertex 10: 4  
Vertex 11: 4  
Vertex 12: 6  
Vertex 13: 4  
Vertex 14: 3  

Triangles found:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 12>
- <0, 3, 12>
- <0, 10, 5>
- <1, 4, 6>
