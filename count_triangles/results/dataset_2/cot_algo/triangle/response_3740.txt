Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (15, 10) (15, 14) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 14) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 1) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 0) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 1) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 7) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 1) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 11) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 17) (1, 12) (1, 19) (1, 13) (1, 7) (14, 15) (14, 16) (14, 4) 

Response:
Nodes in the graph after sorting by the number of connections are:  
\[ 5, 6, 8, 16, 18, 15, 13, 17, 7, 2, 3, 9, 10, 12, 0, 1, 4, 11, 19, 14 \]

The total number of triangles is: [10]

Unique triangles found are:  
<3, 8, 9>  
<3, 7, 17>  
<7, 1, 13>  
<9, 2, 10>  
<12, 1, 19>  
<12, 4, 11>  
<12, 4, 14>  
<14, 4, 16>  
<15, 10, 6>  
<16, 14, 15>
