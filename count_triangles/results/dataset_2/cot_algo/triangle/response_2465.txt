Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 14) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (14, 10) (14, 5) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections). The vertices are relabeled as follows:
- Vertex 0 has degree 4
- Vertex 1 has degree 3
- Vertex 2 has degree 4
- Vertex 3 has degree 2
- Vertex 4 has degree 5
- Vertex 5 has degree 4
- Vertex 6 has degree 4
- Vertex 7 has degree 4
- Vertex 8 has degree 4
- Vertex 9 has degree 2
- Vertex 10 has degree 4
- Vertex 11 has degree 6
- Vertex 12 has degree 3
- Vertex 13 has degree 5
- Vertex 14 has degree 2

Based on the sorted labels, we can now count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 15]

Unique triangles:
- <10, 11, 13>
- <0, 4, 10>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 4, 13>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <11, 12, 13>
- <2, 5, 13>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <5, 7, 11>
- <1, 2, 12>
- <4, 10, 14>
- <4, 5, 13>
- <2, 11, 13>
- <2, 8, 13>
- <7, 11, 12>
