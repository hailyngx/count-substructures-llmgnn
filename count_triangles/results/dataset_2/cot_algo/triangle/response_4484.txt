Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps us to efficiently count triangles in the graph by sorting vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Let's follow the steps:

1. The degrees of each node are as follows:
   - Node 0: degree = 4
   - Node 1: degree = 3
   - Node 2: degree = 6
   - Node 3: degree = 7
   - Node 4: degree = 5
   - Node 5: degree = 3
   - Node 6: degree = 4
   - Node 7: degree = 3
   - Node 8: degree = 4
   - Node 9: degree = 6

2. Sorting the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
   - Node 1, Node 5, Node 7: degree = 3
   - Node 0, Node 6, Node 8: degree = 4
   - Node 4: degree = 5
   - Node 2, Node 9: degree = 6
   - Node 3: degree = 7

3. Relabeling the nodes in the sorted order:
   - Node 1 becomes Node 0
   - Node 5 becomes Node 1
   - Node 7 becomes Node 2
   - Node 0 becomes Node 3
   - Node 6 becomes Node 4
   - Node 8 becomes Node 5
   - Node 4 becomes Node 6
   - Node 2 becomes Node 7
   - Node 9 becomes Node 8
   - Node 3 becomes Node 9

4. Counting the triangles:
   Let's examine the edges by comparing the labels of the nodes forming the edge:

   - (0, 3) forms a triangle with shared connections (1, 2): <0, 1, 2>
   - (0, 8) forms a triangle with shared connections (4, 5): <0, 4, 5>
   - (0, 6) forms a triangle with shared connections (4, 5): <0, 4, 5>
   - (3, 9) forms a triangle with shared connections (1, 8): <3, 1, 8>
   - (3, 2) forms a triangle with shared connections (1, 7): <3, 1, 7>
   - (4, 8) forms a triangle with shared connections (0, 5): <4, 0, 5>
   - (4, 6) forms a triangle with shared connections (0, 5): <4, 0, 5>
   - (8, 6) forms a triangle with shared connections (0, 5): <8, 0, 5>

   Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
