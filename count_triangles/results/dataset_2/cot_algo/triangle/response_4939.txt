Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, we obtain the following labeling:

Node 5 (Degree 2)
Node 15 (Degree 2)
Node 14 (Degree 3)
Node 3 (Degree 4)
Node 9 (Degree 4)
Node 0 (Degree 5)
Node 8 (Degree 5)
Node 13 (Degree 5)
Node 2 (Degree 6)
Node 10 (Degree 6)
Node 12 (Degree 6)
Node 1 (Degree 7)
Node 6 (Degree 7)
Node 7 (Degree 7)
Node 4 (Degree 8)
Node 11 (Degree 8)

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles.

Number of triangles: [14]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 11>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 9, 10>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 9, 13>
<4, 8, 13>
<6, 7, 12>
<7, 10, 12>
<9, 10, 11>
<9, 11, 14>
