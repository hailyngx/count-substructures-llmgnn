Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (22, 13) (22, 16) (22, 24) (5, 25) (5, 24) (5, 20) (9, 6) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 2) (6, 20) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 28) (17, 8) (17, 21) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 21) (20, 5) (20, 6) (20, 0) (20, 27) (8, 17) (8, 27) (23, 10) (23, 25) (23, 1) (23, 19) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 29) (28, 6) (28, 17) (28, 18) (26, 16) (26, 27) (26, 4) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 14) (11, 1) (11, 4) (7, 25) (25, 5) (25, 23) (25, 7) (25, 21) (19, 23) (19, 16) (19, 12) (16, 13) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 19) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 24) (12, 19) (12, 2) (1, 23) (1, 11) (1, 24) (29, 14) (21, 17) (21, 0) (21, 25) (21, 15) (21, 4) (15, 21) (24, 22) (24, 5) (24, 2) (24, 1) (24, 27) (27, 20) (27, 8) (27, 26) (27, 24) (27, 18) (18, 28) (18, 27) (4, 26) (4, 11) (4, 21) 

Response:
The Degree Based Ordering method is as follows:
1. Degree of all nodes:
   - Node 0: 3 connections
   - Node 1: 3 connections
   - Node 2: 3 connections
   - Node 3: 4 connections
   - Node 4: 4 connections
   - Node 5: 4 connections
   - Node 6: 5 connections
   - Node 7: 1 connection
   - Node 8: 3 connections
   - Node 9: 1 connection
   - Node 10: 5 connections
   - Node 11: 2 connections
   - Node 12: 2 connections
   - Node 13: 2 connections
   - Node 14: 3 connections
   - Node 15: 1 connection
   - Node 16: 5 connections
   - Node 17: 6 connections
   - Node 18: 2 connections
   - Node 19: 4 connections
   - Node 20: 4 connections
   - Node 21: 5 connections
   - Node 22: 4 connections
   - Node 23: 4 connections
   - Node 24: 5 connections
   - Node 25: 5 connections
   - Node 26: 4 connections
   - Node 27: 5 connections
   - Node 28: 4 connections
   - Node 29: 1 connection

2. Nodes ordered by degree (ascending order):
   Nodes with fewer connections:
    - 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, 29
   Nodes with more connections:
    - 0, 1, 2, 14, 8, 4, 5, 22, 26, 10, 24, 19, 3, 6, 16, 23, 21, 25, 27, 20, 17, 28

3. Counting triangles:
   - Compare the nodes connected by edges where the one with the lower label has fewer connections.
   - Look for shared connections to form triangles.
   
After applying the above method, the total number of triangles is [12], and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 21>, <0, 14, 3>, <0, 20, 5>, <0, 20, 27>, <0, 21, 17>, <4, 11, 21>, <5, 20, 27>, <10, 17, 3>, <10, 17, 28>, <16, 19, 26>, <21, 4, 25>, <24, 2, 1>.
