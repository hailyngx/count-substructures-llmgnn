Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) 

Response:
Let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 0 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 5

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Node 7 (degree 3) -> Node 0
Node 6 (degree 3) -> Node 1
Node 8 (degree 4) -> Node 2
Node 2 (degree 4) -> Node 3
Node 4 (degree 4) -> Node 4
Node 3 (degree 4) -> Node 5
Node 0 (degree 4) -> Node 6
Node 1 (degree 4) -> Node 7
Node 5 (degree 5) -> Node 8
Node 9 (degree 5) -> Node 9

Now, we will only consider the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
(5, 2), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 6), (6, 7), (1, 3), (4, 7), (4, 0), (7, 3), (0, 4)

Now, let's count the triangles formed by shared connections:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 1, 2>
<1, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 7>

Total number of triangles: [7]
