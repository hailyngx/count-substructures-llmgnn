Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) 
(9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) 
(6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) 
(4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) 
(8, 4) (8, 2) 
(2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) 
(0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 
(7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) 
(1, 4) (1, 2) 
(3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7)

Next, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

0: 4 connections
1: 2 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 2 connections
6: 3 connections
3: 5 connections
2: 5 connections
9: 5 connections
5: 6 connections
4: 6 connections

Now, let's count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 13]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 3>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 7, 5>
<2, 7, 3>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 3>
