This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 2) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 26) (2, 11) (2, 24) (2, 17) (29, 27) (29, 8) (29, 25) (3, 16) (3, 28) (3, 26) (25, 11) (25, 29) (8, 29) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 24) (13, 9) (13, 7) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 4) (23, 0) (4, 8) (4, 23) (4, 0) (4, 5) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 12) (20, 12) (20, 28) (0, 23) (0, 4) (0, 15) (14, 8) (14, 21) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 26) (9, 13) (9, 22) (9, 17) (21, 14) (21, 6) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 17) (10, 15) (10, 5) (28, 3) (28, 20) (28, 19) (18, 16) (18, 6) (1, 19) (17, 2) (17, 9) (17, 7) (19, 28) (19, 1) (27, 29) (27, 26) (12, 22) (12, 15) (12, 20) (12, 26) (24, 2) (24, 13) (26, 16) (26, 3) (26, 6) (26, 27) (26, 12) 

Response:
The graph with nodes and edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: 
{0, 4}, {0, 5}, {0, 15}, {0, 23}, {1, 19}, {2, 11}, {2, 17}, {2, 24}, {3, 16}, {3, 26}, {3, 28}, {4, 8}, {4, 23}, {4, 5}, {5, 6}, {5, 7}, {5, 10}, {6, 7}, {6, 18}, {6, 21}, {6, 26}, {7, 13}, {7, 17}, {8, 14}, {8, 29}, {8, 4}, {9, 13}, {9, 17}, {9, 22}, {10, 15}, {10, 5}, {11, 2}, {11, 16}, {11, 25}, {12, 15}, {12, 20}, {12, 22}, {12, 26}, {13, 24}, {13, 9}, {13, 7}, {14, 8}, {14, 21}, {15, 0}, {15, 5}, {15, 10}, {15, 12}, {16, 11}, {16, 3}, {16, 18}, {16, 26}, {17, 2}, {17, 7}, {17, 9}, {18, 16}, {18, 6}, {19, 1}, {19, 28}, {20, 12}, {20, 28}, {21, 6}, {21, 14}, {22, 23}, {22, 9}, {22, 12}, {23, 4}, {23, 0}, {24, 13}, {24, 2}, {25, 11}, {25, 29}, {26, 3}, {26, 6}, {26, 12}, {26, 16}, {26, 27}, {27, 26}, {27, 29}, {28, 19}, {28, 3}, {28, 20}, {29, 25}, {29, 8}, {29, 27}

Degree-based ordering after sorting the vertices by the number of connections (degree):
Vertices: {1, 17, 19, 21, 27, 28, 0, 10, 14, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 3, 6, 8, 11, 16, 2, 4, 12, 25, 29, 26}

Based on the degree-based ordering, we can count the triangles.
