Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 10) (12, 1) (12, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 11) (11, 6) (11, 2) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 12) 

Response:
Let's list the degrees of each node first:

Node 0: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 6
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 5
Node 10: degree 5
Node 11: degree 2
Node 12: degree 2
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 4

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 11: degree 2 -> Node 0
Node 12: degree 2 -> Node 1
Node 13: degree 3 -> Node 2
Node 14: degree 4 -> Node 3
Node 2: degree 4 -> Node 4
Node 3: degree 4 -> Node 5
Node 4: degree 4 -> Node 6
Node 5: degree 4 -> Node 7
Node 7: degree 4 -> Node 8
Node 8: degree 4 -> Node 9
Node 0: degree 5 -> Node 10
Node 1: degree 5 -> Node 11
Node 9: degree 5 -> Node 12
Node 10: degree 5 -> Node 13
Node 6: degree 6 -> Node 14

Now, let's analyze the edges according to the relabeled nodes:

- Node 6 (4): connects with Node 4, Node 5, Node 13, Node 14, Node 10, Node 11.
- Node 0 (10): connects with Node 10, Node 13, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4.
- Node 2 (4): connects with Node 4, Node 6, Node 11, Node 8.
- Node 6 (3): connects with Node 13, Node 0, Node 5.
- Node 8 (9): connects with Node 11, Node 3, Node 9, Node 5.
- Node 8 (5): connects with Node 9, Node 3, Node 5, Node 14.
- Node 10 (12): connects with Node 1, Node 13, Node 5, Node 14, Node 6, Node 0.
- Node 10 (14): connects with Node 14, Node 6, Node 0, Node 5.
- Node 1 (11): connects with Node 5, Node 3, Node 9, Node 12, Node 8.
- Node 5 (7): connects with Node 10, Node 14, Node 6, Node 8.
- Node 6 (14): connects with Node 14, Node 10, Node 5.
- Node 0 (13): connects with Node 1, Node 4, Node 10, Node 9, Node 14.
- Node 13 (2): connects with Node 4, Node 0, Node 9.
- Node 4 (6): connects with Node 2, Node 6, Node 13, Node 11, Node 3, Node 10.
- Node 7 (8): connects with Node 4, Node 3, Node 1, Node 2.
- Node 3 (5): connects with Node 1, Node 5, Node 4, Node 8, Node 6.
