Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their degree (number of connections) from least to most. Then, relabel the vertices accordingly for calculations. 

After relabelling the vertices, the new order is as follows:
0 -> 7 connections
6 -> 7 connections
2 -> 6 connections
5 -> 6 connections
8 -> 5 connections
9 -> 5 connections
3 -> 4 connections
1 -> 4 connections
4 -> 3 connections
7 -> 3 connections

Now, we can go through the edges and count the triangles by checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge. 

The total number of triangles is [5] which are:
<3, 1, 9>, <3, 1, 5>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 7, 5>, <1, 5, 9>.
