Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
(6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 0), (9, 4), (9, 7), (4, 2), (7, 3), (7, 2), (1, 3), (1, 8), (3, 5), (0, 3), (0, 2)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order:

Nodes with degrees:
0: 4 connections
5: 1 connection
4: 2 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 3 connections
2: 5 connections
3: 5 connections
9: 5 connections
1: 6 connections
6: 6 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider pairs of edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 3, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
