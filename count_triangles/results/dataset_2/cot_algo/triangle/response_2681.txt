Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied to find the total number of triangles in this graph. Let's start by labeling the vertices based on their degrees.

Vertex:    Degree:    Label:
-----------           ----------      -------
0                    2                    0

28                  2                    0
29                  3                    1

Now, we will count the triangles by examining the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge between 0 and 19: Both have 2 connections, no triangle.
