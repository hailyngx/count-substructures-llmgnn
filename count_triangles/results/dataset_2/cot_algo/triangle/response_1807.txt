Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 7) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 8) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 8) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 14) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

    Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
    Edges: (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 10), (6, 3), (6, 4), (9, 7), (10, 11), (10, 8), (10, 7), (10, 13), (11, 0), (5, 13), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 14), (13, 2), (13, 0), (4, 12), (4, 14), (12, 3), (12, 1), (1, 8), (0, 4)
             (13, 7), (14, 3), (2, 12), (3, 14), (7, 2), (8, 10), (8, 5)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

    1. Node 2: Degree 2
    2. Node 11: Degree 2
    3. Node 9: Degree 2
    4. Node 5: Degree 4
    5. Node 0: Degree 4
    6. Node 1: Degree 3
    7. Node 4: Degree 3
    8. Node 12: Degree 3
    9. Node 14: Degree 4
    10. Node 3: Degree 4
    11. Node 6: Degree 6
    12. Node 13: Degree 6
    13. Node 7: Degree 6
    14. Node 10: Degree 6
    15. Node 8: Degree 5

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

    Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found:
    <0, 4, 12>
    <0, 4, 14>
    <0, 8, 10>
    <0, 8, 14>
    <1, 6, 12>
    <3, 4, 14>
