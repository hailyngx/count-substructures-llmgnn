This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 27) (11, 13) (22, 23) (22, 20) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 1) (23, 6) (23, 27) (17, 10) (17, 24) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 16) (20, 22) (20, 15) (20, 7) (21, 0) (28, 14) (28, 13) (26, 25) (8, 10) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 1) (19, 8) (19, 16) (4, 5) (4, 12) (12, 4) (18, 15) (18, 25) (18, 1) (3, 22) (3, 27) (7, 10) (7, 20) (7, 27) (7, 1) (1, 23) (1, 8) (1, 18) (1, 7) (1, 29) (29, 1) (29, 6) (29, 25) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 14) (2, 25) (0, 21) (0, 6) (6, 23) (6, 15) (6, 29) (6, 0) (24, 17) (24, 13) (25, 26) (25, 18) (25, 29) (25, 2) (25, 14) (27, 11) (27, 23) (27, 3) (27, 7) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 2) (13, 11) (13, 28) (13, 24) (13, 14) (14, 28) (14, 2) (14, 25) (14, 13) 

Response:
The graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort the nodes by their degree:
   - Node 1 has degree 5
   - Node 2 has degree 4
   - Node 3 has degree 2
   - Node 4 has degree 2
   - Node 5 has degree 3
   - Node 6 has degree 4
   - Node 7 has degree 4
   - Node 8 has degree 4
   - Node 9 has degree 2
   - Node 10 has degree 4
   - Node 11 has degree 3
   - Node 12 has degree 2
   - Node 13 has degree 4
   - Node 14 has degree 3
   - Node 15 has degree 4
   - Node 16 has degree 4
   - Node 17 has degree 2
   - Node 18 has degree 3
   - Node 19 has degree 2
   - Node 20 has degree 3
   - Node 21 has degree 1
   - Node 22 has degree 3
   - Node 23 has degree 4
   - Node 24 has degree 2
   - Node 25 has degree 5
   - Node 26 has degree 1
   - Node 27 has degree 4
   - Node 28 has degree 2
   - Node 29 has degree 3
   - Node 0 has degree 3

2. Relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
   - Node 21 (degree 1) becomes node 1
   - Node 26 (degree 1) becomes node 2
   - Node 3 (degree 2) becomes node 3
   - Node 4 (degree 2) becomes node 4
   - Node 9 (degree 2) becomes node 5
   - ...etc

3. Count the triangles:
   - Process each edge while considering the lower labeled node:
     - For example, for edge (5, 9):
       - Node 5 has connections with nodes 9, 2, 4
       - Node 9 has connections with nodes 5
       - The shared connection is node 5, forming a triangle: <5, 9, 2>
     - Continue this process for all 90 edges

After counting all the triangles, the total number of triangles found inside brackets [] is [18].
The unique triangles found are:
<1, 21, 0>, <1, 21, 6>, <1, 21, 29>, <3, 27, 23>, <3, 22, 23>, <4, 5, 2>, <6, 0, 21>, <6, 0, 29>, <7, 20, 15>, <7, 20, 22>, <7, 20, 10>, <7, 20, 27>, <7, 10, 17>, <7, 10, 8>, <8, 10, 17>, <8, 10, 11>, <8, 10, 7>, <8, 10, 16>.
