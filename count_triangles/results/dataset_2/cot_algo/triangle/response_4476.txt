Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Here are the vertices sorted by their number of connections (degree):
9 (3 connections),
8 (2 connections),
5 (4 connections),
4 (4 connections),
7 (4 connections),
1 (4 connections),
3 (4 connections),
6 (4 connections),
2 (4 connections),
0 (5 connections).

Starting with the edge (5, 9), we see that the vertex with the lower label (5) has fewer connections. Both vertices 5 and 9 have common connections with vertex 0, forming the triangle (5, 9, 0).

Moving on to the other edges following the same process, we count the triangles in the graph:

Total number of triangles: [9]

Unique triangles:
<5, 9, 0>
