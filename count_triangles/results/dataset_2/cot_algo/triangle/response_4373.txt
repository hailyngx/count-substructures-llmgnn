Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 27) (20, 29) (20, 18) (20, 22) (20, 2) (25, 6) (25, 24) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 21) (8, 7) (5, 12) (6, 25) (6, 24) (6, 14) (6, 15) (28, 29) (28, 26) (28, 13) (29, 20) (29, 28) (29, 26) (29, 12) (2, 20) (2, 27) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 17) (0, 7) (0, 22) (0, 23) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 27) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 17) (21, 8) (21, 19) (21, 12) (17, 11) (17, 26) (17, 15) (24, 25) (24, 6) (24, 9) (14, 6) (22, 20) (22, 0) (22, 27) (9, 4) (9, 24) (9, 10) (9, 23) (23, 0) (23, 9) (23, 19) (27, 16) (27, 2) (27, 1) (27, 22) (27, 13) (12, 5) (12, 29) (12, 21) (3, 4) (3, 10) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 19) (18, 20) (18, 10) (18, 13) (19, 21) (19, 23) (19, 10) (13, 28) (13, 1) (13, 27) (13, 18) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes by their degrees is as follows:
(3) (5) (11) (14) (16) (17) (4) (12) (7) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (2) (9) (0) (8) (1) (6) (18) (19) (10) (13) (15) (26) (27) (29) (20) (28)

Triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<0, 7, 16>
<0, 7, 22>
<0, 23, 27>
<2, 20, 29>
<2, 20, 27>
<4, 6, 25>
<4, 6, 24>
<4, 9, 24>
<4, 8, 21>
<6, 15, 17>
<6, 15, 1>
<6, 12, 29>
<7, 8, 16>
<13, 18, 28>
<13, 18, 27>
<17, 26, 29>
<19, 21, 10>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
