Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 3) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 3) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 12) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 12) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently in the given graph. Let's follow the steps:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections in ascending order.

    Sorted vertices from least to most connected: 9, 14, 1, 5, 2, 8, 3, 6, 12, 13, 7, 11, 0, 10, 4

2. Relabel the vertices according to the sorted order.

    Relabeled vertices:  
    (9) -> 0, (14) -> 1, (1) -> 2, (5) -> 3, (2) -> 4, (8) -> 5, (3) -> 6, (6) -> 7, (12) -> 8, (13) -> 9, (7) -> 10, (11) -> 11, (0) -> 12, (10) -> 13, (4) -> 14

3. For each edge, consider only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

    List of edges to consider with lower labeled vertices first: 
    (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 8), (2, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 10), (6, 11), (6, 13), (6, 12), (7, 3), (8, 2), (8, 0), (9, 1), (10, 13), (11, 14), (12, 5), (13, 5), (14, 12)

4. Count the triangles by checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

    Total number of triangles: [29]

Unique triangles:
    <5, 10, 13>
    <1, 8, 2>
    <4, 8, 0>
    <11, 6, 13>
    <12, 5, 14>
    <6, 4, 7>
    <6, 4, 0>
    <6, 13, 12>
    <1, 9, 2>
    <11, 14, 12>
    <6, 11, 4>
    <3, 7, 0>
    <3, 7, 10>
    <4, 0, 7>
    <6, 11, 13>
    <6, 12, 5>
    <4, 7, 0>
    <7, 10, 0>
    <5, 12, 13>
    <1, 2, 3>
    <1, 2, 8>
    <6, 3, 7>
    <6, 3, 0>
    <6, 13, 5>
    <11, 12, 14>
    <4, 6, 0>
    <10, 5, 13>
    <4, 11, 6>
