Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 8) (5, 8) (5, 4) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 4) (0, 15) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 1) (16, 14) (16, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 8) (18, 15) (19, 13) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 12) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 7) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 10) (2, 3) (2, 15) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 13) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 8) (13, 19) (13, 4) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Let's apply this method to the given graph.

First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes by degree:
Node 16: degree 2
Node 19: degree 1
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 2: degree 2
Node 17: degree 3
Node 0: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 18: degree 2
Node 15: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 13: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 14: degree 5
Node 3: degree 4

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 16 (degree 2) -> Node 0
Node 19 (degree 1) -> Node 1
Node 5 (degree 2) -> Node 2
Node 6 (degree 3) -> Node 3
Node 9 (degree 3) -> Node 4
Node 7 (degree 3) -> Node 5
Node 10 (degree 3) -> Node 6
Node 2 (degree 2) -> Node 7
Node 17 (degree 3) -> Node 8
Node 0 (degree 3) -> Node 9
Node 4 (degree 4) -> Node 10
Node 18 (degree 2) -> Node 11
Node 15 (degree 3) -> Node 12
Node 1 (degree 4) -> Node 13
Node 13 (degree 3) -> Node 14
Node 12 (degree 3) -> Node 15
Node 8 (degree 4) -> Node 16
Node 11 (degree 4) -> Node 17
Node 14 (degree 5) -> Node 18
Node 3 (degree 4) -> Node 19

Now, let's check for triangles based on the sorted nodes and their connections:

Triangles:
[18]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1], and the unique triangle found is <14, 17, 18>.
