Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 7), (6, 1), (6, 3), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 9), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles.

Nodes by degree:
0: 3
1: 4
5: 3
6: 2
8: 3
7: 5
3: 4
9: 7
2: 5
4: 6

Vertices sorted by degree:
6, 0, 5, 8, 7, 1, 3, 2, 4, 9

Calculating the triangles:

Triangles: [16]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <7, 9, 2>, <9, 2, 4>
