Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 2) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 19) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 12) (10, 11) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 2) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 1) (1, 18) (1, 2) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 7) (0, 16) (0, 13) (0, 5) (6, 17) (6, 12) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 19) (9, 15) (9, 17) (19, 16) (19, 2) (19, 14) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 6) (14, 5) (14, 19) (7, 13) (7, 18) (7, 17) 

Response:
The vertices of the graph can be labeled based on their degrees as follows:
- Vertex 0: degree 4
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 2: degree 5
- Vertex 3: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 4
- Vertex 5: degree 5
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 3
- Vertex 8: degree 4
- Vertex 9: degree 3
- Vertex 10: degree 2
- Vertex 11: degree 4
- Vertex 12: degree 4
- Vertex 13: degree 3
- Vertex 14: degree 2
- Vertex 15: degree 4
- Vertex 16: degree 4
- Vertex 17: degree 4
- Vertex 18: degree 4
- Vertex 19: degree 3

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Starting with the edge (3, 12):
- Vertex 3 has 2 connections while Vertex 12 has 4 connections.
- Shared connections between 3 and 12: 0.

Next, the edge (3, 4):
- Vertex 3 has 2 connections while Vertex 4 has 4 connections.
- Shared connections between 3 and 4: 2.

Continuing this process for all edges and summing up the triangles, we find there are a total of 18 triangles in this graph:
