Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 22) (21, 20) (21, 8) (21, 24) (20, 21) (20, 25) (20, 12) (20, 13) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 18) (8, 21) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 18) (13, 20) (13, 8) (13, 9) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 1) (29, 28) (29, 23) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 18) (28, 5) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 26) (5, 2) (5, 28) (11, 20) (11, 23) (11, 19) (23, 29) (23, 11) (23, 17) (23, 27) (27, 25) (27, 23) (27, 10) (27, 26) (27, 19) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 10) (1, 2) (1, 6) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 3) (18, 25) (18, 8) (18, 28) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 16) (17, 23) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 12) (19, 11) (19, 27) (19, 10) (19, 12) (26, 6) (26, 27) (26, 16) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 26) (16, 14) (12, 20) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 24) (0, 8) (0, 24) (24, 21) (24, 12) (24, 0) (24, 14) (10, 27) (10, 22) (10, 9) (10, 19) (14, 16) (14, 24) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections). Let's relabel the nodes accordingly:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 7: Degree 0
Node 15: Degree 0
Node 30: Degree 0
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 10: Degree 2
Node 14: Degree 2
Node 18: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 12: Degree 4
Node 19: Degree 4
Node 20: Degree 5
Node 21: Degree 4
Node 22: Degree 3
Node 23: Degree 4
Node 24: Degree 4
Node 25: Degree 3
Node 26: Degree 3
Node 27: Degree 5
Node 28: Degree 4
Node 29: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 16: Degree 4
Node 17: Degree 4

Now, let's check for triangles by examining each edge. We only consider edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections. 

After checking all the edges, we find that there are 18 triangles in the graph.

The total number of triangles is [18].

Unique triangles found are:
<8, 13, 20>
<10, 22, 27>
<19, 23, 27>
<11, 19, 27>
<8, 18, 28>
<3, 9, 10>
<8, 13, 9>
<6, 1, 5>
<12, 19, 27>
<8, 21, 24>
<16, 17, 26>
<2, 5, 28>
<6, 26, 27>
<0, 8, 24>
<3, 16, 17>
<6, 16, 26>
<12, 17, 19>
<24, 12, 14>
