Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 17) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 17) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 19) (7, 0) (7, 15) (5, 2) (5, 18) (19, 14) (19, 10) (19, 6) (1, 13) (1, 9) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 7) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 6) (6, 4) (6, 19) (6, 12) (6, 3) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 12) (10, 19) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 1) (9, 14) (9, 1) (3, 8) (3, 6) 

Response:
The given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be represented visually as follows:

```
Node: 0 - Connected to: 4, 8, 14, 7
Node: 1 - Connected to: 13, 9
Node: 2 - Connected to: 18, 5, 15
Node: 3 - Connected to: 8, 6
Node: 4 - Connected to: 8, 13, 0, 6
Node: 5 - Connected to: 18, 2, 15
Node: 6 - Connected to: 4, 19, 12, 3
Node: 7 - Connected to: 0, 15
Node: 8 - Connected to: 4, 14, 0, 3
Node: 9 - Connected to: 14, 1
Node: 10 - Connected to: 19
Node: 11 - Connected to: 16, 13, 12
Node: 12 - Connected to: 11, 16, 17, 6
Node: 13 - Connected to: 11, 4, 1
Node: 14 - Connected to: 8, 0, 9, 19
Node: 15 - Connected to: 2, 18, 7
Node: 16 - Connected to: 11, 12, 17
Node: 17 - Connected to: 16, 18, 12
Node: 18 - Connected to: 2, 5, 15, 17
Node: 19 - Connected to: 14, 10, 6
```

Sorting the nodes by their connections from least to most, we get the following order:
Nodes: 1, 10, 3, 7, 9, 5, 0, 2, 15, 6, 18, 8, 19, 13, 4, 12, 16, 17, 11, 14

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now go through the edges to count the number of triangles.

[Total number of triangles: 6]
<4, 6, 19>
<4, 6, 12>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 14>
<0, 8, 14>
<14, 19, 10>
