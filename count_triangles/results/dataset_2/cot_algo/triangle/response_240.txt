Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
Edges in the given graph:
(4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) 
(6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) 
(5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) 
(0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0)

By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the labeled vertices will be:
Labeled vertices: 
0(7), 1(4), 3(3), 5(3), 6(6), 8(3), 2(5), 9(6), 4(4), 7(5)
