Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 13) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 5) (5, 10) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 3) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method will help us count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Sorting the nodes by degree in ascending order, we get the following relabeling:

Node 7: degree 2    
Node 10: degree 2    
Node 3: degree 3   
Node 13: degree 3   
Node 5: degree 4    
Node 8: degree 4     
Node 1: degree 4     
Node 2: degree 4     
Node 12: degree 4     
Node 0: degree 5    
Node 14: degree 5    
Node 6: degree 6    
Node 11: degree 6     
Node 9: degree 6  
Node 4: degree 7    

Now, let's check the shared connections to find the triangles:

Triangles:  
<0, 4, 7>  
<0, 4, 9>  
<0, 4, 14>  
<0, 7, 9>  
<4, 6, 9>  
<6, 9, 11>  
<6, 9, 12>  
<6, 9, 13>  
<4, 11, 13>  
<10, 11, 13>  

Total number of triangles: [10]
