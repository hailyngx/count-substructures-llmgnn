Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 26) (18, 22) (18, 16) (18, 6) (22, 18) (20, 17) (20, 13) (20, 6) (20, 10) (25, 7) (25, 28) (8, 4) (8, 5) (17, 20) (17, 15) (9, 21) (9, 14) (9, 27) (9, 19) (13, 20) (13, 23) (13, 6) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 23) (21, 9) (21, 3) (21, 2) (21, 29) (14, 9) (14, 26) (14, 6) (26, 7) (26, 14) (26, 5) (26, 29) (28, 25) (28, 3) (28, 0) (2, 21) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 26) (5, 0) (12, 24) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 29) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 23) (16, 7) (16, 18) (16, 1) (16, 23) (11, 7) (11, 27) (0, 4) (0, 28) (0, 5) (6, 18) (6, 20) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 27) (24, 12) (1, 19) (1, 16) (29, 21) (29, 26) (29, 15) (10, 20) (10, 23) (27, 9) (27, 11) (27, 6) (23, 13) (23, 3) (23, 19) (23, 16) (23, 10) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is as follows: 

(11, 1), (1, 2), (12, 1), (3, 3), (4, 4), (0, 5), (2, 5), (10, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6), (25, 6), (28, 6), (13, 7), (14, 7), (26, 7), (5, 7), (22, 8), (17, 8), (15, 8), (29, 8), (24, 8), (20, 8), (6, 9), (18, 9), (16, 9), (9, 9), (21, 9), (19, 9), (27, 9), (23, 10)

Now, let's count the number of triangles by checking for shared connections between vertices connected by edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections: 

There are 27 triangles in total: 
[27]

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 28>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 28>, <2, 21, 3>, <2, 21, 29>, <3, 21, 29>, <6, 18, 16>, <6, 13, 20>, <6, 14, 26>, <6, 27, 9>, <7, 4, 8>, <7, 25, 28>, <10, 20, 13>, <10, 20, 23>, <10, 23, 13>, <15, 17, 20>, <15, 19, 1>, <15, 19, 23>, <15, 19, 29>, <16, 1, 19>, <16, 7, 25>, <19, 9, 21>, <19, 15, 29>, <23, 3, 21>, <23, 10, 20>
