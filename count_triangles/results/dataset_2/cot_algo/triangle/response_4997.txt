Response:
Let's construct the graph as described.  

Nodes: 30  
Edges: 90  
Edges: (9, 26), (9, 5), (9, 29), (9, 4), (9, 27), (26, 0), (26, 7), (5, 23), (2, 29), (2, 20), (2, 7), (29, 25), (21, 19), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 11), (1, 28), (10, 22), (11, 24), (12, 17), (6, 15), (6, 8), (13, 16), (0, 11), (17, 8), (19, 22), (24, 23), (23, 13), (18, 20)

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

1. Relabel the vertices based on their degrees, starting from the vertex with the least connections:
   - Node 9 - Degree 5
   - Node 26 - Degree 3
   - Node 5 - Degree 2
   - Node 29 - Degree 3
   - Node 4 - Degree 3    
   - Node 7 - Degree 3
   - Node 23 - Degree 3
   - Node 20 - Degree 3
   - Node 21 - Degree 2
   - Node 3 - Degree 2
   - Node 10 - Degree 2
   - Node 24 - Degree 4
   - Node 12 - Degree 2
   - Node 28 - Degree 5
   - Node 0 - Degree 3
   - Node 1 - Degree 4
   - Node 22 - Degree 4
   - Node 6 - Degree 4
   - Node 15 - Degree 3
   - Node 8 - Degree 4
   - Node 13 - Degree 3
   - Node 16 - Degree 3
   - Node 17 - Degree 4
   - Node 18 - Degree 1
   - Node 2 - Degree 3
   - Node 11 - Degree 4
   - Node 19 - Degree 3
   - Node 25 - Degree 2
   - Node 27 - Degree 4

2. Sort the edges based on the node with the lower label:
   - (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 26), (9, 27), (9, 29), (26, 0), (2, 7), (2, 29), (5, 23), (1, 11), (10, 22), (12, 17), (6, 15), (0, 11), (13, 16)

3. Count the number of triangles:
   - Total number of triangles: [34]

Unique triangles: 
   - <4, 9, 26>
   - <5, 9, 29>
   - <9, 26, 27>
   - <9, 4, 27>
   - <5, 9, 23>
   - <2, 7, 29>
   - <1, 11, 28>
   - <10, 11, 22>
   - <12, 17, 22>
   - <6, 15, 8>
   - <0, 11, 28>
   - <13, 16, 23>
