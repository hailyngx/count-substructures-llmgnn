Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 3) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 14) 

Response:
I will now construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
- 0: (4, 14, 5)
- 1: (6, 9, 4, 7)
- 2: (9, 10, 8, 7)
- 3: (9, 10, 11, 14, 13)
- 4: (6, 8, 0, 5, 1)
- 5: (10, 4, 7, 0, 14)
- 6: (1, 4, 13)
- 7: (8, 2, 5, 1)
- 8: (4, 12, 7, 2)
- 9: (2, 3, 1)
- 10: (11, 3, 13, 5, 2)
- 11: (10, 3, 12)
- 12: (11, 8, 14)
- 13: (6, 10, 14, 3)
- 14: (12, 0, 3, 5, 13)

Now, I will label the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:

Nodes by degree: 1(2), 0(3), 13(3), 12(3), 11(3), 6(3), 7(4), 9(4), 5(5), 8(5), 2(5), 1(5), 4(5), 3(5), 10(5)

Let's count the number of triangles and list the unique triangles found:

Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 5, 14>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 6, 13>, <2, 8, 12>, <2, 8, 7>, <2, 8, 10>, <2, 7, 5>, <3, 13, 14>, <3, 10, 13>, <3, 10, 11>
