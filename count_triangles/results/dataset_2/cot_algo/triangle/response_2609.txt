Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count triangles efficiently in this case. 

The sorted list of nodes based on their degrees is:
```
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 5: 6 connections
```

Now, let's count the triangles:
1. (Node 2, Node 5) -> Shared connections: 1, 8, 1 triangle <2, 5, 8>
2. (Node 2, Node 9) -> Shared connections: 1, 6, 1 triangle  <2, 9, 6>
3. (Node 2, Node 0) -> Shared connections: 8, 5, 1 triangle  <2, 0, 5>
4. (Node 2, Node 1) -> Shared connections: 1, 3, 1 triangle  <2, 1, 3>
5. (Node 2, Node 6) -> Shared connections: 1, 4, 1 triangle  <2, 6, 4>
6. (Node 8, Node 5) -> Shared connections: 7, 1, 1 triangle  <8, 5, 7>
7. (Node 8, Node 7) -> Shared connections: 5, 1, 1 triangle  <8, 7, 5>
8. (Node 8, Node 6) -> Shared connections: 7, 4, 1 triangle  <8, 6, 7>
9. (Node 0, Node 9) -> Shared connections: 3, 6, 1 triangle  <0, 9, 3>
10. (Node 0, Node 3) -> Shared connections: 9, 4, 1 triangle  <0, 3, 9>

Total number of triangles: [10]
