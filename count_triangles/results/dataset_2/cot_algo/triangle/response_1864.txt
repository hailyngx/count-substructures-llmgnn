Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 6) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 16) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 15) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 18) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 18) (13, 12) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 19) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 18) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 0) (6, 12) (6, 14) (19, 2) (19, 3) (19, 13) (10, 7) (10, 1) (4, 13) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 18) (15, 14) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree or number of connections:

Node 5: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 15: 1 connection
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 16: 4 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 18: 6 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
