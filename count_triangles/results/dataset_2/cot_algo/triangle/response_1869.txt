Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Sort vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
   - Vertex 9: 1 connection
   - Vertex 5: 2 connections
   - Vertex 6: 2 connections
   - Vertex 8: 2 connections
   - Vertex 29: 2 connections
   - Vertex 1: 3 connections
   - Vertex 25: 3 connections
   - Vertex 2: 4 connections
   - Vertex 7: 4 connections
   - Vertex 15: 4 connections
   - Vertex 3: 5 connections
   - Vertex 13: 5 connections
   - Vertex 20: 5 connections
   - Vertex 21: 5 connections
   - Vertex 26: 5 connections
   - Vertex 0: 6 connections
   - Vertex 4: 6 connections
   - Vertex 27: 6 connections
   - Vertex 19: 7 connections
   - Vertex 24: 7 connections
   - Vertex 17: 8 connections
   - Vertex 16: 9 connections
   - Vertex 18: 9 connections
   - Vertex 10: 10 connections
   - Vertex 12: 10 connections
   - Vertex 11: 11 connections
   - Vertex 14: 11 connections
   - Vertex 23: 11 connections
   - Vertex 22: 12 connections
   - Vertex 28: 12 connections

2. Proceed with each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
   - Count the number of triangles formed by shared connections in each edge

3. Total number of triangles: 76
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [76]. 

Some unique triangles found are:
- <0, 4, 26>
- <1, 12, 27>
- <3, 5, 23>
- <7, 12, 16>
- <10, 17, 16>
- <11, 14, 18>
- <19, 18, 11>
- <20, 21, 3>
- <22, 24, 2>
- <28, 7, 18>
