Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 12) (7, 10) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 8) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed based on the provided information. 
Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

The vertices with their labels and degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: Label = 0, Degree = 4
- Node 1: Label = 1, Degree = 3
- Node 2: Label = 2, Degree = 4
- Node 3: Label = 3, Degree = 3
- Node 4: Label = 5, Degree = 3
- Node 5: Label = 6, Degree = 7
- Node 6: Label = 4, Degree = 4
- Node 7: Label = 7, Degree = 2
- Node 8: Label = 3, Degree = 5
- Node 9: Label = 2, Degree = 5
- Node 10: Label = 8, Degree = 3
- Node 11: Label = 5, Degree = 4
- Node 12: Label = 2, Degree = 5
- Node 13: Label = 5, Degree = 3
- Node 14: Label = 6, Degree = 5

Based on the degree-based ordering, we analyze the edges as follows:
1. Edge (0, 1): Both vertices have a lower label than degree, so we proceed.
2. Edge (2, 5): Vertex 2 has a lower label than degree, so we proceed.
3. Edge (12, 2): Vertex 12 has a lower label than degree, so we proceed.
4. Edge (12, 14): Vertex 12 has a lower label than degree, so we proceed.
5. Edge (0, 14): Both vertices have a lower label than degree, so we proceed.

The total number of triangles found in the graph is [2].
The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 14> and <2, 12, 14>.
