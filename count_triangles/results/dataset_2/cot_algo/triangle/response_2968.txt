Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 21) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 0) (3, 25) (3, 6) (25, 3) (25, 13) (10, 17) (10, 15) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 23) (17, 22) (17, 2) (4, 24) (4, 26) (18, 26) (18, 7) (18, 1) (21, 5) (21, 11) (24, 4) (24, 19) (2, 17) (2, 27) (2, 6) (2, 28) (8, 20) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 22) (26, 4) (26, 18) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 29) (28, 2) (28, 26) (28, 14) (13, 5) (13, 25) (15, 10) (15, 23) (15, 7) (14, 26) (14, 28) (14, 20) (12, 1) (12, 23) (16, 20) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 27) (7, 18) (7, 15) (7, 27) (20, 5) (20, 8) (20, 14) (20, 16) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 29) (23, 17) (23, 15) (23, 12) (19, 24) (19, 29) (29, 26) (29, 0) (29, 19) (29, 22) (1, 18) (1, 12) (11, 21) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 22) (22, 17) (22, 8) (22, 29) (22, 11) (27, 2) (27, 6) (27, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree.

The sorted list of vertices with their degrees is:
(5: 4), (9: 2), (3: 2), (25: 2), (10: 2), (18: 3), (4: 2), (21: 2), (17: 5), (24: 2), (2: 4), (8: 4), (26: 5), (28: 3), (13: 2), (15: 3), (14: 3), (12: 2), (16: 1), (6: 4), (7: 3), (20: 4), (0: 3), (23: 3), (19: 2), (29: 4), (1: 2), (11: 4), (22: 4), (27: 3)

Following the method, we will only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

After examining all edges, the total number of triangles found in the graph is [23].

The unique triangles are:
<5, 13, 25>, <5, 13, 21>, <5, 13, 25>, <5, 13, 21>, <5, 13, 25>, <5, 13, 21>, <5, 13, 25>, <5, 13, 21>, <5, 21, 11>, <5, 21, 11>, <5, 21, 11>, <5, 21, 11>, <17, 23, 15>, <17, 23, 12>, <17, 23, 15>, <17, 23, 12>, <17, 2, 6>, <17, 2, 6>, <17, 2, 6>, <17, 2, 6>, <17, 2, 6>, <17, 2, 6>, <17, 2, 6>
