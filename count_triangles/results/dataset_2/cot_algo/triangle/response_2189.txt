Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 16) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (17, 19) (17, 18) (17, 11) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 19) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 4) (0, 19) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 15) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 10) (15, 2) (15, 16) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 13) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (16, 9) (16, 2) (16, 1) (16, 15) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 18) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 3) (18, 10) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 3) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 13) (13, 11) (13, 6) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed and sorted based on the degree-based ordering method. 

The sorted vertices are: 
0, 13, 5, 2, 6, 15, 1, 10, 12, 8, 4, 16, 7, 19, 18, 3, 9, 14, 17, 11

Based on the given edges, the unique triangles found are: 
<3, 8, 10>, <3, 7, 11>, <3, 7, 18>, <3, 11, 19>, <8, 10, 18>, <8, 6, 12>, <2, 1, 16>, <1, 2, 15>, <11, 17, 19>, <11, 7, 19>, <11, 13, 18>, <12, 5, 14>, <16, 9, 4>, <16, 2, 15>, <0, 4, 19>
  
Therefore, there are a total of [14] triangles in the graph.
