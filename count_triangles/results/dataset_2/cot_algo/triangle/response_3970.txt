Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 3), (9, 8), (9, 0), (4, 6), (7, 0), (1, 2), (3, 6)

Next, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections) from least to most:

Nodes sorted by degree: 7, 8, 2, 6, 4, 1, 3, 0, 9, 5

Now, we will look at each edge and only consider it if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Considering edge (5, 9): 5 has 5 connections, 9 has 4 connections, shared connections: 3
Considering edge (5, 2): 5 has 5 connections, 2 has 4 connections, shared connections: 1
Considering edge (5, 1): 5 has 5 connections, 1 has 5 connections, shared connections: 2
Considering edge (5, 4): 5 has 5 connections, 4 has 4 connections, shared connections: 3
Considering edge (5, 3): 5 has 5 connections, 3 has 5 connections, shared connections: 2
Considering edge (9, 8): 9 has 4 connections, 8 has 2 connections, shared connections: 0
Considering edge (9, 0): 9 has 4 connections, 0 has 5 connections, shared connections: 1
Considering edge (4, 6): 4 has 4 connections, 6 has 4 connections, shared connections: 3
Considering edge (7, 0): 7 has 1 connection, 0 has 5 connections, shared connections: 0
Considering edge (1, 2): 1 has 5 connections, 2 has 4 connections, shared connections: 1
Considering edge (3, 6): 3 has 5 connections, 6 has 4 connections, shared connections: 3
