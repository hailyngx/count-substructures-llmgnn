Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 0) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 5) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 13) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 1) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 9), (0, 11), (0, 14)
(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 13)
(2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 14), (2, 0)
(3, 5), (3, 10), (3, 0)
(4, 7), (4, 10), (4, 12), (4, 14)
(5, 8), (5, 11), (5, 12), (5, 1)
(6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 1)
(7, 4), (7, 8)
(8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 12)
(9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 1), (9, 0)
(10, 3), (10, 4), (10, 11), (10, 14)
(11, 0), (11, 5), (11, 13), (11, 10)
(12, 4), (12, 5), (12, 8), (12, 13)
(13, 1), (13, 11), (13, 12)
(14, 0), (14, 2), (14, 4), (14, 10)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Nodes sorted by degree: 7, 13, 6, 3, 12, 10, 7, 14, 1, 2, 0, 8, 5, 4, 9

Counting the triangles:
Total number of triangles: [23]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 1, 14>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 10>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 11>, <0, 5, 12>, <0, 9, 2>, <0, 9, 6>, <0, 9, 1>, <0, 11, 5>, <0, 11, 13>, <0, 11, 10>, <0, 14, 2>, <0, 14, 4>, <0, 14, 10>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 8, 5>
