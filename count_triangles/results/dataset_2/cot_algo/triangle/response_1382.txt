Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 3, and 4
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 2, and 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 1, 7, and 4
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 0, and 4
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 0, and 3
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 8, 1, and 3
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 1, 7, 4, 0
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6 and 2
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 2, 0, and 1
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 and 8

Next, we sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):
Nodes by degree: 7, 9, 3, 0, 4, 1, 7, 2, 8, 10

Renaming the nodes based on their degree order:
Node 7 (Degree 1) -> Node 0
Node 9 (Degree 2) -> Node 1
Node 3 (Degree 3) -> Node 2
Node 0 (Degree 4) -> Node 3
Node 4 (Degree 4) -> Node 4
Node 1 (Degree 4) -> Node 5
Node 2 (Degree 5) -> Node 6
Node 8 (Degree 5) -> Node 7
Node 6 (Degree 7) -> Node 8
Node 5 (Degree 10) -> Node 9

Edges after relabeling:
(5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9)
(6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7)
(2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0)
(8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0)
(4, 3)

Now, let's count the triangles:
Triangles: [30]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
