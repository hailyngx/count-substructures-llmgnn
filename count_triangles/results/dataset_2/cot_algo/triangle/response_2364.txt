Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (1, 5), (7, 9), (5, 9), (1, 7)
- 1: (0, 5), (3, 6), (4, 9), (5, 6), (3, 4), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 6)
- 2: (8, 9), (8, 2), (2, 9)
- 3: (1, 6), (4, 6), (1, 3), (3, 9), (3, 4), (9, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5)
- 4: (1, 9), (3, 9), (6, 9), (6, 5), (1, 3), (3, 6), (4, 9)
- 5: (0, 1), (0, 7), (5, 8), (1, 6), (1, 5), (5, 6), (5, 8)
- 6: (3, 1), (4, 1), (1, 3), (3, 4), (5, 1), (5, 8), (6, 5)
- 7: (0, 1), (0, 9), (0, 5), (9, 7)
- 8: (2, 9), (2, 8), (5, 8)
- 9: (0, 7), (7, 9), (4, 8), (4, 6), (0, 5), (9, 0), (9, 7), (3, 4), (9, 8)

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

Nodes by degree: (sorted from least connected to most connected)
0(4), 2(3), 7(4), 8(3), 5(6), 6(7), 3(8), 4(7), 1(8), 9(9)
