Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 24) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 22) (15, 29) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 23) (22, 15) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 21) (0, 16) (0, 1) (20, 15) (20, 26) (4, 27) (4, 23) (4, 16) (4, 2) (1, 0) (1, 26) (1, 17) (26, 18) (26, 20) (26, 1) (26, 21) (26, 11) (28, 29) (28, 19) (28, 10) (29, 3) (29, 15) (29, 28) (29, 13) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (27, 4) (27, 5) (27, 13) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 7) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 24) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 24) (7, 10) (7, 2) (24, 3) (24, 16) (24, 7) (24, 2) (14, 3) (23, 18) (23, 4) (8, 25) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 19) (21, 22) (21, 26) (5, 17) (5, 27) (5, 12) (5, 10) (12, 5) (19, 28) (19, 17) (19, 6) (25, 8) (13, 29) (13, 27) (10, 28) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 24) (2, 6) (2, 10) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed based on the given information. Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph.

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
0: 0
1: 1
2: 2
3: 3
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 7
8: 8
9: 10
10: 11
11: 12
12: 13
13: 14
14: 15
15: 16
16: 17
17: 18
18: 19
19: 20
20: 21
21: 22
22: 23
23: 24
24: 25
25: 26
26: 27
27: 28
28: 29

Now, let's find the total number of triangles:

[18]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 26, 27>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 10>
<2, 6, 24>
<2, 6, 28>
<2, 7, 10>
<2, 7, 24>
<4, 13, 27>
<5, 10, 13>
