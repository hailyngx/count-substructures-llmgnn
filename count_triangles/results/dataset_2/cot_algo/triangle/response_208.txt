Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 18) (25, 20) (25, 12) (25, 24) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 17) (13, 1) (13, 28) (13, 6) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 19) (10, 9) (10, 24) (11, 8) (11, 23) (11, 14) (11, 2) (28, 13) (28, 1) (29, 7) (17, 8) (17, 19) (17, 22) (26, 20) (26, 5) (26, 6) (4, 27) (4, 21) (4, 15) (27, 4) (27, 19) (6, 13) (6, 26) (6, 21) (6, 22) (21, 4) (21, 6) (21, 5) (5, 26) (5, 21) (5, 3) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 25) (12, 2) (12, 0) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 7) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 7) (18, 20) (18, 9) (16, 24) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 15) (24, 25) (24, 10) (24, 16) (24, 22) (7, 29) (7, 14) (7, 9) (1, 13) (1, 28) (1, 16) (0, 12) (0, 15) (15, 4) (15, 16) (15, 0) (22, 17) (22, 6) (22, 24) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 16) (3, 19) (19, 23) (19, 17) (19, 27) (19, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently in such graphs. Let's begin by sorting the vertices based on their connections:

- Node 7 has 3 edges
- Node 9 has 3 edges
- Node 0 has 2 edges
- Node 15 has 3 edges
- Node 27 has 2 edges
- Node 29 has 1 edge
- Node 10 has 2 edges
- Node 14 has 3 edges
- Node 4 has 3 edges
- Node 2 has 3 edges
- Node 5 has 3 edges
- Node 3 has 4 edges
- Node 22 has 3 edges
- Node 16 has 4 edges
- Node 21 has 3 edges
- Node 6 has 4 edges
- Node 12 has 3 edges
- Node 1 has 3 edges
- Node 17 has 3 edges
- Node 19 has 4 edges
- Node 20 has 3 edges
- Node 8 has 4 edges
- Node 23 has 3 edges
- Node 11 has 4 edges
- Node 24 has 4 edges
- Node 28 has 2 edges
- Node 13 has 3 edges
- Node 18 has 2 edges
- Node 25 has 3 edges
- Node 26 has 3 edges

Now, let's count the triangles. 

There are a total of [42] triangles in the graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 6, 21>
<2, 3, 16>
<9, 10, 24>
<2, 11, 14>
<3, 5, 21>
<7, 9, 14>
<3, 16, 15>
<11, 14, 7>
<3, 16, 1>
<12, 2, 11>
<13, 28, 1>
<19, 3, 16>
<19, 23, 17>
<19, 27, 4>
<19, 27, 3>
<23, 19, 17>
<6, 13, 1>
<6, 13, 28>
<14, 7, 9>
<14, 8, 11>
<24, 10, 9>
<24, 10, 16>
<24, 22, 6>
