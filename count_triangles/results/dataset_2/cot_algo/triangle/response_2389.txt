Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (10, 2) (10, 16) (10, 14) (17, 19) (17, 11) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 19) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 11) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 11) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 19) (15, 1) (15, 13) (9, 8) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9, 19) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (7, 18) (7, 19) (7, 5) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 9) (19, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 12) (16, 10) (16, 9) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

Edges:
- 0: [8, 2, 11]
- 1: [3, 15]
- 2: [10, 18, 11, 0]
- 3: [1, 6, 5]
- 4: [17, 19]
- 5: [3, 7]
- 6: [8, 3, 13]
- 7: [18, 19, 5]
- 8: [9, 0, 6]
- 9: [8, 16, 13, 19]
- 10: [2, 16, 14]
- 11: [17, 2, 18, 0, 12]
- 12: [14, 11]
- 13: [15, 9, 6]
- 14: [10, 12, 19]
- 15: [1, 13]
- 16: [10, 9]
- 17: [19, 11, 4]
- 18: [2, 7, 11]
- 19: [17, 4, 14, 9, 7]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted based on their degree:

Sorted vertices: [1, 16, 12, 5, 7, 4, 0, 15, 6, 10, 14, 3, 8, 13, 2, 18, 11, 9, 17, 19]

Triangles:
- Total number of triangles: [13]

Unique triangles:
- <0, 2, 8>
- <0, 2, 11>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <2, 10, 16>
- <2, 11, 18>
- <2, 11, 0>
- <8, 6, 3>
- <3, 6, 13>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <11, 12, 14>
- <11, 17, 19>
- <9, 13, 15>
- <9, 6, 13>
