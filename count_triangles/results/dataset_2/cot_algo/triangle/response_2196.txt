Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 26) (3, 18) (15, 10) (15, 22) (15, 28) (15, 2) (1, 21) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 9) (21, 29) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 26) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 16) (25, 27) (25, 6) (6, 25) (6, 9) (6, 14) (9, 21) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 24) (28, 15) (28, 11) (28, 13) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 24) (8, 22) (0, 17) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 23) (11, 28) (11, 14) (17, 20) (17, 0) (17, 13) (13, 28) (13, 17) (26, 3) (26, 7) (26, 20) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 4) (27, 25) (27, 10) (16, 7) (16, 20) (18, 3) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 23) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 12) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 23) (5, 0) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 23) (24, 29) (29, 21) (29, 24) (29, 22) (23, 14) (23, 19) (23, 12) (23, 24) (22, 15) (22, 8) (22, 29) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method can be applied as follows:

1. Identify the degrees of each vertex:
   - Vertex 0: degree 2
   - Vertex 1: degree 2
   - Vertex 2: degree 4
   - Vertex 3: degree 2
   - Vertex 4: degree 3
   - Vertex 5: degree 1
   - Vertex 6: degree 4
   - Vertex 7: degree 3
   - Vertex 8: degree 3
   - Vertex 9: degree 4
   - Vertex 10: degree 4
   - Vertex 11: degree 3
   - Vertex 12: degree 4
   - Vertex 13: degree 2
   - Vertex 14: degree 3
   - Vertex 15: degree 4
   - Vertex 16: degree 3
   - Vertex 17: degree 3
   - Vertex 18: degree 4
   - Vertex 19: degree 3
   - Vertex 20: degree 4
   - Vertex 21: degree 4
   - Vertex 22: degree 3
   - Vertex 23: degree 4
   - Vertex 24: degree 4
   - Vertex 25: degree 2
   - Vertex 26: degree 3
   - Vertex 27: degree 2
   - Vertex 28: degree 4
   - Vertex 29: degree 3

2. Sort vertices by degree in ascending order and relabel them:
   - Vertex 5 (degree 1) -> Vertex 0
   - Vertices 1, 3, 13, 25, 27 (degree 2) -> Vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
   - Vertices 0, 7, 8, 11, 16, 17, 22, 26, 29 (degree 3) -> Vertices 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
   - Vertices 4, 14, 20, 25, 28 (degree 4) -> Vertices 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

3. Count the triangles by examining the edges, and output the total number of triangles:

    Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
   - <1, 12, 18>
   - <2, 8, 24>
   - <2, 9, 21>
   - <2, 9, 24>
   - <10, 18, 19>
   - <10, 18, 12>
