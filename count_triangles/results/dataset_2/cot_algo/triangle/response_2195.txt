Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 23) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 21) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 29) (23, 19) (1, 16) (26, 16) (26, 7) (26, 17) (5, 6) (5, 29) (5, 20) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 7) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 17) (20, 5) (20, 15) (20, 18) (20, 28) (20, 10) (28, 6) (28, 20) (28, 25) (3, 7) (3, 22) (21, 8) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 4) (9, 11) (19, 8) (19, 23) (19, 4) (19, 0) (2, 24) (2, 14) (22, 3) (22, 4) (22, 12) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 22) (17, 26) (17, 15) (17, 27) (25, 28) (25, 9) (25, 14) (0, 19) (0, 29) (16, 1) (16, 26) (7, 26) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 27) (11, 9) (11, 13) (13, 11) (13, 10) (29, 23) (29, 5) (29, 0) (29, 12) (24, 2) (24, 27) (24, 12) (24, 10) (27, 17) (27, 7) (27, 24) (14, 23) (14, 2) (14, 25) (10, 20) (10, 13) (10, 24) (10, 12) (12, 22) (12, 29) (12, 24) (12, 10) (18, 15) (18, 20) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. The sorted vertices are labeled from 0 to 29 in ascending order of connections: 

Node 28: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 27: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 18: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 22: degree 4
Node 25: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 4: degree 5
Node 26: degree 5
Node 17: degree 5
Node 15: degree 5
Node 10: degree 5
Node 9: degree 6
Node 12: degree 6
Node 29: degree 6
Node 8: degree 8
Node 11: degree 9
Node 24: degree 9
Node 20: degree 9
Node 16: degree 9
Node 21: degree 2
Node 19: degree 5
Node 23: degree 5

Using the sorted labels, we identify the triangles, and then we count only unique triangles. Based on the given edges, the total number of triangles is [18]. 

The unique triangles are:
<2, 22, 24>
<2, 24, 27>
<3, 7, 27>
<6, 7, 27>
<5, 6, 28>
<5, 20, 28>
<9, 19, 23>
<9, 19, 29>
<9, 25, 28>
<9, 25, 14>
<10, 12, 24>
<10, 12, 29>
<10, 13, 24>
<10, 15, 18>
<11, 13, 10>
<0, 19, 29>
<17, 15, 18>
<17, 26, 16>
