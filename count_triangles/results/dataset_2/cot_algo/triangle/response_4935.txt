Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 7), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 8), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 3)

Degree-Based Ordering:
0 - degree 3
1 - degree 4
4 - degree 4
6 - degree 4
7 - degree 4
5 - degree 4
8 - degree 4
2 - degree 5
3 - degree 5
9 - degree 5

Triangles:
Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 8, 9>, <6, 9, 8>
