Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 1) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 14) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be used to count the number of triangles in the given graph. 
To start with, we will sort the nodes based on their degree in non-decreasing order.

Sorted nodes by degree: 5, 8, 12, 1, 2, 3, 13, 0, 11, 4, 6, 10, 14, 7, 9

Next, we will go through each edge in the graph by considering only the edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections. 
We will count the triangles formed by the shared connections between the two nodes of each edge.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 10>, <0, 4, 11>, <0, 1, 11>, <0, 9, 14>, <1, 8, 11>, <3, 7, 14>, <4, 7, 10>, <4, 7, 11>, <4, 10, 11>.
