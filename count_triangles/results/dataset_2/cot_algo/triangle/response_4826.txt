Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the triangles efficiently in this graph. Let's sort the nodes by their degree:

Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

Now, we will go through each edge using the rule that the vertex with the lower label should have fewer connections:

Checking: (5, 9), Proceed: YES (5 has fewer connections)
Shared connections: 8
Triangle: <5, 8, 9>

Checking: (5, 6), Proceed: NO (both have the same number of connections)
