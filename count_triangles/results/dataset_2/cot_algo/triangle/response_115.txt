Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
0: 1, 3, 4, 6
1: 0, 4, 5, 8
2: 3, 4, 5, 6
3: 0, 2, 4, 8, 9
4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7
5: 1, 2, 5, 8
6: 0, 2, 4, 9
7: 4, 9
8: 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
9: 3, 6, 7, 8

Now, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

Sorted Vertices by Degree:
0: 4 connections
1: 4 connections
5: 4 connections
9: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
8: 5 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 2 connections
3: 5 connections
4: 6 connections

Triangles:
[11]

Unique Triangles:
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 1>
