Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 1) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 1: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine the edges:
(2, 1)
(1, 5)
(0, 8)
(0, 3)
(4, 9)
(4, 8)
(7, 8)
(7, 1)
(5, 9)
(5, 6)

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 3, 5>
<4, 9, 8>
<4, 9, 3>
<4, 3, 8>
<7, 8, 1>
<1, 5, 9>
