Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:

(5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 4), (9, 3), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 0), (0, 4), (7, 8), (7, 1), (8, 3), (2, 1)

To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 0 has 2 connections
Vertex 5 has 5 connections
Vertices 2, 9 have 4 connections each
Vertices 1, 8, 6, 7 have 3 connections each
Vertices 3, 4 have 5 connections each

Now, we will relabel the vertices in increasing order of their connections and proceed with counting the triangles. We will also list the unique triangles found.

Triangles found:

<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [5]
