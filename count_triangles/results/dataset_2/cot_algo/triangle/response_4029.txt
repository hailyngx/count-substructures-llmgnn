Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: (0, 2), (0, 11), (0, 13), (0, 18), (0, 23), (1, 26), (2, 0), (2, 17), (2, 18), (2, 22), (2, 29), (3, 12), (3, 17), (3, 23), (4, 10), (4, 11), (4, 12), (4, 16), (4, 9), (5, 14), (5, 16), (5, 20), (6, 7), (6, 10), (7, 12), (7, 25), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 11), (8, 18), (8, 27), (9, 4), (9, 7), (10, 4), (10, 16), (10, 19), (10, 21), (11, 0), (11, 4), (11, 8), (11, 25), (11, 29), (12, 3), (12, 4), (12, 7), (13, 0), (13, 17), (13, 25), (14, 5), (14, 28), (15, 20), (15, 24), (15, 28), (16, 4), (16, 5), (16, 10), (16, 26), (17, 2), (17, 3), (17, 13), (18, 0), (18, 2), (18, 8), (18, 22), (18, 27), (19, 10), (20, 15), (20, 27), (20, 5), (21, 10), (22, 2), (22, 18), (23, 0), (23, 3), (23, 25), (24, 15), (25, 7), (25, 11), (25, 13), (25, 23), (26, 1), (26, 16), (27, 18), (27, 20), (27, 8), (28, 14), (28, 15), (29, 2), (29, 11)

After sorting nodes based on their degree (number of connections), we have the following order:

Nodes: 24, 19, 21, 26, 27, 28, 1, 3, 6, 9, 5, 14, 23, 13, 7, 12, 10, 8, 22, 17, 15, 16, 20, 25, 29, 18, 0, 2, 4, 11

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 12]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 18>
<0, 11, 25>
<0, 13, 17>
<0, 13, 23>
<2, 17, 29>
<2, 18, 22>
<4, 10, 16>
<4, 10, 21>
<4, 11, 25>
<5, 14, 28>
<7, 12, 25>
<8, 11, 27>
