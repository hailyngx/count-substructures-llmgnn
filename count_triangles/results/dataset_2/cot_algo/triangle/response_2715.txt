Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 8) (11, 13) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 13) (0, 9) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 2) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on the number of connections is as follows:
Nodes: 13, 4, 3, 2, 0, 11, 7, 5, 10, 9, 8, 6, 12, 1, 14

The triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 8, 14>
<1, 14, 5>
<1, 14, 7>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 13>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 14>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 14>

Total number of triangles: [12]
