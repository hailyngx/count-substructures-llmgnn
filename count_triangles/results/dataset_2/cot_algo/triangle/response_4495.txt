Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 10) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 0) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 4) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 
(3, 7, 10, 11, 2, 5, 8, 14, 6, 13, 4, 8, 1, 0, 9)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:

Triangles:
[496]
<1, 5, 9>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 1, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 9, 13>
<0, 4, 13>
<0, 9, 13>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 4, 13>
<1, 0, 5>
