Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 6) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the number of triangles in this graph efficiently. Let's start by sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 14: 4 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 11: 5 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 12: 6 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 10: 5 connections

Now, let's label the nodes according to their sorted order and list the unique triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 10>
<0, 1, 13>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 5, 13>
<1, 9, 14>
<3, 6, 10>
<3, 6, 13>
<3, 9, 2>
<3, 9, 11>
<5, 6, 13>
<5, 13, 10>
<6, 7, 12>
<9, 11, 14>
<10, 12, 6>

Total number of triangles: [16]
