Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 3) (0, 7) (0, 17) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 8) (15, 19) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 13) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 17) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 12) (8, 7) (8, 12) (3, 9) (3, 18) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 12) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 19) (17, 4) (17, 18) (17, 0) (17, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 17
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 14
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 12, 14, 17
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 18
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 17, 18, 19
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 11, 12
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 9, 16
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 8, 14, 19
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 12
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 14
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 16
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 8, 14
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 16, 19
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, 9, 12
- Node 15 is connected to node 19
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 6, 11, 13
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 18
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 17
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 13, 15

Next, we sort the nodes by their degree:

Nodes by degree in increasing order:
0, 15, 3, 8, 11, 5, 13, 2, 1, 12, 16, 17, 18, 6, 7, 9, 14, 19, 4

Now, we count the triangles using the degree-based ordering method:

Triangles: [139]

Unique triangles:
<3, 9, 4>
<12, 14, 2>
<1, 14, 9>
<16, 13, 1>
<6, 16, 9>
<7, 19, 14>
<13, 16, 1>
<4, 18, 17>
<12, 8, 2>
<16, 11, 5>
<12, 8, 7>
<1, 13, 19>
<12, 14, 1>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 18, 3>
<16, 11, 5>
<17, 18, 4>
<14, 12, 9>
<9, 1, 14>
<4, 17, 18>
<2, 14, 12>
<14, 7, 1>
<13, 19, 16>
<9, 14, 1>
<9, 6, 4>
<9, 3, 18>
<7, 19, 15>
<14, 2, 12>
<6, 9, 4>
<13, 16, 1>
<7, 14, 19>
<14, 1, 9>
<16, 1, 13>
<14, 9, 1>
<6, 4, 9>
<4, 3, 18>
<17, 4, 18>
<18, 17, 4>
<8, 12, 2>
<5, 11, 16>
<8, 12, 7>
<13, 1, 19>
<14, 12, 1>
<18, 4, 17>
<12, 2, 14>
<7, 1, 14>
<19, 13, 16>
<4, 9, 6>
<18, 17, 4>
