Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 9) (21, 20) (21, 12) (21, 5) (4, 7) (4, 22) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 29) (7, 24) (7, 19) (2, 29) (2, 6) (29, 7) (29, 2) (29, 9) (12, 21) (12, 27) (12, 14) (12, 15) (27, 12) (27, 25) (27, 24) (27, 5) (28, 22) (28, 13) (28, 5) (22, 4) (22, 28) (22, 26) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 8) (26, 0) (26, 17) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 19) (17, 26) (17, 20) (17, 13) (20, 21) (20, 17) (20, 6) (15, 12) (15, 14) (9, 1) (9, 29) (9, 0) (13, 28) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 24) (25, 27) (25, 0) (25, 14) (23, 26) (23, 24) (18, 8) (19, 7) (19, 11) (0, 26) (0, 9) (0, 25) (24, 7) (24, 27) (24, 13) (24, 23) (6, 2) (6, 20) (10, 1) (5, 1) (5, 21) (5, 27) (5, 28) (16, 3) (16, 14) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 25) (14, 16) (8, 26) (8, 3) (8, 18) 

Response:
The degrees of the 30 nodes in the given graph are as follows:

Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 6
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 1
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 15: degree 2
Node 16: degree 2
Node 17: degree 3
Node 18: degree 1
Node 19: degree 2
Node 20: degree 3
Node 21: degree 3
Node 22: degree 4
Node 23: degree 2
Node 24: degree 4
Node 25: degree 3
Node 26: degree 6
Node 27: degree 4
Node 28: degree 3
Node 29: degree 4

Based on the degrees, we will relabel the nodes from 0 to 29 as follows:
Node 0 (degree 4) -> Node 18
Node 1 (degree 3) -> Node 10
Node 2 (degree 2) -> Node 6
Node 3 (degree 4) -> Node 8
Node 4 (degree 2) -> Node 7
Node 5 (degree 4) -> Node 11
Node 6 (degree 2) -> Node 15
Node 7 (degree 6) -> Node 24
Node 8 (degree 3) -> Node 9
Node 9 (degree 3) -> Node 12
Node 10 (degree 1) -> Node 0
Node 11 (degree 3) -> Node 17
Node 12 (degree 4) -> Node 13
Node 13 (degree 4) -> Node 14
Node 14 (degree 4) -> Node 16
Node 15 (degree 2) -> Node 2
Node 16 (degree 2) -> Node 3
Node 17 (degree 3) -> Node 19
Node 18 (degree 1) -> Node 1
Node 19 (degree 2) -> Node 5
Node 20 (degree 3) -> Node 21
Node 21 (degree 3) -> Node 22
Node 22 (degree 4) -> Node 25
Node 23 (degree 2) -> Node 20
Node 24 (degree 4) -> Node 27
Node 25 (degree 3) -> Node 26
Node 26 (degree 6) -> Node 29
Node 27 (degree 4) -> Node 23
Node 28 (degree 3) -> Node 18
Node 29 (degree 4) -> Node 28

Now, let's count the number of triangles formed in the graph using this relabeling strategy. 

The total number of triangles is [42].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 5, 27>
<1, 5, 28>
<1, 9, 29>
<7, 19, 24>
<7, 24, 27>
<9, 1, 29>
<13, 14, 28>
<14, 15, 16>
<17, 13, 24>
<20, 17, 13>
<23, 24, 26>
<26, 17, 20>
