Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 2) (15, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 17) (17, 11) (17, 0) (17, 19) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 18) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 7) (18, 13) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 4) (8, 14) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 4) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 0) (16, 19) (5, 14) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 19) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 18) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Vertex degrees:
0: 5
1: 4
2: 4
3: 3
4: 4
5: 1
6: 4
7: 5
8: 1
9: 3
10: 2
11: 4
12: 3
13: 3
14: 3
15: 1
16: 1
17: 3
18: 4
19: 4

Sorted vertices: 5, 15, 8, 16, 10, 3, 9, 13, 17, 0, 11, 12, 4, 6, 1, 2, 7, 18, 14, 19

Triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 11]
<0, 9, 13>
<0, 7, 12>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 17, 19>
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 2, 18>
<1, 7, 12>
<4, 6, 13>
<7, 10, 11>
