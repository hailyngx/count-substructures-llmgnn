Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 4) (4, 0) (4, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 11) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 11), (5, 0), 
(9, 6), (9, 10), (9, 0), (9, 12), 
(6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 8), 
(2, 8), 
(8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 2), (8, 10), (8, 3), 
(0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 7), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 4), 
(7, 6), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 10), (7, 14), (7, 13), 
(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 14), (1, 10), (1, 12), 
(10, 9), (10, 8), (10, 0), (10, 7), (10, 1), (10, 13), 
(3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 12), 
(14, 7), (14, 1), (14, 4), 
(4, 0), (4, 14), 
(13, 7), (13, 10), (13, 11), 
(11, 5), (11, 0), (11, 13), (11, 12), 
(12, 9), (12, 1), (12, 3), (12, 11)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the nodes are sorted as follows:

Nodes: 2, 3, 4, 13, 14, 5, 6, 12, 9, 1, 11, 7, 10, 0, 8 

Now, we will count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 9]

Unique triangles:
<3, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 10>
<6, 8, 7>
<6, 8, 1>
<10, 0, 7>
<0, 5, 11>
<9, 6, 8>
<9, 10, 0>
<1, 5, 11>
