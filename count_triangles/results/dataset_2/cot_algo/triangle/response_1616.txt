Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 23) (21, 24) (21, 13) (21, 29) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 23) (6, 26) (9, 22) (9, 12) (14, 6) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 2) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 12) (13, 21) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 0) (2, 17) (2, 16) (18, 10) (18, 29) (7, 23) (7, 27) (12, 9) (12, 8) (24, 21) (24, 11) (24, 27) (22, 9) (22, 26) (22, 5) (26, 6) (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 15) (5, 13) (5, 22) (5, 10) (5, 20) (28, 1) (28, 26) (3, 0) (3, 19) (11, 14) (11, 24) (4, 13) (4, 27) (27, 7) (27, 24) (27, 4) (27, 16) (25, 17) (25, 29) (23, 1) (23, 6) (23, 7) (0, 13) (0, 3) (15, 26) (15, 19) (15, 29) (19, 14) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 16) (20, 5) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 5) (29, 21) (29, 8) (29, 18) (29, 25) (29, 15) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 27) (16, 19) 

Response:
The sorted vertices with their respective degrees are as follows:
(0, 2), (3, 2), (7, 2), (20, 2), (4, 3), (9, 3), (15, 3), (18, 3), (1, 4), (5, 4), (11, 4), (12, 4), (28, 4), (10, 4), (24, 4), (8, 4), (25, 4), (2, 4), (17, 4), (22, 4), (27, 4), (14, 5), (6, 5), (13, 5), (29, 5), (21, 6), (26, 6), (16, 4), (19, 4).

Now, we will count the triangles and find the unique triangles:
Total number of triangles: [29]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 13>, <12, 8, 14>, <4, 13, 27>, <14, 16, 19>, <5, 10, 22>, <14, 17, 25>, <6, 14, 17>, <5, 22, 26>, <14, 19, 27>, <8, 10, 18>, <8, 10, 5>, <2, 16, 27>, <13, 21, 29>, <5, 13, 22>, <8, 12, 29>, <7, 23, 6>, <2, 17, 25>, <4, 27, 16>, <0, 13, 29>, <15, 19, 14>, <19, 15, 29>, <23, 1, 6>, <16, 14, 19>, <13, 8, 21>, <16, 14, 26>, <11, 14, 24>, <24, 11, 27>, <16, 19, 3>, <27, 24, 11>.
