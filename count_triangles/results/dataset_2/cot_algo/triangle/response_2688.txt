Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (13, 20) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 15) (22, 1) (9, 26) (26, 9) (26, 12) (6, 13) (6, 1) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 5) (21, 13) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 4) (21, 2) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 28) (18, 17) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 12) (23, 4) (23, 24) (23, 27) (28, 21) (28, 18) (28, 27) (29, 8) (29, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 24) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 10) (19, 18) (19, 20) (1, 22) (1, 6) (1, 10) (15, 22) (15, 16) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 15) (17, 18) (17, 3) (3, 17) (3, 12) (25, 24) (25, 2) (24, 23) (24, 0) (24, 25) (24, 2) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 1) (12, 26) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11) (20, 13) (20, 19) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 27) (4, 21) (4, 23) (4, 29) (27, 23) (27, 28) (27, 11) (2, 21) (2, 25) (2, 24) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps identify triangles in the graph efficiently. 

After sorting the nodes by their degree from the least connected to the most connected, the new node labels are as follows:
Nodes: 25, 26, 29, 5, 10, 16, 17, 3, 10, 18, 19, 7, 4, 21, 11, 15, 20, 12, 22, 2, 14, 24, 6, 1, 8, 13, 23, 27, 0, and 28.

Next, we can count the triangles and list them:
