Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 7) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 1) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 4) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 4) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) 

Response:
The graph with nodes and edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (10, 12), (10, 4), (12, 7), (12, 14), (2, 4), (4, 9)
- 1: (7, 9), (7, 11), (7, 1), (1, 9)
- 2: (7, 12), (7, 2), (2, 8), (8, 6), (4, 2), (2, 10)
- 3: (4, 14), (6, 3), (3, 14), (4, 3)
- 4: (14, 3), (14, 4), (14, 10), (10, 4), (12, 0), (2, 4), (4, 6), (6, 5), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 9)
- 5: (10, 5), (5, 13), (11, 5), (5, 6), (5, 10)
- 6: (8, 6), (14, 3), (6, 4), (3, 6), (6, 5)
- 7: (12, 7), (7, 2), (2, 7), (7, 1), (7, 9)
- 8: (13, 8), (8, 2), (8, 9), (2, 8), (8, 6)
- 9: (13, 9), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 8), (4, 9)
- 10: (10, 12), (10, 14), (0, 10), (2, 10), (10, 5)
- 11: (1, 11), (11, 5)
- 12: (12, 14), (12, 0), (12, 7), (10, 12), (12, 13)
- 13: (8, 13), (13, 5), (13, 9), (13, 12)
- 14: (12, 14), (14, 4), (14, 3), (14, 10)

By applying Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by the number of connections (degree):
3, 11, 1, 13, 0, 7, 9, 6, 8, 2, 14, 12, 5, 10, 4

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [12].

The unique triangles found are:
<7, 2, 14>
<7, 2, 4>
<7, 2, 12>
<7, 2, 10>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 6, 3>
<4, 6, 0>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 5, 10>
<3, 14, 4>
<14, 10, 12>
<14, 10, 4>
