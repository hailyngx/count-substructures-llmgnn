Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 10) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 10) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 1) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 4) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 1) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 10) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. The sorted vertices with their connection counts are:
- Node 11: 1 connection
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Nodes 6, 12, 2, 8: 3 connections each
- Nodes 3, 10, 14, 7: 4 connections each
- Nodes 1, 4, 9, 13, 5: 6 connections each

Now, we can start counting the triangles by examining each edge. We will only consider an edge if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

After analyzing the edges based on the criteria mentioned above, we count a total of 16 triangles. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [16], and the unique triangles found are:
<3, 5, 12>
<0, 1, 14>
<0, 6, 14>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 10, 12>
<1, 4, 13>
<1, 11, 13>
<4, 9, 13>
<5, 7, 13>
<7, 10, 12>
<7, 10, 3>
<9, 11, 13>
<9, 14, 0>
<9, 14, 1>
<10, 12, 3>
