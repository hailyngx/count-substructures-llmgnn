Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 6) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 14) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 11) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 1) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 1) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 11) (3, 4) (3, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 14) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices from least to most connected is as follows:
Vertices: 5, 8, 3, 1, 7, 12, 2, 0, 6, 14, 13, 11, 9, 10, 4

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph by examining the edges. 

Total number of triangles: [15]
