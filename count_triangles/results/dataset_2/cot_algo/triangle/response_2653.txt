Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 6) 

Response:
Let's represent the given graph as below:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (5), (8), (3)
- 1: (5), (4), (8), (6)
- 2: (8), (6), (3)
- 3: (5), (9), (7), (2), (0), (6)
- 4: (5), (8), (1), (6)
- 5: (9), (1), (4), (0), (3)
- 6: (4), (2), (1), (3)
- 7: (9), (3)
- 8: (9), (4), (2), (0), (1)
- 9: (5), (8), (3), (7)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Ordered nodes by degree:
Label 0: 1 connection
Label 7: 1 connection
Label 2: 2 connections
Label 6: 2 connections
Label 4: 2 connections
Label 1: 3 connections
Label 9: 4 connections
Label 8: 5 connections
Label 3: 6 connections
Label 5: 5 connections

Now, we will list the edges based on lower labeled vertices having fewer connections:

Edges to consider:
- (0, 5)
- (0, 8)
- (0, 3)
- (1, 4)
- (1, 6)
- (2, 8)
- (2, 6)
- (2, 3)
- (4, 5)
- (4, 8)
- (4, 6)
- (5, 9)
- (6, 2)
- (6, 3)
- (7, 9)
- (8, 9)

Now, let's count the number of triangles formed by the shared connections:

[Total number of triangles: 3]
Unique triangles: <0, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>
