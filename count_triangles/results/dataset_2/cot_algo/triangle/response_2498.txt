Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 26) (15, 0) (27, 10) (27, 2) (27, 5) (3, 28) (3, 7) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 4) (23, 29) (10, 27) (17, 1) (17, 4) (0, 15) (0, 20) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 9) (9, 22) (9, 20) (9, 28) (26, 15) (26, 20) (26, 8) (26, 12) (28, 3) (28, 9) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 7) (6, 21) (6, 29) (6, 12) (6, 19) (21, 6) (21, 16) (21, 2) (21, 24) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (16, 21) (16, 4) (16, 5) (2, 27) (2, 21) (2, 7) (2, 5) (5, 27) (5, 16) (5, 2) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 25) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 24) (19, 13) (14, 12) (25, 22) (25, 11) (18, 23) (18, 13) (18, 8) (29, 23) (29, 6) (29, 4) (12, 26) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 18) (13, 12) (4, 23) (4, 17) (4, 16) (4, 29) (4, 24) (24, 21) (24, 19) (24, 4) (8, 26) (8, 18) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections they have. Let's first construct the graph:

- Node 0 connects to nodes: 15, 20
- Node 1 connects to nodes: 15, 17, 7
- Node 2 connects to nodes: 27, 21, 7, 5
- Node 3 connects to nodes: 28, 7
- Node 4 connects to nodes: 23, 17, 16, 29, 24
- Node 5 connects to nodes: 27, 16, 2
- Node 6 connects to nodes: 21, 29, 12, 19
- Node 7 connects to nodes: 3, 1, 2
- Node 8 connects to nodes: 26, 18
- Node 9 connects to nodes: 22, 20, 28
- Node 10 connects to nodes: 27
- Node 11 connects to nodes: 19, 25, 13
- Node 12 connects to nodes: 26, 6, 14, 13
- Node 13 connects to nodes: 11, 19, 18, 12
- Node 14 connects to nodes: 12
- Node 15 connects to nodes: 1, 26, 0
- Node 16 connects to nodes: 21, 5, 4
- Node 17 connects to nodes: 1, 4
- Node 18 connects to nodes: 23, 13, 8
- Node 19 connects to nodes: 6, 11, 24, 13
- Node 20 connects to nodes: 0, 26, 9
- Node 21 connects to nodes: 6, 16, 2, 24
- Node 22 connects to nodes: 23, 9, 25
- Node 23 connects to nodes: 22, 18, 4, 29
- Node 24 connects to nodes: 21, 19, 4
- Node 25 connects to nodes: 22, 11
- Node 26 connects to nodes: 15, 20, 8, 12
- Node 27 connects to nodes: 10, 2, 5
- Node 28 connects to nodes: 3, 9
- Node 29 connects to nodes: 23, 6, 4

Based on the degree-based ordering, the vertices are labeled as follows:
0(2), 10(1), 14(1), 15(3), 17(2), 18(3), 3(2), 27(3), 28(3), 29(3), 4(5), 9(3), 11(3), 12(4), 13(4), 16(3), 1(3), 19(4), 2(4), 20(3), 21(4), 22(3), 23(4), 24(3), 25(2), 26(4), 5(3), 6(4), 7(3), 8(2)
