Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 9) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 5) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 5) (3, 17) (11, 19) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 13) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 14) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 6) (19, 11) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 16) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 2) (14, 13) (14, 8) (14, 12) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 16) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 2) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 16) (18, 6) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 2) (16, 9) 

Response:
Nodes with their corresponding connections in the same order as in the input:

(0) - [12, 2, 9]  
(1) - [17, 6, 5]  
(2) - [19, 6, 5, 0, 16]  
(3) - [17]  
(4) - [7, 12, 16]  
(5) - [1, 17, 2]  
(6) - [1, 8, 18, 2]  
(7) - [4, 9]  
(8) - [19, 14, 6]  
(9) - [7, 15, 13, 0, 16]  
(10) - [15, 19]  
(11) - [19]  
(12) - [4, 14, 0]  
(13) - [17, 15, 14]  
(14) - [13, 8, 12]  
(15) - [10, 9, 13]  
(16) - [4, 19, 2, 9]
