Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows: 

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29
- Edges: (0, 15), (0, 14), (0, 21), (0, 8), (1, 3), (1, 12), (2, 3), (2, 18), (2, 16), (2, 28), (3, 2), (3, 9), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 9), (4, 13), (5, 11), (5, 28), (5, 20), (6, 7), (6, 4), (7, 15), (7, 17), (7, 22), (7, 6), (8, 18), (8, 0), (8, 12), (9, 3), (9, 4), (10, 23), (10, 25), (10, 29), (11, 5), (11, 23), (12, 1), (12, 8), (12, 20), (13, 25), (13, 20), (13, 4), (14, 18), (14, 0), (14, 23), (15, 7), (15, 0), (15, 29), (16, 2), (16, 28), (16, 19), (17, 21), (17, 7), (18, 2), (18, 26), (18, 14), (18, 8), (19, 16), (20, 5), (20, 24), (20, 12), (20, 13), (21, 17), (21, 0), (21, 26), (22, 27), (22, 7), (22, 25), (23, 10), (23, 14), (23, 28), (23, 11), (24, 26), (24, 20), (25, 10), (25, 22), (25, 13), (26, 27), (26, 18), (26, 21), (26, 24), (27, 22), (27, 26), (28, 2), (28, 5), (28, 16), (28, 23), (29, 15), (29, 10)

To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degrees from least to most. The sorted order is as follows: 

Vertices: 19, 24, 13, 11, 6, 9, 12, 16, 17, 26, 27, 5, 1, 25, 3, 4, 18, 8, 22, 20, 7, 0, 14, 2, 21, 28, 10, 23, 15, 29

Now, we can count the number of triangles and list the unique triangles found: 

Total number of triangles: [15]
Unique triangles: <0, 8, 12>, <4, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 2>, <7, 15, 21>, <20, 24, 26>, <5, 11, 28>, <10, 23, 25>, <13, 20, 4>, <14, 18, 0>, <16, 19, 28>, <17, 21, 0>, <18, 2, 14>, <22, 25, 7>, <22, 27, 26>, <26, 21, 7>
