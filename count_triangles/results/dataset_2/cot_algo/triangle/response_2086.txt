Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 10) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 12) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 11) (5, 12) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method steps are as follows:

Step 1: Sort the vertices based on the number of connections.

Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 14: 5 connections
Vertex 5: 5 connections
Vertex 10: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 6 connections
Vertex 4: 6 connections
Vertex 12: 6 connections
Vertex 11: 6 connections
Vertex 6: 6 connections
Vertex 13: 6 connections
Vertex 9: 7 connections

Ordering the vertices from least to most connected:
1 < 2 < 7 < 14 < 0 < 3 < 5 < 10 < 4 < 6 < 12 < 11 < 8 < 13 < 9

Step 2: Relabel the vertices based on the sorted order:
Vertex 1 -> 0
Vertex 2 -> 1
Vertex 7 -> 2
Vertex 14 -> 3
Vertex 0 -> 4
Vertex 3 -> 5
Vertex 5 -> 6
Vertex 10 -> 7
Vertex 4 -> 8
Vertex 6 -> 9
Vertex 12 -> 10
Vertex 11 -> 11
Vertex 8 -> 12
Vertex 13 -> 13
Vertex 9 -> 14

Step 3: Count the triangles:
Triangles: [32]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 14>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 11>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 5, 11>, <0, 5, 12>, <0, 10, 14>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 11>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 14, 9>, <2, 1, 6>, <5, 3, 4>, <5, 3, 11>, <5, 3, 12>, <10, 7, 14>, <4, 3, 11>, <4, 3, 12>, <4, 3, 5>, <4, 10, 13>, <4, 12, 13>, <4, 12, 5>, <7, 8, 11>, <2, 12, 13>, <5, 13, 12>
