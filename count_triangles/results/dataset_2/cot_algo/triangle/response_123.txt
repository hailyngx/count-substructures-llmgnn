Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 0) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (12, 5) (12, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 14) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 12: Degree 2
Vertex 9: Degree 2
Vertex 0: Degree 4
Vertex 5: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 4
Vertex 7: Degree 4
Vertex 2: Degree 3
Vertex 6: Degree 5
Vertex 10: Degree 4
Vertex 13: Degree 3
Vertex 11: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 5
Vertex 4: Degree 4
Vertex 1: Degree 5
Vertex 14: Degree 6

Now, we will label the vertices from 0 to 14 based on their degrees:

Vertex 12: 0
Vertex 9: 1
Vertex 0: 2
Vertex 5: 3
Vertex 8: 4
Vertex 7: 5
Vertex 2: 6
Vertex 6: 7
Vertex 10: 8
Vertex 13: 9
Vertex 11: 10
Vertex 3: 11
Vertex 4: 12
Vertex 1: 13
Vertex 14: 14

Now, we will look at each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections to count triangles:

(1, 3): shared connection with 11 forms triangle <1, 3, 11>
(1, 11): no triangles
(1, 14): no triangles
(1, 13): no triangles
(1, 4): shared connection with 11 forms triangle <1, 4, 11>
(3, 1): shared connection with 11 forms triangle <3, 1, 11>
(3, 0): shared connection with 6 forms triangle <3, 0, 6>
(3, 14): shared connection with 10 forms triangle <3, 14, 10>
(3, 6): shared connection with 5 forms triangle <3, 6, 5>
(3, 5): shared connection with 6 forms triangle <3, 5, 6>
(10, 7): shared connection with 8 forms triangle <10, 7, 8>
(10, 2): shared connection with 13 forms triangle <10, 2, 13>
(10, 9): shared connection with 14 forms triangle <10, 9, 14>
(10, 14): no triangles
(11, 13): no triangles
(11, 6): shared connection with 4 forms triangle <11, 6, 4>
(11, 8): shared connection with 4 forms triangle <11, 8, 4>
(8, 14): no triangles
(8, 7): shared connection with 5 forms triangle <8, 7, 5>
(13, 2): shared connection with 4 forms triangle <13, 2, 4>
(4, 8): no triangles
(4, 2): shared connection with 6 forms triangle <4, 2, 6>
(5, 0): shared connection with 6 forms triangle <5, 0, 6>
(5, 7): no triangles
(5, 12): no triangles
(6, 11): shared connection with 4 forms triangle <6, 11, 4>
(6, 5): shared connection with 0 forms triangle <6, 5, 0>
(0, 5): shared connection with 6 forms triangle <0, 5, 6>
(0, 6): no triangles
(14, 1): no triangles
(14, 3): shared connection with 10 forms triangle <14, 3, 10>
(14, 8): no triangles
(14, 0): no triangles
(14, 9): no triangles
(9, 10): shared connection with 12 forms triangle <9, 10, 12>
(9, 12): no triangles
(9, 14): no triangles
(2, 13): no triangles
(2, 4): shared connection with 6 forms triangle <2, 4, 6>

There are 13 triangles in total as follows:
<1, 3, 11>, <1, 4, 11>, <3, 0, 6>, <3, 5, 6>, <10, 7, 8>, <10, 2, 13>, <10, 9, 14>, <11, 6, 4>, <11, 8, 4>, <8, 7, 5>, <13, 2, 4>, <4, 2, 6>, <9, 10, 12>

Therefore, there are [13] triangles in the given graph.
