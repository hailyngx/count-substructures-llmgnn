Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degree is: 

1. Node 1: Connections - 2
2. Node 8: Connections - 3
3. Node 3: Connections - 3
4. Node 2: Connections - 4
5. Node 4: Connections - 5
6. Node 7: Connections - 5
7. Node 9: Connections - 5
8. Node 6: Connections - 5
9. Node 0: Connections - 6
10. Node 5: Connections - 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in a way that the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

Now, counting the triangles:

The total number of triangles is [12].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>.
