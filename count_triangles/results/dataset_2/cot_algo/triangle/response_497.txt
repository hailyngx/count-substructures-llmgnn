Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 9), (6, 9), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 2)  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:  
Nodes by degree: 0 (3), 2 (3), 6 (3), 8 (3), 5 (3), 7 (4), 9 (5), 1 (6), 3 (6), 4 (6)

Triangles from shared connections:
- Triangle <3, 4, 7>
- Triangle <1, 3, 5>
- Triangle <1, 4, 9>
- Triangle <1, 2, 8>

Total number of triangles: [4]
