Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently in the given graph. 
First, we need to find the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 6
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, we can relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Node 2 (degree 3)
- Node 5 (degree 3)
- Node 6 (degree 4)
- Node 8 (degree 4)
- Node 9 (degree 4)
- Node 0 (degree 4)
- Node 4 (degree 4)
- Node 1 (degree 5)
- Node 7 (degree 5)
- Node 3 (degree 6)

Next, we examine all edges and count the triangles formed by the shared connections of the vertices with lower labels.
After analyzing the graph, we find that there are a total of 7 triangles. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 3>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 3>, <4, 7, 6>, <4, 7, 3>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
