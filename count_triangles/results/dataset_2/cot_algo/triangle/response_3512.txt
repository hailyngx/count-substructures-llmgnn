Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 10) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed. Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 6
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 6
Node 11: Degree 5
Node 14: Degree 5
Node 10: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 5

Triangles found: <9, 4, 2>, <9, 4, 7>, <9, 4, 0>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 7, 3>, <4, 7, 14>, <4, 2, 12>, <7, 0, 11>, <1, 6, 10>, <1, 6, 13>, <3, 6, 13>, <2, 12, 8>, <11, 12, 8>, <14, 12, 8>, <14, 12, 11>

Total number of triangles: [15]
