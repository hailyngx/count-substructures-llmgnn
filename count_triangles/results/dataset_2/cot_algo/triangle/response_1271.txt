Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 4) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 19) (4, 15) (4, 0) (4, 16) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 13) (2, 10) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 18) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 18) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 8) (11, 0) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 2) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 0) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 12) (19, 9) (19, 17) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 6) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 1) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of their connections and then relabeling them accordingly. Here is the list of vertices in ascending order of their connections:

Vertices: (3) (15) (5) (9) (4) (7) (2) (8) (0) (13) (1) (17) (16) (6) (19) (12) (18) (10) (11)

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

[Total number of triangles: 9]

Unique triangles found:
<3, 15, 17>
<3, 4, 15>
<3, 9, 17>
<5, 9, 13>
<5, 9, 18>
<5, 13, 7>
<0, 4, 16>
<0, 11, 16>
<9, 13, 7>
