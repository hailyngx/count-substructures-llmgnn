Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 5) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Edges: (0, 11), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 10), (0, 13), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 11), (1, 14), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 14), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 11), (3, 14), (4, 5), (4, 12), (4, 0), (5, 8), (5, 11), (5, 14), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 13), (6, 1), (6, 3), (7, 0), (7, 14), (8, 5), (8, 10), (8, 3), (9, 2), (9, 12), (9, 6), (10, 8), (10, 0), (10, 13), (10, 14), (11, 5), (11, 13), (11, 0), (11, 3), (11, 1), (12, 4), (12, 9), (13, 6), (13, 10), (13, 0), (13, 11), (14, 5), (14, 2), (14, 7), (14, 10), (14, 1), (14, 3)

To count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, we proceed with counting the triangles based on the method described earlier.

After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new ordering is:
Nodes: {7, 12, 9, 2, 4, 10, 8, 5, 14, 1, 3, 13, 6, 11, 0}

Based on this new ordering, the triangles found in the graph are:
[Total number of triangles: 14]
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 14>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 11>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 7, 14>, <0, 10, 13>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 6, 14>, <2, 5, 14>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 8, 5>, <5, 11, 14>
