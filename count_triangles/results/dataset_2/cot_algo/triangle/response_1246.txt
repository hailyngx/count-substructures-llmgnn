Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 25) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 15) (3, 29) (25, 11) (25, 6) (25, 8) (8, 16) (8, 25) (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 20) (13, 28) (12, 1) (12, 26) (27, 10) (27, 28) (2, 13) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 21) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 17) (1, 12) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 28) (26, 12) (26, 1) (26, 20) (26, 29) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 20) (20, 13) (20, 26) (20, 17) (4, 14) (4, 21) (29, 3) (29, 26) (29, 22) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 24) (23, 19) (5, 18) (5, 10) (19, 23) (19, 0) (6, 25) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 16) (9, 15) (21, 13) (21, 2) (21, 4) (21, 22) (14, 4) (14, 23) (14, 22) (14, 7) (22, 29) (22, 21) (22, 14) (22, 15) (24, 23) (24, 0) (0, 19) (0, 6) (0, 24) (0, 15) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 22) (15, 0) (7, 14) (10, 27) (10, 2) (10, 5) (28, 13) (28, 27) (28, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Let's construct the list with the degrees of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 2
- Node 20: degree 3
- Node 21: degree 4
- Node 22: degree 4
- Node 23: degree 4
- Node 24: degree 2
- Node 25: degree 3
- Node 26: degree 4
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 29: degree 3

According to the Degree-Based Ordering, we sort the nodes as follows:
7, 3, 5, 9, 18, 25, 24, 19, 26, 27, 10, 4, 14, 6, 0, 8, 12, 16, 20, 29, 1, 28, 13, 21, 2, 17, 22, 15, 11, 23

Next, we proceed with counting the triangles considering the edges that satisfy the condition mentioned earlier. After counting, we find that there are 28 triangles. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [28], and the unique triangles found are: 
<2, 17, 18>, <1, 12, 26>, <10, 2, 13>, <10, 2, 17>, <10, 5, 18>, <14, 22, 29>, <14, 22, 7>, <14, 4, 21>, <14, 4, 22>, <15, 0, 19>, <15, 0, 24>, <15, 0, 6>, <15, 9, 16>, <16, 15, 22>, <16, 15, 9>, <16, 17, 20>, <16, 17, 2>, <16, 17, 18>, <16, 8, 25>, <2, 17, 20>, <20, 17, 13>, <20, 17, 26>, <20, 13, 21>, <22, 14, 7>, <22, 14, 21>, <22, 21, 4>, <23, 11, 25>.
