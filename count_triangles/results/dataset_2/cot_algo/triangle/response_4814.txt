Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (2, 9) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 8) (8, 18) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 5) (1, 0) (1, 16) (1, 5) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 4) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 13) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 19) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 17) (4, 12) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 15) (7, 16) (7, 5) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 15) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 16) (15, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 16) (5, 14) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 15) (19, 14) (19, 13) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their connections sorted by node number:

Node 0: 1, 4, 14
Node 1: 0, 5, 16
Node 2: 9, 18
Node 3: 10, 11
Node 4: 0, 9, 12, 17
Node 5: 1, 7, 14, 15
Node 6: 9, 10
Node 7: 5, 16
Node 8: 11, 18
Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 14
Node 10: 3, 6, 16
Node 11: 3, 8, 13
Node 12: 4, 15, 17
Node 13: 11, 17, 19
Node 14: 0, 5, 9, 19
Node 15: 5, 12, 16, 18
Node 16: 1, 7, 10, 15
Node 17: 4, 12, 13
Node 18: 2, 8, 15
Node 19: 13, 14

We will now count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 27]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 4, 14>
<0, 5, 14>
<1, 5, 16>
<4, 9, 14>
