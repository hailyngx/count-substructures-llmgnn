Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 7) (10, 13) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (20, 4) (21, 16) (21, 26) (21, 11) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 5) (26, 22) (26, 21) (26, 7) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 12) (7, 13) (7, 22) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 26) (3, 28) (3, 23) (8, 19) (9, 17) (9, 23) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 15) (27, 25) (27, 29) (27, 23) (16, 21) (16, 14) (5, 28) (5, 1) (5, 14) (29, 25) (29, 27) (29, 6) (29, 4) (29, 18) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 29) (14, 28) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 24) (15, 25) (15, 23) (15, 11) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 19) (23, 3) (23, 9) (23, 27) (23, 15) (2, 24) (4, 20) (4, 19) (4, 29) (4, 24) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 18) (11, 21) (11, 15) (24, 14) (24, 2) (24, 4) (18, 29) (18, 1) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections or edges each vertex has. Then, for each edge, we only consider it if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we relabel them accordingly:

Vertex 0: degree 4
Vertex 1: degree 3
Vertex 2: degree 1
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 5: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 4
Vertex 7: degree 5
Vertex 8: degree 1
Vertex 9: degree 3
Vertex 10: degree 5
Vertex 11: degree 2
Vertex 12: degree 3
Vertex 13: degree 5
Vertex 14: degree 4
Vertex 15: degree 3
Vertex 16: degree 2
Vertex 17: degree 3
Vertex 18: degree 2
Vertex 19: degree 3
Vertex 20: degree 1
Vertex 21: degree 3
Vertex 22: degree 3
Vertex 23: degree 4
Vertex 24: degree 3
Vertex 25: degree 3
Vertex 26: degree 3
Vertex 27: degree 3
Vertex 28: degree 3
Vertex 29: degree 5

Based on the sorted labels, we will now check for triangles. The triangles found are:

<0, 6, 10>
<0, 4, 29>
<0, 7, 13>
<1, 5, 14>
<1, 18, 29>
<2, 4, 24>
<3, 9, 23>
<3, 14, 28>
<4, 19, 29>
<5, 14, 28>
<6, 10, 29>
<7, 13, 22>
<9, 17, 23>
<10, 12, 17>
<14, 16, 21>
<15, 11, 21>
<15, 23, 27>
<18, 1, 29>
<19, 4, 24>
<22, 7, 26>

Therefore, there are a total of [20] triangles in the given graph.
