Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (6, 2), (2, 6)
- 1: (4, 1), (1, 3), (1, 6)
- 2: (4, 2), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 0), (0, 2)
- 3: (9, 3), (4, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)
- 4: (9, 4), (7, 4), (4, 8), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 2)
- 5: (9, 5), (8, 5), (6, 5), (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 7)
- 6: (5, 6), (7, 6), (1, 6), (8, 6), (6, 2), (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 0), (0, 6)
- 7: (5, 7), (9, 7), (4, 7), (7, 6)
- 8: (5, 8), (8, 4), (8, 6)
- 9: (5, 9), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 7)

Now, we will label the nodes based on their degree:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 6
Node 5: Degree 7
Node 6: Degree 10
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges and count the triangles:

Triangles: [<1, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 6>]

Total number of triangles: [2]
