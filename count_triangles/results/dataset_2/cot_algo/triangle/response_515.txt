Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 15) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 8) (15, 6) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 16) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 7) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 1) (12, 17) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 19) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 14) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 14) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 19) (2, 19) (2, 14) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 2) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 16) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 2) (10, 4) (18, 0) (0, 1) (0, 18) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: [(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 11), (9, 8), (9, 17), (6, 14), (6, 15), (3, 15), (3, 11), (3, 17), (3, 8), (15, 13), (15, 16), (1, 16), (1, 0), (1, 7), (4, 10), (4, 11), (7, 1), (12, 17), (13, 19), (11, 14), (8, 14), (16, 19), (2, 19), (2, 14), (17, 12), (18, 0)]

Next, let's find the degree of each node:
Node 0: 3
Node 1: 3
Node 2: 2
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 3
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 3
Node 7: 2
Node 8: 3
Node 9: 4
Node 10: 1
Node 11: 4
Node 12: 2
Node 13: 3
Node 14: 4
Node 15: 4
Node 16: 4
Node 17: 4
Node 18: 1
Node 19: 4

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes labeled in increasing order of degree: [10, 18, 2, 7, 12, 0, 1, 4, 6, 13, 8, 3, 14, 5, 15, 16, 17, 9, 11, 19]

Now, we will count the triangles:
[12 triangles]

Unique triangles:
<4, 11, 14>
<0, 1, 16>
<5, 6, 15>
<5, 9, 17>
<13, 15, 19>
<3, 8, 15>
<8, 9, 17>
<13, 15, 16>
<1, 16, 19>
<5, 11, 13>
<14, 16, 19>
<3, 11, 15>
