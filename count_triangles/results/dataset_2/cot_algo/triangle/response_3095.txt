Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. 
Here are the steps followed to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Sort the vertices by their degrees (number of connections):
   Node 1: degree 2
   Node 3: degree 2
   Node 5: degree 2
   Node 8: degree 2
   Node 0: degree 3
   Node 7: degree 5
   Node 4: degree 5
   Node 6: degree 5
   Node 2: degree 5
   Node 9: degree 6

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degrees in increasing order:
   Node 1: degree 2 -> L1
   Node 3: degree 2 -> L2
   Node 5: degree 2 -> L3
   Node 8: degree 2 -> L4
   Node 0: degree 3 -> L5
   Node 7: degree 5 -> L6
   Node 4: degree 5 -> L7
   Node 6: degree 5 -> L8
   Node 2: degree 5 -> L9
   Node 9: degree 6 -> L10

3. Make use of the sorted list of vertices to find triangles:
   - For each edge, only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found: 
<5, 9, 2>
<5, 9, 7>
<5, 9, 0>
<5, 2, 7>
<5, 2, 6>
<5, 2, 4>
<9, 2, 7>
<9, 2, 6>
<9, 2, 4>
<9, 7, 4>
<9, 7, 6>
<9, 0, 4>
<4, 7, 6>
<4, 7, 0>
<4, 7, 2>
<7, 0, 2>

Total number of triangles: [16]
