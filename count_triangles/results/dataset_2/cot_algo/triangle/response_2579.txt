Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 10) (13, 10) (13, 11) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps us efficiently count the number of triangles in this graph. 
Let's relabel the vertices based on their degrees: 

Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 5
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 6
Node 9: degree 5
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 5
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 2
Node 14: degree 4

Now, for each edge, we will only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This way, we ensure to count each triangle only once.

Checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge, we find the following unique triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 40]
