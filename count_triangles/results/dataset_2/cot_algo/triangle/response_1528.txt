Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 22) (18, 22) (18, 7) (22, 16) (22, 18) (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 12) (25, 20) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 29) (25, 0) (3, 25) (3, 6) (23, 1) (23, 21) (10, 11) (10, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 28) (5, 14) (17, 20) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 7) (0, 25) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 21) (7, 18) (7, 17) (7, 0) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 28) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 29) (9, 24) (9, 1) (29, 11) (29, 25) (29, 9) (29, 4) (26, 6) (26, 27) (26, 4) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 9) (6, 3) (6, 26) (6, 27) (12, 16) (12, 20) (12, 8) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 24) (15, 28) (21, 23) (21, 0) (24, 17) (24, 9) (24, 15) (28, 5) (28, 19) (28, 15) (27, 17) (27, 26) (27, 6) (14, 5) (14, 15) (4, 2) (4, 29) (4, 26) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method works as follows:
1. We sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:  
Node 13: degree 0  
Node 30: degree 0  
Nodes 7, 13, 30: degree 0  
Nodes 2, 5, 6, 13, 23, 28, 30: degree 1  
Nodes 1, 3, 4, 7, 13, 15, 19, 21, 24, 26, 27, 30: degree 2  
Nodes 0, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 22, 25, 29: degree 3  
Nodes 9, 11, 16, 17, 20: degree 4  

2. Next, we renumber the nodes based on their degrees from lowest to highest degree:  
Nodes with degree 0: {1, 2, 3}  
Nodes with degree 1: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}  
Nodes with degree 2: {10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}  
Nodes with degree 3: {21, 22, 23, 24, 25}  
Nodes with degree 4: {26, 27, 28, 29, 30}  

3. Now, we go through the list of edges, and for each edge, we only consider it if the node with the lower label has fewer connections. This way, we ensure that we count each triangle only once.

After determining the triangles, the total number of triangles formed in the graph is [21].  

The unique triangles found in the graph are:  
<1, 2, 3>  
<1, 7, 21>  
<1, 9, 25>  
<1, 15, 24>  
<2, 5, 6>  
<2, 10, 11>  
<2, 11, 16>  
<2, 11, 29>  
<2, 22, 23>  
<3, 6, 26>  
<4, 9, 24>  
<5, 10, 11>  
<5, 10, 15>  
<5, 14, 28>  
<6, 26, 27>  
<7, 8, 12>  
<7, 17, 27>  
<9, 24, 29>  
<10, 15, 19>  
<11, 16, 22>  
<20, 22, 25>
