Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 6) (2, 18) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 5) (12, 5) (12, 9) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 17) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 17) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 5) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 4) (1, 11) (1, 5) (19, 11) (19, 14) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 12) (9, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 14) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 1) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 6) (4, 15) (15, 4) (15, 14) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 15) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph can be represented as follows:

0 - connections: 3
1 - connections: 2
2 - connections: 2
3 - connections: 4
4 - connections: 4
5 - connections: 4
6 - connections: 3
7 - connections: 3
8 - connections: 2
9 - connections: 2
10 - connections: 2
11 - connections: 6
12 - connections: 2
13 - connections: 3
14 - connections: 4
15 - connections: 2
16 - connections: 3
17 - connections: 5
18 - connections: 2
19 - connections: 2

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges starting from the vertices with lower labels and fewer connections. 

Calculating the number of triangles:
- For edge (8, 13): No triangles.
- For edge (8, 16): No triangles.
- For edge (8, 17): No triangles.
- For edge (13, 3): No triangles.
- For edge (10, 11): No triangles.
- For edge (10, 4): No triangles.
- For edge (2, 18): No triangles.
- For edge (12, 5): No triangles.
- For edge (3, 7): No triangles.
- For edge (3, 0): No triangles.
- For edge (17, 4): No triangles.
- For edge (1, 5): No triangles.
- For edge (19, 14): No triangles.
- For edge (6, 11): No triangles.
- For edge (9, 12): No triangles.
- For edge (16, 14): No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
