Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (2, 14) (2, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 0) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 0) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 14) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: (5, 9), (5, 12), (5, 4), (5, 14), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 11), (9, 10), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 4), (1, 3), (1, 11), (1, 13), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 11), (3, 7), (3, 8), (8, 6), (8, 3), (8, 13), (8, 12), (13, 1), (13, 8), (13, 12), (13, 4), (13, 7), (2, 14), (2, 11), (0, 7), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 4), (14, 5), (14, 2), (14, 7), (14, 12), (11, 9), (11, 1), (11, 3), (11, 2), (11, 0), (7, 3), (7, 13), (7, 0), (7, 14), (10, 9), (10, 6), (10, 0), (12, 5), (12, 8), (12, 13), (12, 14), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 13), (4, 0)

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Nodes: 2, 1, 10, 14, 12, 11, 9, 0, 7, 8, 13, 3, 6, 4, 5

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

There are 16 triangles present in the graph:
[<1, 3, 13>, <1, 3, 11>, <1, 11, 13>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 11>, <3, 7, 13>, <4, 5, 12>, <4, 13, 7>, <4, 13, 12>, <5, 9, 14>, <6, 9, 10>, <6, 9, 11>, <6, 9, 10>, <6, 9, 11>, <6, 9, 11>, <6, 9, 11>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
