Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 1) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections). Let's label the vertices based on their degree:

Node 0: degree 2
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 12: degree 5
Node 13: degree 5
Node 14: degree 5
Node 4: degree 6
Node 11: degree 6
Node 8: degree 7
Node 9: degree 7
Node 5: degree 7

Now, we will count the triangles formed by checking the shared connections for each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Triangle <1, 2, 4> formed by edges (1, 2), (1, 4), and (2, 4)
- Triangle <1, 2, 12> formed by edges (1, 2), (1, 12), and (2, 12)

[Total number of triangles: 2]
