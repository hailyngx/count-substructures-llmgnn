Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 25) (14, 1) (17, 3) (17, 19) (4, 16) (4, 20) (4, 15) (4, 21) (7, 29) (7, 22) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 25) (6, 20) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 19) (11, 29) (18, 22) (18, 28) (18, 29) (22, 26) (22, 7) (22, 18) (8, 10) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 21) (23, 28) (16, 4) (16, 21) (16, 3) (21, 4) (21, 23) (21, 16) (21, 12) (21, 29) (2, 23) (2, 12) (2, 24) (12, 21) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 13) (3, 17) (3, 16) (1, 14) (1, 29) (1, 13) (29, 7) (29, 11) (29, 18) (29, 21) (29, 1) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 15) (5, 15) (25, 26) (25, 6) (25, 15) (15, 4) (15, 24) (15, 5) (15, 25) (20, 4) (20, 6) (20, 27) (20, 28) (27, 9) (27, 20) (19, 17) (19, 10) (28, 18) (28, 23) (28, 20) (28, 13) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 28) 

Response:
The graph has the following structure with nodes and edges:  

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}  
Edges: {(9, 26), (9, 6), (9, 27), (26, 22), (26, 25), (14, 1), (17, 3), (17, 19), (4, 16), (4, 20), (4, 15), (4, 21), (7, 29), (7, 22), (6, 10), (11, 29), (18, 28), (22, 7), (8, 23), (23, 2), (16, 3), (21, 12), (2, 24), (0, 13), (1, 13), (29, 11), (24, 15), (5, 15), (20, 27), (19, 10), (28, 13)}  

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees from least to most:  
Nodes: {5, 14, 18, 9, 11, 17, 19, 20, 21, 28, 3, 13, 22, 23, 25, 26, 2, 7, 10, 16, 24, 6, 27, 1, 29, 0, 4, 8, 12, 15}  

Now, let's find the triangles by considering the edges and shared connections:  
Triangles:   
<0, 2, 23>  
<0, 2, 24>  
<0, 23, 24>  
<2, 12, 21>  
<3, 16, 4>  
<21, 23, 24>   
<0, 8, 24>  
<1, 13, 29>  
<4, 15, 24>  
<10, 19, 17>  
<10, 19, 28>  
<10, 19, 29>  
<9, 6, 26>  
<13, 28, 20>  
<15, 5, 25>  
<20, 27, 9>  

Total number of triangles: [15]
