Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 6) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 0) (6, 14) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order:
   Vertex 5 has 4 connections.
   Vertex 1 has 4 connections.
   Vertex 13 has 4 connections.
   Vertex 6 has 4 connections.
   Vertex 10 has 4 connections.
   Vertex 14 has 4 connections.
   Vertex 8 has 4 connections.
   Vertex 9 has 6 connections.
   Vertex 3 has 6 connections.
   Vertex 2 has 6 connections.
   Vertex 7 has 6 connections.
   Vertex 12 has 6 connections.
   Vertex 0 has 6 connections.
   Vertex 11 has 8 connections.
   Vertex 4 has 8 connections.

2. Relabel the vertices according to the sorted order:
   Vertex 5 -> Label 0
   Vertex 1 -> Label 1
   Vertex 13 -> Label 2
   Vertex 6 -> Label 3
   Vertex 10 -> Label 4
   Vertex 14 -> Label 5
   Vertex 8 -> Label 6
   Vertex 9 -> Label 7
   Vertex 3 -> Label 8
   Vertex 2 -> Label 9
   Vertex 7 -> Label 10
   Vertex 12 -> Label 11
   Vertex 0 -> Label 12
   Vertex 11 -> Label 13
   Vertex 4 -> Label 14

Now, based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [34]

Unique triangles:
<1, 2, 14>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 11>
<1, 8, 12>
<2, 8, 12>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 12>
