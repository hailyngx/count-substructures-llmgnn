Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 19) (11, 17) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 14) (18, 16) (18, 13) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 3) (1, 7) (1, 19) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 7) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 5) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 0) (14, 2) (14, 4) (14, 13) (12, 8) (12, 16) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 12) (0, 15) (0, 3) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (7, 1) (7, 17) (13, 18) (13, 4) (13, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree.

Node 0: deg = 2 (0, 15), Node 1: deg = 2 (1, 19), Node 6: deg = 2 (6, 9), Node 11: deg = 2 (11, 17), Node 12: deg = 2 (12, 16), Node 18: deg = 2 (18, 13), Node 7: deg = 2 (7, 1), Node 2: deg = 3 (2, 10, 19), Node 4: deg = 3 (4, 8, 13), Node 5: deg = 4 (5, 8, 10, 16), Node 3: deg = 5 (3, 6, 8, 9, 0), Node 15: deg = 3 (15, 8, 10), Node 17: deg = 3 (17, 9, 11), Node 9: deg = 5 (9, 6, 10, 17, 3), Node 8: deg = 5 (8, 4, 5, 15, 12), Node 14: deg = 3 (14, 2, 4).

Triangle count [60]: <3, 9, 6>, <2, 10, 19>, <2, 14, 4>, <0, 15, 10>, <3, 9, 6>, <4, 8, 13>, <3, 9, 6>, <11, 19, 17>, <3, 9, 6>, <3, 8, 12>, <8, 15, 0>, <8, 15, 10>, <9, 10, 6>, <4, 8, 5>, <4, 8, 13>, <5, 8, 16>, <4, 8, 13>, <4, 14, 2>, <5, 8, 16>, <12, 16, 18>, <5, 8, 16>.
