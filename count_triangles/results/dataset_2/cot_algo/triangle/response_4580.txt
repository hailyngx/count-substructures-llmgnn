Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 8) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 8) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 15) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 13) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 3) (2, 6) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 0) (0, 18) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 13) (5, 18) (5, 19) (5, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 1) (19, 5) (19, 1) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 8) (12, 16) (12, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 15) (3, 16) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 9) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 15) (9, 14) (9, 15) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges based on the provided information:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
- Edges: 
  - (0, 18), (0, 14), (0, 19)
  - (1, 19), (1, 13), (1, 11)
  - (2, 6)
  - (3, 12), (3, 9)
  - (4, 17), (4, 7), (4, 10)
  - (5, 8), (5, 18), (5, 19)
  - (6, 15), (6, 18), (6, 2), (6, 7)
  - (7, 15)
  - (8, 11), (8, 16), (8, 15), (8, 5)
  - (9, 15), (9, 14), (9, 3)
  - (10, 17), (10, 4), (10, 13)
  - (11, 14)
  - (12, 16)
  - (13, 14)
  - (15, 7)
  - (16, 12)
  - (17, 3)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Node Degrees:
  - Node 0: degree 3
  - Node 1: degree 3
  - Node 2: degree 1
  - Node 3: degree 3
  - Node 4: degree 3
  - Node 5: degree 3
  - Node 6: degree 4
  - Node 7: degree 2
  - Node 8: degree 4
  - Node 9: degree 3
  - Node 10: degree 3
  - Node 11: degree 2
  - Node 12: degree 2
  - Node 13: degree 2
  - Node 14: degree 3
  - Node 15: degree 3
  - Node 16: degree 2
  - Node 17: degree 2
  - Node 18: degree 2
  - Node 19: degree 2

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, the nodes will be relabeled as follows:
2 12 13 17 18 19 11 7 16 0 14 1 3 5 10 15 4 8 9 6

Now, we will list the triangles (<u, v, w>) formed by shared connections between the two vertices of each edge:

- Triangles:
  - <2, 18, 6>
  - <3, 12, 16>
  - <0, 14, 11>
  - <0, 14, 1>
  - <0, 19, 1>
  - <4, 7, 15>
  - <4, 10, 17>
  - <8, 11, 16>
  - <8, 5, 18>
  - <8, 15, 9>
  - <9, 14, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
