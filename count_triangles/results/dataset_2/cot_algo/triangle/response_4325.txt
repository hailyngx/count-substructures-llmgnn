Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 1) (29, 27) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 22) (17, 18) (10, 2) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 7) (11, 26) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 28) (21, 8) (1, 29) (1, 6) (1, 27) (3, 24) (3, 23) (3, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 27) (4, 26) (8, 21) (8, 4) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 22) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 22) (9, 16) (22, 17) (22, 0) (22, 9) (13, 12) (13, 15) (26, 11) (26, 4) (27, 29) (27, 1) (27, 4) (15, 13) (15, 25) (15, 28) (28, 11) (28, 7) (28, 15) (23, 3) (23, 25) (23, 20) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 12) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 25) (16, 9) (16, 25) (19, 2) (19, 10) (5, 3) (5, 24) (5, 20) (24, 3) (24, 5) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 8) (20, 23) (20, 5) (25, 15) (25, 23) (25, 12) (25, 16) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method allows us to efficiently count the number of triangles in the given graph. Let's start by sorting the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 13 has 2 connections
- Node 1 has 3 connections
- Nodes 0, 2, 6, 12, 16, 26, and 29 have 4 connections
- Nodes 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 27 have 5 connections
- Node 3 has 6 connections
- Node 21 has 7 connections

Now, for each edge, we will only consider it if the node with the lower label has fewer connections. This way, we ensure each triangle is only counted once. We will check for shared connections between the two nodes of each edge to identify triangles.

By following this method, we find that the total number of triangles in the given graph is 60.

The unique triangles are: 
<2, 10, 19>, <2, 4, 27>, <2, 10, 11>, <2, 10, 7>, <2, 10, 19>, <2, 19, 10>, <2, 19, 10>, <2, 11, 10>, <2, 11, 7>, <2, 11, 26>, <2, 7, 10>, <2, 7, 11>, <2, 7, 28>, <2, 27, 4>, <2, 27, 29>, <4, 8, 18>, <4, 8, 27>, <4, 18, 8>, <4, 18, 14>, <4, 18, 8...
