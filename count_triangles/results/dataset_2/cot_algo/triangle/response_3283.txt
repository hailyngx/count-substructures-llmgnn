Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles will be applied to the given graph. 

Vertex degrees:
0: 4
1: 4
2: 4
3: 2
4: 5
5: 5
6: 5
7: 4
8: 3
9: 4

Sorted vertices by degree:
3 < 8 < 0 < 1 < 7 < 2 < 9 < 5 < 6 < 4

Number of triangles: [14]

Unique triangles:
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 0, 6>
<5, 7, 3>
<5, 8, 6>
