Response:
The graph has been constructed with 30 nodes and 90 edges. The graph contains the following edges:

(1, 21) (1, 28) (1, 7) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 15) (21, 29) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 28) (3, 27) (15, 21) (15, 3) (15, 9) (18, 23) (18, 28) (18, 29) (22, 16) (22, 24) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 25) (17, 5) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 25) (28, 1) (28, 21) (28, 3) (28, 18) (5, 10) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 25) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 19) (11, 3) (11, 27) (11, 8) (11, 2) (20, 29) (20, 4) (29, 21) (29, 18) (29, 20) (19, 13) (19, 23) (19, 9) (23, 18) (23, 19) (23, 7) (23, 12) (4, 10) (4, 20) (4, 27) (4, 12) (27, 3) (27, 11) (27, 4) (12, 1) (12, 23) (12, 4) (12, 9) (25, 17) (25, 0) (25, 14) (25, 5) (7, 1) (7, 23) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 11) (8, 16) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 12) (9, 24) (24, 22) (24, 9) (6, 10) (16, 22) (16, 13) (16, 8)

After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, the nodes are relabeled as follows:
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 10 has degree 3
Node 21 has degree 4
Node 0 has degree 3
Node 18 has degree 3
Node 22 has degree 2
Node 17 has degree 2
Node 14 has degree 2
Node 28 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 13 has degree 4
Node 11 has degree 4
Node 20 has degree 2
Node 19 has degree 3
Node 23 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 4
Node 27 has degree 3
Node 12 has degree 4
Node 25 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 2 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 2
Node 9 has degree 4
Node 6 has degree 1
Node 16 has degree 3
Node 15 has degree 3
Node 24 has degree 2

Based on this ordering, now we can count the triangles by checking shared connections. The total number of triangles is [57].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 3, 15>
<1, 3, 28>
<1, 21, 15>
<1, 21, 28>
<1, 3, 27>
<1, 3, 7>
