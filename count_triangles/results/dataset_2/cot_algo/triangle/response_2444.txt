Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 19) (27, 12) (27, 10) (10, 27) (10, 2) (10, 14) (12, 11) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 26) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 6) (8, 16) (8, 4) (8, 20) (28, 6) (28, 20) (14, 0) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 2) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 23) (18, 6) (18, 24) (22, 26) (22, 19) (22, 3) (26, 12) (26, 22) (26, 21) (26, 3) (15, 0) (20, 8) (20, 28) (20, 9) (20, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 22) (3, 26) (3, 13) (6, 4) (6, 28) (6, 18) (6, 23) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 20) (2, 9) (7, 1) (7, 17) (19, 0) (19, 22) (19, 17) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 9) (21, 26) (17, 7) (17, 19) (17, 9) (23, 18) (23, 6) (23, 25) (23, 24) (9, 4) (9, 20) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 17) (1, 7) (1, 25) (25, 23) (25, 1) (24, 18) (24, 23) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. From the given edges, we can calculate the degree of each node:

Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 5
Node 5: degree 0
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 5
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 4
Node 15: degree 1
Node 16: degree 2
Node 17: degree 3
Node 18: degree 4
Node 19: degree 3
Node 20: degree 3
Node 21: degree 1
Node 22: degree 3
Node 23: degree 4
Node 24: degree 2
Node 25: degree 2
Node 26: degree 4
Node 27: degree 2
Node 28: degree 2

Based on the degree-based ordering, we relabel the nodes:
Node 5 -> 0
Node 21 -> 1
Node 7 -> 2
Node 16 -> 3
Node 15 -> 4
Node 27 -> 5
Node 1 -> 6
Node 17 -> 7
Node 28 -> 8
Node 11 -> 9
Node 24 -> 10
Node 25 -> 11
Node 0 -> 12
Node 3 -> 13
Node 16 -> 14
Node 10 -> 15
Node 13 -> 16
Node 14 -> 17
Node 2 -> 18
Node 18 -> 19
Node 12 -> 20
Node 19 -> 21
Node 22 -> 22
Node 26 -> 23
Node 20 -> 24
Node 6 -> 25
Node 9 -> 26
Node 4 -> 27
Node 8 -> 28

Now, we can identify the triangles in the graph by examining the edges and shared connections between vertices. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [38].
Unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 14, 10>
<0, 14, 4>
<0, 3, 13>
<0, 3, 26>
<0, 19, 22>
<0, 19, 17>
<6, 4, 18>
<6, 4, 14>
<6, 4, 8>
<6, 23, 24>
<6, 23, 18>
<6, 23, 25>
<6, 28, 20>
<10, 14, 2>
<10, 14, 4>
<12, 27, 26>
<13, 3, 26>
<14, 18, 23>
<14, 18, 24>
<18, 23, 24>
