Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 12) (11, 20) (16, 17) (16, 10) (2, 29) (2, 9) (2, 20) (2, 28) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 0) (3, 25) (3, 13) (3, 12) (25, 2) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 8) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 24) (23, 22) (23, 15) (18, 6) (18, 13) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 21) (8, 25) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 20) (7, 25) (7, 9) (7, 17) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 15) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 21) (6, 18) (6, 1) (21, 4) (21, 26) (13, 3) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 20) (17, 16) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 28) (17, 0) (19, 4) (19, 8) (27, 25) (27, 1) (1, 6) (1, 27) (1, 28) (14, 15) (10, 16) (10, 4) (10, 26) (10, 28) (0, 29) (0, 17) (0, 9) (5, 20) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (15, 23) (15, 12) (15, 14) (28, 2) (28, 17) (28, 1) (28, 10) (20, 11) (20, 2) (20, 8) (20, 13) (20, 5) (24, 22) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections each vertex has in ascending order. Then, relabel the vertices accordingly based on this order.

The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is:
(5) (6) (14) (16) (24) (7) (11) (15) (18) (21) (23) (26) (27) (1) (22) (28) (0) (3) (17) (19) (20) (29) (4) (8) (10) (12) (13) (9) (25) (2)

Based on the sorted order, the edges that will be considered for counting triangles are:
(5, 20) (6, 18) (14, 15) (16, 17) (24, 22) (7, 25) (11, 12) (15, 14) (18, 6) (21, 4) (23, 22) (26, 21) (27, 1) (1, 28) (22, 23) (28, 17) (0, 29) (3, 25) (17, 16) (19, 4) (20, 11) (29, 0) (4, 8) (8, 25) (10, 16) (12, 11) (13, 3) (9, 2) 

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

There are a total of [53] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 12, 13>
<4, 8, 19>
<4, 9, 21>
<6, 18, 13>
<11, 12, 3>
<11, 20, 13>
<16, 17, 28>
<22, 23, 15>
<22, 24, 26>
<23, 15, 12>
<26, 21, 4>
<1, 27, 25>
<28, 1, 27>
<1, 6, 18>
<29, 0, 9>
<5, 20, 11>
<17, 16, 7>
