Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 8) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 12) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 14) (2, 5) (2, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 6) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 13) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
Edges: (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 8) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 12) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 14) (2, 5) (2, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 6) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 13)

Using Degree-Based Ordering method:
Vertices sorted by degree: [2, 9, 10, 2, 7, 8, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 6, 1, 7, 8]
Relabeled vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]

Count of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles:
<5, 11, 14>
<2, 5, 14>
<1, 7, 13>
<3, 4, 10>
<3, 6, 7>
<1, 11, 13>
<0, 4, 10>
<3, 11, 14>
<8, 11, 12>
