Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (15, 18) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 19) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 18) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 19) (16, 0) (16, 5) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 2) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 13) (18, 15) (18, 1) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 8) (19, 12) (19, 0) (19, 2) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 8) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 13) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 13) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 18) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly:

Vertex 15 (degree 1)
Vertex 16 (degree 2)
Vertex 2 (degree 3)
Vertex 13 (degree 3)
Vertex 0 (degree 3)
Vertex 11 (degree 3)
Vertex 5 (degree 3)
Vertex 7 (degree 3)
Vertex 3 (degree 3)
Vertex 6 (degree 4)
Vertex 14 (degree 4)
Vertex 12 (degree 4)
Vertex 1 (degree 5)
Vertex 4 (degree 5)
Vertex 10 (degree 5)
Vertex 19 (degree 5)
Vertex 17 (degree 6)
Vertex 9 (degree 6)
Vertex 18 (degree 6)
Vertex 8 (degree 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles:

1. For edge (3, 17):
Vertex 3 (degree 3) has fewer connections than vertex 17 (degree 6).
They share a connection with vertex 9, forming a triangle: <3, 9, 17>.

2. For edge (15, 18) - Skipped as vertex 15 has higher degree than vertex 18.

3. For edge (10, 17):
Vertex 10 (degree 5) has fewer connections than vertex 17 (degree 6).
They share connections with vertices 6, 9, and 18, forming triangles: <10, 6, 17>, <10, 9, 17>, <10, 18, 17>.

4. For edge (10, 8) - Skipped as both vertices have the same degree.

5. For edge (17, 3) - Already counted when processing edge (3, 17) as triangles are unique.

6. For edge (17, 10) - Already counted when processing edge (10, 17) as triangles are unique.

7. For edge (17, 6):
Vertex 17 (degree 6) has fewer connections than vertex 6 (degree 4).
They share connections with vertices 9 and 10, forming triangles: <17, 9, 6>, <17, 10, 6>.

8. For edge (17, 9):
Vertex 17 (degree 6) has fewer connections than vertex 9 (degree 6).
They share connections with vertices 3, 10, 6, 18, and forming triangles: <17, 3, 9>, <17, 10, 9>, <17, 6, 9>, <17, 18, 9>.
