Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degrees are as follows:
(6) -> (9) -> (7) -> (2) -> (5) -> (8) -> (3) -> (0) -> (4) -> (1)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles using the given edge information.

The total number of triangles is [12].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 0, 6>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 4>
<3, 2, 5>
<3, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<8, 6, 9>
<3, 1, 9>
<2, 1, 8>
