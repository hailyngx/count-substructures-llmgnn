Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (8, 3)
- 1: (5, 1), (6, 7), (2, 1)
- 2: (6, 2), (8, 2), (3, 2), (1, 2)
- 3: (5, 3), (9, 3), (7, 3), (4, 3), (2, 3), (0, 3)
- 4: (7, 4), (8, 4), (3, 4)
- 5: (1, 5), (3, 5), (7, 5)
- 6: (9, 6), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 8)
- 7: (5, 7), (9, 7), (6, 7), (4, 7), (1, 7)
- 8: (6, 8), (4, 8), (8, 2), (8, 0)
- 9: (9, 6), (9, 3), (9, 7), (3, 9), (7, 9)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:

Nodes by degree: 0 (1), 9 (2), 5 (3), 4 (3), 8 (4), 1 (4), 2 (4), 7 (5), 3 (6), 6 (6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles:

Triangles: [25]

Unique triangles:
<5, 1, 2>
<4, 8, 0>
<4, 3, 7>
<1, 7, 5>
<1, 7, 6>
<1, 2, 6>
<7, 6, 5>
<7, 6, 4>
<6, 8, 4>
<6, 8, 2>
<6, 2, 1>
<6, 2, 3>
<6, 3, 9>
<6, 3, 7>
<6, 3, 4>
<9, 6, 3>
<9, 6, 7>
<9, 3, 7>
<5, 7, 1>
<5, 7, 6>
<3, 5, 1>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 0, 8>
