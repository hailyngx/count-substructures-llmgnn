Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 11) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 13) (1, 2) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 8) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 16) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 4) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 13) (16, 7) (11, 2) (11, 1) (14, 18) (14, 13) (3, 6) (3, 19) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 4) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 6) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 14) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 19) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 

Node 16: 1 connection 
Node 5: 3 connections 
Node 14: 3 connections 
Node 19: 3 connections 
Node 9: 3 connections 
Node 0: 4 connections 
Node 3: 4 connections 
Node 18: 5 connections 
Node 2: 5 connections 
Node 13: 5 connections 
Node 7: 5 connections 
Node 1: 5 connections 
Node 11: 5 connections 
Node 17: 5 connections 
Node 15: 5 connections 
Node 6: 5 connections 
Node 10: 5 connections 
Node 12: 6 connections 
Node 8: 6 connections 
Node 4: 6 connections 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method for counting the triangles, we observe the following triangles: 

- Triangle <12, 18, 13>
- Triangle <0, 7, 9>
- Triangle <0, 7, 16>
- Triangle <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle <1, 2, 11>
- Triangle <1, 8, 15>
- Triangle <2, 11, 1>
- Triangle <4, 5, 10>
- Triangle <4, 6, 0>
- Triangle <6, 8, 1>
- Triangle <6, 12, 19>
- Triangle <8, 15, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
