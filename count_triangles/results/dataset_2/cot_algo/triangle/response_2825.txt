Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:  

Node 2: degree 3  
Node 0: degree 3  
Node 8: degree 3  
Node 6: degree 3  
Node 9: degree 4  
Node 3: degree 4  
Node 1: degree 4  
Node 7: degree 5  
Node 4: degree 5  
Node 5: degree 5  

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the edges in the graph:  

Triangles:  
[8]  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, and <7, 8, 9>.
