Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: 1, 2, 5, 7
- 1: 0, 4, 6, 7
- 2: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- 3: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- 4: 1, 2, 7
- 5: 0, 2, 3
- 6: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- 8: 2, 6
- 9: 3, 6

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes by degree:
1. 3, 4, 8, 9 (Degree: 1)
2. 0, 1, 8 (Degree: 2)
3. 5, 4 (Degree: 3)
4. 0, 1, 2, 4, 7 (Degree: 4)
5. 6 (Degree: 6)

Now, we will check the edges using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Ignoring edges where the lower labeled vertex has a higher degree:
- Ignoring: (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 8), (1, 7), (1, 0), (1, 4), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 2), (7, 6), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 0), (8, 6), (8, 2), (0, 1), (0, 7)
- Considering: (0, 2), (0, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5)

Calculating triangles:
- Triangle: <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle: <2, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
