Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 6) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
- 0: 2, 4, 5, 8
- 1: 3, 10, 11, 14
- 2: 0, 3, 6
- 3: 1, 2, 10, 11
- 4: 0, 5, 6, 8, 13
- 5: 0, 4, 7, 9
- 6: 2, 4, 6, 12, 13
- 7: 5, 9, 14
- 8: 0, 4, 8, 12, 13, 14
- 9: 5, 7, 9, 12
- 10: 1, 3, 10, 13
- 11: 1, 3, 11, 12, 14
- 12: 6, 8, 9, 11, 12
- 13: 4, 6, 8, 10, 13
- 14: 1, 7, 8, 11, 14

Applying Degree-Based Ordering, the sorted nodes are:
0, 2, 7, 10, 6, 5, 1, 3, 13, 14, 11, 9, 12, 4, 8

The triangles in the graph are:
[6] <4, 8, 13>
