Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]

Edges:
(0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 28) (0, 9) 
(1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 22) 
(2, 4) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 25) 
(3, 22) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 26) 
(4, 2) (4, 20) (4, 28) 
(5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 20) 
(6, 14) (6, 16) (6, 13) (6, 29) 
(7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 28) 
(8, 5) (8, 11) 
(9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 23) 
(10, 15) (10, 21) 
(11, 8) 
(12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 23) 
(13, 3) (13, 20) (13, 6) 
(14, 6) (14, 16) (14, 25) 
(15, 1) (15, 2) (15, 10) 
(16, 0) (16, 6) (16, 14) 
(17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 21) 
(18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 19) 
(19, 18) (19, 22) (19, 24) (19, 26) 
(20, 0) (20, 2) (20, 4) (20, 5) (20, 13) 
(21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 17) (21, 22) 
(22, 1) (22, 3) (22, 19) (22, 21) 
(23, 9) (23, 12) (23, 26) 
(24, 7) (24, 19) 
(25, 2) (25, 14) 
(26, 3) (26, 19) (26, 23) 
(28, 0) (28, 4) (28, 7) 
(29, 6)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by degree (in ascending order):
[27, 8, 11, 29, 24, 5, 13, 14, 25, 10, 1, 16, 4, 3, 17, 6, 2, 26, 18, 12, 21, 22, 15, 0, 20, 7, 23, 19, 9]

Now, we can start counting the number of triangles. 

The total number of triangles is: [8]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 20>
<0, 7, 28>
<0, 16, 6>
<2, 4, 20>
<2, 15, 10>
<2, 15, 1>
<3, 22, 4>
<3, 22, 2>
