Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 26) (11, 25) (16, 17) (16, 29) (16, 23) (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (29, 16) (29, 17) (29, 1) (1, 2) (1, 29) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 24) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 23) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 9) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 24) (17, 16) (17, 29) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 21) (26, 11) (26, 13) (26, 19) (21, 19) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 19) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 28) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 27) (14, 4) (25, 11) (25, 22) (25, 18) (27, 14) (27, 22) (27, 10) (6, 15) (6, 14) (24, 8) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 10) (18, 19) (18, 25) (18, 23) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 0) (22, 14) (22, 25) (22, 27) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 23) (10, 2) (10, 27) (10, 24) (23, 16) (23, 13) (23, 18) (23, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices by their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order:

Node 28: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 21: 3 connections
Node 22: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 26: 4 connections
Node 27: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 10: 5 connections
Node 12: 5 connections
Node 24: 5 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Node 15: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 18: 5 connections
Node 23: 5 connections
Node 29: 5 connections
Node 11: 6 connections
Node 16: 6 connections
Node 25: 6 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now identify the triangles:

1. <8, 9, 28>
2. <8, 10, 24>
3. <8, 24, 10>
4. <0, 4, 23>
5. <5, 11, 19>
6. <12, 7, 24>
7. <12, 24, 7>
8. <14, 4, 27>
9. <15, 3, 5>
10. <16, 17, 29>
11. <16, 29, 17>
12. <22, 25, 27>
13. <26, 13, 23>
14. <26, 19, 11>

There are a total of [14] triangles.
