Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 9), (4, 8), (4, 2), (4, 9), (4, 0), (8, 5), (0, 7), (0, 5), (0, 6), (9, 3), (9, 2), (6, 7), (6, 2), (2, 5)

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degrees:
Nodes by degree: {1: 5, 3: 3, 4: 4, 8: 2, 0: 3, 7: 3, 9: 2, 6: 3, 2: 3, 5: 2}
Sorted Nodes: {1, 8, 9, 5, 3, 7, 0, 6, 2, 4}

Now, we will list the triangles found:
Triangles: [<1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <4, 2, 5>, <3, 4, 9>, <6, 2, 5>]

Total number of triangles: [6]
