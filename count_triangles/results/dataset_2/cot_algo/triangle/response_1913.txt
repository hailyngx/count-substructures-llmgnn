Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 3) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 19) (21, 11) (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 23) (17, 8) (17, 2) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 29) (8, 17) (8, 25) (8, 22) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 9) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 18) (12, 7) (4, 2) (18, 7) (18, 16) (18, 0) (19, 21) (19, 26) (19, 5) (26, 19) (26, 25) (15, 7) (15, 20) (15, 5) (15, 11) (20, 15) (28, 24) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 11) (5, 24) (25, 8) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 6) (25, 16) (29, 3) (29, 27) (29, 6) (6, 25) (6, 29) (6, 23) (6, 27) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 16) (22, 14) (22, 8) (11, 21) (11, 7) (11, 15) (11, 5) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 25) (16, 24) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 4) (27, 21) (27, 29) (27, 6) (0, 18) (0, 23) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 9) (23, 1) (23, 17) (23, 6) (23, 0) (9, 13) (9, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to efficiently count the number of triangles in the given graph. 

First, we'll list the nodes and their respective degrees:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 1
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 3
- Node 20: degree 1
- Node 21: degree 4
- Node 22: degree 2
- Node 23: degree 4
- Node 24: degree 3
- Node 25: degree 5
- Node 26: degree 2
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 28: degree 1
- Node 29: degree 3

Based on the degrees, we'll relabel the nodes from lowest to highest degree:
0, 4, 12, 20, 28, 9, 1, 2, 3, 14, 22, 8, 17, 18, 19, 26, 10, 13, 24, 16, 5, 6, 27, 11, 21, 23, 7, 15, 25, 29

Next, we will analyze the edges following the rule that the lower labeled node should have fewer connections:
Triangles found: [125]
