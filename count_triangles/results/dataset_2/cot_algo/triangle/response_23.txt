Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 21) (2, 4) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 10) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 3) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 6) (27, 29) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 20) (27, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 23) (10, 29) (10, 13) (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 7) (22, 0) (26, 5) (26, 3) (24, 12) (24, 15) (6, 12) (6, 7) (6, 3) (21, 2) (21, 27) (21, 23) (21, 14) (28, 18) (28, 23) (5, 12) (5, 26) (5, 11) (0, 17) (0, 22) (0, 11) (0, 19) (15, 24) (19, 29) (19, 0) (19, 25) (23, 4) (23, 21) (23, 28) (3, 8) (3, 26) (3, 6) (3, 14) (14, 21) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 16) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 20) (1, 9) (20, 27) (20, 1) (20, 9) (20, 11) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 18) (25, 19) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 20) (16, 8) (16, 14) (9, 27) (9, 1) (9, 20) (18, 17) (18, 28) (18, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles will be as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
    - Node 9 (Degree: 0)
    - Node 22 (Degree: 0)
    - Node 28 (Degree: 0)
    - Node 25 (Degree: 1)
    - Node 2 (Degree: 2)
    - Node 24 (Degree: 2)
    - Node 26 (Degree: 2)
    - Node 15 (Degree: 2)
    - Node 1 (Degree: 3)
    - Node 7 (Degree: 3)
    - Node 5 (Degree: 3)
    - Node 18 (Degree: 3)
    - Node 16 (Degree: 3)
    - Node 21 (Degree: 3)
    - Node 10 (Degree: 4)
    - Node 17 (Degree: 4)
    - Node 19 (Degree: 4)
    - Node 3 (Degree: 4)
    - Node 29 (Degree: 5)
    - Node 12 (Degree: 5)
    - Node 11 (Degree: 5)
    - Node 4 (Degree: 5)
    - Node 8 (Degree: 5)
    - Node 6 (Degree: 5)
    - Node 20 (Degree: 5)
    - Node 14 (Degree: 5)
    - Node 0 (Degree: 5)
    - Node 27 (Degree: 6)
    - Node 13 (Degree: 6)

2. Relabeling the nodes from 0 to 29 based on the sorted degrees.

After relabeling the nodes, we check the edges with the rule that the lower label should have fewer connections. By following this rule, we find the total number of triangles as 5 which are: <0, 17, 7>, <0, 17, 18>, <0, 19, 25>, <0, 19, 29>, <2, 4, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [5].
