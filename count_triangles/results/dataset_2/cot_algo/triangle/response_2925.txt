Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and edges:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 28), (5, 16), (9, 5), (9, 25), (9, 21), (1, 3), (1, 29), (1, 23), (1, 22), (1, 18), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 22), (8, 13), (8, 11), (8, 18), (13, 8), (13, 2), (13, 19), (10, 11), (10, 15), (10, 6), (10, 27), (11, 8), (11, 10), (11, 27), (0, 17), (0, 2), (20, 26), (20, 24), (2, 13), (2, 0), (2, 18), (2, 28), (18, 1), (18, 8), (18, 2), (18, 17), (18, 25), (7, 16), (7, 23), (12, 15), (12, 26), (26, 20), (26, 12), (26, 24), (28, 5), (28, 2), (24, 20), (24, 26), (24, 22), (15, 10), (15, 12), (15, 25)... (continuing)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Degrees:
0: 3
1: 5
2: 6
3: 4
4: 2
5: 3
6: 4
7: 2
8: 4
9: 4
10: 4
11: 4
12: 3
13: 4
14: 1
15: 5
16: 4
17: 4
18: 6
19: 3
20: 3
21: 3
22: 5
23: 4
24: 4
25: 4
26: 4
27: 3
28: 3
29: 3

After sorting by degree:
14 4
7 2
4 2
0 3
5 3
12 3
20 3
21 3
26 3
27 3
28 3
29 3
3 4
6 4
9 4
10 4
11 4
13 4
16 4
19 4
23 4
24 4
25 4
1 5
15 5
2 6
18 6
8 4
17 4
22 5

Following the process, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [358].
Unique triangles found in the graph are:
