Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 6) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 2) (8, 19) (3, 11) (3, 0) (15, 10) (15, 14) (13, 17) (13, 14) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 19) (17, 5) (19, 18) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 14) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (12, 10) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 1) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 9) (4, 1) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 18) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 13) (14, 19) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (5, 16) (5, 17) (5, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for finding triangles involves sorting the nodes by the number of connections each node has. 

The degree of each node in the provided graph is:
Node 11: degree 5
Node 16: degree 3
Node 8:  degree 4
Node 3:  degree 2
Node 2:  degree 2
Node 18: degree 4
Node 19: degree 5
Node 15: degree 2
Node 13: degree 2
Node 17: degree 4
Node 10: degree 3
Node 14: degree 4
Node 0:  degree 3
Node 12: degree 1
Node 1:  degree 4
Node 5:  degree 3
Node 6:  degree 2
Node 9:  degree 2
Node 4:  degree 4

Next, we will relabel the nodes from 0 to 19 based on their degrees in ascending order:

Node 12 (degree 1) -> Node 3
Nodes 2, 6, 13, 15, 19, 9 (degree 2) -> Nodes 4, 6, 9, 11, 15, 16
Nodes 10, 16, 5 (degree 3) -> Nodes 0, 2, 3
Nodes 8, 17 (degree 4) -> Nodes 1, 5
Nodes 18, 1, 14, 0, 11 (degree 5) -> Nodes 7, 8, 10, 12, 17

Now, we will check for triangles by looking at the edges with the lower labeled node having fewer connections:

Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 1, 10>
3. <0, 1, 12>
4. <0, 1, 17>
5. <0, 2, 7>
6. <0, 2, 10>
7. <0, 2, 12>
8. <0, 2, 17>
9. <1, 5, 7>
10. <1, 5, 8>
11. <1, 5, 10>
12. <1, 5, 17>
13. <1, 5, 12>
14. <4, 11, 12>
15. <4, 11, 17>
16. <4, 8, 17>
17. <6, 9, 15>

Total number of triangles: [17]
