Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) 

Response:
Below is the graph representation of the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3), (0, 4), (0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 3)
- 1: (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 1), (4, 1), (7, 6), (8, 1), (2, 1), (1, 6)
- 2: (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 2), (0, 2), (2, 1)
- 3: (5, 9), (4, 3), (0, 3), (6, 3), (3, 6)
- 4: (0, 4), (1, 4), (3, 4)
- 5: (9, 5), (8, 5), (0, 5), (1, 5), (3, 5)
- 6: (7, 6), (0, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6), (3, 6)
- 7: (9, 7), (7, 6)
- 8: (5, 8), (9, 8), (8, 1)
- 9: (5, 9), (9, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (2, 9)

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices by their degrees:
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 0: Degree 6
Node 9: Degree 7
Node 5: Degree 7

Triangles: [18]
