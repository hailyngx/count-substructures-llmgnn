Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 8) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in efficiently counting the number of triangles in the given graph. 
The vertices along with their corresponding degrees are as follows:
- Vertex 0: degree 4
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 2: degree 2
- Vertex 3: degree 4
- Vertex 4: degree 3
- Vertex 5: degree 6
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 4
- Vertex 8: degree 4
- Vertex 9: degree 5
- Vertex 10: degree 4
- Vertex 11: degree 5
- Vertex 12: degree 3
- Vertex 13: degree 5
- Vertex 14: degree 5

Sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order:
1. Vertex 2
2. Vertex 1
3. Vertex 12
4. Vertex 4
5. Vertex 6
6. Vertex 7
7. Vertex 0
8. Vertex 3
9. Vertex 8
10. Vertex 10
11. Vertex 9
12. Vertex 11
13. Vertex 13
14. Vertex 14
5. Vertex 5

Since the graph has 60 edges, we will proceed with counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Total number of triangles: [16]
Unique triangles: <0, 5, 9>, <0, 5, 14>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 9, 13>, <2, 6, 14>, <2, 7, 3>, <2, 7, 6>, <2, 7, 0>, <3, 7, 14>, <4, 11, 10>, <4, 11, 1>, <4, 11, 3>, <4, 8, 6>, <4, 8, 14>, <4, 13, 10>, <4, 13, 1>
