Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective connections are as follows:
- Node 0: 5 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 5 connections
- Node 5: 6 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 5 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

The Degree-Based Ordering is as follows:
- Node 2 (3 connections)
- Node 3 (3 connections)
- Node 8 (2 connections)
- Node 1 (4 connections)
- Node 6 (4 connections)
- Node 9 (4 connections)
- Node 7 (5 connections)
- Node 4 (5 connections)
- Node 0 (5 connections)
- Node 5 (6 connections)

Now, we will count the triangles:

- <3, 7, 0>
- <4, 7, 0>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 9, 6>
- <1, 9, 5>
- <1, 6, 5>
