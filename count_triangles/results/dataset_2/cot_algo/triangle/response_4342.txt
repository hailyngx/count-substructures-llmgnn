Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles efficiently.

After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order:
- Node 24 has degree 2
- Nodes 2, 4, 10, 11, 12, 27, 28, 29 have degree 3
- Nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 22, 23, 25, 26 have degree 4
- Nodes 0, 6, 15, 19, 20, 21 have degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 6

Let's examine the edges based on the degree-based ordering to count the triangles:
