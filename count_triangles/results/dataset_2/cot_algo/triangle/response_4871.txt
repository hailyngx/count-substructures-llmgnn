Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 14) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 20) (10, 19) (10, 24) (10, 5) (19, 10) (19, 29) (19, 1) (26, 13) (26, 17) (13, 16) (13, 26) (13, 21) (8, 16) (8, 17) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 28) (9, 12) (23, 11) (23, 7) (21, 13) (21, 4) (21, 22) (4, 9) (4, 21) (4, 25) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 6) (1, 19) (1, 6) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 20) (28, 9) (28, 3) (28, 15) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 24) (7, 23) (7, 3) (7, 27) (7, 17) (5, 10) (5, 22) (5, 15) (5, 0) (0, 5) (20, 16) (20, 3) (20, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 20) (2, 25) (2, 15) (29, 19) (15, 28) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 22) (22, 21) (22, 5) (22, 15) (27, 7) (25, 4) (25, 2) (25, 18) (17, 26) (17, 8) (17, 7) (17, 24) (17, 18) (24, 10) (24, 14) (24, 17) (18, 12) (18, 25) (18, 17) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. 

After sorting the vertices by their degree, we have the following relabeling:
- Node 0: degree 1
- Node 26: degree 1
- Node 27: degree 1
- Node 29: degree 1
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 20: degree 2
- Node 23: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 21: degree 3
- Node 24: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 5
- Node 22: degree 5
- Node 25: degree 5
- Node 28: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 18: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 7
- Node 6: degree 7
- Node 9: degree 7
- Node 15: degree 7
- Node 12: degree 8
- Node 19: degree 8

Now, we can count the triangles by considering each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections and checking for shared connections:
- Triangles counted: 11
- Unique triangles found: <2, 16, 23>, <2, 16, 8>, <2, 16, 14>, <2, 16, 20>, <3, 7, 23>, <3, 7, 17>, <3, 7, 27>, <4, 12, 9>, <5, 15, 2>, <5, 22, 15>, <6, 12, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
