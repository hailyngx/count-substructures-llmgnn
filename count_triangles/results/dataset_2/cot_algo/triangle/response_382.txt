Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 7) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 5) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 16) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (19, 11) (19, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 9) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 16) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 18) (7, 13) (7, 10) (7, 5) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 18) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 11) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 18) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 0) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 3) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges:
(8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) 
(13, 15) (13, 7) 
(10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 2) 
(17, 12) (17, 5) 
(4, 5) (4, 16) 
(5, 2) (5, 7) 
(19, 11) (19, 3) 
(1, 6) (1, 9) 
(15, 16) 
(12, 18) 
(16, 18) 
(6, 0) 
(2, 11) 
(3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 18) 
(11, 9) 

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes and their degrees:
0: 3
9: 3
11: 3
14: 3
10: 3
6: 3
12: 3
15: 3
19: 2
1: 2
4: 2
5: 4
2: 3
7: 4
17: 3
16: 3
8: 4
3: 4
18: 4
13: 3

Now, let's count the triangles:
Triangles: [9]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 9. 

The unique triangles found are:
<11, 2, 5>
<4, 5, 16>
<2, 10, 7>
<1, 6, 0>
<1, 9, 11>
<8, 13, 15>
<3, 0, 6>
<3, 14, 8>
<3, 18, 16>
