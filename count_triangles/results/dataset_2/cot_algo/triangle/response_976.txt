Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 4) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 17) (11, 16) (11, 28) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 2) (14, 0) (14, 2) (17, 26) (17, 20) (17, 28) (17, 19) (1, 26) (1, 3) (1, 24) (1, 22) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 15) (3, 4) (20, 17) (20, 25) (20, 10) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 21) (25, 2) (18, 1) (18, 2) (22, 1) (22, 8) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 6) (27, 29) (27, 28) (27, 7) (2, 16) (2, 14) (2, 25) (2, 18) (0, 16) (0, 14) (15, 3) (28, 11) (28, 17) (28, 27) (28, 5) (23, 26) (23, 5) (23, 7) (23, 29) (5, 28) (5, 23) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 13) (13, 19) (13, 21) (13, 29) (21, 25) (21, 13) (21, 4) (29, 27) (29, 23) (29, 13) (8, 22) (8, 6) (24, 1) (24, 10) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 21) (7, 9) (7, 27) (7, 23) (10, 20) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 24) (6, 25) (6, 12) (6, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
(9, 26), (9, 4), (9, 7), 
(26, 1), (26, 23), (26, 17), 
(11, 16), (11, 28), 
(16, 0), (16, 12), (16, 2), 
(14, 0), (14, 2), 
(17, 20), (17, 28), (17, 19), 
(1, 3), (1, 24), (1, 22), (1, 18), 
(3, 15), (3, 4), 
(20, 25), (20, 10), 
(25, 6), (25, 21), (25, 2), 
(18, 2), 
(22, 8), 
(12, 10), (12, 6), 
(27, 29), (27, 28), (27, 7), 
(0, 14), 
(23, 5), 
(5, 28), 
(19, 13), 
(13, 21), (13, 29), 
(21, 4), 
(8, 6)

Next, relabel the nodes based on their degrees from least to most:

0 (degree 1)
11 (degree 1)
5 (degree 1)
8 (degree 1)
9 (degree 2)
3 (degree 2)
18 (degree 2)
22 (degree 2)
24 (degree 2)
7 (degree 3)
14 (degree 3)
10 (degree 4)
19 (degree 4)
20 (degree 4)
28 (degree 4)
27 (degree 4)
4 (degree 4)
12 (degree 4)
17 (degree 4)
21 (degree 4)
25 (degree 4)
13 (degree 5)
6 (degree 5)
1 (degree 5)
23 (degree 5)
15 (degree 6)
2 (degree 6)
16 (degree 6)
29 (degree 6)
26 (degree 6)

Now, we count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [78]
