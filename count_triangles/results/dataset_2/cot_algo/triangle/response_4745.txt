Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 14) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 19) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (14, 16) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 18) (1, 15) (1, 10) (3, 9) (3, 15) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 0) (15, 1) (15, 3) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 7) (18, 16) (18, 17) (18, 7) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 0) (13, 9) (13, 14) (4, 9) (4, 14) (0, 6) (0, 19) (0, 8) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in this graph is as follows:

Nodes sorted by their degrees:
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 17: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 18: Degree 3
Node 12: Degree 2
Node 13: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 15: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 16: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 14: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 19: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following:
[Total number of triangles: 17]
<9, 13, 14>, <9, 13, 4>, <9, 14, 13>, <9, 14, 4>, <9, 3, 15>, <9, 13, 14>, <4, 14, 13>, <18, 16, 6>, <18, 16, 14>, <18, 7, 2>, <18, 7, 16>, <7, 16, 18>, <7, 16, 6>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 19, 5>, <0, 8, 12>, <0, 8, 6>
