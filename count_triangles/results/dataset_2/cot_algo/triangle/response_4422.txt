Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 29) (11, 20) (16, 28) (16, 19) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 27) (0, 20) (0, 18) (0, 1) (27, 0) (27, 25) (18, 0) (18, 20) (18, 24) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 10) (22, 7) (23, 22) (23, 7) (23, 19) (23, 12) (10, 22) (10, 17) (10, 21) (17, 10) (17, 15) (20, 11) (20, 0) (20, 18) (20, 3) (20, 4) (28, 16) (28, 25) (29, 11) (29, 21) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 23) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 14) (26, 6) (3, 20) (3, 4) (4, 20) (4, 3) (4, 24) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 17) (21, 10) (21, 29) (25, 27) (25, 28) (25, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (6, 26) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 22) (2, 24) (2, 14) (2, 7) (24, 18) (24, 4) (24, 2) (24, 12) (14, 16) (14, 26) (14, 2) (8, 11) (8, 25) (8, 1) (7, 22) (7, 23) (7, 6) (7, 2) (12, 23) (12, 24) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Vertices with 0 connections: 13, 30
Vertices with 1 connection: 13, 15, 17, 21, 30
Vertices with 2 connections: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 26
Vertices with 3 connections: 2, 5, 7, 9, 20, 22, 23, 27
Vertices with 4 connections: 11, 14, 16, 19, 29, 25
Vertices with 5 connections: 0, 28

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

Triangles: [16]
Unique triangles found: <16, 19, 26>
