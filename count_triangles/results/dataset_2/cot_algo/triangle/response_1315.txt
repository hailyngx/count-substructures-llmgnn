Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 18) (10, 15) (10, 16) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 19) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 11) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 13) (8, 18) (8, 6) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 19) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 15) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 5) (11, 2) (11, 1) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 16) (3, 13) (16, 10) (16, 3) (9, 0) (9, 13) (5, 4) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 13) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees (number of connections). Let's relabel the vertices in increasing order of their degrees. 

The new vertex order is as follows:
Vertex 0: degree 5
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 3
Vertex 3: degree 4
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 5: degree 2
Vertex 6: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 6
Vertex 8: degree 2
Vertex 9: degree 2
Vertex 10: degree 2
Vertex 11: degree 2
Vertex 12: degree 3
Vertex 13: degree 4
Vertex 14: degree 4
Vertex 15: degree 3
Vertex 16: degree 2
Vertex 17: degree 3
Vertex 18: degree 4
Vertex 19: degree 4

Now, let's count the triangles by considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections than the other vertex.

The total number of triangles is [15].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 14, 1>
<0, 14, 13>
<0, 17, 19>
<0, 1, 4>
<1, 11, 2>
<1, 5, 4>
<2, 3, 17>
<2, 3, 11>
<3, 13, 14>
<3, 13, 6>
<3, 16, 10>
<4, 7, 12>
<7, 18, 0>
<7, 18, 8>
<7, 15, 19>
