Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 14) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 6) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 11) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 9) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Then, we relabel the vertices according to this sorting. 

After relabeling the vertices, the graph will look like this:
Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
Edges: (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 14) (10, 14) (11, 14) (12, 11) (13, 14)
   
Now, by following the Degree-Based Ordering method with the given edges, we can count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles is: [12]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 9, 14>
<1, 9, 2>
<3, 5, 4>
<4, 5, 12>
<3, 5, 12>
<4, 3, 6>
<10, 14, 9>
<10, 14, 12>
