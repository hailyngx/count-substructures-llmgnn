Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 17) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 19) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 18) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 15) (0, 4) (14, 12) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 9) (19, 5) (19, 18) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 2) (15, 8) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 12) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 3) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 16) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 12) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 2) (3, 4) (3, 18) (2, 1) (2, 17) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 4), (3, 4), 
(6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 10), 
(1, 9), (1, 13), (1, 11,), (1, 15), (1, 2), 
(18, 13), (18, 19), (18, 16), (18, 3), 
(12, 14), (12, 15), (12, 16), 
(5, 11), (5, 19), (5, 16), 
(8, 13), (8, 10), (8, 15), 
(9, 17), (9, 19), 
(10, 6), (10, 8), (10, 11), 
(13, 8), (13, 1), (13, 18), 
(19, 9), (19, 5), (19, 18), 
(15, 8), (15, 11), (15, 1), (15, 12), 
(2, 1), (2, 17), 
(14, 12), 
(11, 10), (11, 1), (11, 5), (11, 17), (11, 15), 
(16, 5), (16, 18), (16, 12), 
(17, 7), (17, 9), (17, 11), (17, 2), 
(7, 6)

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degrees:

Node degrees:
0: 2, 1: 5, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2, 5: 4, 6: 4, 7: 2, 8: 3, 9: 4, 10: 3, 11: 5, 12: 3, 13: 3, 14: 1, 15: 4, 16: 3, 17: 4, 18: 4, 19: 3

Based on the degree-based ordering, the vertices' labels will be:
0 < 2 < 7 < 3 < 4 < 14 < 8 < 10 < 12 < 5 < 19 < 9 < 16 < 13 < 1 < 15 < 11 < 6 < 17 < 18 < 2

Let's count the number of triangles:
Triangles: [45]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 3>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 11>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 19>, <0, 4, 18>, <0, 4, 16>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 3, 18>, <0, 3, 16>, <0, 13, 18>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 1, 11>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 19>, <0, 1, 18>, <0, 1, 16>, <0, 1, 15>, <0, 1, 12>, <0, 15, 12>, <0, 11, 5>, <0, 11, 19>, <0, 11, 18>, <4, 3, 18>, <4, 3, 16>, <4, 13, 18>, <4, 1, 13>, <4, 1, 11>, <4, 1, 5>, <4, 1, 19>, <4, 1, 18>, <4, 1, 16>, <4, 1, 15>, <4, 1, 12>, <4, 15, 12>, <4, 11, 5>, <4, 11, 19>, <4, 11, 18>, <3, 1, 18>, <3, 15, 12>, <3, 5, 19>, <13, 1, 18>, <13, 15, 12>
