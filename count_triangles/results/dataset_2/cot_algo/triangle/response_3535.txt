Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 19) (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 7) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 16) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 11) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 18) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 14) (15, 1) (15, 17) (15, 12) (10, 16) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 16) (17, 19) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 16) (12, 15) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 13) (14, 12) (16, 8) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 19) (0, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Let's assign labels to the nodes based on their degrees:  

Node 5: degree 2  
Node 9: degree 2  
Node 4: degree 3  
Node 7: degree 5  
Node 1: degree 2  
Node 3: degree 2  
Node 6: degree 4  
Node 2: degree 3  
Node 8: degree 3  
Node 18: degree 3  
Node 11: degree 4  
Node 13: degree 4  
Node 15: degree 2  
Node 10: degree 1  
Node 17: degree 4  
Node 19: degree 5  
Node 12: degree 2  
Node 14: degree 5  
Node 16: degree 4  
Node 0: degree 1  

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles. We will count a triangle only if its vertices are labeled in increasing order.  

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [12].  
The unique triangles found are:  
<4, 6, 7>  
<4, 7, 11>  
<4, 7, 18>  
<6, 7, 11>  
<6, 7, 18>  
<7, 11, 18>  
<7, 13, 14>  
<11, 13, 14>  
<7, 16, 17>  
<8, 14, 16>  
<13, 14, 17>  
<16, 17, 19>
