Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 8) (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (4, 15) (4, 2) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 10) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 0) (5, 14) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 19) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 19) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 19) (12, 17) (19, 1) (19, 0) (19, 13) (10, 7) (10, 2) (8, 16) (8, 15) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph can be labeled from 0 to 19.

After relabeling based on the number of connections, the vertices are sorted as follows:
Nodes with 2 connections: 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 19
Nodes with 3 connections: 0, 5
Nodes with 4 connections: 7, 9, 18
Nodes with 5 connections: 3, 8
Nodes with 6 connections: 11, 13, 17
Nodes with 7 connections: 14
Nodes with 8 connections: 15
Nodes with 9 connections: 16

With this ordering, we will now count the number of triangles:
- Checking the nodes with 2 connections (1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 19):
  No triangles can be formed using these nodes.

- Checking the nodes with 3 connections (0, 5):
  No triangles can be formed using these nodes.

- Checking the nodes with 4 connections (7, 9, 18):
  No triangles can be formed using these nodes.

- Checking the nodes with 5 connections (3, 8):
  Triangle <3, 8, 15> is formed.

- Checking the nodes with 6 connections (11, 13, 17):
  Triangle <11, 13, 17> is formed.

- Checking the nodes with 7 connections (14):
  No triangles can be formed using this node.

- Checking the nodes with 8 connections (15):
  No triangles can be formed using this node.

- Checking the nodes with 9 connections (16):
  No triangles can be formed using this node.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
The unique triangles found are <3, 8, 15> and <11, 13, 17>.
