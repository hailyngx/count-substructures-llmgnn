Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
0 - 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
1 - 0, 4, 9
2 - 3, 7, 8
3 - 2, 6, 7, 9
4 - 0, 1, 6, 7
5 - 6, 8, 9
6 - 0, 3, 4, 5
7 - 2, 3, 4, 8
8 - 0, 2, 5, 7, 9
9 - 0, 1, 3, 5, 8

Next, we sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes by Degree: 2, 1, 5, 6, 4, 7, 9, 0, 3, 8

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and sorting the edges by the lower labeled vertex, we proceed to count the triangles:

Triangles:
1. <3, 2, 7>
2. <5, 9, 8>
3. <5, 6, 0>
4. <6, 4, 0>
5. <8, 7, 2>
6. <8, 9, 1>
7. <8, 9, 3>
8. <9, 5, 6>

Total number of triangles: [8]
