Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 18) (6, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (3, 8) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 17) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 15) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 11) (17, 12) (10, 15) (10, 1) (15, 8) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 16) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 19) (7, 9) (7, 1) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 16) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 17) (18, 6) (18, 13) (18, 1) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 18) (2, 15) (2, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in solving this problem efficiently by sorting the vertices based on their degree.

After sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections), the new labeling of vertices is as follows:  

Node 5: Degree 3  
Node 9: Degree 4  
Node 6: Degree 2  
Node 0: Degree 4  
Node 14: Degree 3  
Node 3: Degree 1  
Node 11: Degree 5  
Node 8: Degree 4  
Node 13: Degree 3  
Node 17: Degree 2  
Node 10: Degree 2  
Node 15: Degree 4  
Node 16: Degree 4  
Node 7: Degree 2  
Node 19: Degree 4  
Node 4: Degree 3  
Node 12: Degree 3  
Node 18: Degree 3  
Node 1: Degree 5  
Node 2: Degree 2  

Now, we will go through each edge and count the total number of triangles formed.

After analyzing all the possible triangles, we find that the total number of triangles in the graph is 24.

Therefore, the output is: [24]
Unique triangles found: <5, 9, 12>, <0, 14, 1>, <0, 14, 4>, <11, 19, 13>, <11, 19, 16>, <11, 8, 15>, <8, 9, 5>, <8, 9, 7>, <8, 9, 11>, <8, 3, 11>, <8, 15, 16>, <8, 15, 10>, <8, 15, 2>, <13, 19, 16>, <13, 19, 11>, <13, 18, 6>, <14, 0, 16>, <14, 0, 1>, <14, 4, 0>, <12, 5, 1>, <12, 5, 17>, <18, 6, 13>, <1, 5, 10>, <15, 2, 16>
