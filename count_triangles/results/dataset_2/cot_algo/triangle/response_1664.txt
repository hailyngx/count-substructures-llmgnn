Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 10) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 7) (11, 4) (11, 0) (14, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 11) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 13: 3 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 11: 4 connections
- Node 14: 1 connection
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 10: 4 connections
- Node 0: 7 connections
- Node 6: 6 connections
- Node 12: 6 connections
- Node 1: 5 connections
- Node 3: 5 connections

2. Relabel the nodes accordingly:
- Node 14: 0 connections (new label 0)
- Node 5: 3 connections (new label 1)
- Node 13: 3 connections (new label 2)
- Node 8: 3 connections (new label 3)
- Node 9: 4 connections (new label 4)
- Node 4: 4 connections (new label 5)
- Node 11: 4 connections (new label 6)
- Node 7: 4 connections (new label 7)
- Node 10: 4 connections (new label 8)
- Node 2: 5 connections (new label 9)
- Node 1: 5 connections (new label 10)
- Node 6: 6 connections (new label 11)
- Node 12: 6 connections (new label 12)
- Node 3: 5 connections (new label 13)
- Node 0: 7 connections (new label 14)

3. For each edge, count the triangles if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Triangles found: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 11>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 4, 12>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 6, 12>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 11>, <2, 5, 12>, <2, 5, 13>, <2, 9, 10>, <2, 9, 11>, <2, 9, 12>, <2, 9, 13>, <2, 9, 14>, <2, 10, 13>, <3, 10, 13>, <6, 10, 11> 

4. Total number of triangles: [20]
