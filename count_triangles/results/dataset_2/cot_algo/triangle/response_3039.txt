Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 10) (22, 29) (12, 27) (12, 17) (27, 13) (27, 12) (27, 18) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 23) (28, 6) (28, 17) (4, 3) (18, 27) (18, 11) (18, 17) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 24) (14, 0) (14, 23) (14, 15) (14, 16) (5, 23) (5, 1) (5, 21) (5, 16) (26, 15) (26, 7) (7, 26) (7, 15) (7, 24) (25, 1) (25, 29) (25, 15) (8, 20) (9, 16) (11, 18) (11, 23) (11, 17) (11, 2) (23, 6) (23, 14) (23, 5) (23, 11) (23, 21) (10, 13) (10, 22) (10, 6) (10, 0) (21, 5) (21, 23) (21, 24) (20, 8) (20, 3) (20, 19) (29, 22) (29, 25) (29, 3) (17, 12) (17, 28) (17, 18) (17, 11) (1, 5) (1, 25) (3, 4) (3, 20) (3, 29) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 26) (15, 7) (15, 25) (2, 11) (2, 19) (19, 20) (19, 2) (24, 0) (24, 7) (24, 21) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 5) (16, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to count the number of triangles efficiently in a graph. Let's follow the steps to find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections):
   Vertex 4 has degree 0
   Vertex 2 has degree 1
   Vertices 8, 9, 26, 27, 28, 29 have degree 2
   Vertices 1, 5, 6, 7, 12, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25 have degree 3
   Vertices 0, 3, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 24 have degree 4
   Vertex 13 has degree 5

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   Vertex 4 -> A
   Vertex 2 -> B
   Vertices 8, 9, 26, 27, 28, 29 -> C
   Vertices 1, 5, 6, 7, 12, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25 -> D
   Vertices 0, 3, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 24 -> E
   Vertex 13 -> F

3. Count the triangles:
   From the given edges, the triangles found are:
   <0, 10, 13>, <0, 14, 23>, <0, 15, 25>, <0, 24, 7>, <1, 5, 23>, <1, 5, 25>, <3, 4, 20>, <3, 4, 29>, <3, 20, 29>, <6, 10, 13>, <6, 10, 22>, <6, 23, 14>, <6, 23, 21>, <10, 13, 22>, <11, 17, 18>, <11, 17, 28>, <14, 16, 5>, <14, 16, 9>, <15, 0, 14>, <15, 0, 26>, <15, 7, 24>, <15, 7, 25>, <15, 25, 1>, <16, 5, 23>, <16, 5, 9>

4. Calculate the total number of triangles:
   Total number of triangles = 24

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [24].
