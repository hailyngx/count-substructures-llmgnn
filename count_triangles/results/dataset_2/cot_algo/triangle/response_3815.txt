Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 7) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 0) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 13) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 12) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 12) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: {(5, 6), (5, 12), (5, 4), (5, 7), (9, 14), (9, 13), (1, 11), (1, 14), (1, 13), (1, 12), (3, 0), (3, 6), (3, 8), (10, 8), (10, 7), (10, 14), (11, 1), (11, 0), (11, 13), (4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 6), (4, 2), (8, 3), (8, 10), (8, 4), (8, 14), (8, 0), (8, 6), (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 8), (0, 3), (0, 11), (0, 8), (0, 14), (0, 2), (0, 7), (14, 9), (14, 1), (14, 10), (14, 8), (14, 0), (2, 4), (2, 0), (2, 13), (7, 5), (7, 10), (7, 0), (7, 12), (12, 5), (12, 1), (12, 7), (12, 13), (13, 9), (13, 1), (13, 11), (13, 2), (13, 12)}

Now, let's perform the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph.

Sorted vertices by their degrees:
{9, 2, 10, 12, 7, 11, 13, 1, 14, 5, 4, 6, 3, 0, 8}

Triangles:
[18]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 8, 6>
<0, 11, 1>
<2, 13, 12>
<5, 6, 3>
<5, 7, 10>
<9, 13, 1>
