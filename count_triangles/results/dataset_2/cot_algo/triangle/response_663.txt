Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 13) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 7) (9, 19) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 16) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 17) (3, 17) (3, 10) (0, 16) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 0) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 1) (19, 9) (19, 5) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 4) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 12) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 15) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 1) (4, 13) (4, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degrees in ascending order. Relabeling them accordingly, we have:

0: 4 connections
1: 4 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
5: 4 connections
11: 2 connections
15: 3 connections
16: 4 connections
6: 3 connections
9: 4 connections
18: 3 connections
7: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
19: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
10: 3 connections
12: 4 connections
13: 4 connections
17: 3 connections

Using these labels, the triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 12, 5>
<0, 16, 13>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 10, 3>
<1, 12, 15>
<1, 15, 11>
<2, 5, 12>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 13, 12>
<6, 13, 16>
<9, 18, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
