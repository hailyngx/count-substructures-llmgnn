Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The degree of each node is as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 4

The vertices sorted by their degrees are:
5, 6, 0, 1, 3, 7, 9, 4, 8, 2

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges:

1. Edge (5, 2): Both nodes have different degrees, so we proceed. Shared connections: 8.
2. Edge (5, 8): Both nodes have different degrees, so we proceed. Shared connections: 2.
3. Edge (5, 7): Both nodes have different degrees, so we proceed. Shared connections: 4.
4. Edge (9, 8): Both nodes have different degrees, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
5. Edge (9, 3): Node 9 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
6. Edge (9, 1): Node 9 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
7. Edge (9, 0): Node 0 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
8. Edge (4, 7): Both nodes have different degrees, so we proceed. Shared connections: 0.
9. Edge (4, 1): Node 4 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: 2.
10. Edge (4, 6): Node 6 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
11. Edge (4, 2): Node 4 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: 1.
12. Edge (7, 5): Node 5 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
13. Edge (7, 4): Node 4 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: 0.
14. Edge (7, 0): Node 0 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
15. Edge (7, 3): Node 7 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: 0.
16. Edge (6, 4): Node 4 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
17. Edge (6, 2): Node 6 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
18. Edge (2, 5): Node 2 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: 8.
19. Edge (2, 4): Node 2 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: 1.
20. Edge (2, 6): Node 2 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
21. Edge (2, 8): Node 2 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: 5.
22. Edge (2, 1): Node 2 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: 4.
23. Edge (8, 5): Node 5 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
24. Edge (8, 9): Node 8 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
25. Edge (8, 2): Node 2 has a lower degree, so we skip (as the higher-degree node is first).
26. Edge (8, 3): Node 8 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
27. Edge (8, 1): Node 1 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
28. Edge (0, 9): Node 0 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
29. Edge (0, 7): Node 0 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
30. Edge (0, 3): Node 0 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
31. Edge (0, 1): Node 0 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
32. Edge (3, 9): Node 3 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
33. Edge (3, 7): Node 3 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: 0.
34. Edge (3, 8): Node 3 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
35. Edge (3, 0): Node 0 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
36. Edge (1, 9): Node 1 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
37. Edge (1, 4): Node 1 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: 0.
38. Edge (1, 2): Node 1 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: 4.
39. Edge (1, 8): Node 1 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
40. Edge (1, 0): Node 0 has a lower degree, so we proceed. Shared connections: none.
