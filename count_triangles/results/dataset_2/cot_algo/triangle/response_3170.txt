Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (13, 1) (13, 3) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 0) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) (6, 2) (6, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). The sorted list of vertices with their corresponding degrees is as follows:

(5, 4) (4, 4) (7, 2) (1, 4) (3, 4) (8, 4) (12, 3) (13, 2) (11, 3) (2, 6) (14, 5) (6, 2) (10, 4) (0, 4) (9, 6)

We will now list the number of triangles and unique triangles found:

Total number of triangles: [24]
