Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 22) (1, 27) (21, 0) (21, 26) (21, 15) (0, 21) (0, 22) (0, 18) (27, 1) (27, 28) (27, 3) (10, 26) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 7) (2, 17) (2, 7) (8, 29) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 23) (26, 21) (26, 10) (9, 25) (9, 4) (9, 28) (22, 1) (22, 0) (22, 16) (22, 25) (3, 27) (3, 11) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (5, 13) (5, 24) (5, 20) (13, 19) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 18) (15, 1) (15, 21) (16, 22) (16, 28) (16, 24) (16, 29) (28, 27) (28, 9) (28, 16) (28, 4) (28, 18) (14, 11) (14, 12) (24, 5) (24, 16) (24, 7) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 24) (7, 29) (7, 6) (29, 8) (29, 16) (29, 7) (25, 9) (25, 22) (25, 23) (25, 4) (6, 7) (6, 23) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 25) (4, 20) (20, 5) (20, 4) (20, 18) (23, 19) (23, 25) (23, 6) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 28) (18, 20) (18, 12) (12, 14) (12, 18) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with 30 nodes and 90 edges based on the given information. 

Next, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections (degrees) in increasing order:
0, 16, 29, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 21, 26, 8, 22, 24, 27, 7, 10, 13, 18, 20, 23, 28, 9, 19, 25

Triangles found (vertex labels adjusted to their original values):
[<0, 1, 22>, <1, 15, 27>, <2, 7, 17>, <4, 13, 19>, <4, 18, 28>, <4, 20, 25>, <5, 13, 24>, <7, 16, 24>, <7, 16, 29>, <9, 25, 28>, <11, 13, 19>, <11, 13, 5>, <16, 22, 25>, <18, 20, 28>] 

Total number of triangles: [14]
