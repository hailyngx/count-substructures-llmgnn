Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and the given 40 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
(5, 1), (5, 7),
(9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9 3), (9, 1),
(2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 3), (2, 7), (2, 0),
(8, 9), (8, 6),
(0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 4), (0, 6),
(7, 5), (7, 2), (7, 0), (7, 6),
(1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 4),
(6, 2), (6, 8), (6, 0), (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 4),
(3, 9), (3, 2), (3, 4),
(4, 9), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 3)

Next, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

Nodes Degree 
0: 5
1: 4
3: 3
8: 2
5: 2
7: 4
4: 5
9: 6
2: 6
6: 7

Now, we'll go through the edges and count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Triangles: [6]

Unique Triangles:
<2, 6, 9>
