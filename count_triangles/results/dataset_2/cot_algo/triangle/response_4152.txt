Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 2) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 17) (1, 10) (1, 15) (1, 16) (15, 1) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 12) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 9) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 18) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 12) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 14) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 9) (12, 15) (12, 3) (18, 10) (18, 11) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 16) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 20
Edges: 60
Edge List:
(8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 2) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 17) (1, 10) (1, 15) (1, 16) (15, 1) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 12) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 9) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 18) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 12) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 14) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 9) (12, 15) (12, 3) (18, 10) (18, 11) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 16)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Node 18: degree = 2
Node 13: degree = 2
Node 12: degree = 2
Node 16: degree = 3
Node 8: degree = 3
Node 5: degree = 4
Node 4: degree = 4
Node 0: degree = 4
Node 2: degree = 5
Node 1: degree = 5
Node 17: degree = 5
Node 15: degree = 5
Node 6: degree = 4
Node 3: degree = 6
Node 7: degree = 4
Node 11: degree = 4
Node 14: degree = 5
Node 19: degree = 3
Node 9: degree = 4
Node 10: degree = 6
