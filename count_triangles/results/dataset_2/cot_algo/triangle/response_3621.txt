Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:  

0 (degree 3)  
8 (degree 1)  
6 (degree 4)  
7 (degree 5)  
5 (degree 4)  
3 (degree 5)  
4 (degree 4)  
1 (degree 5)  
9 (degree 4)  
2 (degree 5)  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order:  
(0, 6), (0, 2), (0, 7), (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 7), (4, 9), (4, 3), (4, 5), (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 0), (7, 8), (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 7), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 5), (3, 4), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 8), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 1)  

There are a total of 18 triangles in the given graph:

<3, 4, 5>  
<3, 5, 6>  
<3, 5, 4>  
<3, 7, 1>  
<4, 5, 6>  
<4, 5, 3>  
<5, 7, 1>  
<7, 8, 1>  
<7, 8, 3>
