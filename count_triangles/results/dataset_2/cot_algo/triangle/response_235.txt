Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges:
(3, 6), (25, 5), (25, 21), (22, 23), (22, 10), (23, 22), (23, 26), (23, 17), (23, 13), (7, 2), (12, 24), (12, 19), (19, 12), (19, 24), (26, 23), (26, 5), (26, 11), (5, 25), (5, 26), (5, 8), (5, 21), (13, 23), (13, 9), (28, 0), (28, 14), (28, 18), (28, 15), (9, 13), (9, 24), (9, 1), (29, 27), (29, 16), (29, 0), (27, 29), (27, 11), (27, 2), (18, 28), (18, 21), (6, 3), (6, 17), (6, 15), (6, 8), (17, 23), (17, 6), (17, 16), (17, 0), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 24), (8, 20), (8, 21), (0, 28), (0, 29), (0, 17), (0, 15), (16, 29), (16, 17), (16, 1), (20, 8), (20, 21), (24, 12), (24, 19), (24, 9), (24, 8), (15, 28), (15, 6), (15, 0), (15, 4), (21, 25), (21, 5), (21, 18), (21, 8), (21, 20), (1, 9), (1, 16), (1, 14), (1, 10), (14, 28), (14, 1), (11, 26), (11, 27), (10, 22), (10, 1), (10, 4), (10, 2), (2, 7), (2, 27), (2, 10), (4, 15), (4, 10)

After sorting the vertices based on the number of connections from least to most, the new labeling is as follows:

Nodes: {4, 7, 14, 20, 3, 9, 10, 12, 16, 18, 19, 13, 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 5, 17, 21, 25, 29}

The total number of triangles in the graph is [48], and the unique triangles found are:

<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 17>, <0, 17, 15>, <0, 17, 29>, <0, 15, 4>, <0, 15, 6>, <1, 9, 13>, <1, 9, 24>, <1, 10, 4>, <1, 14, 28>, <2, 10, 7>, <2, 10, 27>, <4, 10, 2>, <4, 10, 7>, <5, 8, 21>, <5, 21, 20>, <5, 21, 25>, <6, 8, 5>, <6, 15, 4>, <6, 15, 15>, <6, 15, 28>, <8, 20, 21>, <10, 22, 23>, <10, 23, 26>, <11, 27, 29>, <13, 9, 24>, <15, 28, 14>, <16, 17, 0>, <19, 12, 24>, <19, 24, 9>, <21, 5, 25>, <23, 22, 10>, <23, 22, 17>, <24, 9, 13>, <24, 9, 1>, <24, 12, 19>, <24, 12, 8>, <24, 19, 12>, <26, 23, 13>, <26, 23, 17>, <27, 2, 7>, <28, 0, 29>, <28, 0, 17>, <28, 0, 15>, <28, 18, 21>, <29, 0, 17>
