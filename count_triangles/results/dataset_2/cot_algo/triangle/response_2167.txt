Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 0) (11, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 14) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their respective connections:

0: 7 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 5 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 5 connections
5: 5 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 6 connections
8: 3 connections
9: 4 connections
10: 4 connections
11: 2 connections
12: 2 connections
13: 4 connections
14: 3 connections

By analyzing the edges and following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is 6, and the unique triangles found are:

<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 13, 4>
<4, 10, 5>
<7, 2, 14>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
