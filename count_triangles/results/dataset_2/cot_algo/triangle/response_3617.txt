Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (10, 15) (10, 12) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 17) (13, 3) (13, 9) (17, 15) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 11) (8, 9) (8, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 4) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 17) (11, 18) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 14) (4, 16) (4, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 20
Edges: 60

Edges:
(0, 11), (0, 5), (0, 6)
(1, 5), (1, 6)
(2, 11), (2, 14)
(3, 9), (3, 13), (3, 14), (3, 18)
(4, 5), (4, 14), (4, 16)
(5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 7)
(6, 0), (6, 1)
(7, 5), (7, 9)
(8, 9), (8, 12)
(9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 13)
(10, 12), (10, 15)
(11, 0), (11, 2), (11, 17), (11, 18)
(12, 8), (12, 10), (12, 14), (12, 17)
(13, 3), (13, 9)
(14, 2), (14, 3), (14, 4), (14, 12)
(15, 10), (15, 17), (15, 18)
(16, 4), (16, 17), (16, 19)
(17, 11), (17, 12), (17, 15), (17, 16)
(18, 3), (18, 11), (18, 15), (18, 19)
(19, 16), (19, 18)

After sorting the nodes by their degree from least to most, the relabeled nodes are:
Nodes: 20
New labeling:  (0 -> 3), (1 -> 4), (2 -> 10), (3 -> 11), (4 -> 12), (5 -> 9), (6 -> 8), (7 -> 15), (8 -> 14), (9 -> 16), (10 -> 7), (11 -> 0), (12 -> 13), (13 -> 17), (14 -> 18), (15 -> 1), (16 -> 19), (17 -> 6), (18 -> 5), (19 -> 2)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles is [15].
Unique triangles found:
<14, 13, 8>
<2, 10, 11>
<3, 9, 13>
<3, 12, 14>
<3, 14, 4>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 16, 17>
<6, 1, 5>
<9, 13, 3>
<9, 13, 8>
