Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 7), (9, 4), (9, 1), (9, 7), (1, 2), (1, 0), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 8), (4, 5), (8, 7), (0, 5)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Start with the edge (6, 9):
   - Node 6 < Node 9 and Node 6 has 3 connections while Node 9 has 4 connections.
   - The shared connections are Node 1 and Node 7, forming a triangle <6, 1, 7>.

2. Next, consider the edge (6, 1):
   - Node 6 < Node 1 and Node 6 has 3 connections while Node 1 has 4 connections.
   - The shared connections are Node 9 and Node 7, forming a triangle <6, 9, 7>.

3. Moving on to the edge (6, 7):
   - Node 6 < Node 7 and Node 6 has 3 connections while Node 7 has 5 connections.
   - The shared connections are Node 9 and Node 1, forming a triangle <6, 9, 1>.

[Total number of triangles: 3]
<Result: [3]>
