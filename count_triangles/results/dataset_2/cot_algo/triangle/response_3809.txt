The edges sorted in ascending order of node degrees are:
(3, 18) (5, 2) (1, 22) (9, 17) (28, 8) (29, 12) (14, 0) (17, 13) (25, 14) (0, 7) (2, 22) (9, 0) (3, 18) (5, 2) (8, 2) (6, 17) (9, 17) (9, 0) (1, 22) (2, 5) (3, 18) (9, 17) (0, 14) (1, 22) (4, 19) (7, 11) (9, 17) (13, 27) (15, 10) (0, 10) (1, 22) (3, 18) (5, 2) (7, 12) (14, 25) (0, 10) (10, 15) (0, 14) (0, 10) (1, 22) (3, 18) (12, 18) (2, 5) (8, 2) (14, 25) (0, 7) (0, 9) (13, 18) (0, 14) (13, 23) (3, 18) (5, 2) (25, 14) (0, 10) (0, 14) (10, 15) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, ...

There are 84 edges listed in the sorted order. 

Now, let's find the triangles:
Triangles: [244]
Unique triangles found:
