The edges are as follows: (6, 21) (6, 20) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (14, 17) (14, 20) (14, 15) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 4) (0, 6) (0, 27) (0, 4) (27, 0) (27, 26) (27, 5) (20, 6) (20, 14) (20, 25) (20, 13) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 19) (25, 12) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 29) (28, 17) (28, 29) (29, 18) (29, 28) (29, 13) (29, 5) (21, 6) (21, 24) (13, 20) (13, 29) (13, 12) (13, 16) (26, 27) (26, 15) (7, 25) (7, 2) (7, 22) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 26) (11, 8) (11, 12) (23, 24) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 16) (19, 25) (19, 8) (19, 3) (5, 27) (5, 29) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 4) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 19) (12, 25) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 24) (24, 21) (24, 23) (24, 12) (24, 1) (1, 9) (1, 24) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 16) (22, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29

Edges: (6, 21), (6, 20), (6, 0), (9, 3), (9, 1), (14, 17), (14, 20), (14, 15), (14, 10), (17, 14), (17, 10), (17, 28), (17, 4), (0, 6), (0, 27), (0, 4), (27, 0), (27, 26), (27, 5), (20, 6), (20, 14), (20, 25), (20, 13), (25, 20), (25, 7), (25, 19), (25, 12), (10, 14), (10, 17), (10, 15), (10, 3), (10, 2), (2, 10), (2, 18), (2, 7), (18, 2), (18, 15), (18, 29), (28, 17), (28, 29), (29, 18), (29, 28), (29, 13), (29, 5), (21, 6), (21, 24), (13, 20), (13, 29), (13, 12), (13, 16), (26, 27), (26, 15), (7, 25), (7, 2), (7, 22), (15, 14), (15, 10), (15, 18), (15, 26), (11, 8), (11, 12), (23, 24), (8, 11), (8, 19), (8, 16), (19, 25), (19, 8), (19, 3), (5, 27), (5, 29), (16, 13), (16, 8), (16, 4), (3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 19), (12, 25), (12, 13), (12, 11), (12, 24), (24, 21), (24, 23), (24, 12), (24, 1), (1, 9), (1, 24), (4, 17), (4, 0), (4, 16), (22, 7)

Next, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph. 

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections and relabeling them accordingly, we find that the vertices are ordered as follows:
(0, 27, 26, 28, 1, 13, 9, 23, 11, 21, 24, 22, 17, 3, 16, 29, 14, 4, 8, 18, 15, 19, 12, 20, 2, 7, 25, 6, 5, 10)

Now, we can proceed with counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The total number of triangles [] is 27.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 3, 19>
<1, 9, 24>
<2, 7, 25>
<3, 10, 14>
<3, 8, 16>
<4, 13, 19>
<4, 16, 17>
<7, 18, 25>
<10, 14, 17>
<10, 15, 18>
<10, 15, 26>
<11, 12, 24>
<12, 13, 29>
<13, 16, 8>
<15, 18, 29>
<21, 24, 1>
<26, 27, 5>
<6, 20, 14>
<6, 20, 25>
<6, 20, 13>
<6, 20, 14>
<6, 20, 25>
<18, 2, 7>
<24, 21, 6>
<24, 12, 25>
