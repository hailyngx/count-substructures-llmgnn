Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 6) (0, 12) (0, 19) (14, 6) (2, 12) (2, 19) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 1) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 10) (4, 1) (18, 4) (18, 3) (3, 11) (3, 18) (3, 17) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 4) (15, 8) (15, 10) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 15) (10, 7) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 6) (9, 16) (7, 10) (7, 13) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 19) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 5) (5, 8) (5, 17) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 13) (13, 16) (13, 7) (13, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles starts by sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. 

Based on the provided graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, the sorted list of vertices based on the number of connections is as follows:
Vertices: [11, 16, 3, 4, 6, 10, 1, 12, 19, 8, 13, 17, 0, 18, 7, 15, 2, 14, 5, 9]

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Counting the number of triangles and listing unique triangles:
Total number of triangles: [10]
Unique triangles: <3, 11, 18>, <6, 16, 17>, <4, 10, 15>, <6, 12, 16>, <7, 13, 19>, <1, 4, 8>, <4, 10, 15>, <0, 12, 16>, <4, 8, 10>, <0, 2, 19>
