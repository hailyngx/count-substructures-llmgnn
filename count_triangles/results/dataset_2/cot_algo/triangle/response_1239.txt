Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 19) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 16) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 1) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 17) (11, 3) (11, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (5, 18) (5, 17) (1, 18) (1, 10) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 19) (14, 16) (14, 10) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 10) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 17) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 15) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 15) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 15) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree and then relabelling them accordingly. Let's do this for the given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges.

The degrees of the nodes are:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 2
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 5
Node 11: degree 2
Node 12: degree 2
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 2
Node 15: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4
Node 17: degree 3
Node 18: degree 4
Node 19: degree 5

Relabelling the nodes:
Node 0 -> 1
Node 1 -> 2
Node 2 -> 0
Node 3 -> 3
Node 4 -> 4
Node 5 -> 5
Node 6 -> 8
Node 7 -> 6
Node 8 -> 7
Node 9 -> 11
Node 10 -> 12
Node 11 -> 9
Node 12 -> 13
Node 13 -> 10
Node 14 -> 14
Node 15 -> 15
Node 16 -> 16
Node 17 -> 17
Node 18 -> 18
Node 19 -> 19

Edges after relabelling:
(1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 19) (4, 1) (4, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 12) (13, 6) (13, 16) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 11) (0, 3) (18, 0) (18, 5) (18, 2) (3, 18) (3, 17) (3, 9) (17, 3) (17, 11) (11, 1) (11, 6) (5, 18) (5, 9) (2, 18) (2, 12) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 19) (14, 16) (14, 12) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 12) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 17) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 8) (19, 16) (19, 15) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 15) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 15) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 16)
