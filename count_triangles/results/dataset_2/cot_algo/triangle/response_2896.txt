Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 8) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 13) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 14) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 13) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
Nodes sorted by the number of connections: <br>
Node 7: 1 connection <br>
Node 13: 3 connections <br>
Nodes 5, 10, 12: 4 connections <br>
Nodes 0, 1, 4, 14: 5 connections <br>
Nodes 2, 3, 11: 6 connections <br>
Nodes 6, 9, 8: 7 connections <br>
