Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 3) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 0) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 12) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 7) (0, 11) (0, 13) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
(5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10)
(9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7)
(6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 13)
(10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13)
(11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8)
(4, 8) (4, 2)
(8, 14) (8, 3)
(3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12)
(13, 1) (13, 0)
(12, 2) (12, 14)
(2, 4)
(14, 12)
(7, 1)

Now, let's find the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices and their degrees:
0: 2, 1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 3, 4: 3, 5: 5, 6: 4, 7: 5, 8: 4, 9: 4, 10: 4, 11: 5, 12: 3, 13: 4, 14: 4

Sorted vertices by degrees:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 13, 14, 6, 8, 10, 9, 7, 5, 11

Triangles found: 
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 8, 11>
<9, 5, 6>
<7, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [4]
