Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 3) (5, 13) (6, 10) (6, 0) (4, 2) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (0, 6) (14, 7) (14, 12) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 19) (1, 13) (1, 10) (17, 9) (17, 7) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 16) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 15) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 16) (12, 3) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 12) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 3) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 15) (11, 4) (3, 18) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us efficiently count the number of triangles in the given graph.

The vertices are labeled with the number of connections they have in parenthesis:

(0) - 6, 10
(1) - 10, 13
(2) - 4, 8, 12, 18
(3) - 9, 12, 18, 19
(4) - 2, 11, 16, 18
(5) - 13
(6) - 0, 10
(7) - 14, 15, 17
(8) - 2, 9
(9) - 3, 8, 16, 17
(10) - 1, 6, 13, 15
(11) - 4
(12) - 2, 3, 14, 16
(13) - 1, 5, 10, 19
(14) - 7, 12
(15) - 7, 10, 16, 19
(16) - 4, 9, 12, 15, 18
(17) - 7, 9
(18) - 2, 3, 4, 16
(19) - 3, 13, 15

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles]: [14]

<0, 2, 6>
<0, 6, 10>
<1, 13, 15>
<1, 13, 19>
<2, 4, 16>
<2, 8, 9>
<2, 12, 16>
<3, 9, 16>
<3, 9, 18>
<3, 12, 16>
<3, 12, 18>
<4, 12, 16>
<7, 9, 17>
<10, 13, 15>
