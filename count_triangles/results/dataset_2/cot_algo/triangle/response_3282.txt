Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 4) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 4) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 12) (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 10) (10, 11) (10, 1) (8, 11) (8, 14) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 7) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 6) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 4) (4, 16) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 6) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 0) (12, 15) (12, 13) (19, 9) (19, 6)
