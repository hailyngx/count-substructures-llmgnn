Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their degrees.
After relabeling the vertices accordingly, the sorted list becomes:
Node 5 (degree 4)
Node 1 (degree 4)
Node 3 (degree 4)
Node 4 (degree 4)
Node 8 (degree 3)
Node 6 (degree 3)
Node 0 (degree 6)
Node 2 (degree 3)
Node 9 (degree 5)
Node 7 (degree 5)

To count the triangles:
1. Start with the edge (5, 9). Since 5 has fewer connections than 9, proceed.
   Shared connections between 5 and 9: (0, 7)
   Triangle formed: <5, 9, 0>, <5, 9, 7>
   
2. Move to the next edge (5, 0). 5 has fewer connections than 0, proceed.
   Shared connections between 5 and 0: (7, 9)
   Triangle formed: <5, 0, 7>, <5, 0, 9>
   
3. Continue this process for all edges to identify and count the triangles formed.  

After examining all edges, the total number of triangles found is [22].
The unique triangles found are:
<5, 9, 0>, <5, 9, 7>, <5, 0, 7>, <5, 0, 9>, <9, 1, 7>, <9, 1, 0>, <9, 7, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 0, 2>, <6, 0, 7>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 0>, <7, 1, 8>, <7, 8, 4>, <7, 9, 1>
