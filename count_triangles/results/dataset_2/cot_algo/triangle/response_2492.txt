Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 21) (9, 20) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 14) (21, 9) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 12) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 19) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 22) (26, 11) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 27) (11, 3) (11, 26) (11, 6) (11, 23) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 27) (4, 13) (27, 6) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 23) (16, 21) (16, 28) (28, 16) (28, 15) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 20) (15, 28) (15, 22) (15, 24) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 24) (17, 7) (23, 25) (23, 11) (23, 27) (23, 18) (0, 17) (2, 9) (2, 10) (12, 21) (12, 6) (12, 8) (29, 1) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 8) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (14, 1) (14, 27) (14, 20) (22, 25) (22, 15) (20, 9) (20, 1) (20, 10) (20, 14) (18, 13) (18, 23) (19, 3) (19, 13) (24, 15) (24, 17) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly.

The sorted list of vertices based on their connections is as follows:
0 → 1 → 29 → 16 → 28 → 15 → 22 → 24 → 18 → 10 → 2 → 12 → 7 → 26 → 6 → 13 → 8 → 20 → 14 → 3 → 11 → 25 → 23 → 27 → 4 → 17 → 21 → 5 → 9

By following the method, we will check each edge and count the number of triangles formed.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [58].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 9, 20>
<1, 9, 21>
<1, 20, 21>
<1, 14, 27>
<16, 21, 28>
<17, 3, 7>
<17, 3, 24>
<18, 13, 19>
<20, 9, 21>
<22, 15, 24>
