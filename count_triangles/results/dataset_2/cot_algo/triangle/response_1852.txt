Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 8) (9, 29) (9, 21) (9, 17) (9, 1) (26, 6) (20, 11) (20, 25) (20, 13) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 8) (25, 12) (25, 22) (15, 23) (15, 0) (15, 24) (28, 29) (28, 24) (29, 9) (29, 28) (29, 22) (29, 18) (29, 10) (22, 25) (22, 29) (22, 8) (3, 23) (21, 9) (21, 13) (27, 25) (27, 5) (0, 15) (0, 10) (0, 17) (10, 29) (10, 0) (10, 18) (2, 12) (12, 25) (12, 2) (12, 5) (24, 11) (24, 15) (24, 28) (6, 26) (6, 23) (5, 27) (5, 12) (5, 17) (1, 11) (1, 9) (1, 8) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 19) (13, 20) (13, 21) (13, 4) (13, 23) (13, 14) (7, 8) (14, 13) (14, 23) (23, 15) (23, 3) (23, 6) (23, 13) (23, 14) (4, 13) (4, 19) (19, 20) (19, 17) (19, 4) (18, 11) (18, 29) (18, 10) (8, 16) (8, 25) (8, 22) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's organize the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges.
Let's create a Degree-Based Ordering to sort the vertices and label them accordingly.

Nodes by degree:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 1
Node 8: degree 5
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 6
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 5
Node 14: degree 2
Node 15: degree 3
Node 16: degree 2
Node 17: degree 4
Node 18: degree 3
Node 19: degree 3
Node 20: degree 4
Node 21: degree 2
Node 22: degree 3
Node 23: degree 5
Node 24: degree 4
Node 25: degree 5
Node 26: degree 1
Node 27: degree 2
Node 28: degree 2
Node 29: degree 5

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we relabel the nodes:
Nodes by label:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 1
Node 8: degree 5
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 6
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 5
Node 14: degree 2
Node 15: degree 3
Node 16: degree 2
Node 17: degree 4
Node 18: degree 3
Node 19: degree 3
Node 20: degree 4
Node 21: degree 2
Node 22: degree 3
Node 23: degree 5
Node 24: degree 4
Node 25: degree 5
Node 26: degree 1
Node 27: degree 2
Node 28: degree 2
Node 29: degree 5

Now, we will count the number of triangles:
From the given edges, we can identify the triangles as follows: 
[Total number of triangles: 13]
<1, 8, 25>, <1, 11, 20>, <1, 11, 24>, <1, 8, 11>, <1, 9, 29>, <4, 13, 20>, <4, 13, 23>, <8, 16, 25>, <9, 10, 29>, <9, 18, 29>, <9, 21, 13>, <13, 20, 25>, <15, 23, 6>
