Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 9) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 0) (15, 18) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 18) (10, 3) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 1) (18, 15) (18, 13) (19, 2) (19, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 4) (17, 3) (17, 9) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 2) (4, 1) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 13) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections, relabeling them accordingly, and then checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to find triangles.

After sorting the nodes by their degree in increasing order, the new labeling of the nodes are as follows:

Node 5: degree 1
Node 6: degree 1
Node 8: degree 1
Node 11: degree 1
Node 15: degree 1
Node 17: degree 1
Node 19: degree 1
Node 0: degree 2
Node 3: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 1
Node 18: degree 2
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5
Node 4: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4

Now, we can go through each edge and count the triangles:

Triangles: [220]
Unique triangles: <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 5, 15>, <0, 5, 13>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 6, 15>, <0, 6, 13>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 15>, <0, 2, 13>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 15>, <0, 4, 13...
