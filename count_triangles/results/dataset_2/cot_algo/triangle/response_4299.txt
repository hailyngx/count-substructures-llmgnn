Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 9) (7, 13) (21, 11) (12, 25) (12, 15) (12, 26) (27, 24) (5, 6) (5, 26) (5, 18) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 18) (28, 6) (28, 10) (13, 7) (13, 26) (13, 1) (26, 12) (26, 5) (26, 13) (4, 15) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 25) (16, 17) (16, 22) (16, 23) (16, 15) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 23) (29, 22) (29, 3) (2, 23) (2, 14) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 29) (22, 25) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 8) (10, 28) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 25) (11, 21) (11, 24) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 14) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 19) (18, 8) (3, 5) (3, 29) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 14) (14, 2) (14, 24) (14, 3) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 15) (20, 23) (23, 16) (23, 9) (23, 2) (23, 20) (25, 12) (25, 6) (25, 19) (25, 22) (25, 10) (8, 0) (8, 18) (8, 17) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 16) (15, 17) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method sorts the vertices by the number of connections they have from least to most. The graph vertices with their corresponding degrees are as follows:

0: 4  
2: 4  
4: 2  
7: 3  
11: 2  
20: 1  
27: 1  
19: 4  
29: 3  
8: 3  
14: 3  
10: 4  
21: 2  
24: 4  
1: 3  
9: 3  
13: 3  
3: 5  
5: 4  
6: 5  
12: 3  
15: 4  
16: 4  
17: 3  
18: 4  
22: 4  
23: 4  
25: 5  
26: 4  
28: 3  

Now, we will go through each edge and only consider the ones where the edge connects a vertex with lower label to a vertex with a higher label and count the number of triangles they form.

The total number of triangles is [98].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 1, 13>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 10>
<0, 3, 29>
<1, 9, 13>
<2, 14, 24>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 18>
<3, 5, 26>
<3, 10, 29>
<5, 6, 18>
<5, 6, 25>
<5, 6, 26>
<5, 18, 19>
<6, 25, 26>
<10, 25, 28>
<15, 16, 17>
<15, 16, 22>
<15, 17, 18>
<15, 17, 22>
<16, 17, 22>
<16, 17, 23>
<16, 17, 25>
<16, 22, 25>
<16, 23, 25>
