Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their connections are as follows:  
Node 5, Node 9, Node 1, Node 4, Node 8, Node 6, Node 3, Node 0, Node 7, Node 2.

Counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- (1, 3) shares a connection 5 forming a triangle <1, 3, 5>.
- (1, 9) shares a connection 6 forming a triangle <1, 9, 6>.
- (2, 3) shares a connection 0 forming a triangle <2, 3, 0>.
- (2, 5) shares a connection 3 forming a triangle <2, 5, 3>.
- (2, 7) shares a connection 6 forming a triangle <2, 7, 6>.
- (3, 5) shares a connection 4 forming a triangle <3, 5, 4>.
- (3, 6) shares a connection 4 forming a triangle <3, 6, 4>.
- (4, 6) shares a connection 9 forming a triangle <4, 6, 9>.
- (5, 1) shares a connection 3 forming a triangle <5, 1, 3>.
- (5, 2) shares a connection 3 forming a triangle <5, 2, 3>.
- (5, 4) shares a connection 6 forming a triangle <5, 4, 6>.
- (8, 1) shares a connection 5 forming a triangle <8, 1, 5>.
- (9, 1) shares a connection 6 forming a triangle <9, 1, 6>.
- (9, 4) shares a connection 6 forming a triangle <9, 4, 6>.

The total number of triangles inside brackets is [14].
