Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 19) (22, 13) (22, 27) (22, 11) (22, 12) (8, 23) (8, 28) (8, 25) (8, 17) (23, 8) (23, 24) (2, 18) (2, 14) (2, 21) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 5) (1, 26) (1, 16) (1, 10) (26, 1) (26, 21) (0, 14) (0, 21) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 4) (4, 18) (4, 14) (15, 2) (15, 16) (20, 6) (21, 2) (21, 26) (21, 0) (21, 28) (28, 8) (28, 21) (28, 24) (17, 8) (17, 25) (17, 5) (17, 7) (25, 8) (25, 17) (25, 5) (25, 10) (25, 24) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 25) (10, 29) (3, 7) (3, 6) (7, 17) (7, 3) (24, 23) (24, 28) (24, 25) (6, 20) (6, 3) (6, 29) (6, 11) (29, 10) (29, 6) (29, 19) (19, 13) (19, 29) (19, 12) (27, 22) (27, 11) (27, 16) (9, 16) (16, 1) (16, 15) (16, 27) (16, 9) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 25) (5, 11) (11, 22) (11, 6) (11, 27) (11, 5) (12, 22) (12, 19) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(0, 14), (0, 21), (1, 26), (1, 16), (2, 18), (2, 14), (2, 21), (2, 15), (3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 18), (4, 14), (5, 18), (5, 17), (5, 25), (5, 11), (6, 20), (6, 3), (6, 29), (6, 11), (7, 17), (7, 3), (8, 23), (8, 28), (8, 25), (8, 17), (9, 16), (10, 13), (10, 1), (10, 25), (10, 29), (11, 22), (11, 6), (11, 27), (11, 5), (12, 22), (12, 19), (13, 22), (13, 10), (13, 19), (14, 2), (14, 0), (14, 4), (15, 2), (15, 16), (16, 1), (16, 15), (16, 27), (16, 9), (17, 8), (17, 25), (17, 5), (17, 7), (18, 2), (18, 4), (18, 5), (19, 13), (19, 29), (19, 12), (20, 6), (21, 2), (21, 26), (21, 0), (21, 28), (22, 13), (22, 27), (22, 11), (22, 12), (23, 8), (23, 24), (24, 23), (24, 28), (24, 25), (25, 8), (25, 17), (25, 5), (25, 10), (25, 24), (26, 1), (26, 21), (27, 22), (27, 11), (27, 16), (28, 8), (28, 21), (28, 24), (29, 10), (29, 6), (29, 19)

Next, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes by degree: 9, 5, 20, 0, 15, 3, 7, 4, 12, 6, 10, 13, 14, 1, 2, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 8, 11

Now, let's find the triangles based on the unique connections between nodes with lower labels:
Triangles: <0, 2, 14>, <7, 17, 25>, <6, 11, 27>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
