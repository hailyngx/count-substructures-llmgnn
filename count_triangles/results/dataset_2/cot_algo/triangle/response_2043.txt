Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees from lowest to highest. The degrees of each vertex in this graph are as follows: 

Node 5: 3 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections

Given the degrees of the nodes in sorted order, we will find and count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 2]
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 4>
