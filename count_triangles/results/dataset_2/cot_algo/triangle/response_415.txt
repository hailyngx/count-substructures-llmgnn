Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 9) (15, 24) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 8) (4, 1) (4, 29) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 10) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 0) (22, 16) (22, 0) (22, 3) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 8) (20, 24) (25, 20) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 24) (28, 10) (29, 4) (29, 28) (29, 13) (29, 5) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 27) (8, 20) (8, 2) (8, 9) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 9) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 11) (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 26) (1, 4) (1, 20) (1, 12) (17, 13) (6, 18) (6, 21) (21, 6) (21, 13) (21, 23) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 19) (13, 29) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 16) (23, 26) (23, 21) (23, 14) (14, 23) (14, 12) (16, 22) (16, 13) (16, 5) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 10) (3, 7) (3, 22) (3, 0) (0, 18) (0, 22) (0, 3) (0, 5) (10, 7) (10, 28) (10, 12) (24, 15) (24, 20) (24, 28) (5, 29) (5, 16) (5, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections they have, from least to most connections. After relabeling the vertices accordingly, we can proceed with counting the number of triangles.

The vertices with their corresponding degrees are as follows:
- Vertex 11: degree 3
- Vertex 17: degree 1
- Vertex 26: degree 3
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 21: degree 3
- Vertex 27: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 3
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 18: degree 3
- Vertex 28: degree 3
- Vertex 29: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 8: degree 4
- Vertex 9: degree 3
- Vertex 13: degree 4
- Vertex 14: degree 2
- Vertex 16: degree 3
- Vertex 5: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 12: degree 3
- Vertex 19: degree 4
- Vertex 0: degree 4
- Vertex 23: degree 3
- Vertex 10: degree 3
- Vertex 25: degree 1
- Vertex 22: degree 3
- Vertex 20: degree 4
- Vertex 24: degree 3
- Vertex 15: degree 4

Based on the degrees of the vertices, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph. After calculating, the total number of triangles is found to be [20].

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 1, 20>
<4, 28, 11>
<4, 29, 13>
<6, 18, 19>
<8, 2, 9>
<11, 19, 26>
<13, 21, 23>
<15, 24, 20>
<15, 27, 8>
<18, 0, 22>
<20, 24, 28>
<21, 6, 18>
<22, 3, 0>
<23, 21, 13>
<24, 15, 27>
<26, 19, 11>
<29, 5, 16>
<29, 13, 21>
<29, 4, 28>
