Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 4) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we follow these steps:

1. Construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:
- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
- Edges: (6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 4), (9, 2), (9, 11), (9, 10), (9, 13), (1, 3), (1, 10), (1, 13), (1, 4), (3, 5), (3, 12), (8, 5), (13, 14), (10, 11), (7, 12), (7, 14), (12, 2), (0, 11), (0, 14), (5, 7)

2. Sort the nodes by their number of connections:
Node Degrees: [(0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 6), (10, 4), (11, 5), (12, 3), (13, 4), (14, 4)]

3. Relabel the vertices according to their degrees (lowest degree to highest degree):
New Labels: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 7, 3: 6, 4: 5, 5: 4, 6: 2, 7: 3, 8: 3, 9: 8, 10: 4, 11: 5, 12: 3, 13: 4, 14: 4}

4. Count the triangles by analyzing the edges:
- Triangle 1: <1, 4, 10>
- Triangle 2: <3, 5, 12>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
