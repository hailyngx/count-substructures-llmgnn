Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 13) (21, 7) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 17) (4, 8) (4, 28) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 11) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 14) (26, 2) (19, 26) (19, 13) (17, 7) (17, 20) (17, 23) (20, 1) (20, 17) (20, 27) (20, 5) (5, 26) (5, 20) (5, 23) (0, 16) (0, 24) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 9) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 25) (25, 16) (25, 6) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 10) (28, 4) (28, 8) (28, 27) (28, 15) (9, 0) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 13) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 22) (11, 6) (2, 26) (2, 6) (23, 17) (23, 5) (6, 25) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 22) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 0) (13, 18) (24, 0) (24, 22) (24, 10) (24, 15) (22, 11) (22, 6) (22, 24) (22, 10) (22, 3) (15, 28) (15, 18) (15, 24) (3, 16) (3, 22) (3, 27) (27, 20) (27, 28) (27, 3) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 24) (10, 22) 

Response:
The vertices can be sorted based on their degree as follows:
Nodes with degree 1: [9, 29]
Nodes with degree 2: [7, 19, 23, 27]
Nodes with degree 3: [4, 5, 13, 15, 18, 20, 21, 28]
Nodes with degree 4: [0, 2, 3, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 24, 25, 26]
Nodes with degree 5: [1, 10, 22]
Nodes with degree 6: []
Nodes with degree 7: []
Nodes with degree 8: []
Nodes with degree 9: []
Nodes with degree 10: [30]

Now, we will count the triangles by iterating through the edges where the lower labeled vertices have fewer connections:
