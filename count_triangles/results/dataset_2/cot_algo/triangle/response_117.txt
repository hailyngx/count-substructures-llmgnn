Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 3) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 9 has degree 4  
Node 7 has degree 3  
Node 10 has degree 3  
Node 14 has degree 3  
Node 0 has degree 4  
Node 2 has degree 2  
Node 3 has degree 4  
Node 5 has degree 4  
Node 6 has degree 4  
Node 1 has degree 3  
Node 12 has degree 4  
Node 8 has degree 5  
Node 11 has degree 6  
Node 13 has degree 6  
Node 4 has degree 6  

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method and checking for shared connections, we find the triangles:
