Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 11) (22, 5) (22, 3) (3, 22) (3, 15) (3, 20) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 4) (14, 6) (14, 28) (14, 9) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 21) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 27) (4, 25) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 28) (21, 17) (21, 28) (21, 23) (28, 14) (28, 8) (28, 21) (28, 26) (26, 28) (26, 23) (27, 17) (27, 4) (27, 18) (5, 22) (5, 19) (19, 13) (19, 8) (19, 5) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 9) (16, 29) (16, 6) (23, 21) (23, 26) (23, 18) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 2) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 20) (1, 13) (1, 29) (1, 20) (29, 16) (29, 1) (29, 25) (6, 14) (6, 16) (6, 24) (24, 17) (24, 6) (2, 0) (2, 10) (20, 3) (20, 10) (20, 1) (18, 3) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 23) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 7) (11, 13) (11, 22) (11, 12) (12, 0) (12, 11) (25, 4) (25, 29) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order. Let's relabel the nodes accordingly and count the triangles:

Node degrees (in descending order):  
Node 13 has degree 5  
Node 22 has degree 4  
Node 4 has degree 4  
Node 28 has degree 4  
Node 18 has degree 4  
Node 10 has degree 4  
Node 3 has degree 4  
Node 1 has degree 3  
Node 5 has degree 3  
Node 9 has degree 3  
Node 14 has degree 3  
Node 17 has degree 3  
Node 20 has degree 3  
Node 23 has degree 3  
Node 27 has degree 3  
Node 6 has degree 3  
Node 29 has degree 3  
Node 8 has degree 3  
Node 0 has degree 3  
Node 26 has degree 2  
Node 12 has degree 2  
Node 21 has degree 2  
Node 24 has degree 2  
Node 2 has degree 2  
Node 7 has degree 2  
Node 16 has degree 2  
Node 25 has degree 2  
Node 11 has degree 2  
Node 15 has degree 2  

As per the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

1. For each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:  
   - (13, 22) forms triangle with 3  
   - (13, 11) forms triangle with 3  
   - (22, 11) forms triangle with 3  
   Total count: 3 triangles

2. Unique triangles found:  
   - <13, 22, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] in the given graph.
