Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 13) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 10) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 12) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied to count the number of triangles in this graph. 

First, let's sort the nodes by their degrees from least to most:
Nodes: 11, 8, 3, 14, 13, 9, 1, 0, 12, 10, 5, 6, 2, 7, 4

Now, let's relabel the nodes accordingly:
11 -> 0
8 -> 1
3 -> 2
14 -> 3
13 -> 4
9 -> 5
1 -> 6
0 -> 7
12 -> 8
10 -> 9
5 -> 10
6 -> 11
2 -> 12
7 -> 13
4 -> 14
  
After relabeling, we have the following edges according to the new labels:
(4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 13) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 6) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 9) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 10) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5)

Now, let's count the number of triangles:
[15]

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 6, 10>
