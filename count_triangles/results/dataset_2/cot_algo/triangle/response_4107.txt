Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 27) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 24) (9, 3) (18, 9) (18, 22) (18, 23) (22, 18) (22, 12) (8, 9) (8, 23) (8, 24) (23, 18) (23, 8) (23, 1) (23, 29) (5, 6) (5, 17) (5, 10) (2, 24) (2, 28) (2, 25) (4, 20) (4, 29) (11, 28) (11, 14) (11, 1) (28, 2) (28, 11) (28, 14) (17, 5) (17, 20) (17, 21) (20, 4) (20, 17) (20, 27) (20, 14) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 26) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 13) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 24) (14, 11) (14, 28) (14, 20) (14, 12) (12, 22) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 19) (3, 9) (3, 0) (29, 23) (29, 4) (29, 25) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 16) (24, 15) (1, 23) (1, 11) (1, 19) (15, 24) (15, 25) (26, 0) (26, 25) (21, 17) (21, 27) (27, 6) (27, 20) (27, 21) (10, 5) (13, 7) (13, 19) (25, 2) (25, 29) (25, 15) (25, 26) (19, 12) (19, 1) (19, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections). Let's label the nodes based on their degree in increasing order:

- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 10: 3 connections
- Node 21: 3 connections
- Node 27: 3 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 17: 3 connections
- Node 13: 3 connections
- Node 15: 3 connections
- Node 26: 3 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 11: 4 connections
- Node 14: 4 connections
- Node 19: 4 connections
- Node 25: 4 connections
- Node 3: 5 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 8: 5 connections
- Node 9: 5 connections
- Node 18: 5 connections
- Node 22: 5 connections
- Node 12: 5 connections
- Node 24: 6 connections
- Node 20: 6 connections
- Node 28: 6 connections
- Node 23: 6 connections
- Node 29: 6 connections

Now, we will go through the edges considering the lower labeled node to count triangles:

- Triangle <6, 9, 24>
- Triangle <9, 18, 23>
- Triangle <9, 8, 23>
- Triangle <9, 3, 0>
- Triangle <9, 3, 29>
- Triangle <9, 24, 16>
- Triangle <18, 22, 12>
- Triangle <8, 24, 16>
- Triangle <8, 23, 1>
- Triangle <5, 6, 27>
- Triangle <5, 6, 17>
- Triangle <4, 20, 14>
- Triangle <11, 28, 14>
- Triangle <11, 28, 2>
- Triangle <11, 14, 12>
- Triangle <28, 2, 24>
- Triangle <17, 5, 10>
- Triangle <17, 5, 21>
- Triangle <17, 20, 14>
- Triangle <20, 4, 27>
- Triangle <20, 4, 29>
- Triangle <20, 27, 21>
- Triangle <0, 3, 26>
- Triangle <0, 7, 13>
- Triangle <7, 16, 12>
- Triangle <16, 24, 15>
- Triangle <14, 12, 19>
- Triangle <12, 22, 19>
- Triangle <3, 9, 0>
- Triangle <3, 9, 29>
- Triangle <29, 25, 15>
- Triangle <23, 1, 19>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [31].
