Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
Let's first sort the vertices by their degree and relabel them accordingly:

Node 5: 4 edges
Node 6: 4 edges
Node 9: 4 edges
Node 1: 4 edges
Node 3: 4 edges
Node 4: 4 edges
Node 7: 5 edges
Node 8: 5 edges
Node 0: 5 edges
Node 2: 5 edges

Now, based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can go through the edges to count the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 8>
<3, 2, 4>
<3, 2, 7>
