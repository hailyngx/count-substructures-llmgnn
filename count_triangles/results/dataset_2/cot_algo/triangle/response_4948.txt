Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) 

Response:
The graph consists of the following edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, 8

By sorting the nodes based on their connections in non-decreasing order, we get the following order:
0 < 4 < 7 < 3, 8 < 1, 6 < 2 < 5 < 9

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles found in the graph are:
[9]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9]. And the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 9>.
