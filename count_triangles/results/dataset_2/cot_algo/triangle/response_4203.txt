Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 5), (4, 2), (7, 3), (7, 9), (7, 5), (7, 1), (7, 8), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 9), (1, 0), (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 5), (6, 9), (6, 0), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 1), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 0), (8, 4), (8, 7), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 3), (5, 2), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 9), (2, 4), (2, 1), (2, 9), (2, 5)

Now, we'll apply the Degree-Based Ordering method and count the number of triangles.

Degree-Based Ordering (from least to most connections):
0(3) < 6(2) < 8(2) < 5(3) < 2(4) < 9(6) < 1(5) < 3(4) < 7(5) < 4(4)

Triangles:
1. <4, 8, 9>
2. <4, 5, 9>
3. <4, 5, 2>
4. <7, 3, 1>
5. <7, 3, 5>
6. <1, 3, 0>

Total number of triangles: [6]
