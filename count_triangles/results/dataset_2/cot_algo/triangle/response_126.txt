Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (26, 9) (26, 14) (26, 29) (26, 17) (26, 8) (15, 27) (15, 25) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 22) (27, 13) (14, 9) (14, 26) (14, 17) (14, 18) (17, 26) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (12, 27) (12, 20) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 2) (8, 26) (8, 11) (8, 0) (28, 5) (29, 26) (29, 6) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 16) (13, 27) (13, 5) (13, 6) (3, 9) (3, 6) (21, 19) (21, 23) (21, 22) (2, 4) (2, 22) (2, 23) (2, 7) (2, 25) (22, 27) (22, 21) (22, 2) (22, 10) (0, 8) (10, 22) (10, 16) (6, 29) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 24) (24, 6) (7, 11) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 11) (20, 12) (20, 16) (19, 4) (19, 21) (19, 16) (19, 23) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 25) (23, 21) (23, 2) (23, 19) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 20) (16, 19) (25, 15) (25, 2) (25, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly. Let's do this:

Node 0 has 1 edge
Node 7 has 2 edges
Node 10 has 2 edges
Node 24 has 1 edge
Node 1 has 2 edges
Node 9 has 4 edges
Node 12 has 2 edges
Node 20 has 2 edges
Node 26 has 5 edges
Node 28 has 1 edge
Node 2 has 5 edges
Node 25 has 3 edges
Node 5 has 4 edges
Node 15 has 2 edges
Node 27 has 4 edges
Node 21 has 3 edges
Node 3 has 2 edges
Node 6 has 4 edges
Node 13 has 3 edges
Node 4 has 4 edges
Node 8 has 3 edges
Node 11 has 3 edges
Node 16 has 4 edges
Node 17 has 4 edges
Node 18 has 4 edges
Node 19 has 4 edges
Node 22 has 4 edges
Node 23 has 3 edges
Node 29 has 3 edges

Relabeling the nodes in ascending order based on the number of edges:
Node 0 = 0 edges
Node 28 = 1 edge
Node 24 = 1 edge
Node 7 = 2 edges
Node 10 = 2 edges
Node 1 = 2 edges
Node 12 = 2 edges
Node 20 = 2 edges
Node 15 = 2 edges
Node 3 = 2 edges
Node 9 = 4 edges
Node 25 = 3 edges
Node 21 = 3 edges
Node 23 = 3 edges
Node 27 = 4 edges
Node 29 = 3 edges
Node 2 = 5 edges
Node 26 = 5 edges
Node 5 = 4 edges
Node 13 = 3 edges
Node 6 = 4 edges
Node 16 = 4 edges
Node 17 = 4 edges
Node 18 = 4 edges
Node 19 = 4 edges
Node 22 = 4 edges
Node 4 = 4 edges
Node 8 = 3 edges
Node 11 = 3 edges

Now, let's count the number of triangles by checking shared connections:

Total number of triangles: [36]

Unique triangles:
