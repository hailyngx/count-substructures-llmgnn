Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 28) (26, 9) (26, 14) (26, 5) (26, 23) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 16) (27, 22) (27, 11) (27, 28) (7, 25) (7, 3) (7, 23) (7, 1) (21, 12) (21, 2) (21, 24) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 14) (22, 9) (22, 27) (22, 18) (22, 14) (22, 29) (2, 21) (2, 18) (2, 16) (5, 26) (5, 8) (5, 17) (6, 15) (6, 23) (6, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 20) (28, 9) (28, 27) (28, 29) (28, 20) (29, 22) (29, 28) (29, 3) (8, 15) (8, 5) (8, 6) (11, 27) (11, 17) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 0) (14, 26) (14, 18) (14, 22) (23, 26) (23, 7) (23, 6) (23, 24) (24, 21) (24, 23) (24, 20) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 29) (17, 5) (17, 11) (17, 19) (19, 25) (19, 17) (19, 10) (20, 4) (20, 28) (20, 24) (20, 10) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 25) (1, 10) (0, 25) (12, 21) (16, 15) (16, 2) (10, 19) (10, 20) (10, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method works as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:
   - Node 0: degree 1
   - Node 12: degree 1
   - Node 9: degree 2
   - Node 15: degree 3
   - Node 26: degree 4
   - Node 5: degree 3
   - Node 6: degree 3
   - Node 7: degree 4
   - Node 21: degree 3
   - Node 18: degree 4
   - Node 22: degree 5
   - Node 2: degree 3
   - Node 27: degree 3
   - Node 14: degree 4
   - Node 23: degree 4
   - Node 24: degree 3
   - Node 4: degree 3
   - Node 28: degree 4
   - Node 29: degree 3
   - Node 8: degree 3
   - Node 11: degree 2
   - Node 25: degree 4
   - Node 3: degree 4
   - Node 17: degree 3
   - Node 19: degree 3
   - Node 20: degree 4
   - Node 1: degree 4
   - Node 10: degree 3

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   - Node 0 -> Node 0 (degree 1)
   - Node 12 -> Node 1 (degree 1)
   - Node 9 -> Node 2 (degree 2)
   - Node 15 -> Node 3 (degree 3)
   - ...
   - Node 1 -> Node 27 (degree 4)
   - Node 10 -> Node 28 (degree 3)

3. Using the sorted vertices, count the number of triangles:
   - 66 triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [66].
The unique triangles found are:
<4, 8, 15>, <4, 8, 6>, <4, 15, 6>, <5, 8, 6>, <14, 22, 18>, <14, 26, 22>, <14, 26, 18>, <1, 4, 25>, <14, 18, 22>, <15, 6, 8>, <15, 23, 6>, <15, 23, 8>, <1, 25, 7>, <22, 26, 14>, <10, 20, 24>, <10, 20, 4>, <1, 25, 19>, <10, 20, 1>, <23, 6, 7>, <23, 24, 6>, <23, 24, 7>, <17, 5, 11>, <17, 19, 25>, <17, 11, 5>, <24, 20, 10>, <2, 16, 18>, <2, 16, 15>, <2, 18, 21>, <2, 16, 15>, <2, 16, 15>, <2, 16, 15>.
