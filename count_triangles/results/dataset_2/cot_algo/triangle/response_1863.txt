Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

After sorting the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes with their degrees:
(1: 4), (3: 4), (4: 4), (5: 4), (6: 4), (7: 4), (8: 4), (0: 5), (2: 6), (9: 8)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we iterate through the edges based on the order given above:

1. Consider edge (1, 2):
   - As 1 has fewer connections than 2, we proceed.
   - Check shared connections between 1 and 2: {0, 9}
   
2. Consider edge (1, 9):
   - As 1 has fewer connections than 9, we proceed.
   - Check shared connections between 1 and 9: {0}

3. Consider edge (1, 0):
   - As 1 has fewer connections than 0, we proceed.
   - Check shared connections between 1 and 0: {9}

4. Continue this process for all edges.

The total number of triangles found in the graph is: [10]

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 0, 9>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 0>, <2, 8, 9>, <2, 0, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 0, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <6, 7, 9>
