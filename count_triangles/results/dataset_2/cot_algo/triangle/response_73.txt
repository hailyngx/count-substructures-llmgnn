Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 17) (1, 19) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 19) (21, 15) (4, 7) (4, 24) (4, 10) (7, 21) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 5) (3, 28) (3, 23) (25, 26) (25, 22) (25, 14) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 17) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 15) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 15) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 28) (15, 21) (15, 7) (15, 29) (15, 0) (14, 25) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 13) (8, 20) (8, 27) (22, 25) (22, 26) (22, 28) (22, 12) (26, 25) (26, 22) (6, 28) (6, 24) (28, 3) (28, 20) (28, 22) (28, 6) (28, 18) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 27) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 23) (24, 4) (24, 6) (24, 12) (17, 1) (17, 2) (17, 27) (9, 27) (19, 1) (19, 21) (19, 29) (19, 18) (16, 0) (16, 14) (11, 14) (11, 18) (10, 4) (18, 28) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 12) (12, 22) (12, 24) (12, 18) (23, 3) (23, 2) (23, 13) (27, 8) (27, 5) (27, 17) (27, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their number of connections in ascending order. After relabeling the nodes accordingly, the sorted list is as follows:

Nodes:  9, 16, 11, 10, 6, 4, 26, 3, 0, 2, 25, 14, 8, 12, 22, 5, 24, 18, 20, 1, 21, 29, 7, 13, 19, 23, 27, 17, 28, 15

Now, we will count the triangles by following the method mentioned earlier and finally output the total number of triangles inside brackets.

[12]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 15, 21>
<5, 7, 15>
<6, 12, 24>
<3, 13, 23>
<2, 7, 29>
<14, 16, 20>
<5, 13, 27>
<4, 10, 24>
<9, 18, 27>
<7, 15, 21>
<18, 19, 28>
<1, 17, 21>
