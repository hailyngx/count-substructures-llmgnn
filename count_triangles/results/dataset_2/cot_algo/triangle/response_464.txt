Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
1. Node 6 has 2 connections.
2. Node 0 has 3 connections.
3. Node 2 has 4 connections.
4. Node 4 has 4 connections.
5. Node 1 has 4 connections.
6. Node 3 has 4 connections.
7. Node 7 has 4 connections.
8. Node 8 has 5 connections.
9. Node 9 has 5 connections.
10. Node 5 has 5 connections.

Now, we will go through the edges and count the number of triangles based on the method mentioned:

- Edge (5, 9): Node 5 and Node 9 share connections with Node 1, forming a triangle <5, 9, 1>.
- Edge (5, 6): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (5, 8): Node 5 shares connections with Node 0 and Node 9, but no new triangles are formed.
- Edge (5, 1): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (5, 0): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (9, 5): Node 9 and Node 5 share connections with Node 1, already counted as a triangle.
- Edge (9, 8): Node 9 shares connections with Node 5 and Node 2, but no new triangles are formed.
- Edge (9, 2): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (9, 1): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (9, 7): Node 9 shares connections with Node 2 and Node 4, but no new triangles are formed.
- Edge (4, 7): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (4, 8): Node 4 shares connections with Node 2 and Node 7, but no new triangles are formed.
- Edge (4, 2): Node 4, Node 9, and Node 2 share connections, forming a triangle <4, 9, 2>.
- Edge (4, 3): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (7, 9): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (7, 4): Node 7, Node 9, and Node 2 share connections, forming a triangle <7, 9, 2>.
- Edge (7, 3): Node 7 shares connections with Node 4 and Node 1, but no new triangles are formed.
- Edge (7, 2): Node 7 shares connections with Node 4 and Node 9, but no new triangles are formed.
- Edge (1, 5): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (1, 9): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (1, 3): Node 1 shares connections with Node 5 and Node 7, but no new triangles are formed.
- Edge (1, 6): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (3, 4): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (3, 7): Node 3 shares connections with Node 1 and Node 4, but no new triangles are formed.
- Edge (3, 1): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (3, 0): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (6, 5): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (6, 1): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (8, 5): Node 8 shares connections with Node 0 and Node 9, but no new triangles are formed.
- Edge (8, 9): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (8, 4): Node 8 shares connections with Node 0 and Node 2, but no new triangles are formed.
- Edge (8, 2): Node 8, Node 4, and Node 9 share connections, forming a triangle <8, 4, 9>.
- Edge (8, 0): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (2, 9): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (2, 4): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (2, 7): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (2, 8): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (0, 5): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (0, 3): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (0, 8): No triangles are formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <4, 9, 2>, <8, 4, 9>
