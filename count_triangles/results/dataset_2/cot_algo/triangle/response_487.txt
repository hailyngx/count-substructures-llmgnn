Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 15) (9, 20) (9, 1) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 14) (20, 9) (20, 5) (20, 10) (25, 6) (25, 23) (25, 18) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 27) (2, 24) (2, 11) (18, 25) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 0) (22, 28) (22, 7) (11, 2) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 0) (28, 22) (28, 11) (28, 17) (28, 14) (28, 4) (3, 13) (24, 26) (24, 2) (24, 19) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 8) (17, 28) (17, 4) (23, 9) (23, 25) (23, 11) (10, 20) (10, 16) (21, 13) (21, 27) (21, 29) (21, 4) (0, 18) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 15) (5, 20) (5, 14) (14, 26) (14, 28) (14, 1) (14, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (7, 22) (7, 13) (13, 3) (13, 21) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 27) (8, 1) (6, 25) (6, 18) (4, 28) (4, 17) (4, 21) (4, 29) (19, 24) (27, 2) (27, 21) (27, 13) (29, 21) (29, 4) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be used to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, let's construct the graph by listing the nodes and their connections:

Nodes and their connections:
- Node 0: 18, 11, 16, 12
- Node 1: 9, 14, 8
- Node 2: 18, 12, 27, 24, 11
- Node 3: 13
- Node 4: 28, 17, 21, 29
- Node 5: 20, 14
- Node 6: 25, 18
- Node 7: 22, 13
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 26, 15, 20, 1, 23
- Node 10: 20, 16
- Node 11: 2, 28, 23, 0
- Node 12: 2, 0
- Node 13: 3, 21, 7, 15, 27
- Node 14: 26, 28, 1, 5
- Node 15: 9, 16, 13
- Node 16: 10, 0, 15
- Node 17: 28, 4
- Node 18: 25, 2, 6, 0
- Node 19: 24
- Node 20: 9, 5, 10
- Node 21: 13, 27, 29, 4
- Node 22: 28, 7
- Node 23: 9, 25, 11
- Node 24: 26, 2, 19
- Node 25: 6, 23, 18
- Node 26: 9, 24, 14
- Node 27: 2, 21, 13
- Node 28: 22, 11, 17, 14, 4
- Node 29: 21, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[20] triangles

Unique triangles:
<0, 11, 28>
<0, 11, 2>
<0, 11, 23>
<0, 12, 2>
<0, 12, 18>
<0, 12, 16>
<0, 16, 10>
<0, 16, 15>
<1, 14, 9>
<1, 14, 5>
<13, 21, 27>
<13, 21, 4>
<13, 21, 29>
<13, 7, 22>
<13, 7, 3>
<13, 15, 9>
<14, 26, 28>
<18, 25, 6>
<18, 25, 23>
<18, 6, 25>
