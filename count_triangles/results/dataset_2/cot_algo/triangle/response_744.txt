Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (16, 1) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 3) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 17) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 0) (8, 2) (18, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 15) (3, 9) (3, 18) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 13) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 17) (17, 9) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 15) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 1) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 19) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: 14, 8
- 1: 11, 16, 6, 14, 10
- 2: 16, 9, 8, 12
- 3: 9, 18
- 4: 7
- 5: 9, 6
- 6: 5, 1, 17, 10, 13
- 7: 4, 12, 17
- 8: 0, 2
- 9: 11, 5, 2, 17, 3
- 10: 6, 19, 1
- 11: 1, 9, 13
- 12: 7, 2, 15
- 13: 11, 6, 19
- 14: 0, 1
- 15: 12, 19, 17
- 16: 11, 2
- 17: 9, 7, 6, 19, 15
- 18: 3
- 19: 15, 17, 10, 13

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degree:

Nodes by degree:
0: 2 connections
4: 1 connection
8: 2 connections
18: 1 connection
3: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
10: 3 connections
14: 2 connections
1: 5 connections
16: 2 connections
12: 3 connections
6: 5 connections
15: 3 connections
2: 4 connections
17: 5 connections
9: 5 connections
19: 4 connections
7: 3 connections
11: 3 connections
13: 3 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Triangles: [24]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 8, 2>
<0, 8, 14>
<0, 14, 1>
<4, 7, 17>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 10, 1>
<6, 10, 19>
<6, 13, 11>
<7, 12, 2>
<7, 12, 15>
<9, 11, 13>
<9, 11, 16>
<9, 13, 19>
<9, 17, 7>
<9, 17, 15>
<10, 13, 19>
<11, 13, 19>
<15, 17, 19>
<16, 1, 6>
<17, 15, 19>
<17, 6, 10>
<7, 17, 6>
