Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree in ascending order are: 
Nodes: 7, 8, 2, 3, 0, 6, 1, 9, 5, 4 

Based on this ordering, we will count the triangles.

Total number of triangles: [15]

Unique triangles found:
