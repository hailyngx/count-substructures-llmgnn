Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 3) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 9) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the nodes by the number of connections each node has, and relabeling them accordingly. The vertices with their corresponding degrees are:

- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 6
- Node 11: degree 6

Let's now count the number of triangles by considering edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

For the given graph, we find the following triangles: 
[Total number of triangles: 14]
<4, 10, 9>
<4, 10, 1>
<4, 10, 11>
<4, 11, 13>
<4, 11, 2>
<5, 6, 3>
<5, 2, 3>
<6, 7, 3>
<6, 7, 11>
<6, 8, 13>
<1, 9, 10>
<1, 9, 14>
<1, 14, 8>
<13, 9, 14>
