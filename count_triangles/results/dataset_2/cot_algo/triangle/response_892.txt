Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 8) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (0, 14) (0, 15) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 7) (15, 0) (15, 1) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 10) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 10) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 7) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 10) (3, 16) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

Edges:
- 0: [14, 15]
- 1: [15, 16, 7]
- 2: [13, 12]
- 3: [9, 18, 10, 16]
- 4: [17, 18, 11]
- 5: [14, 19, 10]
- 6: [8]
- 7: [9, 1, 11, 10]
- 8: [6, 13, 11]
- 9: [16, 3, 7]
- 10: [13, 5, 7, 3, 12]
- 11: [8, 13, 4, 18, 7]
- 12: [2, 10]
- 13: [8, 2, 11, 10]
- 14: [17, 0, 5]
- 15: [0, 1]
- 16: [1, 9, 3]
- 17: [14, 18, 4]
- 18: [17, 4, 11, 3]
- 19: [5]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we list the vertices based on their degrees from least to most:

Vertices: [6, 2, 12, 19, 0, 1, 15, 7, 16, 5, 9, 3, 4, 17, 8, 13, 11, 18, 10, 14]

Now, we count the number of triangles in the graph which is the total number of unique triangles formed:

Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles: <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 14>, <1, 7, 11>, <1, 7, 10>, <1, 10, 16>, <3, 7, 10>, <4, 11, 18>, <5, 7, 10>, <5, 10, 12>, <13, 7, 11>
