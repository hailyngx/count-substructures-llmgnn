Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 10) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 11) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (0, 13) (0, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we need to first list the vertices based on their connections:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
```
Vertex 10: 4 connections
Vertex 12: 4 connections
Vertex 14: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 13: 2 connections
Vertex 11: 5 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
```

Based on the sorted list, we will now examine each edge to count triangles:

Triangles:
```
[Total number of triangles: 8]
<4, 9, 7>
<4, 7, 6>
<9, 7, 11>
<9, 7, 4>
<10, 13, 12>
<10, 14, 12>
<10, 14, 5>
<10, 14, 11>
