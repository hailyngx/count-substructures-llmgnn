Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 6) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 6) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 10) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 12)
