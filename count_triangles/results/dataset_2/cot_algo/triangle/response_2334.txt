Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 9) (18, 5) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 3) (19, 2) (19, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (12, 16) (12, 3) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 10) (3, 18) (3, 12) (17, 5) (17, 0) (17, 8) (14, 18) (14, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 1) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 14) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 13) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 15) (13, 4) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 4) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly.

Sorted vertices by their connections:
- Vertex 16 with 3 connections.
- Vertex 6 with 3 connections.
- Vertex 7 with 3 connections.
- Vertex 12 with 3 connections.
- Vertex 2 with 4 connections.
- Vertex 1 with 4 connections.
- Vertex 19 with 4 connections.
- Vertex 3 with 4 connections.
- Vertex 14 with 4 connections.
- Vertex 6 with 5 connections.
- Vertex 11 with 5 connections.
- Vertex 10 with 5 connections.
- Vertex 9 with 5 connections.
- Vertex 18 with 5 connections.
- Vertex 8 with 5 connections.
- Vertex 0 with 5 connections.
- Vertex 17 with 5 connections.
- Vertex 13 with 5 connections.
- Vertex 5 with 5 connections.
- Vertex 4 with 5 connections.

Based on the above order, we will analyze the given edges where the endpoint with the lower label has fewer connections.
