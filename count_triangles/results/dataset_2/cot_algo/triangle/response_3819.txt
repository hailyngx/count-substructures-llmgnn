Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 1) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 1) (10, 13) (10, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 11) 

Response:
The Degrees of the Nodes are as follows:  
Node 0: 4 connections  
Node 1: 5 connections  
Node 2: 4 connections  
Node 3: 5 connections  
Node 4: 3 connections  
Node 5: 3 connections  
Node 6: 4 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 8: 5 connections  
Node 9: 5 connections  
Node 10: 2 connections  
Node 11: 4 connections  
Node 12: 4 connections  
Node 13: 4 connections  
Node 14: 4 connections  

According to the Degree-Based Ordering method, we need to first sort the nodes by their degrees in ascending order and label them accordingly:

Node 10: 2 connections [0]  
Node 4: 3 connections [1]  
Node 5: 3 connections [2]  
Node 0: 4 connections [3]  
Node 2: 4 connections [4]  
Node 6: 4 connections [5]  
Node 7: 4 connections [6]  
Node 12: 4 connections [7]  
Node 13: 4 connections [8]  
Node 14: 4 connections [9]  
Node 1: 5 connections [10]  
Node 3: 5 connections [11]  
Node 8: 5 connections [12]  
Node 9: 5 connections [13]  
Node 11: 4 connections [14]  

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Checking for triangles involving edges with the lower label having fewer connections:
    - Triangle <3, 4, 7>
    - Triangle <3, 4, 11>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
