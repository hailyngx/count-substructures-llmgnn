Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with 10 nodes and the given 40 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (1, 7, 3, 6, 2)
- 1: (3, 6, 0)
- 2: (5, 9, 4, 8, 0)
- 3: (5, 4, 7, 1, 0, 8)
- 4: (9, 7, 8, 3, 2)
- 5: (2, 3)
- 6: (7, 1, 0)
- 7: (9, 4, 0, 3, 6)
- 8: (4, 3, 2)
- 9: (4, 2, 7)

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method and relabel the nodes based on their connections:

Node ordering:
0(5), 1(3), 8(3), 2(5), 6(3), 3(6), 4(5), 7(5), 9(3), 5(2)

Let's count the number of triangles:

- For edge (2, 5): Not counted as 5 has fewer connections than 2.
- For edge (2, 9): Not counted as 9 has fewer connections than 2.
- For edge (2, 4): Counting triangle formed by shared connection 3: <2, 4, 3>
- For edge (2, 8): Not counted as 8 has fewer connections than 2.
- For edge (2, 0): Counting triangle formed by shared connection 3: <2, 0, 3>

Total number of triangles inside brackets []: [2]
Unique triangles: <2, 4, 3>, <2, 0, 3>
