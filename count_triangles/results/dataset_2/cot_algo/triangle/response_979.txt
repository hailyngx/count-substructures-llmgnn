Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 25) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 23) (15, 21) (15, 12) (21, 15) (21, 17) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 24) (13, 28) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 17) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 22) (20, 4) (25, 9) (25, 20) (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 29) (3, 18) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 5) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 27) (28, 13) (28, 16) (28, 18) (28, 23) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 4) (19, 10) (19, 6) (19, 0) (6, 19) (6, 14) (6, 4) (24, 8) (24, 13) (24, 29) (23, 26) (23, 28) (23, 29) (0, 3) (0, 19) (14, 6) (14, 2) (7, 20) (7, 1) (7, 17) (29, 3) (29, 16) (29, 24) (29, 23) (29, 4) (22, 20) (22, 27) (27, 9) (27, 16) (27, 22) (17, 21) (17, 11) (17, 7) (4, 20) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 29) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 28) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections). Let's label the vertices accordingly from least to most connections:

- Node 9 (degree 3)
- Node 26 (degree 3)
- Node 15 (degree 2)
- Node 21 (degree 2)
- Node 8 (degree 3)
- Node 13 (degree 3)
- Node 10 (degree 4)
- Node 11 (degree 2)
- Node 20 (degree 5)
- Node 25 (degree 3)
- Node 1 (degree 4)
- Node 3 (degree 4)
- Node 12 (degree 3)
- Node 16 (degree 3)
- Node 28 (degree 4)
- Node 5 (degree 3)
- Node 19 (degree 4)
- Node 6 (degree 3)
- Node 24 (degree 3)
- Node 23 (degree 3)
- Node 0 (degree 3)
- Node 14 (degree 2)
- Node 7 (degree 3)
- Node 29 (degree 5)
- Node 22 (degree 2)
- Node 27 (degree 3)
- Node 17 (degree 3)
- Node 4 (degree 5)
- Node 2 (degree 2)
- Node 18 (degree 2)

Now, we will count the triangles by following the method described earlier.

The total number of triangles is: [16]

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 14>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 6, 19>, <0, 19, 6>, <1, 20, 22>, <1, 26, 23>, <3, 12, 15>, <3, 28, 16>, <4, 20, 22>, <4, 20, 29>, <10, 11, 17>, <10, 19, 6>, <13, 8, 24>, <13, 8, 28>, <21, 15, 12>, <27, 16, 29>
