Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 6) (1, 27) (1, 18) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 6) (3, 27) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 23) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 7) (17, 2) (17, 25) (20, 29) (20, 10) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 19) (29, 20) (29, 26) (29, 21) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 25) (8, 18) (9, 8) (9, 15) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 26) (7, 2) (7, 6) (25, 17) (25, 8) (25, 19) (25, 14) (25, 10) (23, 0) (23, 15) (23, 13) (26, 29) (26, 12) (26, 15) (10, 20) (10, 4) (10, 25) (24, 3) (22, 5) (18, 1) (18, 0) (18, 8) (18, 19) (19, 11) (19, 28) (19, 25) (19, 18) (15, 9) (15, 23) (15, 26) (15, 21) (6, 16) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 13) (14, 28) (14, 25) (14, 5) (27, 1) (27, 3) (27, 5) (21, 29) (21, 15) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 23) (13, 6) (5, 22) (5, 14) (5, 27) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the nodes by their degrees, then assigning labels according to the order. Here is the sorted list of nodes with their degrees:

(1: 2), (4: 2), (7: 2), (0: 3), (3: 4), (9: 2), (11: 3), (16: 3), (18: 4), (19: 4), (21: 2), (22: 1), (25: 5), (27: 3), (2: 4), (5: 3), (6: 4), (8: 4), (10: 3), (12: 4), (13: 4), (15: 4), (23: 3), (14: 3), (20: 3), (26: 3), (28: 3), (29: 3), (17: 2)

Following the sorting, we can now count the number of triangles present in the given graph. Let's proceed with the calculations. 

The total number of triangles is [60].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 5, 27>
<0, 7, 6>
<0, 7, 13>
<0, 13, 6>
<3, 19, 25>
<4, 12, 26>
<4, 21, 15>
<6, 13, 16>
<6, 13, 23>
<8, 15, 21>
<9, 15, 26>
<10, 4, 25>
<10, 19, 28>
<12, 4, 10>
<12, 4, 26>
<13, 2, 23>
<14, 5, 27>
<14, 28, 5>
<15, 21, 29>
<18, 0, 23>
<25, 14, 5>
<25, 19, 18>
<25, 19, 28>
<25, 14, 28>
<25, 14, 5>
<26, 15, 21>
<27, 5, 14>
