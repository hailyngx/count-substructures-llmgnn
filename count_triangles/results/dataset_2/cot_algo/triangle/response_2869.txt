Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 17) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 11) (4, 14) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (10, 11) (10, 1) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 13) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 19) (3, 14) (3, 1) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 12) (18, 4) (18, 0) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 0) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 1) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 3) (8, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) (15, 9) (15, 6) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 2) (6, 8) (6, 15) (16, 4) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 

Edges: (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 12), (9, 15), (9, 17), (14, 17), (14, 3), (14, 4), (14, 2), (17, 19), (17, 8), (17, 11), (4, 7), (4, 18), (4, 16), (10, 11), (10, 1), (11, 13), (1, 3), (3, 8), (0, 7), (0, 18), (12, 0), (19, 1), (8, 6), (2, 13), (15, 6) 

After sorting the nodes by their degree from least to most connections, the new labels are: 

Nodes: 15, 6, 0, 2, 10, 16, 13, 7, 1, 12, 5, 3, 8, 18, 11, 4, 14, 19, 17, 9 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles: 

Triangles: [26] 

Unique triangles: 
<5, 9, 17>, <5, 12, 4>, <5, 12, 0>, <9, 15, 6>, <9, 17, 8>, <9, 17, 11>, <14, 3, 1>, <14, 3, 8>, <14, 3, 13>, <14, 4, 18>, <14, 4, 0>, <14, 4, 16>, <14, 17, 8>, <14, 17, 11>, <14, 17, 19>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 7, 18>, <4, 12, 0>, <4, 12, 5>, <4, 12, 0>, <4, 12, 5>, <4, 18, 0>, <17, 8, 3>, <17, 11, 13>, <17, 19, 1>, <17, 19, 11>
