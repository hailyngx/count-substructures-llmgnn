Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (13, 29) (22, 15) (22, 11) (1, 21) (1, 28) (21, 1) (21, 9) (21, 23) (21, 2) (21, 15) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 20) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 12) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 18) (20, 8) (20, 0) (20, 14) (20, 28) (20, 11) (28, 1) (28, 20) (28, 16) (29, 13) (29, 10) (29, 19) (29, 24) (2, 21) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (26, 24) (24, 29) (24, 26) (24, 4) (24, 18) (5, 8) (5, 27) (19, 29) (19, 25) (15, 22) (15, 21) (15, 10) (9, 21) (9, 8) (9, 2) (16, 28) (16, 6) (4, 2) (4, 24) (4, 12) (4, 23) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 4) (25, 0) (25, 19) (25, 27) (27, 5) (27, 25) (27, 14) (7, 10) (7, 6) (11, 22) (11, 20) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 23) (6, 16) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 23) (14, 20) (14, 27) (18, 0) (18, 24) (23, 21) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections and then relabeling the vertices accordingly. 

After sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, the labels will be as follows:
- Node 16 has 1 connection.
- Node 26 has 1 connection.
- Node 1 has 2 connections.
- Node 3 has 3 connections.
- Node 5 has 3 connections.
- Node 13 has 3 connections.
- Node 18 has 3 connections.
- Node 19 has 3 connections.
- Node 27 has 3 connections.
- Node 0 has 4 connections.
- Node 11 has 4 connections.
- Node 14 has 4 connections.
- Node 22 has 4 connections.
- Node 2 has 5 connections.
- Node 4 has 5 connections.
- Node 6 has 5 connections.
- Node 9 has 5 connections.
- Node 12 has 6 connections.
- Node 20 has 6 connections.
- Node 21 has 6 connections.
- Node 7 has 7 connections.
- Node 8 has 7 connections.
- Node 25 has 7 connections.
- Node 10 has 8 connections.
- Node 28 has 8 connections.
- Node 15 has 9 connections.
- Node 29 has 9 connections.
- Node 17 has 10 connections.
- Node 24 has 10 connections.

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the edges provided in the graph, we can count the number of triangles and identify them:

[Total number of triangles: 37]
<0, 2, 21>, <0, 4, 23>, <0, 4, 24>, <0, 5, 27>, <0, 18, 24>, <1, 2, 21>, <1, 9, 21>, <1, 15, 21>, <2, 4, 21>, <2, 4, 24>, <2, 6, 23>, <2, 9, 21>, <2, 10, 29>, <4, 6, 23>, <4, 9, 21>, <4, 10, 29>, <4, 12, 24>, <4, 23, 24>, <4, 21, 23>, <4, 24, 21>, <5, 8, 27>, <6, 9, 23>, <6, 10, 29>, <6, 23, 21>, <6, 23, 24>, <7, 10, 29>, <8, 20, 5>, <9, 10, 29>, <9, 23, 21>, <10, 12, 29>, <10, 15, 21>, <10, 17, 29>, <10, 29, 17>, <10, 29, 19>, <10, 29, 24>, <12, 17, 29>, <15, 21, 23>, <15, 21, 10>
