Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 19) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 19) (4, 12) (18, 11) (18, 17) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 10) (15, 1) (15, 10) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 14) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 17) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 0) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 17) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (16, 12) (3, 9) (3, 2) (14, 1) (14, 10) (7, 6) (7, 2) (17, 18) (17, 19) (17, 0) (17, 5) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 5) (5, 0) (5, 17) (5, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices according to their degrees in ascending order, then relabeling them accordingly.

After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labeling is as follows:
0 (degree 4)
3 (degree 4)
4 (degree 2)
5 (degree 4)
7 (degree 2)
16 (degree 2)
2 (degree 6)
6 (degree 4)
8 (degree 4)
12 (degree 4)
1 (degree 5)
13 (degree 4)
14 (degree 3)
15 (degree 2)
9 (degree 5)
11 (degree 4)
17 (degree 4)
10 (degree 5)
18 (degree 3)
19 (degree 5)

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph based on the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The total number of triangles is [33].
