Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 10) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 7) (5, 6) (5, 16) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 16) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 19) (15, 13) (15, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 2) (10, 6) (4, 2) (4, 15) (12, 9) (12, 14) (0, 18) (0, 6) (0, 9) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 6) (16, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 14) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 3) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 13) (3, 8) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 14) (13, 15) (13, 19) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 19) 

Response:
The given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: (2, 8), (2, 4), (2, 10), (18, 16), (18, 0), (18, 7), (5, 6), (5, 16), (5, 7), (6, 5), (6, 10), (6, 0), (6, 16), (8, 9), (8, 3), (1, 17), (1, 11), (1, 9), (17, 3), (17, 19), (15, 13), (15, 4), (9, 11), (9, 0), (9, 12), (10, 6), (4, 15), (12, 14), (0, 6), (16, 3), (11, 14), (19, 13), (3, 14), (7, 19)

Next, let's rank the nodes based on their degrees:
0(4), 1(3), 2(3), 3(4), 4(3), 5(3), 6(4), 7(3), 8(3), 9(5), 10(2), 11(3), 12(2), 13(2), 14(3), 15(2), 16(4), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start examining the edges and counting the triangles:

Triangles: [21]
Unique triangles: <2, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 16>, <2, 8, 3>, <2, 10, 6>, <2, 10, 6>, <18, 16, 5>, <18, 16, 6>, <18, 16, 3>, <18, 0, 6>, <18, 0, 16>, <18, 7, 5>, <18, 7, 6>, <5, 6, 16>, <6, 10, 0>, <8, 9, 3>, <8, 9, 1>, <8, 3, 17>, <9, 11, 1>, <9, 11, 14>, <9, 0, 6>]
