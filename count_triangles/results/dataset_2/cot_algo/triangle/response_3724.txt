Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 1) (22, 5) (22, 28) (22, 0) (22, 17) (23, 2) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 26) (18, 1) (18, 4) (18, 9) (6, 28) (28, 22) (28, 6) (28, 27) (28, 25) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 24) (13, 19) (26, 4) (26, 13) (26, 5) (17, 1) (17, 22) (17, 13) (17, 15) (7, 1) (7, 25) (7, 24) (7, 27) (25, 28) (25, 7) (25, 9) (25, 10) (20, 27) (20, 2) (20, 19) (29, 15) (29, 14) (29, 21) (29, 11) (21, 29) (21, 16) (21, 5) (5, 22) (5, 26) (5, 21) (5, 8) (2, 23) (2, 20) (2, 27) (2, 14) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 9) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 16) (15, 17) (15, 29) (15, 19) (19, 13) (19, 20) (19, 15) (19, 27) (0, 22) (0, 11) (11, 1) (11, 29) (11, 0) (24, 13) (24, 7) (24, 16) (8, 5) (10, 25) (27, 28) (27, 7) (27, 20) (27, 2) (27, 19) (14, 4) (14, 29) (14, 2) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

0 -> [22, 11]
1 -> [3, 17, 11, 18, 7]
2 -> [23, 20, 27, 14]
3 -> [1]
4 -> [18, 14, 26]
5 -> [22, 26, 21, 8]
6 -> [28]
7 -> [1, 25, 24, 27]
8 -> [5]
9 -> [18, 25, 16]
10 -> [25]
11 -> [1, 29, 0]
13 -> [26, 17, 24, 19]
14 -> [4, 29, 2]
15 -> [17, 29, 19]
16 -> [21, 24, 9]
17 -> [1, 22, 13, 15]
18 -> [1, 4, 9]
19 -> [13, 20, 15, 27]
20 -> [27, 2, 19]
21 -> [29, 16, 5]
22 -> [5, 28, 0, 17]
23 -> [2]
24 -> [13, 7, 16]
25 -> [28, 7, 9, 10]
26 -> [4, 13, 5]
27 -> [22, 7, 20, 2, 19]
28 -> [22, 6, 27, 25]
29 -> [15, 14, 21, 11]

Next, we will sort the vertices by their degrees:

0: 2
3: 1
6: 1
8: 1
10: 1
18: 3
23: 1
4: 3
16: 3
20: 3
7: 4
13: 4
14: 3
15: 3
1: 5
2: 4
5: 4
9: 3
11: 3
17: 4
19: 4
21: 3
22: 4
24: 3
25: 4
26: 3
27: 5
28: 4
29: 4

Now, we will list the triangles based on the degree-based ordering method:

[<21, 5, 26>, <21, 5, 28>, <21, 5, 22>, <15, 19, 13>, <15, 19, 27>, <15, 19, 20>, <15, 29, 14>, <15, 29, 21>, <15, 29, 11>, <13, 17, 15>, <13, 17, 29>, <13, 17, 22>, <13, 26, 5>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
