Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 4) (14, 2) (14, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 14) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 14 and the corresponding edges are listed. Now, let's organize the information and count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes by their connections:
- Node 0: 5 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 2: 6 connections
- Node 3: 5 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 9: 5 connections
- Node 10: 3 connections
- Node 11: 4 connections
- Node 12: 5 connections
- Node 13: 5 connections
- Node 14: 2 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start by considering edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 3, 13>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 2, 7>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <3, 9, 13>
- <9, 12, 13>
- <9, 10, 14>

Total number of triangles: [11]
