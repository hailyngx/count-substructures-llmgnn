Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 28) (2, 29) (2, 18) (29, 2) (29, 8) (29, 14) (3, 15) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 11) (15, 16) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 13) (8, 29) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 27) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 28) (4, 5) (4, 8) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 0) (18, 1) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 11) (28, 9) (28, 13) (28, 24) (20, 27) (20, 22) (17, 24) (17, 27) (1, 8) (1, 18) (24, 28) (24, 17) (24, 26) (26, 24) (26, 23) (7, 6) (7, 25) (7, 16) (25, 7) (25, 19) (25, 22) (10, 21) (10, 12) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 14) (22, 20) (22, 25) (22, 12) (23, 26) (23, 12) (12, 21) (12, 10) (12, 22) (12, 23) (14, 29) (14, 18) (14, 16) (0, 6) (0, 18) (0, 11) (0, 19) (11, 5) (11, 15) (11, 21) (11, 0) (11, 27) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 0) (27, 8) (27, 20) (27, 17) (27, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly. Let's apply this to the given graph:

Vertices sorted by degrees:
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 16: degree 2
Vertex 9: degree 2
Vertex 17: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 3
Vertex 5: degree 3
Vertex 18: degree 4
Vertex 3: degree 4
Vertex 10: degree 4
Vertex 20: degree 4
Vertex 23: degree 4
Vertex 25: degree 4
Vertex 26: degree 4
Vertex 28: degree 4
Vertex 29: degree 4
Vertex 1: degree 5
Vertex 13: degree 5
Vertex 22: degree 5
Vertex 24: degree 5
Vertex 4: degree 5
Vertex 6: degree 5
Vertex 14: degree 5
Vertex 8: degree 6
Vertex 11: degree 6
Vertex 12: degree 6
Vertex 15: degree 6
Vertex 19: degree 6
Vertex 0: degree 7
Vertex 21: degree 7
Vertex 27: degree 7

We will now list the triangles based on the order of vertices and shared connections. 

The total number of triangles and the unique triangles found are as follows:
[Total number of triangles: 20]
<4, 8, 13>
<6, 8, 13>
<0, 11, 27>
<0, 19, 25>
<5, 11, 15>
<10, 12, 22>
<16, 14, 29>
<16, 7, 25>
<16, 14, 18>
<27, 20, 22>
<27, 11, 17>
<12, 10, 21>
<12, 22, 25>
<24, 17, 27>
<24, 26, 23>
<8, 4, 5>
<18, 2, 14>
<6, 0, 18>
<3, 15, 11>
<6, 9, 13>
