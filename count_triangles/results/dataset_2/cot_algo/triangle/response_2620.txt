Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 1) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) 

Response:
The vertices and their connections can be described as follows:

- Vertex 0: Connected to vertices 9, 10, 14, 3, 13
- Vertex 1: Connected to vertices 5, 9, 12
- Vertex 2: Connected to vertices 5, 6, 8
- Vertex 3: Connected to vertices 5, 6, 0, 8
- Vertex 4: Connected to vertices 10, 6
- Vertex 5: Connected to vertices 9, 2, 1, 3
- Vertex 6: Connected to vertices 9, 4, 10, 3, 2, 8
- Vertex 7: Connected to vertices 12, 13
- Vertex 8: Connected to vertices 6, 11, 2, 3
- Vertex 9: Connected to vertices 5, 6, 14, 1, 0
- Vertex 10: Connected to vertices 4, 6, 11, 0, 12, 13
- Vertex 11: Connected to vertices 10, 14, 8, 12
- Vertex 12: Connected to vertices 7, 10, 11, 13, 1
- Vertex 13: Connected to vertices 7, 10, 12, 0

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will sort the vertices based on the number of connections they have:
Vertices in order: 7, 4, 2, 1, 14, 11, 5, 8, 3, 0, 13, 12, 6, 10, 9

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Vertex 7 does not form any triangles.
- Vertex 4 does not form any triangles.
- Vertex 2 forms the following triangle: <2, 6, 8>.
- Vertex 1 forms the following triangle: <1, 5, 9>.
- Vertex 14 forms the following triangles: <11, 14, 9>, <0, 14, 9>.
- Vertex 11 forms the following triangle: <10, 11, 12>.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Triangles found: <2, 6, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <11, 14, 9>, <0, 14, 9>, <10, 11, 12>
