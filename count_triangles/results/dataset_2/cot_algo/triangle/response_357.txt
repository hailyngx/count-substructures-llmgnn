Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges. 

By sorting the vertices based on their number of connections in non-decreasing order, the vertices are relabeled as follows:
0 (degree 5), 2 (degree 4), 5 (degree 3), 6 (degree 3), 8 (degree 3), 1 (degree 4), 3 (degree 5), 7 (degree 4), 4 (degree 6), 9 (degree 6).

Now, let's list only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(2, 5), (2, 8), (6, 5), (0, 5), (2, 3), (8, 3), (6, 1), (9, 2), (8, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5).

Next, we identify the shared connections for each edge to count the triangles:
<0, 5, 2>, <0, 5, 3>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4], and the unique triangles found are <0, 5, 2>, <0, 5, 3>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 6>.
