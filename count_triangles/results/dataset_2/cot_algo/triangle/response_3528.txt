Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (8, 6), (8, 3), (8, 0), (6, 1), (0, 7), (7, 2), (3, 7)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Nodes sorted by the number of connections:
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 0: Degree 5

Triangles found:
<5, 9, 0>
<8, 9, 0>
<3, 9, 0>
<5, 1, 6>
<5, 1, 2>
<5, 4, 1>
<5, 2, 7>
<9, 8, 6>
<9, 8, 0>
<9, 3, 7>

Total number of triangles: [10]
