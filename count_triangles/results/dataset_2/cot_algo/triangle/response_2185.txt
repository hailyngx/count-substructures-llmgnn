Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 4) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Degree-Based Ordering:  
Nodes ranked by degree (from lowest to highest):
6, 9, 7, 4, 0, 5, 8, 2, 1, 3

Sorted Edges to consider based on degree:
(6, 9) (9, 2) (7, 3) (4, 5) (0, 6) (5, 4) (8, 2) (2, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1)
(9, 6) (1, 3) (7, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (4, 2) (2, 5) (3, 2) (6, 1) (3, 5)
