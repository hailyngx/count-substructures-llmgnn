Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 0) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are as follows:
Vertex 2: degree 4
Vertex 3: degree 4
Vertex 7: degree 1
Vertex 5: degree 5
Vertex 8: degree 4
Vertex 6: degree 4
Vertex 9: degree 4
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 4: degree 5
Vertex 0: degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (2, 5): Check shared connections - Triangle <2, 5, 1>
2. Edge (2, 9): Check shared connections - Triangle <2, 9, 6>
3. Edge (5, 8): Check shared connections - Triangle <5, 8, 6>
4. Edge (1, 3): Check shared connections - Triangle <1, 3, 0>
5. Edge (1, 4): Check shared connections - Triangle <1, 4, 0>
6. Edge (5, 4): Check shared connections - Triangle <5, 4, 0>
7. Edge (9, 6): Check shared connections - Triangle <9, 6, 3>

Total number of triangles: [6]
