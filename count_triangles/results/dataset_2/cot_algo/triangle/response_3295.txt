Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 9) (1, 3) (3, 17) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (8, 2) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 15) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 12) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (6, 18) (6, 19) (0, 16) (16, 18) (16, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 10) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 15) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 12) (9, 17) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 15) (15, 13) (15, 7) (15, 11) (15, 9) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 19) (19, 6) (19, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections). The sorted list of vertices with their degrees in brackets is as follows:
[0(1), 1(1), 2(2), 5(2), 6(2), 8(2), 16(2), 18(4), 7(4), 11(4), 13(4), 15(4), 19(2), 12(4), 4(4), 10(4), 14(4), 3(5), 17(5), 9(4)]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method on the given graph, we proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge: (14, 17) --> Shared connections: 13
2. Edge: (14, 4) --> Shared connections: 10
3. Edge: (14, 5) --> Shared connections: None
4. Edge: (14, 10) --> Shared connections: None
5. Edge: (17, 13) --> Shared connections: 15
6. Edge: (17, 3) --> Shared connections: None
7. Edge: (1, 3) --> Shared connections: None
8. Edge: (3, 7) --> Shared connections: None
9. Edge: (8, 2) --> Shared connections: None
10. Edge: (13, 11) --> Shared connections: 15
11. Edge: (2, 18) --> Shared connections: 12
12. Edge: (18, 6) --> Shared connections: None
13. Edge: (4, 12) --> Shared connections: None
14. Edge: (6, 19) --> Shared connections: None
15. Edge: (0, 16) --> Shared connections: None
16. Edge: (7, 15) --> Shared connections: 11
17. Edge: (5, 12) --> Shared connections: None
18. Edge: (9, 17) --> Shared connections: 13
19. Edge: (15, 9) --> Shared connections: 13
20. Edge: (10, 19) --> Shared connections: None

There are a total of 11 triangles in the graph:
[<13, 15, 17>, <13, 15, 11>, <15, 13, 17>, <15, 13, 11>, <14, 17, 13>, <14, 17, 15>, <17, 15, 13>, <3, 17, 9>, <3, 17, 13>, <3, 17, 15>, <3, 15, 11>]
