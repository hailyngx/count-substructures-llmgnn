Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. Here is the sorted list of nodes with their degrees in parentheses:

Node 1 (degree 4): 9, 5, 7, 1
Node 2 (degree 4): 6, 8, 2, 0
Node 3 (degree 5): 6, 4, 5, 2, 7
Node 4 (degree 5): 9, 8, 0, 5, 3
Node 5 (degree 4): 6, 5, 4, 1
Node 6 (degree 4): 9, 5, 3, 2
Node 7 (degree 5): 9, 8, 0, 7, 1
Node 8 (degree 3): 4, 8, 7
Node 9 (degree 4): 6, 4, 1, 7

Now, let's count the triangles formed by the edges based on the degree-based ordering method:

- For edge (0, 7):
    Node 0: Connects with 4, 2, 7
    Node 7: Connects with 9, 8, 0, 3, 1
    Shared connections: 7
    Triangle: (0, 7, 4)

- For edge (0, 2):
    Node 0: Connects with 4, 2, 7
    Node 2: Connects with 6, 8, 3, 0
    Shared connections: 0, 2
    Triangle: (0, 2, 4)

- For edge (0, 4):
    Node 0: Connects with 4, 2, 7
    Node 4: Connects with 9, 8, 0, 5, 3
    Shared connections: 0, 4
    Triangle: (0, 4, 9)

- For edge (1, 7):
    Node 1: Connects with 9, 5, 7
    Node 7: Connects with 9, 8, 0, 3, 1
    Shared connections: 1, 7
    Triangle: (1, 7, 9)

- For edge (2, 3):
    Node 2: Connects with 6, 8, 3, 0
    Node 3: Connects with 6, 4, 5, 2, 7
    Shared connections: 2, 3
    Triangle: (2, 3, 6)

- For edge (2, 6):
    Node 2: Connects with 6, 8, 3, 0
    Node 6: Connects with 9, 5, 3, 2
    Shared connections: 2, 6
    Triangle: (2, 6, 9)

- For edge (3, 7):
    Node 3: Connects with 6, 4, 5, 2, 7
    Node 7: Connects with 9, 8, 0, 3, 1
    Shared connections: 3, 7
    Triangle: (3, 7, 1)

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: <0, 7, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 6>
