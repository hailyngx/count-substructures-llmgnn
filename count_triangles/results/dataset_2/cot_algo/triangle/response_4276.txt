Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves reordering the vertices based on the number of connections they have. Let's label the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 0: 5 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections

Now, we will consider only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Considering edges with one endpoint as Vertex 0:
- (0, 8): Forms a triangle with Vertex 2

Considering edges with one endpoint as Vertex 1:
- (1, 7): Forms a triangle with Vertex 6

Considering edges with one endpoint as Vertex 2:
- (2, 8): Forms a triangle with Vertex 4
- (2, 3): Forms a triangle with Vertex 6

Considering edges with one endpoint as Vertex 3:
- (3, 7): Forms a triangle with Vertex 1

Considering edges with one endpoint as Vertex 4:
- No suitable edges to form triangles.

Considering edges with one endpoint as Vertex 5:
- No suitable edges to form triangles.

Considering edges with one endpoint as Vertex 6:
- (6, 8): Forms a triangle with Vertex 4

Considering edges with one endpoint as Vertex 7:
- (7, 1): Forms a triangle with Vertex 6

Considering edges with one endpoint as Vertex 8:
- (8, 0): Forms a triangle with Vertex 2

Considering edges with one endpoint as Vertex 9:
- (9, 7): Forms a triangle with Vertex 1

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <1, 6, 7>.
