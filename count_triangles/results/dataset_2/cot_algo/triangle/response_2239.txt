Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 8) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 12) (11, 17) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 16) (18, 3) (18, 2) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 19) (6, 4) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 17) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 8) (0, 10) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 8) (16, 2) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 1) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 9) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 8) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 17) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 4) (19, 9) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 13) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 13) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 9) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

The vertices are sorted based on the number of connections they have:
Vertices: 15 (0 connections), 18 (0 connections), 5 (1 connection), 8 (1 connection), 0 (1 connection), 11 (1 connection), 17 (1 connection), 15 (1 connection), 1 (2 connections), 7 (2 connections), 4 (2 connections), 9 (2 connections), 13 (2 connections), 19 (3 connections), 6 (4 connections), 2 (4 connections), 10 (4 connections), 12 (5 connections), 16 (5 connections), 3 (6 connections).

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will consider each edge and count the triangles based on the shared connections:
1. For the edge (3, 6): <2, 3, 6>
2. For the edge (3, 18): No triangle since both vertices have more connections.
3. For the edge (15, 8): No triangle since both vertices have more connections.
4. For the edge (10, 0): No triangle since both vertices have more connections.
5. For the edge (10, 1): No triangle since both vertices have more connections.
