Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 10) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 10) (14, 11) (7, 3) (7, 2) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 11) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is constructed as below:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]

Edges:
- 0: [8, 5, 11, 6, 2]
- 1: [3, 14, 13, 4]
- 2: [4, 0, 7]
- 3: [1, 7, 6, 9, 5]
- 4: [1, 8, 12, 2, 9, 10]
- 5: [3, 13, 0, 14]
- 6: [3, 8, 0]
- 7: [3, 2]
- 8: [4, 10, 0, 6]
- 9: [3, 4, 12, 11]
- 10: [4, 8, 13, 14]
- 11: [0, 14, 9]
- 12: [4, 13, 14, 9]
- 13: [1, 5, 12, 10]
- 14: [1, 5, 12, 10, 11]

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 16]

<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 13>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 13>, <1, 5, 14>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 12>, <3, 5, 13>, <4, 8, 10>, <4, 9, 11>, <4, 12, 13>, <10, 11, 14>
