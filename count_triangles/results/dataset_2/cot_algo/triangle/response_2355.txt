Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 12) (14, 1) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 19) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 5) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 11) (0, 18) (0, 2) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (4, 5) (4, 18) (18, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 7) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 16) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 19) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 9) (19, 16) (12, 15) (12, 2) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (7, 3) (7, 18) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 19) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

Edges: 
(3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) 
(15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 12) 
(14, 1) 
(17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) 
(8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) 
(13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 19) 
(10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 5) 
(5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) 
(6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 11) 
(0, 18) (0, 2) 
(2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) 
(4, 5) (4, 18) 
(18, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 7) 
(1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 16) 
(9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 19) 
(19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 9) (19, 16) 
(12, 15) (12, 2) 
(11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) 
(7, 3) (7, 18) 
(16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 19)

After reordering the nodes based on their degrees from lowest to highest, the new ordering is: 
[4, 7, 12, 0, 14, 6, 17, 11, 2, 16, 8, 10, 3, 5, 13, 1, 9, 15, 18, 19]

Following the degree-based algorithm to count triangles, we get:
Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles found: 
<1, 13, 19>
<5, 10, 17>
<5, 6, 11>
<5, 6, 3>
<5, 4, 18>
<3, 5, 6>
<9, 16, 19>
<2, 8, 16>
