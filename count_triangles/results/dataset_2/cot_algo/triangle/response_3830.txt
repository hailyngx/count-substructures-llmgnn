Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: {9, 2, 7, 4, 1, 6}
- 1: {0, 2, 7, 8, 4}
- 2: {5, 9, 0, 1, 6}
- 3: {9, 6}
- 4: {9, 0, 1, 6}
- 5: {2, 8, 7}
- 6: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- 7: {5, 0, 8, 1}
- 8: {5, 7, 1}
- 9: {4, 2, 3, 0}

Now, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
- Node 3: Degree = 2
- Node 8: Degree = 3
- Node 5: Degree = 3
- Node 7: Degree = 4
- Node 1: Degree = 5
- Node 6: Degree = 5
- Node 4: Degree = 5
- Node 9: Degree = 4
- Node 2: Degree = 5
- Node 0: Degree = 6

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: 6
Unique Triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <2, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
