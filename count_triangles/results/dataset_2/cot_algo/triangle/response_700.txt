Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 16) (13, 0) (22, 11) (22, 17) (22, 8) (15, 20) (15, 17) (15, 16) (20, 15) (20, 24) (20, 10) (28, 29) (28, 25) (29, 28) (29, 8) (29, 0) (29, 3) (24, 20) (24, 26) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 19) (26, 24) (26, 10) (26, 7) (4, 9) (27, 24) (27, 21) (27, 7) (5, 23) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 14) (0, 13) (0, 29) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 1) (10, 20) (10, 26) (10, 0) (10, 6) (6, 24) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 2) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 9) (18, 3) (3, 29) (3, 18) (3, 8) (17, 22) (17, 15) (17, 2) (23, 5) (23, 7) (21, 27) (21, 11) (25, 28) (25, 9) (14, 5) (14, 16) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 7) (19, 24) (19, 1) (7, 26) (7, 27) (7, 23) (7, 2) (1, 0) (1, 19) (1, 16) (16, 13) (16, 15) (16, 14) (16, 1) (11, 22) (11, 5) (11, 21) (8, 22) (8, 29) (8, 6) (8, 3) 

Response:
The given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: (13, 16), (13, 0), (22, 11), (22, 17), (22, 8), (15, 20), (15, 17), (15, 16), (20, 15), (20, 24), (20, 10), (28, 29), (28, 25), (29, 28), (29, 8), (29, 0), (29, 3), (24, 20), (24, 26), (24, 6), (24, 27), (24, 19), (26, 24), (26, 10), (26, 7), (4, 9), (27, 24), (27, 21), (27, 7), (5, 23), (5, 18), (5, 11), (5, 14), (0, 13), (0, 29), (0, 10), (0, 18), (0, 1), (10, 20), (10, 26), (10, 0), (10, 6), (6, 24), (6, 10), (6, 8), (9, 4), (9, 18), (9, 25), (9, 2), (18, 5), (18, 0), (18, 9), (18, 3), (3, 29), (3, 18), (3, 8), (17, 22), (17, 15), (17, 2), (23, 5), (23, 7), (21, 27), (21, 11), (25...

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their number of connections:

Degree-Based Ordering: 
Node 12 (Degree 0)
Node 1, 2, 4, 13, 14, 16, 19, 21, 23 (Degree 1)
Node 3, 7, 11, 12, 17, 18, 22, 25, 27, 28 (Degree 2)
Node 5, 6, 9, 20, 24, 29 (Degree 3)
Node 0, 8, 10, 15, 26 (Degree 4)

Next, we will count the triangles by considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Number of triangles: [144]
Unique triangles found: <0, 13, 16>, <0, 10, 26>, <0, 10, 6>, <0, 18, 5>, <0, 18, 9>, <0, 18, 3>, <0, 1, 16>, <1, 16, 13>, <2, 9, 18>, <3, 8, 29>, <3, 18, 5>, <3, 18, 9>, <4, 9, 18>, <5, 14, 16>, <5, 11, 21>, <5, 11, 22>, <5, 11, 7>, <5, 11, 23>, <5, 11, 2>, <5, 23, 7>, <6, 10, 26>, <6, 10, 0>, <6, 8, 22>, <6, 8, 29>, <6, 8, 3>, <6, 8, 7>, <7, 2, 23>, <7, 26, 24>, <7, 26, 10>, <7, 26, 6>, <7, 26, 8>, <7, 27, 24>, <8, 22, 17>, <8, 29, 28>, <9, 25, 28>, <13, 16, 15>, <14, 5, 11>, <15, 16, 13>, <15, 17, 22>, <16, 1, 0>, <17, 2, 11>, <18, 5, 23>, <18, 9, 4>, <19, 1, 0>, <20, 15, 17>, <21, 11, 5>, <22, 17, 15>, <24, 20, 15>, <24, 20, 10>, <24, 26, 10>, <25, 9, 4>, <29, 28, 25>
