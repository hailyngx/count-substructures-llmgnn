Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 14) (3, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 12) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 12) (10, 14) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 12) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then checking for triangles based on shared connections between vertices.

Here's the process:

1. List of vertices and their degrees:
- Vertex 0: degree 4
- Vertex 1: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 6
- Vertex 3: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 7
- Vertex 5: degree 4
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 4
- Vertex 8: degree 4
- Vertex 9: degree 3
- Vertex 10: degree 2
- Vertex 11: degree 5
- Vertex 12: degree 5
- Vertex 13: degree 2
- Vertex 14: degree 4

2. Sort vertices by degree:
3 < 10
9 < 13
0 = 1 = 5 = 7 = 8 = 6
11 < 12
4 < 14 < 2

3. Count triangles:
Triangles: 
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 4, 12>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <2, 4, 12>
- <2, 5, 14>
- <2, 6, 11>
- <2, 9, 14>
- <4, 6, 11>
- <4, 6, 12>
- <4, 7, 11>
- <4, 7, 12>

Count of triangles: [15]
