Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 11) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 12) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 7) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 10) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on the number of connections. The sorted nodes are:
Node 3 - Degree: 1
Node 13 - Degree: 1
Node 1 - Degree: 2
Node 3 - Degree: 2
Node 8 - Degree: 4
Node 13 - Degree: 4
Node 6 - Degree: 7
Node 9 - Degree: 7
Node 4 - Degree: 7
Node 14 - Degree: 7
Node 1 - Degree: 7
Node 0 - Degree: 7
Node 3 - Degree: 7
Node 2 - Degree: 8
Node 10 - Degree: 8
Node 12 - Degree: 8
Node 5 - Degree: 8
Node 11 - Degree: 9
Node 7 - Degree: 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.
