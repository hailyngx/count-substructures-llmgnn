Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 12) (15, 24) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 26) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 25) (7, 4) (7, 20) (7, 28) (7, 23) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 28) (22, 2) (3, 24) (3, 16) (12, 15) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 26) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 25) (21, 15) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 25) (28, 7) (28, 18) (28, 21) (28, 20) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 19) (26, 27) (26, 12) (9, 25) (10, 21) (10, 13) (8, 14) (8, 1) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 29) (16, 18) (16, 3) (16, 21) (17, 0) (17, 23) (25, 4) (25, 14) (25, 21) (25, 9) (2, 22) (2, 14) (2, 11) (6, 12) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 23) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 1) (5, 23) (5, 29) (23, 7) (23, 17) (23, 1) (23, 5) (23, 29) (29, 19) (29, 5) (29, 23) (20, 7) (20, 28) (20, 24) (24, 15) (24, 3) (24, 20) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's label the vertices based on their degree in increasing order:

Vertices with degree 1: 0, 6, 9, 17, 20, 22, 27
Vertices with degree 2: 1, 8, 10, 13, 16, 26, 29
Vertices with degree 3: 3, 5, 11, 12, 19, 23, 28
Vertices with degree 4: 2, 4, 7, 14, 18, 24, 25
Vertex with degree 5: 21
Vertex with degree 6: 15

Now, we will count the number of triangles:

1. For edge (4, 7):
    - Vertex 4 has degree 4, and vertex 7 has degree 2.
    - Check their shared connections: Vertex 4 is connected to 18, 25, and 7; vertex 7 is connected to 20, 23, and 28.
    - Triangle formed: <4, 7, 28>

2. For edge (4, 18):
    - Vertex 4 has degree 4, and vertex 18 has degree 4.
    - Check their shared connections: Vertex 4 is connected to 7, 14, 25, and 18; vertex 18 is connected to 16, 28, and 14.
    - Triangles formed: <4, 7, 14> and <4, 7, 18>

3. For edge (4, 25):
    - Vertex 4 has degree 4, and vertex 25 has degree 4.
    - Check their shared connections: Vertex 4 is connected to 7, 18, and 14; vertex 25 is connected to 21, 14, and 9.
    - Triangle formed: <4, 25, 14>

4. Continue this process for all edges.

After counting all the triangles, the total number of triangles in the given graph is **39**.
