Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 13) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 4) (10, 8) (10, 19) (17, 9) (17, 5) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 16) (0, 19) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 16) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 19) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 11) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 12) (8, 10) (8, 9) (9, 17) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 7) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 6) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 19) (7, 14) (7, 9) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 12) (4, 15) (4, 2) (4, 14) (16, 18) (16, 14) (16, 13) (16, 19) (12, 1) (12, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in this graph.

Let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Nodes: [3, 0, 1, 7, 6, 8, 12, 10, 7, 17, 18, 15, 14, 13, 11, 9, 2, 5, 4, 19]
Degrees: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6]

Let's relabel the vertices accordingly:

Nodes: [3(0), 0(1), 1(2), 7(3), 6(4), 8(5), 12(6), 10(7), 7(8), 17(9), 18(10), 15(11), 14(12), 13(13), 11(14), 9(15), 2(16), 5(17), 4(18), 19(19)]

Now we count the number of triangles:
- For each edge, we check if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
- If so, we check for shared connections between the two vertices of the edge to find triangles.

After checking all edges, we find the total number of triangles: [8]

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 6, 19>
<5, 15, 19>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 14, 16>
<9, 10, 19>
<9, 11, 13>
<10, 12, 11>
<13, 16, 18>
