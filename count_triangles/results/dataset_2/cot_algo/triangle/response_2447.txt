Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections

Now, starting from the vertex with the lowest degree and moving to the highest one, we will count the number of triangles in the graph by only considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Total number of triangles: [13]
Unique triangles found: <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 1, 7>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 1, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 8, 0>
