Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
Let's start by constructing the graph with the given nodes and edges. Once we have the graph, we will then count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The graph:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3), (9, 6), (9, 2), (4, 7), (4, 3), (7, 1), (7, 8), (6, 3), (6, 8), (8, 0), (1, 7), (1, 8), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 2)

Now, let's assign numbers to the nodes based on their degrees from lowest to highest:
- Node 2 (Degree: 2)
- Node 4 (Degree: 2)
- Node 5 (Degree: 5)
- Node 6 (Degree: 2)
- Node 1 (Degree: 2)
- Node 7 (Degree: 3)
- Node 9 (Degree: 3)
- Node 0 (Degree: 4)
- Node 8 (Degree: 4)
- Node 3 (Degree: 5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the order where the lower labeled node has fewer connections. We will count the triangles formed by shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

After counting the triangles, we find that there are 4 triangles in total:
- Triangle 1: <5, 0, 8>
- Triangle 2: <5, 1, 8>
- Triangle 3: <5, 3, 8>
- Triangle 4: <7, 1, 8>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
