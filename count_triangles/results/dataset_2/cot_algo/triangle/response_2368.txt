Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 2) (11, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 12) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 3) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are:
Node 8 with 1 connection
Nodes 11, 12 with 2 connections
Nodes 0, 5 with 3 connections
Nodes 1, 4, 8, 10, 14 with 4 connections
Nodes 2, 3, 7, 9 with 5 connections
Node 6 with 6 connections

The triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 5, 11>
<1, 9, 13>
<1, 10, 13>
<2, 9, 10>
<2, 9, 14>
<2, 9, 13>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 13>
<3, 5, 12>
<6, 9, 10>

Total number of triangles: [15]
