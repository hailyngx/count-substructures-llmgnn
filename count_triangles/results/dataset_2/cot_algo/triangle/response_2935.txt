Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The vertices and their respective connections are:
- Vertex 0: 5, 7, 6, 2
- Vertex 1: 4, 2, 8
- Vertex 2: 9, 1, 6, 8, 0
- Vertex 3: 5, 4, 7, 6
- Vertex 4: 9, 1, 3
- Vertex 5: 9, 0, 3
- Vertex 6: 9, 3, 2, 8, 0
- Vertex 7: 9, 0, 3
- Vertex 8: 9, 1, 6, 2
- Vertex 9: 5, 9, 6, 8, 4, 2, 7, 0

Applying degree-based ordering based on the number of connections:
Vertex ordering: 1, 7, 0, 8, 4, 3, 5, 6, 2, 9
