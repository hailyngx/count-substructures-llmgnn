Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges is as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: [(11, 19), (16, 1), (16, 9), (16, 15), (5, 9), (5, 17), (5, 7), (9, 16), (9, 5), (9, 2), (14, 7), (14, 13), (14, 10), (17, 5), (17, 4), (6, 2), (6, 13), (4, 17), (4, 18), (4, 12), (4, 13), (4, 2), (18, 4), (18, 7), (18, 3), (18, 8), (10, 14), (10, 0), (10, 1), (15, 16), (15, 0), (15, 12), (12, 4), (12, 15), (12, 0), (0, 10), (0, 15), (0, 12), (0, 3), (3, 18), (3, 0), (3, 8), (19, 11), (19, 7), (8, 18), (8, 3), (1, 16), (1, 10), (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 4), (13, 14), (13, 6), (13, 4), (13, 7), (7, 5), (7, 14), (7, 18), (7, 19), (7, 13)]

Now let's find the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by the number of connections:
Node 11: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 19: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 18: 4 connections
Node 16: 4 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

Number of triangles: [16]
