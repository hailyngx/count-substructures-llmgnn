Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 5) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 1) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 1) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Nodes: 8, 4, 14, 12, 10, 1, 0, 6, 2, 3, 13, 7, 9, 11, 5

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (8, 13): 8 < 13, Both share connections with 5, forming triangle <8, 13, 5>.
2. Edge (8, 3): 8 < 3, Both share connections with 11, forming triangle <8, 3, 11>.
3. Edge (13, 5): 13 > 5.
4. Edge (10, 4): 10 < 4, Both share connections with 5, forming triangle <10, 4, 5>.
5. Edge (10, 2): 10 < 2, Both share connections with 11, forming triangle <10, 2, 11>.
6. Edge (10, 9): 10 < 9, Both share connections with 7, forming triangle <10, 9, 7>.
7. Edge (11, 3): 11 > 3.
8. Edge (4, 10): 4 < 10, Both share connections with 5, forming triangle <4, 10, 5>.
9. Edge (4, 5): 4 < 5, Both share connections with 13, forming triangle <4, 5, 13>.
10. Edge (7, 12): 7 < 12, Both share connections with 6, forming triangle <7, 12, 6>.
11. Edge (7, 6): 7 < 6, Both share connections with 11, forming triangle <7, 6, 11>.
12. Edge (0, 11): 0 < 11, Both share connections with 5, forming triangle <0, 11, 5>.
13. Edge (0, 14): 0 < 14, Both share connections with 9, forming triangle <0, 14, 9>.
14. Edge (2, 13): 2 < 13, Both share connections with 5, forming triangle <2, 13, 5>.
15. Edge (3, 8): 3 < 8, Both share connections with 11, forming triangle <3, 8, 11>.
16. Edge (3, 4): 3 < 4, Both share connections with 5, forming triangle <3, 4, 5>.
17. Edge (7, 12): 7 < 12, Both share connections with 6, forming triangle <7, 12, 6>.
18. Edge (7, 6): 7 < 6, Both share connections with 11, forming triangle <7, 6, 11>.
19. Edge (9, 0): 9 > 0.
20. Edge (9, 14): 9 > 14.

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles found: <8, 13, 5>, <8, 3, 11>, <10, 4, 5>, <10, 2, 11>, <10, 9, 7>, <4, 5, 13>, <7, 12, 6>, <7, 6, 11>, <0, 11, 5>, <0, 14, 9>, <2, 13, 5>, <3, 8, 11>, <3, 4, 5>
