Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 17) (22, 8) (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 14) (16, 20) (14, 16) (14, 9) (17, 22) (17, 19) (7, 21) (7, 25) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 19) (21, 25) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 28) (6, 9) (6, 25) (6, 18) (6, 23) (6, 20) (9, 22) (9, 14) (9, 6) (9, 29) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 19) (20, 16) (20, 15) (20, 6) (20, 8) (4, 29) (4, 2) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 19) (18, 0) (19, 17) (19, 21) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 0) (3, 21) (25, 7) (25, 21) (25, 6) (25, 28) (29, 9) (29, 4) (29, 1) (29, 10) (2, 22) (2, 4) (2, 10) (5, 26) (5, 23) (5, 24) (5, 0) (8, 22) (8, 20) (8, 28) (28, 15) (28, 25) (28, 8) (24, 5) (1, 12) (1, 29) (1, 0) (23, 7) (23, 6) (23, 5) (0, 18) (0, 26) (0, 5) (0, 1) (10, 12) (10, 29) (10, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first sort the vertices by their degree from least to most and relabel them accordingly. 

The sorted list of vertices with their degrees is as follows:
Node 11: Degree = 0
Node 7: Degree = 2
Node 15: Degree = 3
Node 13: Degree = 5
Node 16: Degree = 5
Node 14: Degree = 5
Node 17: Degree = 6
Node 21: Degree = 6
Node 5: Degree = 6
Node 3: Degree = 6
Node 18: Degree = 6
Node 8: Degree = 6
Node 1: Degree = 6
Node 4: Degree = 6
Node 24: Degree = 6
Node 10: Degree = 6
Node 12: Degree = 6
Node 20: Degree = 7
Node 9: Degree = 7
Node 6: Degree = 7
Node 2: Degree = 7
Node 25: Degree = 7
Node 26: Degree = 7
Node 19: Degree = 8
Node 0: Degree = 8
Node 28: Degree = 8
Node 23: Degree = 8
Node 29: Degree = 8
Node 22: Degree = 9

Now, we proceed to count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method: 

Total number of triangles = [16]

Unique triangles found:
