Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 18) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (0, 16) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 6) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 19) (15, 1) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 12) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 2) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 19) (19, 7) (19, 18) (12, 0) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 17) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (2, 9) (2, 16) (2, 17) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and relabeling them accordingly.

After sorting the vertices, we have the following mapping:

0 -> 4 connections
1 -> 3 connections
3 -> 5 connections
4 -> 4 connections
6 -> 3 connections
7 -> 3 connections
9 -> 5 connections
2 -> 3 connections
5 -> 4 connections
8 -> 4 connections
11 -> 3 connections
12 -> 5 connections
14 -> 3 connections
15 -> 5 connections
10 -> 2 connections
13 -> 2 connections
16 -> 3 connections
17 -> 2 connections
18 -> 3 connections
19 -> 2 connections

Now, we proceed with counting the triangles based on the sorted vertex labels and the edges provided.

There are 16 triangles in total as follows:
[<0, 4, 10>, <0, 4, 14>, <0, 12, 16>, <0, 12, 17>, <4, 6, 11>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 8, 10>, <4, 14, 6>, <5, 6, 11>, <5, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 10>, <6, 11, 13>, <7, 15, 12>, <9, 11, 13>, <9, 12, 13>, <9, 15, 12>]
[16 triangles]
