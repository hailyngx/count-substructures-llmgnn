Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 25) (7, 2) (21, 4) (10, 17) (10, 22) (10, 4) (10, 25) (17, 10) (17, 25) (17, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 29) (20, 6) (20, 0) (20, 18) (20, 16) (12, 27) (12, 16) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 23) (1, 14) (1, 26) (1, 11) (26, 1) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 5) (13, 26) (13, 2) (5, 26) (5, 15) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 23) (25, 7) (25, 10) (25, 17) (16, 20) (16, 12) (16, 28) (16, 19) (15, 5) (15, 18) (3, 6) (3, 27) (3, 22) (3, 29) (18, 20) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 11) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 24) (22, 10) (22, 3) (8, 17) (8, 27) (8, 24) (2, 7) (2, 13) (11, 1) (11, 18) (24, 19) (24, 8) (24, 29) (4, 9) (4, 21) (4, 10) (23, 14) (23, 28) (29, 0) (29, 3) (29, 24) 

Response:
Based on the provided graph, the degree-based ordering of the nodes from least to most connected is as follows:

Nodes: 5, 15, 21, 22, 12, 1, 2, 13, 11, 18, 24, 19, 14, 26, 28, 23, 4, 17, 10, 8, 7, 25, 16, 20, 9, 6, 3, 27, 0, 29

Now, let's count the triangles by examining the edges according to the degree-based ordering rule mentioned earlier:

1. 5-15
2. 21-4
3. 21-13-26
4. 12-3-27
5. 1-14-23
6. 2-7-25
7. 2-13
8. 11-1-14
9. 18-11-1
10. 24-19-18
11. 28-26-13
12. 28-26-23
13. 4-21-10
14. 17-10-4
15. 17-25-7
16. 8-17-25
17. 8-27-3
18. 7-25-10
19. 16-20-6
20. 16-28-26
21. 16-19-18
22. 15-5
23. 15-18
24. 3-6-0
25. 3-22-10
26. 3-27-8
27. 3-29-24
28. 0-14-1
29. 0-20-6
30. 0-29-24

There are a total of 30 triangles in the given graph, represented inside brackets as [30]. Some of the unique triangles include <1, 14, 23>, <7, 25, 10>, and <16, 20, 6>.
