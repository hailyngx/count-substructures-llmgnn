Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 0), (4, 7), (4, 8), (7, 3), (7, 2), (1, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (6, 0), (8, 9), (0, 7), (2, 3), (2, 6)

Next, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
1. Node 1 - degree 1
2. Node 2 - degree 2
3. Node 5 - degree 5
4. Node 9 - degree 5
5. Node 4 - degree 4
6. Node 7 - degree 4
7. Node 6 - degree 3
8. Node 8 - degree 3
9. Node 0 - degree 3
10. Node 3 - degree 3

Now, we will count the triangles:
1. For edge (5, 9): No triangle
2. For edge (5, 1): No triangle
3. For edge (5, 4): Formed triangle {4, 5, 7}
4. For edge (5, 0): No triangle
5. For edge (5, 7): No triangle
6. For edge (9, 6): No triangle
7. For edge (9, 8): No triangle
8. For edge (9, 0): No triangle
9. For edge (4, 7): Formed triangle {4, 5, 7}
10. For edge (4, 8): Formed triangle {4, 8, 9}
11. For edge (7, 3): No triangle
12. For edge (7, 2): No triangle
13. For edge (1, 5): No triangle
14. For edge (3, 6): No triangle
15. For edge (3, 8): No triangle
16. For edge (6, 0): Formed triangle {0, 6, 9}
17. For edge (8, 9): Formed triangle {4, 8, 9}
18. For edge (0, 7): Formed triangle {0, 7, 4}
19. For edge (2, 3): No triangle
20. For edge (2, 6): No triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <4, 5, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, and <0, 4, 7>.
