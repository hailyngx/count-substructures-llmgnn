Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices based on their degrees and then process the edges to count the triangles.

Here is the process:

1. The sorted vertices based on degrees are:  
   (3 connections) : 6  
   (4 connections) : 5, 7  
   (5 connections) : 3, 4, 9  
   (6 connections) : 0, 1, 2, 8  

2. Now, we will process the edges while considering the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections.

The total number of triangles found is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
