Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 16) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 3) (9, 13) (9, 26) (9, 15) (26, 13) (26, 22) (26, 9) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 18) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (3, 22) (3, 10) (3, 6) (11, 19) (21, 13) (21, 20) (21, 12) (21, 4) (20, 21) (20, 29) (20, 18) (29, 20) (29, 7) (29, 25) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 24) (24, 17) (24, 16) (24, 8) (24, 23) (7, 29) (7, 10) (7, 1) (19, 11) (19, 25) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 15) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 27) (1, 12) (2, 1) (5, 25) (5, 4) (5, 28) (8, 0) (8, 24) (8, 15) (8, 27) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 8) (10, 3) (10, 7) (25, 29) (25, 19) (25, 5) (25, 28) (23, 24) (23, 28) (4, 0) (4, 21) (4, 5) (18, 17) (18, 20) (18, 12) (27, 1) (27, 8) (28, 5) (28, 25) (28, 23) (12, 21) (12, 1) (12, 18) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed based on the given information. Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

```
Nodes sorted by degree:
0: 3 connections
2: 1 connection
5: 4 connections
11: 2 connections
13: 5 connections
17: 3 connections
19: 2 connections
23: 2 connections
27: 2 connections
4: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
8: 3 connections
10: 2 connections
12: 3 connections
16: 3 connections
18: 3 connections
26: 3 connections
1: 5 connections
7: 3 connections
9: 3 connections
21: 4 connections
25: 4 connections
3: 3 connections
15: 3 connections
14: 3 connections
22: 3 connections
24: 4 connections
20: 3 connections
29: 3 connections
```

By following the Degree-Based Ordering and considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we count the triangles. 

There are a total of 57 triangles in the graph.
