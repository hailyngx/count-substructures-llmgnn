Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) 
(4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) 
(1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) 
(6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) 
(2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2)

Now we will label the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order. We have:
Nodes: 7, 5, 4, 3, 7, 2, 6, 6, 8, 9

Now we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. For node 0: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 6) form a triangle <0, 1, 6>.
2. For node 1: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6) form a triangle <1, 3, 4>.
3. For node 2: (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7) form a triangle <2, 4, 6>.
4. For node 3: (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6) form a triangle <1, 3, 4>.
5. For node 4: (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 8) form a triangle <1, 3, 4>.
6. For node 5: No triangles.
7. For node 6: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 9) form a triangle <1, 2, 6>.
8. For node 7: No triangles.
9. For node 8: (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 0) form a triangle <0, 4, 8>.
10. For node 9: (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3) form a triangle <0, 2, 3>.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 2, 3>
