Edges: 
(15, 18), (15, 2), (27, 0), (27, 22), (27, 16), (1, 29), (1, 23), (1, 18), (21, 24), (21, 0), (0, 27), (0, 21), (0, 8), (0, 13), (10, 11), (11, 10), (11, 3), (11, 14), (11, 18), (11, 5), (4, 7), (4, 18), (4, 26), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 17), (12, 17), (12, 9), (17, 7), (17, 12), (17, 16), (18, 15), (18, 1), (18, 11), (18, 4), (19, 26), (19, 14), (26, 4), (26, 19), (26, 13), (26, 23), (26, 25), (24, 21), (24, 3), (24, 28), (24, 20), (24, 25), (13, 0), (13, 26), (13, 5), (13, 16), (3, 11), (3, 24), (3, 2), (5, 11), (5, 13), (5, 20), (28, 24), (22, 27), (22, 20), (14, 11), (14, 19), (14, 29), (23, 1), (23, 26), (23, 6), (29, 1), (29, 14), (29, 25), (16, 27), (16, 17), (16, 13), (16, 20), (2, 15), (2, 7), (2, 3), (6, 7), (6, 23), (6, 25), (20, 24), (20, 5), (20, 22), (20, 16), (8, 0), (9, 12), (25, 26), (25, 24), (25, 29)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:

Sorted Vertices by Degree: 
Nodes in increasing order of degree: [8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 1, 5, 22, 28, 29, 2, 3, 6, 14, 19, 7, 20, 23, 27, 4, 11, 13, 16, 17, 21, 25, 26, 0, 18, 24]

Triangles (in unique vertex IDs):

<11, 18, 1>
<11, 18, 5>
<11, 18, 15>
<11, 18, 7>
