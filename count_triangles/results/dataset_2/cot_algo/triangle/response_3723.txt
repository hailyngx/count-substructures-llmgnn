Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0: 2, 6, 7, 8
1: 5
2: 0, 3, 8, 9
3: 2, 4, 5, 9
4: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
5: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8
6: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
7: 0, 4, 5
8: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6
9: 2, 3, 4, 6
```

Now, let's count the triangles.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 8>
