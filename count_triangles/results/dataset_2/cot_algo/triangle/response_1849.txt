Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 18) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 18) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 15) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 17) (8, 7) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 2) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 12) (6, 13) (17, 9) (17, 8) (17, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 18) (13, 6) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 14) (18, 12) (4, 17) (4, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 19) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. The vertices are relabeled as follows:
Node 5: degree 4 (smallest degree)
Node 6: degree 1
Node 11: degree 4
Node 13: degree 1
Node 16: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 17: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4
Node 12: degree 3
Node 18: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 19: degree 3
Node 3: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 4: degree 2
Node 10: degree 3
Node 15: degree 3 (largest degree)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we process the edges to count the triangles. Here are the triangles found:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <0, 1, 19>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <0, 2, 15>
- <1, 5, 19>
- <1, 19, 7>
- <2, 5, 15>
- <2, 8, 15>
- <8, 17, 4>
- <8, 17, 9>
- <8, 7, 19>
- <9, 15, 5>
- <9, 17, 8>
- <9, 17, 4>
- <10, 11, 18>
- <10, 18, 14>
- <14, 11, 16>
- <14, 16, 11>
- <11, 16, 14>
- <12, 9, 15>
- <12, 9, 17>
- <12, 18, 14>
- <12, 18, 11>
- <16, 14, 11>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [26].
