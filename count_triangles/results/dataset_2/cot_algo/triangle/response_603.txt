Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph:

The Degree-Based Ordering method states that we start by sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has.

The vertices with their corresponding degrees are:
- Node 0: degree 6
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 6
- Node 7: degree 6
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 6

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Node 0 (degree 6) -> Node A
- Node 1 (degree 4) -> Node B
- Node 2 (degree 3) -> Node C
- Node 3 (degree 2) -> Node D
- Node 4 (degree 4) -> Node E
- Node 5 (degree 3) -> Node F
- Node 6 (degree 6) -> Node G
- Node 7 (degree 6) -> Node H
- Node 8 (degree 3) -> Node I
- Node 9 (degree 6) -> Node J

Let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:
- <A, B, E>
- <A, E, G>
- <A, E, J>
- <A, E, I>
- <B, E, G>
- <B, E, I>
- <B, E, J>
- <B, E, H>
- <D, F, G>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
