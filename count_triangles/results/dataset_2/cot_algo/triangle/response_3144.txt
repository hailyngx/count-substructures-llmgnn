Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 12) (9, 10) (9, 8) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 14) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 15
Edges: 60

Edges:
(1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) 
(3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 14) 
(10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 9) 
(11, 7) (11, 2) 
(8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) 
(13, 5) (13, 7) 
(4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) 
(5, 12) (5, 7) 
(6, 7) (6, 2) 
(0, 14) (0, 12) 
(14, 13)

Now, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Nodes by degree:
3: 2 connections
1: 3 connections
11: 3 connections
0: 3 connections
8: 5 connections
13: 3 connections
4: 5 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 3 connections
2: 3 connections
14: 4 connections
10: 4 connections
12: 5 connections
7: 4 connections
9: 2 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [15]

Unique triangles found: 
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 10, 11>
<1, 11, 2>
<3, 10, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 0, 12>
<11, 8, 13>
<8, 4, 6>
<8, 5, 12>
<8, 6, 2>
<13, 5, 7>
<13, 7, 6>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 6>
<5, 7, 6>
