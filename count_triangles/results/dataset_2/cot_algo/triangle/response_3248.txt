Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 6) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 6) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 13) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 11), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 7), (5, 14), (9, 14), (4, 12), (4, 10), (7, 12), (8, 13), (8, 10), (8, 6), (13, 14), (10, 1), (11, 1), (12, 2), (0, 6), (0, 2), (6, 2)

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degrees:
Nodes by degree: 1, 9, 11, 13, 14, 3, 6, 8, 2, 7, 12, 10, 4, 0, 5

Now, let's count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 5]
<0, 4, 12>
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 6, 2>
<8, 10, 6>
<10, 11, 1>
