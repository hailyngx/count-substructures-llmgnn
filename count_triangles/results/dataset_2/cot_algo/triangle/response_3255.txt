Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
The vertices with their respective degrees are:
- Vertex 6: degree 5
- Vertex 9: degree 5
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 5
- Vertex 7: degree 4
- Vertex 5: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 8: degree 4
- Vertex 0: degree 5

Sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, we get:
1 < 3 < 7 < 2 < 8 < 5 < 0 < 7 < 9 < 4

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the triangles:
1. <4, 7, 9>
2. <0, 6, 9>
3. <0, 1, 6>
4. <3, 4, 7>
5. <2, 3, 7>
6. <1, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
