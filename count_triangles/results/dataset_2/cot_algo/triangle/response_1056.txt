Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 6), (0, 9), 
(1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 9), 
(2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 9), 
(3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), 
(4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 9), 
(5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 9), 
(6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 8), 
(7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 6), 
(8, 3), (8, 6), 
(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4)

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 6 connections.
Node 4 has 6 connections.
Node 9 has 8 connections.

Now, let's count the number of triangles by looking for shared connections between the two endpoints of each edge:

Triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 5, 4>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
