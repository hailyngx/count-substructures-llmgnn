Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 10) (10, 7) (10, 12) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 0) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (9, 11), (9, 0), (9, 12), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 14), (1, 4), (3, 13), (4, 8), (8, 6), (6, 14), (0, 7), (7, 10)

To count the number of triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method, we'll relabel the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices by degree: 
(0: 4), (1: 5), (2: 4), (3: 4), (4: 5), (5: 4), (6: 4), (7: 3), (8: 2), (9: 4), (10: 2), (11: 4), (12: 2), (13: 3), (14: 4)

With this ordering, we start counting triangles using the given edges based on the rule that the vertex with the lower label should have fewer connections:

Triangles: 
[24]
<0, 1, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 4, 14>, <3, 4, 13>, <3, 13, 14>, <4, 6, 11>, <4, 8, 13>, <4, 11, 13>, <6, 7, 14>, <0, 7, 14>, <6, 8, 14>, <0, 7, 10>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 13, 14>, <4, 6, 13>, <1, 2, 14>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 9, 12>, <0, 9, 12>, <4, 9, 11>, <6, 9, 11>
