Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 19) (16, 0) (16, 6) (1, 21) (1, 14) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 13) (21, 14) (4, 25) (7, 22) (18, 2) (18, 8) (22, 7) (22, 14) (22, 6) (8, 18) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (13, 21) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 2) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 3) (9, 25) (9, 15) (9, 17) (26, 13) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 3) (15, 9) (15, 20) (15, 25) (20, 15) (28, 29) (28, 12) (29, 28) (29, 5) (29, 12) (29, 24) (12, 28) (12, 29) (23, 11) (23, 1) (23, 0) (23, 27) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 23) (0, 17) (25, 4) (25, 9) (25, 15) (25, 6) (27, 23) (27, 3) (27, 5) (19, 11) (19, 3) (6, 16) (6, 22) (6, 25) (6, 17) (17, 8) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 6) (17, 3) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 27) (3, 19) (3, 17) (14, 1) (14, 21) (14, 22) (14, 5) (24, 29) (24, 5) (5, 29) (5, 27) (5, 14) (5, 24) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed. Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Vertex 28: 2 connections
Vertex 19: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 20: 2 connections
Vertex 12: 3 connections
Vertex 18: 3 connections
Vertex 24: 3 connections
Vertex 27: 3 connections
Vertex 29: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 26: 4 connections
Vertex 16: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 5 connections
Vertex 21: 5 connections
Vertex 15: 5 connections
Vertex 22: 5 connections
Vertex 25: 5 connections
Vertex 13: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 6 connections
Vertex 14: 6 connections
Vertex 2: 6 connections
Vertex 3: 7 connections
Vertex 8: 7 connections
Vertex 6: 7 connections
Vertex 17: 7 connections
Vertex 10: 7 connections
Vertex 23: 7 connections
Vertex 11: 8 connections

The total number of triangles []: 42
