Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 4) (0, 3) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges first. 

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 7), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 1), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 1), (8, 6), (8, 3), (2, 6), (2, 7), (1, 7), (6, 7), (3, 0)

Next, we need to sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections).

Node degrees:
0: 2
1: 2
2: 3
3: 3
4: 3
5: 5
6: 3
7: 4
8: 5
9: 4

Reorder the nodes based on their degrees:
0 → 1 → 6 → 3 → 2 → 4 → 9 → 7 → 8 → 5

Now, we will check the edges and count the number of triangles formed:
- Edge (3, 0) is a triangle with shared connection 4: <0, 3, 4>
- Edge (1, 7) is a triangle with shared connection 2: <1, 7, 2>

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <0, 3, 4>, <1, 7, 2>
