Now, let's count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The total number of triangles is: [110]

The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 16>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 20>, <0, 4, 18>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 10, 20>, <0, 14, 27>, <0, 19, 25>, <0, 24, 17>, <1, 4, 18>, <1, 4, 19>, <1, 4, 24>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 4, 20>, <1, 7, 6>, <1, 7, 18>, <1, 7, 20>, <1, 12, 25>, ...
