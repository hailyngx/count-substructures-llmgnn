Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 27) (11, 20) (16, 29) (16, 9) (16, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 22) (5, 29) (9, 16) (9, 25) (9, 15) (15, 9) (15, 2) (27, 11) (27, 28) (27, 26) (27, 8) (18, 26) (18, 19) (22, 5) (22, 24) (10, 26) (10, 7) (6, 16) (6, 5) (6, 29) (28, 27) (28, 19) (28, 2) (28, 23) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 17) (26, 27) (26, 18) (26, 10) (26, 19) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 20) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 4) (17, 19) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 23) (0, 12) (3, 12) (3, 17) (25, 9) (25, 21) (13, 21) (13, 4) (21, 25) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 2) (8, 5) (8, 27) (20, 11) (20, 7) (20, 4) (2, 15) (2, 28) (2, 1) (2, 21) (29, 16) (29, 5) (29, 6) (24, 22) (24, 14) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 20) (4, 14) (23, 28) (23, 17) (23, 21) (23, 14) (14, 24) (14, 4) (14, 23) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently in the given graph. Let's perform the calculations as follows:

1. Sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):
Nodes with degrees:
0: 1
1: 3
3: 3
7: 3
12: 3
13: 2
14: 3
20: 3
24: 2
25: 2
6: 3
10: 3
5: 4
8: 2
15: 2
2: 4
26: 4
29: 3
16: 3
22: 2
28: 4
17: 3
18: 3
19: 5
27: 4
21: 3
4: 4
9: 3
11: 3

2. Relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
0: 1
13: 2
24: 3
25: 4
8: 5
22: 6
15: 7
17: 8
4: 9
2: 10
7: 11
12: 12
21: 13
1: 14
5: 15
6: 16
10: 17
29: 18
16: 19
20: 20
3: 21
14: 22
23: 23
28: 24
9: 25
26: 26
18: 27
27: 28
19: 29
11: 30

3. Count the triangles:
From the given edges, we find the following unique triangles:
<5, 6, 16>, <2, 4, 13>, <2, 4, 14>, <2, 4, 20>, <2, 13, 21>, <2, 14, 23>, <2, 21, 23>, <5, 6, 29>, <5, 8, 27>, <5, 22, 24>, <6, 16, 29>, <10, 20, 7>, <14, 23, 4>, <17, 1, 3>, <17, 1, 23>, <17, 3, 12>, <17, 3, 21>, <17, 1, 4>, <18, 26, 19>, <19, 11, 27>, <19, 11, 20>, <19, 27, 8>, <19, 28, 2>, <19, 26, 10>, <24, 22, 5>.

Total number of unique triangles: [24].
