Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 15) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 16) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 19) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 15) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 2) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 15) (4, 3) (4, 6) (1, 17) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 7) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 12) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 13) (16, 9) (16, 2) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 14) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 4) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (12, 10) (12, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 6) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most and relabeling the vertices accordingly. Let's begin by constructing the graph with the given edges:

Vertices:  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:  (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 7), (1, 13), (1, 17), (2, 11), (2, 13), (2, 16), (2, 18), (2, 19), (3, 4), (3, 10), (3, 17), (4, 6), (4, 13), (6, 13), (6, 14), (6, 4), (7, 8), (7, 13), (7, 19), (8, 10), (8, 12), (8, 7), (9, 11), (9, 16), (10, 12), (10, 19), (11, 14), (13, 19), (14, 15), (14, 6), (15, 5), (15, 17)

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:

Vertices:  8, 0, 7, 6, 10, 4, 1, 2, 12, 11, 9, 13, 5, 3, 17, 14, 19, 16, 18, 15

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles, we will now proceed with checking for triangles formed by shared connections between vertices. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [18]. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 3, 4>, <1, 7, 13>, <2, 11, 16>, <2, 13, 19>, <3, 10, 17>, <4, 6, 13>, <7, 8, 10>, <7, 8, 12>, <7, 13, 19>, <10, 12, 19>, <11, 9, 16>, <11, 14, 15>, <13, 6, 14>, <13, 7, 19>, <14, 6, 4>, <15, 5, 17>
