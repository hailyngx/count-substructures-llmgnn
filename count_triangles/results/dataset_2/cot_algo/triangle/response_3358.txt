Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Degree of each node:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 6
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3

Nodes sorted by degree: 7, 8, 9, 5, 2, 0, 4, 3, 6, 1
