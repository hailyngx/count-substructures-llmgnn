Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
By considering the given graph's edges, we can construct the following graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
0: 6, 4, 8, 7
1: 6, 3, 8, 5
2: 5, 6, 3, 4, 7
3: 6, 1, 7, 4, 2
4: 6, 3, 2, 0
5: 9, 2, 8, 1
6: 1, 3, 2, 4, 0
7: 9, 3, 0, 2
8: 5, 1, 0
9: 5, 7

Now let's sort the vertices by the number of connections from least to most and relabel them accordingly:

Nodes: 9, 8, 7, 0, 5, 4, 1, 2, 3, 6

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and checking for shared connections, we find the following triangles:
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 5, 8>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
