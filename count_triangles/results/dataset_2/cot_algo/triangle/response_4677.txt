Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 1) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 12) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degrees (number of connections). The sorted order will be as follows: 

Node 3: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 7: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 8: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 5: degree 6
Node 9: degree 5
Node 10: degree 6
Node 11: degree 6
Node 4: degree 3
Node 0: degree 3

According to the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now consider the edges starting from the nodes with the lowest degree.
