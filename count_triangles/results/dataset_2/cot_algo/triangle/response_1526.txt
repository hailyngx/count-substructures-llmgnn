This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 18) (21, 1) (21, 9) (21, 8) (21, 22) (10, 17) (10, 24) (17, 10) (17, 20) (17, 8) (17, 27) (8, 21) (8, 17) (8, 29) (8, 22) (23, 2) (23, 25) (23, 0) (4, 19) (4, 6) (4, 26) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 0) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 24) (13, 6) (26, 4) (26, 13) (26, 16) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 20) (20, 17) (20, 5) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 28) (15, 19) (9, 21) (9, 29) (9, 11) (29, 8) (29, 9) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 0) (27, 17) (27, 29) (14, 18) (14, 5) (16, 26) (3, 28) (3, 0) (28, 20) (28, 3) (28, 7) (28, 12) (28, 25) (11, 9) (2, 23) (22, 21) (22, 8) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 29) (19, 6) (0, 23) (0, 18) (0, 29) (0, 3) (25, 23) (25, 28) (25, 6) (7, 20) (7, 28) (7, 24) (12, 5) (12, 20) (12, 28) (24, 10) (24, 13) (24, 7) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 19) (6, 25) 

Response:
The graph based on the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges:
- 0: {18, 23, 29, 3}
- 1: {21, 18}
- 2: {23}
- 3: {28, 0}
- 4: {19, 6, 26}
- 5: {13, 14, 20, 12}
- 6: {4, 13, 19, 25}
- 7: {20, 28, 24}
- 8: {21, 17, 29, 22}
- 9: {21, 29, 11}
- 10: {17, 24}
- 11: {9}
- 12: {5, 20, 28}
- 13: {26, 5, 6, 24}
- 14: {18, 5}
- 15: {19}
- 16: {26}
- 17: {10, 8, 20, 27}
- 18: {1, 14, 0}
- 19: {4, 15, 29, 6}
- 20: {17, 5, 7, 12, 28}
- 21: {1, 8, 9, 22}
- 22: {8, 21}
- 23: {2, 25, 0}
- 24: {10, 13, 7}
- 25: {23, 6, 28}
- 26: {4, 13, 16}
- 27: {17, 29}
- 28: {3, 7, 12, 25, 20}
- 29: {8, 9, 27, 19, 0}

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Degree of nodes:
- Node 2: 1 connections
- Node 11: 1 connections
- Node 15: 1 connections
- Node 16: 1 connections
- Nodes 1, 22: 2 connections
- Nodes 10, 2: 2 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Nodes 4, 10, 15, 16, 23: 3 connections
- Node 29: 5 connections
- Nodes 0, 14, 2: 4 connections
- Node 12: 5 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Nodes 6, 24, 25: 4 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Nodes 8, 11, 22: 4 connections
- Nodes 9, 1, 27: 4 connections
- Nodes 13, 26: 4 connections
- Node 20: 5 connections
- Node 17: 4 connections
- Node 18: 3 connections
- Node 19: 4 connections
- Node 21: 4 connections
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 12: 5 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Nodes 6, 24, 25: 4 connections
- Node 11: 4 connections
- Nodes 9, 17, 27: 4 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections

Using the degree-based ordering method, we count the number of triangles with the provided 90 edges as follows:
