Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) 

Response:
Nodes sorted by their degrees:
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections

Based on degree-based ordering, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(5, 0), (5, 3), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 7), (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 8), (2, 8), (2, 0), (2, 7), (8, 9), (8, 7), (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 6), (8, 1), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 6), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 1), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 0), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 2), (0, 8), (0, 3)
