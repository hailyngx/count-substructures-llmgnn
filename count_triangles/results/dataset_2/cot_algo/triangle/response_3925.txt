Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 15) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 28) (25, 22) (8, 20) (8, 14) (13, 4) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 7) (18, 5) (18, 17) (17, 18) (17, 0) (29, 6) (29, 0) (29, 5) (21, 24) (21, 23) (24, 21) (24, 27) (22, 25) (22, 26) (22, 14) (22, 28) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 15) (28, 25) (28, 22) (28, 1) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 16) (27, 24) (27, 7) (27, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 22) (14, 1) (14, 5) (23, 21) (23, 26) (23, 6) (16, 20) (16, 4) (16, 15) (15, 11) (15, 26) (15, 16) (15, 0) (1, 28) (1, 14) (19, 2) (19, 3) (19, 6) (0, 17) (0, 29) (0, 15) (0, 9) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 29) (6, 23) (6, 19) (6, 3) (3, 19) (3, 6) (3, 12) (5, 18) (5, 29) (5, 27) (5, 14) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 27) (12, 11) (12, 9) (12, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in a graph involves sorting vertices by their degrees and then identifying triangles based on the connectivity of the vertices.

After constructing the graph and sorting the vertices by their degrees, the list of vertices in ascending order of degrees is as follows:
<0, 9, 13, 17, 18, 1, 3, 7, 12, 24, 28, 5, 6, 19, 21, 23, 27, 2, 8, 11, 15, 16, 22, 25, 26, 29, 4, 10, 14, 20>

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and examining the given edges, we can count the number of triangles in the graph and identify the unique triangles.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [18].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 5, 29>, <0, 6, 29>, <0, 15, 29>, <2, 7, 10>, <2, 11, 10>, <2, 19, 3>, <4, 10, 13>, <5, 14, 27>, <5, 18, 27>, <9, 12, 3>, <14, 22, 25>, <14, 22, 28>, <14, 22, 5>, <14, 22, 8>, <15, 16, 20>, <15, 26, 22>, <15, 26, 23>, <19, 3, 6>
