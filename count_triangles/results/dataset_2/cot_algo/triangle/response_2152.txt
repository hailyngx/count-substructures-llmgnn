Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 4) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 13) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 5) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections they have. Let's label the vertices based on their degrees in increasing order:

0: 4 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 6 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 6 connections
10: 3 connections
11: 4 connections
12: 6 connections
13: 4 connections
14: 3 connections

Now, we'll go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

Triangles: [16]
Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 12>
<0, 4, 3>
<1, 10, 13>
<2, 4, 12>
<2, 4, 3>
<4, 11, 14>
<4, 5, 14>
<4, 11, 5>
<4, 11, 1>
<4, 12, 6>
<4, 12, 0>
<5, 11, 14>
<5, 4, 14>
<9, 8, 10>
