Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 9) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 14) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 15) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 8) (12, 16) (12, 0) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 15) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 18) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 4) (18, 11) (18, 13) (18, 19) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 4) (9, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 6) (2, 15) (4, 16) (4, 19) (4, 5) (15, 17) (15, 14) (15, 13) (15, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their degrees in increasing order:
   - Vertex 3 has degree 3
   - Vertex 5 has degree 2
   - Vertex 9 has degree 1
   - Vertex 18 has degree 3
   - Vertex 0 has degree 2
   - Vertex 2 has degree 2
   - Vertex 4 has degree 3
   - Vertex 6 has degree 4
   - Vertex 15 has degree 4
   - Vertex 7 has degree 4
   - Vertex 10 has degree 3
   - Vertex 11 has degree 3
   - Vertex 13 has degree 4
   - Vertex 19 has degree 4
   - Vertex 1 has degree 3
   - Vertex 8 has degree 5
   - Vertex 12 has degree 2
   - Vertex 14 has degree 2
   - Vertex 17 has degree 3
   - Vertex 16 has degree 4

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   - Vertex 3 -> A
   - Vertex 5 -> B
   - Vertex 9 -> C
   - Vertex 18 -> D
   - Vertex 0 -> E
   - Vertex 2 -> F
   - Vertex 4 -> G
   - Vertex 6 -> H
   - Vertex 15 -> I
   - Vertex 7 -> J
   - Vertex 10 -> K
   - Vertex 11 -> L
   - Vertex 13 -> M
   - Vertex 19 -> N
   - Vertex 1 -> O
   - Vertex 8 -> P
   - Vertex 12 -> Q
   - Vertex 14 -> R
   - Vertex 17 -> S
   - Vertex 16 -> T

3. Calculate the triangles:
   - Triangle <A, B, P>
   - Triangle <C>
   - Triangle <D, F, I>
   - Triangle <D, F, J>
   - Triangle <D, H, J>
   - Triangle <E, G, Q>
   - Triangle <G, R>
   - Triangle <G, T>
   - Triangle <H, I>
   - Triangle <H, M>
   - Triangle <H, N>
   - Triangle <H, S, T>
   - Triangle <I, M>
   - Triangle <I, S>
   - Triangle <J, M>
   - Triangle <J, N>
   - Triangle <J, S>
   - Triangle <K, O>
   - Triangle <L, O>
   - Triangle <L, N>
   - Triangle <M, N>
   - Triangle <P>
   - Triangle <Q>
   - Triangle <R>
   - Triangle <S, T>

Therefore, there are 26 triangles in the given graph.  
The total number of triangles is [26].
