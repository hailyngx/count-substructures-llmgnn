Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 5) (26, 8) (26, 27) (5, 9) (5, 18) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 6) (27, 26) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 16) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 18) (3, 13) (22, 2) (22, 15) (22, 8) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 13) (23, 12) (8, 26) (8, 22) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 23) (13, 28) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 21) (2, 1) (2, 22) (2, 18) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 14) (28, 13) (28, 29) (28, 19) (28, 25) (29, 28) (29, 7) (29, 15) (14, 0) (14, 10) (14, 18) (14, 25) (17, 1) (17, 23) (17, 19) (7, 0) (7, 23) (7, 8) (7, 29) (7, 15) (6, 0) (6, 21) (6, 15) (21, 27) (21, 11) (21, 6) (21, 25) (12, 23) (12, 16) (16, 27) (16, 10) (16, 12) (24, 19) (24, 20) (4, 20) (15, 22) (15, 29) (15, 7) (15, 6) (20, 24) (20, 4) (20, 19) (19, 28) (19, 17) (19, 24) (19, 20) (25, 28) (25, 14) (25, 21) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph. 

After sorting the vertices by their degrees in increasing order, the new labeling of the nodes from 0 to 29 is as follows:
Nodes sorted by degree: [9, 26, 1, 3, 10, 4, 5, 24, 12, 16, 11, 2, 22, 18, 14, 25, 29, 17, 7, 6, 21, 0, 8, 13, 23, 27, 15, 19, 20, 28]

The triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 18, 1>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 14, 25>
<0, 14, 18>
<0, 7, 15>
<0, 21, 27>
<0, 27, 14>
<1, 18, 2>
<2, 18, 5>
<7, 15, 29>
<13, 23, 17>
<14, 18, 25>
<16, 21, 25>
<19, 20, 24>
<19, 20, 28>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
