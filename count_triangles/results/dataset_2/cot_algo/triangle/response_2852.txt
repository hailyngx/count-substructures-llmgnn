Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 6) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 18) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 9) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (1, 16) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (7, 19) (13, 17) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 15) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 0) (0, 19) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 12) (2, 17) (2, 9) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 18) (5, 14) (5, 18) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 18) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted list of vertices is as follows:

Vertex 0: Degree 1
Vertex 7: Degree 1
Vertex 19: Degree 3
Vertex 4: Degree 3
Vertex 13: Degree 3
Vertex 20: Degree 4
Vertex 2: Degree 4
Vertex 5: Degree 4
Vertex 9: Degree 4
Vertex 12: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 4
Vertex 1: Degree 4
Vertex 10: Degree 5
Vertex 14: Degree 5
Vertex 8: Degree 5
Vertex 18: Degree 6
Vertex 17: Degree 6
Vertex 6: Degree 6
Vertex 15: Degree 6
Vertex 11: Degree 7
Vertex 16: Degree 7

Following the method described, we will count the triangles formed by the connections:

1. For the edge (11, 16), process since Vertex 11 has fewer connections:
   - Shared connections with (11, 16): 6
   - Triangles: <11, 16, 6>, <11, 16, 15>

2. For the edge (11, 3), process since Vertex 3 has fewer connections:
   - Shared connections with (11, 3): None

3. For the edge (11, 6), process since Vertex 11 has fewer connections:
   - Shared connections with (11, 6): None

4. For the edge (11, 15), process since Vertex 11 has fewer connections:
   - Shared connections with (11, 15): None

5. For the remaining edges, none can form triangles following the method.

The total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <11, 16, 6>, <11, 16, 15>
