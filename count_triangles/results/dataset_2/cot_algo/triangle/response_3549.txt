Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (9, 13) (9, 18) (9, 7) (9, 27) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 3) (29, 8) (6, 24) (6, 27) (6, 0) (4, 18) (4, 21) (4, 2) (18, 9) (18, 4) (26, 23) (26, 3) (26, 0) (0, 6) (0, 26) (0, 7) (0, 23) (0, 19) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 20) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 27) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 16) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 8) (16, 7) (16, 15) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 23) (21, 4) (21, 16) (21, 22) (24, 6) (24, 16) (24, 12) (24, 23) (23, 26) (23, 0) (23, 16) (23, 24) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 27) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 20) (3, 17) (3, 26) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 20) (20, 7) (20, 19) (20, 11) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 24) (12, 11) (12, 8) (27, 9) (27, 6) (27, 1) (27, 13) (8, 29) (8, 10) (8, 12) (25, 2) (22, 21) (2, 4) (2, 25) 

Response:
First, construct the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(5, 12) (9, 13) (9, 18) (9, 7) (9, 27) 
(14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 3) (29, 8) 
(6, 24) (6, 27) (6, 0) (4, 18) (4, 21) 
(4, 2) (18, 9) (18, 4) (26, 23) (26, 3) 
(26, 0) (0, 6) (0, 26) (0, 7) (0, 23) 
(0, 19) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 16) 
(7, 20) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 27) (15, 1) 
(15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 16) (10, 14) (10, 1) 
(10, 8) (16, 7) (16, 15) (16, 21) (16, 24) 
(16, 23) (21, 4) (21, 16) (21, 22) (24, 6) 
(24, 16) (24, 12) (24, 23) (23, 26) (23, 0) 
(23, 16) (23, 24) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 19) 
(13, 27) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 13) 
(19, 20) (3, 17) (3, 26) (11, 13) (11, 12) 
(11, 20) (20, 7) (20, 19) (20, 11) (12, 5) 
(12, 15) (12, 24) (12, 11) (12, 8) (27, 9) 
(27, 6) (27, 1) (27, 13) (8, 29) (8, 10) 
(8, 12) (25, 2) (22, 21) (2, 4) (2, 25)

Next, order the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order:
Nodes in degree-based order: 28, 17, 5, 22, 25, 29, 3, 11, 10, 18, 13, 14, 21, 8, 2, 26, 1, 20, 9, 4, 12, 15, 19, 16, 6, 7, 24, 27, 0, 23

Now, we will count the triangles:
Triangles: [546]
Unique triangles: <2, 4, 21>, <2, 4, 25>, <2, 21, 22>, <4, 21, 22>, <6, 23, 26>, <6, 24, 16>, <6, 24, 23>, <7, 0, 16>, <7, 0, 19>, <7, 16, 21>, <7, 16, 24>, <9, 13, 27>, <11, 12, 20>, <11, 12, 13>, <14, 10, 1>, <14, 10, 8>, <15, 12, 24>, <15, 12, 16>, <15, 16, 24>, <18, 9, 4>, <18, 4, 21>, <19, 14, 10>, <19, 14, 7>, <19, 14, 13>, <19, 14, 0>, <19, 0, 15>, <19, 0, 20>, <19, 15, 1>, <20, 11, 13>, <20, 11, 12>, <20, 11, 7>, <20, 11, 13>, <23, 0, 26>, <23, 16, 24>, <27, 13, 9>
