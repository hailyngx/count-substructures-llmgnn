This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 0) (1, 21) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 15) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 27) (29, 5) (29, 18) (7, 21) (7, 19) (7, 18) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 15) (23, 4) (0, 22) (0, 1) (20, 27) (20, 4) (24, 26) (24, 12) (11, 1) (11, 23) (11, 28) (28, 11) (28, 19) (26, 24) (17, 8) (17, 27) (25, 2) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 15) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 3) (3, 9) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 10) (27, 29) (27, 20) (27, 17) (27, 19) (27, 6) (14, 13) (14, 22) (14, 15) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 28) (19, 27) (15, 13) (15, 21) (15, 23) (15, 8) (15, 14) (6, 13) (6, 27) (6, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (16, 9) (16, 4) (12, 1) (12, 24) (12, 10) (18, 29) (18, 7) (4, 23) (4, 20) (4, 16) 

Response:
Constructing the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 22), (1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 21), (2, 9), (2, 19), (2, 25), (2, 29), (3, 9), (4, 16), (4, 20), (4, 23), (4, 24), (5, 10), (5, 22), (5, 29), (6, 10), (6, 13), (6, 27), (7, 18), (7, 19), (7, 21), (7, 27), (8, 15), (8, 17), (8, 1), (9, 16), (9, 2), (9, 3), (10, 12), (10, 5), (11, 1), (11, 23), (11, 28), (12, 1), (12, 10), (12, 24), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 22), (13, 6), (14, 15), (14, 22), (14, 13), (15, 14), (15, 21), (15, 13), (15, 8), (15, 23), (16, 9), (16, 4), (17, 8), (17, 27), (17, 27), (18, 7), (18, 29), (19, 2), (19, 7), (19, 27), (19, 28), (20, 4), (20, 27), (21, 1), (21, 15), (21, 7), (22, 13), (22, 14), (22, 5), (22, 0), (22, 23), (23, 4), (23, 15), (23, 22), (23, 11), (24, 4), (24, 12), (24, 26), (25, 2), (26, 24), (26, 27), (27, 29), (27, 17), (27, 20), (27, 6), (28, 11), (28, 19), (29, 2), (29, 5), (29, 18), (29, 27)

After sorting the nodes by the number of connections from least to most, relabeling the nodes from 0 to 29, we can calculate the number of triangles:

Number of triangles: [27]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 1, 21>, <0, 1, 22>, <0, 21, 1>, <0, 21, 7>, <1, 7, 21>, <2, 9, 19>, <2, 9, 29>, <2, 19, 9>, <2, 19, 27>, <3, 9, 16>, <4, 16, 20>, <4, 16, 23>, <7, 18, 29>, <7, 19, 27>, <7, 21, 1>, <8, 15, 17>, <8, 15, 21>, <9, 16, 3>, <9, 16, 4>, <9, 19, 27>, <10, 12, 5>, <11, 21, 15>, <12, 10, 5>, <13, 14, 15>, <14, 15, 22>, <19, 27, 29>, <21, 7, 1>, <21, 15, 13>
