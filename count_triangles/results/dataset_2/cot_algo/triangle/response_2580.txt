Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 6) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(0, 14), (0, 3),
(1, 11), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 12), (1, 14),
(2, 13), (2, 14),
(3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 12),
(4, 1), (4, 10), (4, 11), (4, 12), (4, 13),
(5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 9),
(6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 11), (6, 13),
(7, 1), (7, 10), (7, 12), (7, 8),
(8, 7), (8, 9), (8, 14),
(9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 11),
(10, 4), (10, 7), (10, 12),
(11, 1), (11, 4), (11, 6), (11, 9), (11, 14),
(12, 3), (12, 4), (12, 7), (12, 10), (12, 1),
(13, 2), (13, 4), (13, 6), (13, 14),
(14, 0), (14, 2), (14, 1), (14, 8), (14, 11), (14, 13)

After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels will be:
0 - 3 connections
2 - 2 connections
7 - 4 connections
5 - 3 connections
10 - 3 connections
8 - 3 connections
13 - 4 connections
6 - 4 connections
12 - 5 connections
9 - 5 connections
1 - 6 connections
11 - 6 connections
4 - 6 connections
3 - 6 connections
14 - 7 connections

Thus, a total of [18] triangles are present in the graph as follows:
<0, 3, 14>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, 
<2, 13, 14>, <7, 8, 14>, <7, 8, 9>, <7, 10, 12>, 
<5, 3, 6>, <5, 3, 9>, <10, 7, 12>, <8, 9, 11>, 
<13, 4, 14>, <13, 6, 11>, <6, 3, 11>, <3, 4, 12>, 
<3, 7, 12>, <1, 4, 11>
