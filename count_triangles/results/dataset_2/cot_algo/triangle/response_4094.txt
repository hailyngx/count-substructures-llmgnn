Response:
The degree-based ordering method is as follows:
1. Node 11 has degree 5.
2. Node 4 has degree 5.
3. Node 12 has degree 5.
4. Node 0 has degree 4.
5. Node 14 has degree 4.
6. Node 3 has degree 4.
7. Node 5 has degree 3.
8. Node 6 has degree 3.
9. Node 1 has degree 3.
10. Node 19 has degree 4.
11. Node 7 has degree 3.
12. Node 8 has degree 2.
13. Node 10 has degree 2.
14. Node 2 has degree 2.
15. Node 17 has degree 4.
16. Node 13 has degree 3.
17. Node 15 has degree 2.
18. Node 18 has degree 2.
19. Node 9 has degree 1.
20. Node 16 has degree 3.
