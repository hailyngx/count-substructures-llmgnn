Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 4) (5, 11) (6, 18) (6, 16) (4, 10) (4, 17) (18, 6) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 19) (8, 15) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 9) (19, 8) (19, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 15) (12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 3) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 9) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 7) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (7, 14) (7, 19) (7, 9) (15, 8) (15, 0) (15, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. After relabeling the vertices accordingly and examining the given edges, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.

After sorting the nodes by degree:
- Node 5 has degree 1 connections.
- Nodes 1, 5, 6, 8, and 18 all have degree 2 connections.
- Nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 19 have degree 4 connections.
- Nodes 3, 13, and 17 have degree 5 connections.
- Nodes 10 and 11 have the highest degree of 6 connections.

Following the method of counting triangles and analyzing the given edges, the total number of triangles in the graph is given below:

\[ [18] \]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 13, 15>
<0, 3, 10>
<0, 4, 17>
<0, 9, 14>
<0, 9, 16>
<0, 9, 7>
<3, 10, 13>
<3, 9, 7>
<4, 10, 17>
<7, 9, 14>
<7, 9, 16>
<8, 15, 0>
<11, 13, 10>
<12, 16, 9>
<12, 3, 9>
<14, 9, 16>
<15, 13, 0>
