Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}
Edges: (3, 15), (3, 21), (3, 27), (3, 13), (15, 3), (15, 0), (15, 18), (6, 24), (9, 14), (9, 13), (2, 5), (2, 26), (2, 1), (2, 28), (29, 17), (29, 11), (0, 15), (0, 20), (0, 21), (0, 5), (20, 0), (4, 27), (4, 22), (4, 26), (18, 15), (17, 29), (17, 23), (17, 19), (17, 5), (17, 21), (22, 4), (22, 26), (22, 1), (26, 2), (26, 4), (26, 22), (26, 13), (26, 11), (13, 3), (13, 9), (13, 26), (13, 10), (13, 27), (27, 3), (27, 4), (27, 13), (28, 2), (28, 10), (21, 3), (21, 0), (21, 17), (21, 19), (21, 25), (11, 29), (11, 26), (11, 23), (11, 1), (23, 17), (23, 11), (23, 7), (23, 12), (8, 19), (8, 12), (19, 17), (19, 21), (19, 8), (19, 7), (19, 1), (7, 23), (7, 19), (7, 25), (7, 14), (25, 21), (25, 7), (24, 6), (24, 1), (5, 2), (5, 0), (5, 17), (1, 2), (1, 22), (1, 11), (1, 19), (1, 24), (14, 9), (14, 7), (10, 13), (10, 28), (12, 23), (12, 8)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Node 26 has the highest degree: 6 connections
- Node 16 has the lowest degree: 0 connections

Therefore, after relabeling the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes: {16, 4, 15, 20, 6, 0, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 17, 23, 24, 25, 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 13, 18, 19, 21, 22, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Calculating triangles using the sorted edges:
- Triangles: 6 found

Final result: 
[6]
Unique triangles: <15, 0, 21>, <1, 2, 26>, <1, 11, 26>, <1, 19, 21>, <1, 22, 26>, <13, 9, 26>
