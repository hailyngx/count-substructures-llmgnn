Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 6) (22, 28) (15, 20) (15, 1) (15, 29) (15, 28) (27, 10) (27, 9) (14, 4) (14, 10) (17, 18) (7, 21) (7, 25) (7, 26) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 19) (21, 24) (20, 15) (20, 26) (20, 8) (20, 28) (29, 15) (29, 5) (28, 22) (28, 15) (28, 20) (28, 8) (3, 21) (3, 11) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 23) (25, 7) (25, 16) (25, 4) (25, 2) (1, 15) (1, 23) (1, 0) (8, 20) (8, 28) (8, 19) (8, 10) (19, 21) (19, 8) (19, 6) (19, 0) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 25) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 10) (16, 25) (16, 26) (6, 22) (6, 19) (6, 24) (24, 21) (24, 6) (24, 9) (24, 2) (23, 11) (23, 1) (2, 25) (2, 24) (2, 5) (5, 29) (5, 3) (5, 2) (18, 17) (26, 7) (26, 20) (26, 16) (26, 0) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 26) (10, 27) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 12) (9, 13) (9, 27) (9, 24) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with vertices and edges as described. 

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees from least to most connections:
Vertices: (sorted based on degrees)
0: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
12: 4 connections
16: 4 connections
18: 4 connections
27: 4 connections
1: 5 connections
3: 5 connections
5: 5 connections
11: 5 connections
19: 5 connections
14: 6 connections
17: 6 connections
23: 6 connections
4: 7 connections
10: 7 connections
20: 7 connections
21: 7 connections
22: 7 connections
24: 7 connections
29: 7 connections
25: 8 connections
26: 8 connections
8: 9 connections
9: 9 connections
28: 9 connections
13: 10 connections

Now, based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- For each edge, we will only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

After counting the triangles by checking for shared connections, we find:
Triangles: <0, 15, 20>, <3, 5, 21>, <2, 21, 24>, <6, 19, 21>, <7, 25, 26>, <9, 13, 27>, <2, 5, 24>, <1, 15, 29>, <10, 12, 14>, <8, 19, 20>, <0, 19, 26>, <4, 12, 25>, <2, 5, 25>, <4, 12, 10>, <3, 5, 11>, <7, 21, 24>, <22, 28, 8>, <22, 28, 20>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [18].
