Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 7) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 5) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 4) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 6) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 14) 
(1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 14) 
(2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) 
(3, 2) (3, 1) 
(4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 12) 
(5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 14) 
(6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 12) 
(7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) 
(8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 13) 
(9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 14) 
(10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) 
(11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 10) 
(12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 8) 
(13, 7) (13, 8) 
(14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9)

After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are: 
Node 0: Degree 6
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 6
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 5
Node 11: Degree 3
Node 12: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 2
Node 14: Degree 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles and the total number of triangles in the graph are as follows:

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles:
<8, 10, 4>
<8, 10, 6>
<8, 10, 9>
<8, 10, 11>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 12>
<0, 6, 12>
<2, 5, 14>
