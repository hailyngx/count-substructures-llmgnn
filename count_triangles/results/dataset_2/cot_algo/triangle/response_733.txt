Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 8) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 13) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 2) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 7) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the provided edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (0, 8), (0, 12), (0, 14), (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 9), (1, 10), (1, 13), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 10), (2, 12), (2, 14), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 14), (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 13), (5, 9), (5, 11), (6, 3), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 14), (7, 8), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 6), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 7), (8, 11), (8, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 1), (10, 1), (10, 2), (10, 13), (11, 5), (11, 8), (12, 13), (12, 0), (12, 14), (12, 2), (13, 12), (13, 4), (13, 1), (13, 10), (14, 6), (14, 0), (14, 3), (14, 12), (14, 2)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes by degree: 11(2), 4(3), 10(3), 7(4), 9(4), 14(4), 0(5), 6(5), 1(5), 12(5), 3(5), 8(6), 2(6), 5(6), 13(6)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [30]
Unique Triangles: <0, 3, 14>, <0, 7, 14>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 12, 14>, <0, 12, 2>, <0, 12, 13>, <0, 12, 4>, <1, 7, 14>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 6>, <1, 9, 4>, <1, 9, 5>, <1, 10, 2>, <1, 10, 13>, <2, 3, 14>, <2, 3, 12>, <2, 5, 14>, <2, 5, 10>, <3, 6, 14>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 14>, <4, 9, 5>, <4, 9, 13>, <7, 8, 6>, <7, 8, 11>, <13, 12, 2>, <13, 12, 4>, <13, 10, 1>, <14, 6, 8>
