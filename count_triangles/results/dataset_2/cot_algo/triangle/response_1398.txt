Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 9) (13, 18) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 20) (4, 7) (4, 25) (4, 29) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 24) (7, 1) (10, 22) (10, 11) (10, 27) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 27) (11, 25) (11, 17) (12, 27) (12, 0) (27, 10) (27, 11) (27, 12) (27, 20) (1, 7) (1, 26) (1, 28) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 2) (2, 26) (2, 5) (2, 21) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 6) (19, 26) (19, 17) (19, 28) (19, 9) (23, 11) (23, 26) (3, 28) (3, 6) (28, 1) (28, 19) (28, 3) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 16) (24, 7) (24, 0) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 6) (5, 22) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 16) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 29) (15, 21) (0, 12) (0, 24) (0, 15) (14, 18) (18, 13) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 21) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 18) (29, 4) (29, 15) (20, 22) (20, 27) (25, 4) (25, 11) (21, 2) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections they have. Then, we can count the number of triangles by looking for shared connections between vertices connected by an edge.

After sorting the vertices by their degrees:

Vertices:  
0 (degree 3)  
3 (degree 3)  
12 (degree 2)  
14 (degree 1)  
13 (degree 2)  
22 (degree 3)  
4 (degree 3)  
10 (degree 3)  
11 (degree 4)  
27 (degree 4)  
1 (degree 3)  
26 (degree 4)  
2 (degree 3)  
5 (degree 3)  
8 (degree 3)  
21 (degree 4)  
15 (degree 4)  
29 (degree 2)  
18 (degree 4)  
16 (degree 3)  
9 (degree 3)  
19 (degree 4)  
17 (degree 3)  
6 (degree 4)  
7 (degree 4)  
20 (degree 2)  
23 (degree 3)  
24 (degree 3)  
25 (degree 2)  
28 (degree 3)

Using the lower labeled vertex criterion, we can go through the edges to count the triangles.  

There are 16 triangles in total:  
[16]  

And the unique triangles are:  
<0, 1, 7>  
<0, 1, 26>  
<0, 3, 6>  
<0, 3, 8>  
<0, 3, 15>  
<0, 12, 27>  
<2, 5, 21>  
<4, 7, 15>  
<4, 15, 21>  
<4, 7, 24>  
<4, 7, 29>  
<6, 8, 21>  
<11, 10, 27>  
<11, 25, 27>  
<11, 25, 17>  
<15, 21, 18>
