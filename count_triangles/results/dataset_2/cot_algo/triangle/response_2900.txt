Node 17: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
Node 10: 6 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 18: 6 connections
Node 15: 6 connections
Node 11: 6 connections
