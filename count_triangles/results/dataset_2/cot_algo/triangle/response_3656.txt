Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 10) (26, 23) (26, 2) (26, 20) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 22) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 22) (7, 2) (7, 13) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 0) (21, 20) (21, 18) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 8) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 29) (12, 22) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 25) (4, 8) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 24) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 21) (20, 26) (20, 21) (6, 10) (6, 28) (6, 18) (6, 19) (28, 6) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 24) (23, 26) (23, 5) (23, 15) (23, 16) (29, 12) (29, 28) (1, 11) (1, 24) (1, 13) (16, 28) (16, 23) (16, 19) (3, 14) (3, 21) (25, 10) (25, 27) (5, 12) (5, 23) (2, 26) (2, 7) (22, 17) (22, 7) (22, 12) (15, 14) (15, 23) (15, 13) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 6) (19, 16) (24, 8) (24, 28) (24, 1) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 15) (18, 21) (18, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by constructing the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(9, 10), (26, 23), (26, 2), (26, 20), (14, 17), (14, 0), (14, 3), (14, 15), (17, 14), (17, 22), (7, 21), (7, 0), (7, 22), (7, 2), (7, 13), (21, 7),
(21, 3), (21, 0), (21, 20), (21, 18), (10, 9), (10, 11), (10, 6), (10, 25), (11, 10), (11, 1), (11, 19), (11, 8), (12, 27), (12, 5), (12, 29), 
(12, 22), (12, 19), (27, 12), (27, 25), (4, 8), (8, 11), (8, 4), (8, 24), (0, 14), (0, 7), (0, 21), (20, 26), (20, 21), (6, 10), (6, 28),
(6, 18), (6, 19), (28, 6), (28, 29), (28, 16), (28, 24), (23, 26), (23, 5), (23, 15), (23, 16), (29, 12), (29, 28), (1, 11), (1, 24), (1, 13),
(16, 28), (16, 23), (16, 19), (3, 14), (3, 21), (25, 10), (25, 27), (5, 12), (5, 23), (2, 26), (2, 7), (22, 17), (22, 7), (22, 12), (15, 14),
(15, 23), (15, 13), (19, 11), (19, 12), (19, 6), (19, 16), (24, 8), (24, 28), (24, 1), (13, 7), (13, 1), (13, 15), (18, 21), (18, 6)

Now, we will label the nodes based on their degree, starting from the least connected node to the most connected node:

Degree 2: 4, 5, 9, 17, 18
Degree 3: 1, 3, 13, 15, 19, 22, 24, 25, 27
Degree 4: 0, 2, 16, 20, 23, 26, 29
Degree 5: 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 21, 28
Degree 6: 11
Degree 7: 14

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles. 

After counting, the total number of triangles is [7].

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 14, 21>, <0, 14, 3>, <0, 14, 15>, <0, 14, 17>, <2, 7, 21>, <2, 7, 14>, <11, 8, 4>
