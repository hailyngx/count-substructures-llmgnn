Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 19) (3, 15) (3, 11) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 14) (15, 11) (14, 15) (14, 17) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 12) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 16) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 16) (8, 2) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 2) (11, 0) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 7) (19, 5) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 0) (10, 9) (10, 12) (0, 11) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 6) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 12) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 12) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 0) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
```
Node  Degree
0     5
1     4
2     4
3     3
4     3
5     2
6     3
7     3
8     1
9     4
10    3
11    4
12    4
13    3
14    2
15    4
16    3
17    4
18    3
19    4
```

The triangles found in the graph are:
- <0, 6, 12>
- <0, 13, 19>
- <1, 6, 12>
- <1, 7, 2>
- <1, 15, 11>
- <2, 7, 5>
- <3, 11, 15>
- <4, 13, 19>
- <4, 16, 12>
- <5, 7, 2>
- <9, 10, 12>
- <9, 10, 17>
- <9, 12, 16>
- <9, 12, 17>
- <9, 12, 6>
- <9, 12, 10>
- <9, 12, 16>
- <9, 12, 17>
- <9, 12, 6>
- <10, 12, 16>
- <10, 12, 17>
- <10, 12, 6>
- <11, 15, 1>
- <11, 15, 3>
- <11, 15, 14>
- <12, 16, 4>
- <12, 16, 18>
- <12, 16, 10>
- <12, 16, 18>
- <12, 16, 10>
- <12, 17, 14>
- <12, 17, 9>
- <12, 17, 14>
- <12, 17, 9>
- <12, 17, 14>
- <12, 17, 9>
- <12, 17, 14>
- <12, 17, 9>
- <12, 17, 14>
- <12, 17, 9>
- <12, 17, 14>
- <12, 17, 9>
- <12, 17, 14>
- <12, 17, 9>
- <13, 0, 19>
- <13, 4, 16>
- <13, 19, 0>
- <14, 15, 17>
- <16, 18, 2>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [46].
