Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
I will construct the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 8, 7, 4
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 8, 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 6
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 0, 6, 8, 4
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 5, 3, 0
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 2, 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 8, 0, 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 2, 0, 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 3

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes with the least connections first:
9(2), 2(3), 6(4), 5(3), 0(4), 4(4), 7(5), 1(4), 8(5), 3(6)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check for triangles:

Triangles:
[<3, 8, 1>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 7, 5>]

Total number of triangles: [4]
