Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are:
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Nodes 0, 8, 6: 4 connections
Nodes 2, 4, 7, 9: 5 connections

Now, we will consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
