Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 10) (14, 6) (14, 2) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 1) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort the vertices based on their degrees. 

Vertices sorted by degree: 
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 14: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 13: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 6: 7 connections
Node 12: 4 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now consider each edge and only count triangles where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

Triangles found:
<2, 4, 8>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 13>
<1, 2, 9>
<5, 10, 13>

Total number of triangles: [5]
