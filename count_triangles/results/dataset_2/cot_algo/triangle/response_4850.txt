Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 6) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 12) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) 

Response:
The given graph with nodes and edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 15
Edges: 60

Edges:
(5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 0) 
(9, 1) (9, 0) 
(4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) 
(7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 8) 
(8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 6) 
(13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 6) 
(10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 14) 
(11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 12) 
(12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 14) 
(0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
(14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 0) 
(2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 3) 
(1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 6) 
(6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 1) 
(3, 10) (3, 2)

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 9: Degree 2
Vertex 3: Degree 2
Vertex 14: Degree 3
Vertex 5: Degree 3
Vertex 7: Degree 4
Vertex 6: Degree 4
Vertex 0: Degree 5
Vertex 8: Degree 5
Vertex 13: Degree 5
Vertex 12: Degree 5
Vertex 11: Degree 5
Vertex 4: Degree 5
Vertex 1: Degree 5
Vertex 2: Degree 5
Vertex 10: Degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph. 

[Total number of triangles: 26]

<0, 2, 5> <0, 2, 7> <0, 3, 10> <0, 6, 1> <0, 6, 8> <0, 6, 13> <0, 6, 10> <0, 6, 14> <0, 9, 1>
<0, 9, 4> <0, 1, 4> <0, 1, 10> <0, 1, 6> <0, 1, 14> <0, 2, 5> <0, 2, 7> <0, 2, 12> <0, 5, 11>
