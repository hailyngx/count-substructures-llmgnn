Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 27) (22, 11) (22, 1) (1, 22) (1, 21) (1, 5) (21, 13) (21, 1) (21, 2) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 15) (3, 20) (25, 18) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 24) (10, 29) (11, 22) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 0) (15, 17) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 9) (2, 21) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 17) (8, 20) (8, 2) (8, 7) (19, 22) (19, 26) (19, 16) (19, 27) (26, 19) (26, 18) (26, 23) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (28, 16) (28, 18) (28, 23) (16, 19) (16, 28) (16, 27) (18, 25) (18, 26) (18, 28) (4, 10) (4, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (23, 26) (23, 28) (5, 1) (24, 10) (24, 0) (24, 9) (9, 11) (9, 20) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 24) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 24) (27, 22) (27, 19) (27, 16) (29, 10) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method will help us count the number of triangles present in the graph.

Here are the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 5
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 5
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 4
- Node 20: degree 3
- Node 21: degree 3
- Node 22: degree 7
- Node 23: degree 3
- Node 24: degree 3
- Node 25: degree 1
- Node 26: degree 4
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 29: 1

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly based on their degrees, starting from 0 (lowest degree) to 29 (highest degree).

The relabeled graph with nodes sorted by degree:
- Node 25: 0
- Node 29: 1
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 4
- Node 0: 5
- Node 20: 6
- Node 13: 7
- Node 21: 8
- Node 1: 9
- Node 14: 10
- Node 15: 11
- Node 16: 12
- Node 23: 13
- Node 28: 14
- Node 2: 15
- Node 12: 16
- Node 6: 17
- Node 8: 18
- Node 26: 19
- Node 18: 20
- Node 19: 21
- Node 27: 22
- Node 7: 23
- Node 17: 24
- Node 9: 25
- Node 24: 26
- Node 10: 27
- Node 11: 28
- Node 22: 29

With the relabeled nodes, we can now count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [96]
