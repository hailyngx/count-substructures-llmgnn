Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 3), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 7), (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 0), (1, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 0), (4, 9), (4, 1), (4, 8), (4, 0), (7, 9), (7, 6), (7, 3), (7, 0), (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 0), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 8), (0, 6), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 8)

Next, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Nodes in sorted order: 1, 5, 7, 8, 3, 4, 0, 6, 9, 2

Now, we will count the triangles according to the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [8]

Unique triangles found: <0, 6, 9>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9>
