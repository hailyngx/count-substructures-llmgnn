Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (13, 4) (13, 1) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 18) (17, 2) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 19) (12, 6) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 17) (15, 14) (15, 16) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 18) (0, 5) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 18) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 16) (1, 6) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 3) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree, which is the number of connections each vertex has with other vertices. 

For this graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, the degrees of each vertex are as follows (vertex: degree):
- 0: 3
- 1: 2
- 2: 4
- 3: 5
- 4: 5
- 5: 3
- 6: 4
- 7: 3
- 8: 4
- 9: 3
- 10: 2
- 11: 4
- 12: 1
- 13: 2
- 14: 3
- 15: 2
- 16: 3
- 17: 4
- 18: 5
- 19: 4

We will relabel the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Vertex 12 (degree 1)
- Vertices 1, 10, 13, 15 (degree 2)
- Vertices 0, 9, 7 (degree 3)
- Vertices 2, 8, 14, 16 (degree 4)
- Vertices 3, 4, 5, 6, 17, 19 (degree 5)

Now, we will go through the edges following the Degree-Based Ordering method. 
We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The triangles found in the graph are:
- <5, 0, 3>
- <0, 1, 6>
- <3, 7, 19>
- <3, 14, 15>
- <5, 11, 3>
- <5, 11, 4>
- <6, 4, 13>
- <10, 11, 17>
- <16, 15, 14>
- <18, 16, 17>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
