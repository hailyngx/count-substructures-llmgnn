Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 6), (0, 8), 
(1, 5), (1, 8), 
(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 9), 
(3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 7), 
(4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8), 
(5, 6), (5, 8), 
(6, 7), (6, 9), 
(7, 9), 
(8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 5), 
(9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes: 1, 0, 8, 5, 2, 7, 4, 3, 6, 9

Now, we will count the triangles:

Triangles: [<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 7>, <4, 5, 8>]

Total number of triangles: [8]
