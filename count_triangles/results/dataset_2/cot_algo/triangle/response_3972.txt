Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 

Response:
The given graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- 0: 5, 7, 8, 2
- 1: 9, 4, 8
- 2: 7, 3, 0, 6
- 3: 7, 6, 2
- 4: 9, 8, 1, 6
- 5: 9, 8, 0
- 6: 4, 3, 8, 2
- 7: 9, 0, 3, 2
- 8: 5, 9, 4, 1, 6, 0
- 9: 5, 8, 4, 1, 7

Now, we will perform the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node degrees: 
0: 4
1: 3
2: 4
3: 3
4: 4
5: 3
6: 4
7: 4
8: 6
9: 5

Sorted nodes based on degrees: 1, 3, 5, 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 8

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

Triangles: 
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 8, 7>
<2, 7, 3>
<2, 6, 4>
<4, 8, 1>
<8, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
