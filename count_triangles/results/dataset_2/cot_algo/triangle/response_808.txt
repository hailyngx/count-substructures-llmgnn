Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 5) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 4) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 2) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 16) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 5) (8, 1) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 13) (12, 15) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 13) (5, 14) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 19) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 18) (13, 5) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 5) (19, 0) (15, 10) (15, 12) (15, 2) (2, 11) (2, 15) (16, 14) (16, 3) (16, 10) (16, 9) (0, 19) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering is as follows:
Node 0 - Degree 1
Node 1 - Degree 3
Node 2 - Degree 2
Node 3 - Degree 3
Node 4 - Degree 4
Node 5 - Degree 5
Node 6 - Degree 4
Node 7 - Degree 2
Node 8 - Degree 1
Node 9 - Degree 3
Node 10 - Degree 3
Node 11 - Degree 2
Node 12 - Degree 2
Node 13 - Degree 5
Node 14 - Degree 4
Node 15 - Degree 3
Node 16 - Degree 4
Node 18 - Degree 5
Node 19 - Degree 5

Edges sorted by the lower-degree node:
(1, 3) (1, 13) (3, 4) (3, 16) (4, 5) (5, 13) (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 16) (10, 15) (13, 18) (15, 2) (18, 19)

Triangles:
[<1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 13>, <3, 4, 5>, <5, 13, 18>, <6, 9, 16>]

Total number of triangles: [5]
