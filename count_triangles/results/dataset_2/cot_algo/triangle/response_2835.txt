Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 3) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (8, 13) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 0) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 9) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 18) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 9) (0, 16) (0, 13) (0, 18) (1, 10) (1, 4) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 2) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 0) (15, 14) (15, 9) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 5) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 19) (9, 15) (4, 1) 

Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. 

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method as described. 

The sorted list of nodes based on their degrees are: 
Nodes - Degree
16 - 3
0 - 3
3 - 3
14 - 5
18 - 6
7 - 6
10 - 4
9 - 4
13 - 3
8 - 3
6 - 4
2 - 3
19 - 4
17 - 2
5 - 3
12 - 2
1 - 2
15 - 2
11 - 2
4 - 1

Based on this ordering, we will analyze each edge to count the triangles. 

After analysis, the total number of triangles in the graph is [24]. 
The unique triangles found are <6, 10, 7>, <7, 9, 10>, <7, 10, 6>, <0, 13, 14>, <0, 13, 18>, <0, 18, 5>, <0, 18, 19>, <3, 14, 5>, <3, 14, 18>, <3, 5, 18>, <18, 19, 2>, <18, 19, 5>, <18, 19, 9>, <14, 15, 9>, <14, 15, 3>, <14, 17, 6>, <8, 13, 0>, <8, 13, 14>, <8, 12, 18>, <5, 18, 19>, <9, 15, 14>, <9, 15, 3>, <9, 19, 5>, <9, 19, 18>.
