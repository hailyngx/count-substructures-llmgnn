Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 24) (2, 28) (29, 5) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 10) (25, 1) (25, 0) (25, 18) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 6) (0, 25) (0, 28) (20, 22) (20, 23) (28, 2) (28, 0) (28, 7) (19, 26) (19, 22) (19, 12) (26, 19) (22, 20) (22, 19) (22, 4) (6, 13) (6, 21) (6, 14) (21, 6) (21, 14) (21, 24) (4, 13) (4, 22) (4, 27) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 17) (27, 5) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 16) (17, 3) (17, 13) (17, 27) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 18) (7, 3) (7, 28) (7, 18) (7, 1) (5, 29) (5, 27) (5, 23) (5, 12) (23, 20) (23, 5) (23, 15) (14, 6) (14, 21) (14, 27) (1, 25) (1, 7) (1, 24) (15, 9) (15, 23) (15, 11) (15, 12) (15, 24) (10, 3) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 11) (24, 2) (24, 21) (24, 1) (24, 15) (11, 8) (11, 15) (11, 12) (18, 25) (18, 16) (18, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has been constructed with 30 nodes and 90 edges based on the provided edge list. To count triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will sort vertices based on their degree connections from least to most:

1. Node 29: degree 1
2. Node 3, 9, 10, 26, 28, 29: degree 2
3. Node 0, 4, 7, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27: degree 3
4. Node 1, 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, 18, 25: degree 4

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes with degree 1: 29
Nodes with degree 2: 3, 9, 10, 26, 28
Nodes with degree 3: 0, 4, 7, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27
Nodes with degree 4: 1, 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, 18, 25

Proceeding with the edges, we will count the triangles by checking shared neighbors for each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

The total number of triangles is [186].
