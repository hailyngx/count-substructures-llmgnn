Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections.

Here is the sorted list of vertices with their respective degrees:
(1, 3), (2, 3), (7, 3), (8, 4), (6, 4), (9, 4), (5, 4), (4, 5), (0, 6)

Following the instruction to only count triangles when the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles using the given edges:

Counting triangles:
<1, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 9, 1>
<5, 9, 3>
<5, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [8]
