Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 16) (2, 21) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 16) (29, 12) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 10) (3, 9) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 6) (25, 11) (10, 3) (10, 26) (10, 13) (11, 25) (11, 1) (11, 5) (7, 21) (7, 24) (7, 9) (21, 2) (21, 7) (21, 28) (8, 28) (8, 22) (23, 19) (17, 29) (17, 6) (17, 4) (28, 3) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 14) (28, 24) (13, 10) (13, 26) (13, 14) (26, 10) (26, 13) (26, 14) (26, 6) (26, 4) (1, 25) (1, 11) (1, 22) (19, 23) (19, 18) (19, 16) (4, 17) (4, 26) (4, 12) (12, 29) (12, 4) (12, 16) (22, 8) (22, 1) (22, 0) (16, 2) (16, 29) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 0) (14, 28) (14, 13) (14, 26) (14, 9) (6, 25) (6, 17) (6, 26) (6, 27) (0, 22) (0, 16) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 14) (18, 19) (18, 20) (20, 18) (20, 27) (20, 24) (24, 7) (24, 28) (24, 20) (27, 6) (27, 20) (5, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method begins by sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. 

The sorted list of nodes with their degrees are:

Node 15: 0 connections
Nodes 0, 5, 23: 1 connection
Nodes 7, 8, 18: 2 connections
Nodes 1, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 22, 27: 3 connections
Nodes 2, 10, 24, 25, 26: 4 connections
Nodes 4, 6, 11, 12, 21, 28: 5 connections
Nodes 3, 17, 29: 6 connections
Node 9: 7 connections
Node 16: 8 connections

Triangles in the given graph exist at node triads (sets of three nodes forming triangles):

<0, 2, 16>
<0, 4, 24>
<1, 6, 25>
<1, 11, 22>
<2, 7, 21>
<3, 9, 14>
<4, 6, 26>
<4, 12, 16>
<4, 12, 29>
<5, 11, 25>
<6, 14, 28>
<7, 9, 24>
<16, 19, 29>

Total number of triangles: [13]
