Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are:
(0: 2),
(3: 3),
(9: 3),
(5: 4),
(7: 4),
(2: 5),
(8: 5),
(1: 6),
(6: 6),
(4: 8).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles in the given graph are as follows:
