Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 1) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 13) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 14) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 1) 

Response:
The graph with nodes and edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (9, 5), (8, 0), (11, 4), (10, 8)
- 1: (4, 7), (12, 4), (11, 2), (10, 8), (1, 8)
- 2: (5, 2), (8, 2), (6, 2), (3, 2), (14, 2), (11, 2)
- 3: (2, 3), (10, 3), (12, 3)
- 4: (7, 4), (12, 4), (13, 4), (1, 4), (11, 4)
- 5: (9, 5), (13, 5), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 14)
- 6: (7, 6), (2, 6)
- 7: (4, 7), (6, 7), (13, 7), (14, 7)
- 8: (5, 8), (2, 8), (10, 8), (1, 8), (8, 0)
- 9: (5, 9), (0, 9)
- 10: (8, 10), (3, 10), (0, 10), (1, 10)
- 11: (4, 11), (2, 11), (0, 11), (12, 11)
- 12: (4, 12), (3, 12), (11, 12), (13, 12)
- 13: (5, 13), (4, 13), (7, 13), (12, 13)
- 14: (5, 14), (2, 14), (1, 14), (7, 14)

Next, we sort the nodes by their degree in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:
Nodes by degree: 6, 9, 10, 3, 7, 1, 0, 12, 8, 11, 14, 2, 4, 13, 5

After relabeling, the edges to be considered are:
- 6: (7, 6), (2, 6)
- 9: (9, 5), (0, 9)
- 10: (8, 10), (3, 10), (0, 10), (1, 10)
- 3: (2, 3), (10, 3), (12, 3)
- 7: (4, 7), (6, 7), (13, 7), (14, 7)
- 1: (4, 7), (12, 4), (11, 2), (10, 8), (1, 8)
- 0: (9, 5), (8, 0), (11, 4), (10, 8)
- 12: (4, 12), (3, 12), (11, 12), (13, 12)
- 8: (5, 8), (2, 8), (10, 8), (1, 8), (8, 0)
- 11: (4, 11), (2, 11), (0, 11), (12, 11)
- 14: (5, 14), (2, 14), (1, 14), (7, 14)
- 2: (5, 2), (8, 2), (6, 2), (3, 2), (14, 2), (11, 2)
- 4: (7, 4), (12, 4), (13, 4), (1, 4), (11, 4)
- 13: (5, 13), (4, 13), (7, 13), (12, 13)

Now, counting the triangles, each edge is considered only if the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- Triangles counted: [20]

Unique triangles found: 
<2, 4, 13>, <2, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 12>, <1, 7, 13>, <1, 7, 14>, <1, 8, 0>, <1, 8, 10>, <1, 8, 3>, <1, 8, 5>, <1, 10, 0>, <1, 10, 8>, <1, 12, 4>, <1, 14, 2>, <1, 14, 5>, <1, 14, 7>, <2, 11, 4>, <2, 11, 12>, <2, 14, 5>, <4, 13, 12>
