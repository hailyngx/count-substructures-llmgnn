Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 5) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 4) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 19) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 1) (5, 14) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 13) (13, 3) (13, 5) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 16) (19, 11) (19, 18) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 19) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 15) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by degree. The degrees of the nodes in the given graph are as follows:

Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 1
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 2
Node 14: degree 4
Node 15: degree 3
Node 16: degree 3
Node 17: degree 5
Node 18: degree 3
Node 19: degree 3

Relabeling the nodes based on their degrees (from least to most connections):

Node 9 (degree 1)
Node 13 (degree 2)
Node 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19 (degree 3)
Node 5, 14 (degree 4)
Node 3, 17 (degree 5)

Now, we only consider the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge: (6, 17) => Forms a triangle with shared connection 14.
2. Edge: (6, 10) => No triangle formed.
3. Edge: (6, 3) => Forms a triangle with shared connection 5.
4. Edge: (9, 12) => No triangle formed.
5. Edge: (14, 17) => Forms a triangle with shared connection 2.
6. Edge: (14, 0) => Forms a triangle with shared connection 7.
7. Edge: (14, 5) => Forms a triangle with shared connections 3 and 8.
8. Edge: (0, 2) => Forms a triangle with shared connection 17.
9. Edge: (0, 7) => Forms a triangle with shared connection 14.
10. Edge: (2, 8) => Forms a triangle with shared connections 0 and 5.
11. Edge: (3, 11) => Forms a triangle with shared connection 8.
12. Edge: (3, 16) => No triangle formed.
13. Edge: (3, 13) => Forms a triangle with shared connection 5.
14. Edge: (0, 7) => Forms a triangle with shared connection 14.
15. Edge: (0, 2) => Forms a triangle with shared connection 17.
16. Edge: (2, 8) => Forms a triangle with shared connections 0 and 5.
17. Edge: (8, 11) => Forms a triangle with shared connection 3.
18. Edge: (5, 13) => Forms a triangle with shared connection 3.
