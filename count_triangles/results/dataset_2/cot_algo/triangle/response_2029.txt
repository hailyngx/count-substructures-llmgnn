Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 
Vertex 7: Degree 3
Vertex 2: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 4
Vertex 9: Degree 4
Vertex 0: Degree 4
Vertex 6: Degree 4
Vertex 1: Degree 5
Vertex 5: Degree 5
Vertex 3: Degree 5
Vertex 4: Degree 5

Now, let's check for triangles:
For each edge, we only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found:
<2, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]
