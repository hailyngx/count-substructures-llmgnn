Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 27) (18, 24) (18, 7) (18, 21) (22, 0) (22, 17) (20, 1) (25, 17) (25, 26) (25, 29) (23, 7) (23, 3) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 29) (8, 0) (0, 22) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 19) (26, 25) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 12) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 12) (7, 18) (7, 23) (7, 0) (3, 23) (3, 21) (3, 16) (3, 2) (21, 18) (21, 3) (21, 29) (16, 28) (16, 3) (16, 24) (16, 13) (16, 2) (4, 27) (27, 18) (27, 4) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 19) (17, 22) (17, 25) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 5) (12, 26) (12, 28) (12, 19) (1, 20) (1, 28) (1, 14) (6, 24) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 6) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 5) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 2) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 15) (15, 9) (29, 25) (29, 11) (29, 26) (29, 21) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 12) 

Response:
Let's first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices by their degrees:
22: 2 connections
6: 1 connection
20: 1 connection
4: 1 connection
16: 5 connections
14: 3 connections
9: 3 connections
15: 1 connection
1: 3 connections
5: 3 connections
12: 3 connections
2: 4 connections
17: 5 connections
13: 4 connections
19: 4 connections
8: 2 connections
0: 5 connections
7: 4 connections
3: 5 connections
21: 3 connections
29: 4 connections
11: 4 connections
25: 4 connections
26: 5 connections
28: 4 connections
18: 4 connections
27: 2 connections
10: 4 connections
23: 2 connections

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
Total number of triangles: [32]
Unique triangles: <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 23>, <0, 7, 18>, <0, 8, 22>, <0, 8, 7>, <0, 8, 19>, <0, 19, 10>, <0, 19, 12>, <0, 19, 13>, <2, 3, 16>, <2, 3, 21>, <2, 3, 23>, <2, 5, 11>, <2, 5, 17>, <2, 5, 7>, <7, 18, 21>, <7, 18, 27>, <7, 23, 3>, <10, 11, 14>, <10, 11, 29>, <10, 19, 12>, <11, 14, 9>, <11, 17, 5>, <12, 19, 13>, <14, 1, 28>, <16, 2, 3>, <16, 2, 5>, <17, 13, 19>, <17, 5, 11>, <19, 12, 26>, <25, 26, 29>
