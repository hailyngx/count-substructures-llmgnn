Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 14) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 2) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Let's relabel the vertices accordingly and count the triangles in the graph.

After sorting the nodes by their degrees, we get the following list:
```
Node 0 -> Degree: 3
Node 14 -> Degree: 3
Node 4 -> Degree: 3
Node 13 -> Degree: 3
Node 7 -> Degree: 3
Node 8 -> Degree: 4
Node 3 -> Degree: 4
Node 5 -> Degree: 4
Node 6 -> Degree: 4
Node 9 -> Degree: 4
Node 1 -> Degree: 4
Node 2 -> Degree: 5
Node 10 -> Degree: 5
Node 11 -> Degree: 5
Node 12 -> Degree: 5
```

Now, let's proceed with counting the triangles. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

- Considering edge (0, 3) where Node 0 (degree 3) is lower labeled:
  - Shared connections with Node 0 and Node 3: {1}

- Considering edge (0, 5) where Node 0 (degree 3) is lower labeled:
  - Shared connections with Node 0 and Node 5: {10}

- Considering edge (0, 7) where Node 0 (degree 3) is lower labeled:
  - Shared connections with Node 0 and Node 7: {}

- Considering edge (0, 14) where Node 0 (degree 3) is lower labeled:
  - Shared connections with Node 0 and Node 14: {}

- Considering edge (4, 6) where Node 4 (degree 3) is lower labeled:
  - Shared connections with Node 4 and Node 6: {}

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].

The unique triangles found are: 
1. <0, 3, 1>
2. <0, 5, 10>
