Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 5) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 1) (6, 14) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 10) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 10) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 12) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) 

Response:
The given graph has the following edges:
(8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) 
(13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) 
(4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) 
(2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) 
(3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 5) 
(11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) 
(9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) 
(1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) 
(6, 1) (6, 14) 
(14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 7) 
(7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 10) 
(5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 10) 
(12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) 
(10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 12) 
(0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) 

After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling is as follows:
0 - degree 3
1 - degree 3
4 - degree 3
6 - degree 2
12 - degree 4
13 - degree 4
8 - degree 3
3 - degree 5
5 - degree 5
7 - degree 5
9 - degree 5
11 - degree 5
10 - degree 5
2 - degree 6
14 - degree 4

By iterating through the edges to count triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [].

The unique triangles found are:
