Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 12) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 5) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (10, 13) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 18) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 18) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 19) (12, 16) (2, 17) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (5, 16) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 1) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 2) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 14) 

Response:
The graph described above can be visualized with the following nodes and connections:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
- 0: {4, 8}
- 1: {2, 4, 5, 18}
- 2: {1, 7, 13, 17}
- 3: {5, 14, 15, 19}
- 4: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- 5: {1, 3, 15, 16}
- 6: {13, 17, 19}
- 7: {2, 13}
- 8: {0, 4, 9, 18}
- 9: {4, 8, 14}
- 10: {13}
- 11: {14, 17, 18}
- 12: {16}
- 13: {2, 6, 7, 10}
- 14: {3, 9, 11, 19}
- 15: {3, 5}
- 16: {5, 12}
- 17: {2, 6, 11}
- 18: {1, 8, 11}
- 19: {3, 6, 14}

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in this graph.

Sorting nodes by their degrees (number of connections):
Nodes in increasing order of degree: 10, 12, 0, 7, 16, 17, 19, 11, 18, 1, 8, 2, 6, 15, 9, 4, 5, 3, 14, 13

Based on this sorting, let's count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 62]
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 18>
<0, 8, 18>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 18>
<1, 4, 18>
<1, 5, 18>
<1, 8, 18>
<2, 13, 17>
<2, 13, 7>
<3, 5, 14>
<3, 5, 15>
<3, 5, 19>
<3, 14, 19>
<4, 8, 9>
<4, 8, 18>
<4, 9, 18>
<4, 14, 19>
<5, 15, 16>
