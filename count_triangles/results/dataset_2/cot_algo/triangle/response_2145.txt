Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are as follows:
1. 5 (degree 3)
2. 9 (degree 3)
3. 7 (degree 4)
4. 6 (degree 5)
5. 10 (degree 2)
6. 11 (degree 5)
7. 8 (degree 3)
8. 13 (degree 5)
9. 1 (degree 3)
10. 3 (degree 4)
11. 12 (degree 4)
12. 0 (degree 4)
13. 2 (degree 6)
14. 14 (degree 3)

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Check the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections to count triangles.
- Count the triangles formed by shared connections.

There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<5, 13, 1>
<5, 13, 9>
<5, 1, 6>
<5, 4, 7>
<4, 7, 3>
<7, 0, 1>
