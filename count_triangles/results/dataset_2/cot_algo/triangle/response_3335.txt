Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 5 connections.
Node 6 has 5 connections.
Node 5 has 6 connections.
Node 4 has 7 connections.
Node 2 has 7 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges based on the new vertex labels to count the number of triangles. 

After counting the triangles, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.
