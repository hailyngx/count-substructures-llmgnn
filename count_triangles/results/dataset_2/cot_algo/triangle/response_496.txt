Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 8) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 6) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 13) (6, 8) (6, 4) (11, 14) (11, 8) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 11) (8, 10) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 10) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 6) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on the number of connections they have. Here is the sorted list of nodes with their corresponding connections:

Node 1: (1, 3 connections)
Node 7: (7, 2 connections)
Node 11: (11, 2 connections)
Node 5: (5, 5 connections)
Node 9: (9, 3 connections)
Node 0: (0, 4 connections)
Node 3: (3, 4 connections)
Node 12: (12, 4 connections)
Node 14: (14, 6 connections)
Node 13: (13, 5 connections)
Node 6: (6, 4 connections)
Node 8: (8, 5 connections)
Node 2: (2, 3 connections)
Node 4: (4, 6 connections)
Node 10: (10, 4 connections)

Now, we will go through the edges listed earlier, and we will only consider the cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

The triangles found are:
<0, 3, 14>
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 4>
<4, 6, 14>
<8, 10, 14>
<8, 11, 14>

There are total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
