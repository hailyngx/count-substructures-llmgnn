Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Count the number of connections for each vertex:
   - Vertex 0: 3 connections
   - Vertex 1: 3 connections
   - Vertex 2: 4 connections
   - Vertex 3: 4 connections
   - Vertex 4: 4 connections
   - Vertex 5: 4 connections
   - Vertex 6: 2 connections
   - Vertex 7: 2 connections
   - Vertex 8: 3 connections
   - Vertex 9: 4 connections
   - Vertex 10: 1 connection
   - Vertex 11: 4 connections
   - Vertex 12: 2 connections
   - Vertex 13: 3 connections
   - Vertex 14: 3 connections
   - Vertex 15: 2 connections
   - Vertex 17: 3 connections
   - Vertex 18: 3 connections
   - Vertex 19: 3 connections
   - Vertex 20: 3 connections
   - Vertex 21: 3 connections
   - Vertex 22: 4 connections
   - Vertex 23: 4 connections
   - Vertex 24: 3 connections
   - Vertex 25: 3 connections
   - Vertex 26: 3 connections
   - Vertex 27: 3 connections

   - Vertex 29: 2 connections

2. Sort the vertices by the number of connections in ascending order and relabel them:
   - Vertex 10 (1 connection)
   - Vertex 12 (2 connections)
   - Vertex 7 (2 connections)
   - Vertex 6 (2 connections)
   - Vertex 15 (2 connections)
   - Vertex 29 (2 connections)
   - Vertex 13 (3 connections)
   - Vertex 14 (3 connections)
   - Vertex 8 (3 connections)
   - Vertex 17 (3 connections)
   - Vertex 18 (3 connections)
   - Vertex 19 (3 connections)
   - Vertex 20 (3 connections)
   - Vertex 21 (3 connections)
   - Vertex 24 (3 connections)
   - Vertex 25 (3 connections)
   - Vertex 26 (3 connections)
   - Vertex 27 (3 connections)
   - Vertex 0 (3 connections)
   - Vertex 4 (4 connections)
   - Vertex 5 (4 connections)
   - Vertex 2 (4 connections)
   - Vertex 3 (4 connections)
   - Vertex 11 (4 connections)
   - Vertex 1 (3 connections)
   - Vertex 22 (4 connections)
   - Vertex 23 (4 connections)
   - Vertex 28 (5 connections)
   - Vertex 9 (4 connections)
