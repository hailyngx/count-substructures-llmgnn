Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 2) (9, 14) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (12, 4) (12, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 2) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) 

Response:
The given graph with its nodes and edges is as follows:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
- Edges: (5, 8), (5, 11), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 10), (9, 2), (9, 14), (4, 5), (4, 12), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 11), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 8), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 13), (8, 14), (13, 8), (13, 1), (13, 0), (10, 5), (10, 11), (10, 3), (10, 1), (11, 5), (11, 4), (11, 10), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 13), (0, 12), (0, 1), (0, 2), (12, 4), (12, 0), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 13), (1, 10), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 10), (3, 14), (3, 2), (14, 9), (14, 8), (14, 3), (14, 2), (2, 9), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 14).

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted nodes are:
Nodes by degree: 9 (1 connection), 6 (1 connection), 12 (1 connection), 7 (2 connections), 13 (3 connections), 2 (4 connections), 11 (4 connections), 10 (4 connections), 12 (4 connections), 9 (4 connections), 6 (4 connections), 1 (5 connections), 0 (6 connections), 14 (6 connections), 3 (6 connections), 8 (7 connections), 5 (7 connections), 4 (8 connections).

Following the instructions, the triangles in the graph are:
Total number of triangles: [18]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 12, 4>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 10, 1>, <3, 10, 5>, <5, 10, 11>, <5, 10, 3>, <5, 10, 1>, <4, 11, 5>, <4, 11, 10>, <4, 11, 0>, <6, 1, 13>, <6, 1, 4>, <8, 5, 7>.
