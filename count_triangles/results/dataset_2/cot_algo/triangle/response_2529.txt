Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 10) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order. 

The sorted vertices are: 
Node 3: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 12: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 0: degree 5
Node 2: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 6: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 14: degree 5
Node 5: degree 7
Node 11: degree 4
Node 13: degree 6

Based on the sorted vertices, we will examine the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections and count the number of triangles. 

After analyzing the edges in the graph, the total number of triangles is [34]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 11>
<0, 1, 13>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 10>
<0, 3, 10>
<0, 11, 1>
<1, 7, 13>
<1, 7, 6>
<1, 11, 0>
<1, 11, 5>
<1, 13, 6>
<2, 6, 1>
