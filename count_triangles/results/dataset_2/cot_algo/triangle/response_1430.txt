Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 16) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 26) (13, 8) (13, 24) (22, 23) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 27) (22, 17) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 18) (23, 28) (7, 24) (21, 3) (21, 20) (21, 15) (18, 22) (18, 23) (15, 21) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 11) (20, 21) (20, 5) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 5) (26, 8) (26, 22) (9, 16) (9, 12) (11, 23) (11, 15) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 17) (25, 19) (25, 12) (25, 4) (27, 22) (27, 2) (27, 17) (28, 3) (28, 23) (28, 0) (28, 5) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 25) (19, 24) (19, 6) (29, 10) (2, 27) (2, 17) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 9) (24, 13) (24, 7) (24, 19) (10, 29) (10, 4) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 25) (17, 22) (17, 11) (17, 27) (17, 2) (4, 0) (4, 25) (4, 10) (4, 6) (5, 20) (5, 14) (5, 28) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the total number of triangles in the graph quickly.

By sorting the nodes based on their degree in increasing order, we can label the nodes accordingly:
Nodes with degree:
0: 4 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 3 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 1 connection
8: 3 connections
9: 3 connections
10: 2 connections
11: 4 connections
12: 3 connections
13: 2 connections
14: 2 connections
15: 4 connections
16: 3 connections
17: 4 connections
18: 3 connections
19: 4 connections
20: 2 connections
21: 3 connections
22: 5 connections
23: 4 connections
24: 4 connections
25: 3 connections
26: 3 connections
27: 3 connections
28: 4 connections
29: 1 connection

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and the given edges, we find the total number of triangles to be 25 according to the steps provided. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [25].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 25>
<0, 5, 28>
<0, 14, 5>
<0, 14, 4>
<1, 3, 16>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 8, 13>
<3, 8, 26>
<3, 21, 16>
<11, 17, 27>
<11, 17, 2>
<11, 19, 25>
<11, 19, 24>
<15, 19, 24>
<15, 19, 12>
<15, 21, 20>
<15, 21, 3>
<15, 21, 16>
<15, 21, 20>
<15, 21, 3>
<22, 23, 18>
<22, 23, 28>
<22, 27, 17>
