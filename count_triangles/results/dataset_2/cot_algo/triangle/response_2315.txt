By labeling the vertices based on their degree, we obtain the following list of edges to check for triangles:

Vertices:  
3 -> 1 connections  
10 -> 2 connections  
17 -> 2 connections  
26 -> 2 connections  
1 -> 3 connections  
13 -> 3 connections  
15 -> 3 connections  
18 -> 3 connections  
19 -> 3 connections  
24 -> 3 connections  
29 -> 3 connections  
2 -> 4 connections  
5 -> 4 connections  
7 -> 4 connections  
9 -> 4 connections  
12 -> 4 connections  
14 -> 4 connections  
27 -> 4 connections  
4 -> 5 connections  
6 -> 5 connections  
16 -> 5 connections  
21 -> 5 connections  
23 -> 5 connections  
0 -> 6 connections  
20 -> 6 connections  
8 -> 7 connections  
11 -> 7 connections  
22 -> 7 connections  
25 -> 7 connections  
28 -> 7 connections
