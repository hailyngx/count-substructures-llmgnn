Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes can be relabeled based on their degree in ascending order as follows:
Node 0: degree 6
Node 1: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 4: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 6: degree 6
Node 9: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges based on the relabeled nodes:
1. (0, 1) -> forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 6: <0, 1, 3>
2. (0, 8) -> forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 6: <0, 8, 3>
3. (1, 2) -> forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 9: <1, 2, 0>
4. (2, 9) -> forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 1: <2, 9, 0>
5. (3, 8) -> forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 6: <3, 8, 0>
6. (0, 5) -> forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 9: <0, 5, 6>
7. (0, 6) -> forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 9: <0, 6, 5>
8. (0, 3) -> forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 8: <0, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
