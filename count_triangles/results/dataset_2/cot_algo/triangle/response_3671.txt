Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 3) (18, 8) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 17) (1, 6) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 8) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 8) (16, 8) (16, 5) (0, 18) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 19) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 5) (14, 10) (15, 0) (15, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 14) (4, 15) (13, 9) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 14) (8, 18) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 16) (5, 3) (5, 16) (5, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles will be applied to the given graph.  
I will relabel the nodes based on the number of connections each node has.

Node degrees:
Node 0: 4
Node 1: 3
Node 2: 2
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 1
Node 5: 3
Node 6: 3
Node 7: 3
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 2
Node 10: 3
Node 11: 2
Node 12: 4
Node 13: 1
Node 14: 4
Node 15: 2
Node 16: 2
Node 17: 3
Node 18: 4
Node 19: 4

Edges to consider in the Degree-Based Ordering:
(2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 0) (18, 3) (18, 8) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 10) (12, 14) (1, 17) (1, 6) (3, 11) (6, 10) (0, 15) (14, 19) (15, 4) (9, 13) (19, 17) (19, 0) (8, 17) (5, 16) 

Triangles found:
<0, 3, 18>
<0, 14, 19>
<1, 6, 10>
<3, 14, 19>
<8, 17, 19>
<5, 14, 19>

Total number of triangles: [6]
