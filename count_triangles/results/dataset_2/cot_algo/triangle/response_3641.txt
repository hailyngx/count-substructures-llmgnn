Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 13) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 11) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 10) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 10) (5, 3) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows with the given graph:

Nodes sorted by their degree:
Node 5: degree 1
Node 4: degree 2
Node 1: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 13: degree 5
Node 0: degree 5
Node 14: degree 5
Node 9: degree 5
Node 3: degree 6
Node 10: degree 6
Node 7: degree 6
Node 11: degree 7

Edges in the order of vertices with the lower label having fewer connections:
(4, 13)
(1, 10)
(1, 8)
(13, 10)
(4, 10)
(4, 13)
(1, 8)
(9, 4)
(9, 14)
(9, 12)
(9, 3)
(0, 14)
(0, 3)
(0, 11)
(0, 1)
(14, 13)
...

After examining the edges with the lower labeled vertices having fewer connections, we find the following unique triangles:
<1, 4, 13>
<1, 4, 10>
<1, 10, 13>
<4, 9, 14>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 11>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 14>
<4, 9, 12>
...

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [19].
