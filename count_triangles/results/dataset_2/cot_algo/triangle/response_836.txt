Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: (6, 7, 8, 2, 3, 1)
- 1: (6, 4, 7, 2, 0)
- 2: (6, 1, 3, 0)
- 3: (5, 9, 7, 2, 0)
- 4: (7, 1)
- 5: (9, 3, 7)
- 6: (9, 1, 2, 0)
- 7: (5, 9, 4, 0, 3, 1)
- 8: (0)
- 9: (5, 6, 3, 7)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order and assign new labels:

New Labels:
0 (degree 6) 
1 (degree 5) 
4 (degree 1) 
8 (degree 1) 
7 (degree 6) 
2 (degree 3) 
5 (degree 3) 
9 (degree 4) 
6 (degree 4) 
3 (degree 5) 

Using the degree-based ordering, consider the edges in the following order:

Edges to Process:
- 8-0
- 4-1
- 7-4
- 7-1
- 2-3
- 2-1
- 2-0
- 5-3
- 5-9
- 5-7
- 6-0
- 6-1
- 6-2
- 6-9
- 9-5
- 9-6
- 3-5
- 3-9
- 3-7
- 3-2
- 3-0
- 0-6
- 0-7
- 0-2
- 0-3
