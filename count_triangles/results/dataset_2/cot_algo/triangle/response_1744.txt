Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph and count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The vertices of the graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
The edges of the graph are: 
(5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 7),
(9, 6), (9, 1), (9, 0),
(6, 3), (6, 0),
(1, 8), (1, 7),
(3, 2),
(4, 2),
(8, 2),
(0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 8)

Now, let's list the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
Vertices: 5, 7, 1, 4, 6, 3, 8, 0, 2, 9

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the edges, considering only pairs where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
Triangles: <0, 4, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 4>

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
