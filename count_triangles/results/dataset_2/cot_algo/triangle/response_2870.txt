Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles by examining edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles is [26].

The unique triangles found are:
```
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 14, 18>
<1, 14, 7>
<1, 14, 13>
<15, 20, 11>
<21, 3, 17>
<2, 21, 12>
