Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 14) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 12) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 14) (1, 6) (1, 8) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 13) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 1 has degree 2
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 13 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 12 has degree 4
Node 14 has degree 5
Node 4 has degree 5
Node 3 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 5
Node 10 has degree 5
Node 0 has degree 6
Node 6 has degree 6
Node 11 has degree 6

Enumerating the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. <0, 6, 10>
2. <0, 6, 11>
3. <0, 6, 12>
4. <0, 10, 11>
5. <0, 10, 12>
6. <0, 11, 12>
7. <0, 5, 10>
8. <0, 5, 12>
9. <0, 5, 14>
10. <1, 6, 8>
11. <4, 8, 9>
12. <4, 8, 13>
13. <4, 9, 13>
14. <4, 3, 11>
15. <4, 3, 12>
16. <4, 5, 13>
17. <3, 6, 11>
18. <3, 6, 12>
19. <3, 11, 14>
20. <6, 13, 4>
21. <7, 9, 11>
22. <7, 9, 12>
23. <7, 11, 14>
24. <12, 10, 0>
25. <12, 3, 11>
26. <9, 14, 11>
27. <10, 11, 3>
28. <10, 11, 14>

There are a total of [28] triangles in the given graph.
