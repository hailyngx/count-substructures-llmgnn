Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 1), (9, 7), (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 1), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 2), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 8), (3, 4), (3, 1), (3, 8), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 8), (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 2), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 0)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph. 

Vertices sorted by degree (connections):
0 (degree 3)
5 (degree 3)
3 (degree 3)
8 (degree 4)
6 (degree 4)
7 (degree 4)
2 (degree 4)
1 (degree 5)
9 (degree 5)
4 (degree 7)

Triangles found: 8 

[Total number of triangles: 8] 
Unique triangles: <1, 8, 3>, <1, 8, 6>, <1, 9, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 0, 7>, <2, 0, 5>, <4, 0, 3>
