Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 10) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 12) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 4) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 11) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 14) 

Response:
The nodes and edges can be represented as a graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 10), (0, 11), 
(1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 11), 
(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), 
(3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 9), (3, 12), 
(4, 10), (4, 11), (4, 14), 
(5, 10), 
(6, 7), 
(7, 8), (7, 9), 
(8, 12), 
(9, 13), 
(10, 12), (10, 13), 
(11, 13), 
(12, 11)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:
Degree 1: {5, 14}
Degree 2: {0, 1, 9}
Degree 3: {3, 12, 5}
Degree 4: {6, 8}
Degree 5: {4}
Degree 6: {10}
Degree 7: {2, 7}
Degree 8: {11}
Degree 9: {13}

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 10, 5>
<0, 11, 4>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 4>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 12, 11>
<6, 7, 1>
<10, 12, 11>

Total number of triangles: [10]
