Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph have the following degrees:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 6
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3

After reordering according to degrees:
- Node 4 (degree 3) becomes A
- Node 8 (degree 3) becomes B
- Node 9 (degree 3) becomes C
- Node 0 (degree 4) becomes D
- Node 1 (degree 4) becomes E
- Node 7 (degree 4) becomes F
- Node 2 (degree 5) becomes G
- Node 3 (degree 5) becomes H
- Node 5 (degree 5) becomes I
- Node 6 (degree 6) becomes J

Now, let's list the triangles based on the shared connections:
- A, B, C
- A, B, D
- A, C, G
- A, D, E
- A, E, F
- A, F, J
- B, D, F
- B, F, H
- C, G, H
- D, E, I
- D, I, J
- E, F, J

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11], and the unique triangles found are <A, B, C>, <A, B, D>, <A, C, G>, <A, D, E>, <A, E, F>, <A, F, J>, <B, D, F>, <B, F, H>, <C, G, H>, <D, E, I>, <E, F, J>.
