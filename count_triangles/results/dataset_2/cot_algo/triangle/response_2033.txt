Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the vertices based on their number of connections and relabeling them accordingly. Let's follow this method to count the triangles in the given graph:

The nodes with their corresponding connections:
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 1: 5 connections
- Node 2: 6 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 6 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 5 connections

Based on the above connections, the sorted nodes would be:
- Node 8 (2 connections)
- Node 5 (3 connections)
- Node 0 (4 connections)
- Node 3 (4 connections)
- Node 4 (4 connections)
- Node 6 (4 connections)
- Node 1 (5 connections)
- Node 9 (5 connections)
- Node 7 (6 connections)
- Node 2 (6 connections) 

Now, we will analyze the edges based on the relabeled nodes with lower labels having fewer connections:
- For the edge (0, 4): Nodes 0 and 4 share a connection with Node 7, forming a triangle <0, 4, 7>.
- For the edge (0, 7): Nodes 0 and 7 share a connection with Node 4, forming a triangle <0, 7, 4>.
- For the edge (0, 2): Nodes 0 and 2 do not share a common connection (Node 4), so no triangle is formed.
- For the rest of the edges, no triangles are formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7> and <0, 7, 4>.
