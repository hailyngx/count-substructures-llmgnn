Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges.

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: {(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 1), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 3), (6, 2), (8, 3), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 1), (2, 0), (0, 8), (0, 2), (1, 2)}

Now, let's sort the vertices by the number of connections from least to most:

Vertices by degree: 
1. (7): 2 connections
2. (1, 4, 6, 8): 3 connections each
3. (0, 3): 4 connections each
4. (2, 9): 5 connections each
5. (5): 6 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices according to their degrees from least to most connections:

Vertices after relabeling:
1. (7) -> (0)
2. (1, 4, 6, 8) -> (1, 2, 3, 4)
3. (0, 3) -> (5, 6)
4. (2, 9) -> (7, 8)
5. (5) -> (9)

Next, we will count the triangles based on these relabeled vertices using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

[Total number of triangles]: [10]
