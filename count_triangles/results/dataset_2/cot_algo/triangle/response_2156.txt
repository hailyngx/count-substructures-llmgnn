Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
The given edges can be represented as a graph with 10 nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. The connections are as follows:

- 0: {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- 1: {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- 2: {1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- 3: {0, 1, 2}
- 4: {0, 2, 8}
- 5: {0, 1, 2}
- 6: {1, 7}
- 7: {0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- 8: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- 9: {1, 2, 7}

Now, by sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, we get:

Vertices in ascending order of degree: [3, 5, 4, 6, 9, 0, 8, 2, 7, 1]

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles formed by the edges:
- Triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 5, 2>, <2, 4, 8>
- Total triangles: [5] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 5.
