Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices from least to most connected is as follows:
Nodes: 5, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 3, 1, 7, 0

Based on the edges provided, we can count the number of triangles and list them:
Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 7, 5>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 8>
