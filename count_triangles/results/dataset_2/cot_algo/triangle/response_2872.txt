Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 22) (4, 23) (4, 15) (7, 12) (7, 17) (0, 11) (0, 1) (27, 21) (27, 24) (27, 28) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 23) (25, 3) (25, 6) (25, 12) (12, 7) (12, 25) (12, 8) (12, 23) (2, 8) (2, 17) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 29) (8, 22) (14, 28) (14, 29) (11, 0) (28, 27) (28, 14) (28, 13) (28, 15) (13, 28) (13, 17) (26, 18) (26, 17) (18, 26) (18, 9) (18, 23) (18, 20) (1, 0) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 16) (15, 4) (15, 28) (15, 1) (15, 22) (17, 7) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 26) (17, 9) (6, 25) (6, 24) (24, 27) (24, 6) (24, 9) (24, 5) (22, 4) (22, 8) (22, 15) (22, 10) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 24) (9, 10) (29, 8) (29, 14) (29, 1) (16, 1) (16, 21) (21, 27) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 5) (5, 24) (5, 21) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 12) (23, 18) (23, 10) (20, 18) (20, 21) (10, 3) (10, 22) (10, 9) (10, 23) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to efficiently count the number of triangles in a graph by examining the vertices with the lowest degrees first.

After sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, we have the following relabeling:
Nodes (0, 11, 13, 16, 5, 6, 10, 14, 29, 21, 2, 26, 18, 7, 12, 1, 15, 4, 23, 8, 22, 27, 3, 25, 28, 17, 9, 24, 20)

Now, we will start counting the triangles based on the edges provided:
- Triangle <0, 1, 15>
- Triangle <0, 1, 29>
- Triangle <1, 15, 28>
- Triangle <1, 15, 4>
- Triangle <1, 15, 22>
- Triangle <1, 29, 8>
- Triangle <1, 29, 14>
- Triangle <15, 4, 22>
- Triangle <15, 28, 4>
- Triangle <15, 28, 14>
- Triangle <15, 22, 4>
- Triangle <4, 22, 8>
- Triangle <4, 22, 15>
- Triangle <8, 22, 15>
- Triangle <7, 12, 25>
- Triangle <7, 12, 23>
- Triangle <12, 25, 23>
- Triangle <3, 10, 25>
- Triangle <2, 8, 22>
- Triangle <26, 18, 20>
- Triangle <9, 17, 24>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [21].
