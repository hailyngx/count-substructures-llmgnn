Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 23) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 12) (28, 29) (28, 19) (28, 5) (29, 28) (29, 3) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 21) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 10) (19, 12) (26, 19) (26, 7) (2, 18) (2, 27) (2, 24) (2, 7) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 22) (6, 20) (3, 4) (3, 29) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 21) (24, 8) (24, 2) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 0) (15, 17) (15, 21) (20, 6) (20, 7) (20, 23) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 27) (16, 18) (16, 1) (16, 10) (17, 15) (17, 27) (17, 7) (25, 0) (14, 6) (7, 26) (7, 2) (7, 20) (7, 17) (7, 13) (5, 28) (5, 12) (5, 22) (5, 27) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 5) (23, 4) (23, 20) (23, 13) (0, 1) (0, 25) (0, 22) (22, 6) (22, 5) (22, 0) (27, 2) (27, 9) (27, 17) (27, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 23) (10, 19) (10, 9) (10, 16) (21, 18) (21, 11) (21, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph. 

By sorting vertices based on their degree: 
Nodes with 1 connection: {11, 25}
Nodes with 2 connections: {0, 14, 15, 17, 22}
Nodes with 3 connections: {13, 20}
Nodes with 4 connections: {1, 5, 6}
Nodes with 5 connections: {10, 16, 26}
Nodes with 6 connections: {2, 7}
Nodes with 7 connections: {12, 27}
Nodes with 8 connections: {3, 4, 9}
Nodes with 9 connections: {23, 24}
Nodes with 10 connections: {8, 19, 29}
Nodes with 11 connections: {18}
Nodes with 13 connections: {28}

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles:

- For edge (4, 8): No triangle formed
- For edge (4, 23): No triangle formed
- For edge (4, 3): No triangle formed
- For edge (8, 9): Triangle <4, 8, 9>
- For edge (8, 24): No triangle formed
- For edge (8, 12): No triangle formed
- For edge (28, 29): No triangle formed
- For edge (28, 19): No triangle formed
- For edge (28, 5): No triangle formed
- For edge (18, 2): No triangle formed
- For edge (18, 16): No triangle formed
- For edge (18, 21): No triangle formed
- For edge (19, 26): Triangle <19, 28, 26>
- For edge (19, 10): No triangle formed
- For edge (26, 7): No triangle formed
- For edge (2, 27): No triangle formed
- For edge (6, 1): No triangle formed
- For edge (6, 14): No triangle formed
- For edge (6, 22): No triangle formed
- For edge (3, 13): No triangle formed
- For edge (3, 9): No triangle formed
- For edge (24, 2): No triangle formed
- For edge (1, 0): No triangle formed
- For edge (15, 17): No triangle formed
- For edge (20, 7): Triangle <7, 20, 22>
- For edge (9, 27): No triangle formed
- For edge (16, 10): Triangle <10, 16, 19>
- For edge (17, 7): Triangle <7, 17, 27>
- For edge (14, 6): No triangle formed
- For edge (5, 12): Triangle <5, 12, 19>
- For edge (23, 13): No triangle formed
- For edge (0, 25): No triangle formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [5]
The unique triangles are: <4, 8, 9>, <19, 28, 26>, <7, 20, 22>, <10, 16, 19>, <7, 17, 27>.
