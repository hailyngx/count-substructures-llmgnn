Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 12) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 4) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 4) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 0) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 4) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 12) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections each vertex has, and then relabeling them accordingly.

The sorted vertices with their respective connections are:
(9: 3 connections), (4: 4 connections), (3: 4 connections), (0: 5 connections), (14: 5 connections), (1: 5 connections), (2: 5 connections), (7: 5 connections), (13: 5 connections), (8: 5 connections), (5: 5 connections), (12: 5 connections), (11: 5 connections), (6: 6 connections), (10: 6 connections).

After relabeling, the graph with new vertex labels becomes:
(0 - 0), (1 - 1), (2 - 2), (3 - 3), (4 - 4), (5 - 5), (6 - 6), (7 - 7), (8 - 8), (9 - 9), (10 - 10), (11 - 11), (12 - 12), (13 - 13), (14 - 14).

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- We consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
- We then check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to count triangles.
