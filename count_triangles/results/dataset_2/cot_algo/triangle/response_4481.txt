Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering helps to count triangles efficiently. 
Below is the sorted list of vertices with their degrees in parentheses:

Vertex 5 (2), 6 (2), 5 (2), 6 (2), 9 (5), 1 (5), 7 (5), 0 (4), 3 (5), 4 (6), 8 (7)

Based on the degree-based ordering, we can start counting triangles using the provided edges. Counting triangles in this way yields a total of [13] triangles. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 8, 6>
<7, 8, 9>
