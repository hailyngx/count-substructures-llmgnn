Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:  

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}  
Edges: (4, 7), (4, 2), (4, 9), (4, 0), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 9), (7, 5), (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 0), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 1), (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8), (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 8), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 5), (8, 6), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 0), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 8)

Next, we will sort the nodes by their degrees to apply the Degree-Based Ordering method:  

Nodes sorted by degrees:  
{7, 1, 2, 9, 0, 6, 3, 5, 8, 4}

Now, we will count the number of triangles by examining the edges in order, considering only cases where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:  

- (4, 7): No triangles
- (4, 2): No triangles
- (4, 9): Triangle formed: <4, 9, 6>
- (4, 0): No triangles
- (7, 4): No triangles
- (7, 3): No triangles
- (7, 9): Triangle formed: <7, 9, 6>
- (7, 5): No triangles
- (6, 9): No triangles
- (6, 5): No triangles
- (6, 8): No triangles
- (6, 0): No triangles
- (9, 4): No triangles
- (9, 7): No triangles
- (9, 6): No triangles
- (9, 1): No triangles
- (1, 9): No triangles
- (1, 3): No triangles
- (1, 5): Triangle formed: <1, 5, 2>
- (1, 8): No triangles
- (3, 7): No triangles
- (3, 1): No triangles
- (3, 2): No triangles
- (3, 8): No triangles
- (5, 7): No triangles
- (5, 6): No triangles
- (5, 1): No triangles
- (5, 2): No triangles
- (5, 8): No triangles
- (2, 4): No triangles
- (2, 3): No triangles
- (2, 5): No triangles
- (8, 6): No triangles
- (8, 1): No triangles
- (8, 3): No triangles
- (8, 5): No triangles
- (8, 0): No triangles
- (0, 4): No triangles
- (0, 6): No triangles
- (0, 8): No triangles

Total number of triangles: [3]  
Unique triangles: <4, 9, 6>, <7, 9, 6>, <1, 5, 2>
