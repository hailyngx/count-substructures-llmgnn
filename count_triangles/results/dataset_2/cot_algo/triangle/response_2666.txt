Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges:
- 0: (5, 8), (6, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0)
- 1: (5, 1), (9, 1), (4, 1), (6, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1)
- 2: (1, 2), (8, 2), (0, 2)
- 3: (7, 3), (6, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (8, 3)
- 4: (9, 4), (4, 8), (4, 1), (4, 6)
- 5: (8, 5), (1, 5), (0, 5)
- 6: (9, 6), (4, 6), (6, 0), (6, 3)
- 7: (8, 7), (7, 3)
- 8: (5, 8), (4, 8), (7, 8), (8, 3), (8, 2), (0, 8)
- 9: (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 1)

Degree-based ordering of nodes:
Node 2: degree 3
Node 7: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 1: degree 6
Node 6: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 8: degree 6
Node 0: degree 4

Using the degree-based ordering method to count triangles, we find:
[Total Number of Triangles: 5]
<0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 6, 9>
