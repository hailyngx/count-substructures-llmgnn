Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 6) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (8, 9) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (6, 12) (6, 13) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 0) (0, 11) (0, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently in this graph. 

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:  
Node 5: degree 4  
Node 9: degree 4  
Node 7: degree 3  
Node 12: degree 5  
Node 13: degree 4  
Node 3: degree 5  
Node 11: degree 6  
Node 8: degree 1  
Node 14: degree 4  
Node 2: degree 6  
Node 1: degree 4  
Node 10: degree 4  
Node 6: degree 3  
Node 4: degree 5  
Node 0: degree 2  

Now, let's count the triangles:  
<2, 5, 9>  
<2, 5, 13>  
<2, 5, 4>  
<2, 7, 14>  
<2, 7, 11>  
<4, 0, 11>  
<4, 0, 1>  
<4, 1, 10>  
<4, 1, 3>  
<4, 1, 11>  
<4, 6, 12>  
<4, 10, 12>  
<4, 10, 3>  
<4, 3, 12>  
<4, 3, 11>  
<6, 2, 12>  
<6, 2, 13>  
<6, 7, 14>  
<6, 13, 5>  

Total number of triangles: [18]
