Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 19) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 11) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 17) (6, 18) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 17) (7, 2) (7, 16) (7, 17) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 19) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 15) (4, 9) (4, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 15) (15, 14) (15, 0) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 14) (10, 9) (10, 1) (19, 3) (19, 16) (17, 18) (17, 11) (17, 7) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed and the vertices have been relabeled based on the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The graph with the relabeled vertices is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 1), (0, 15), (0, 5), (0, 8), 
(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 10), (1, 12), (1, 16), 
(2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 18), 
(3, 11), (3, 13),
(4, 9),
(5, 2),
(6, 18),
(7, 16),
(8, 0), (8, 14),
(9, 10), (9, 12),
(11, 13), (11, 17),
(12, 13), (12, 14),
(13, 11),
(14, 15),
(16, 7), (16, 19),
(17, 7), (17, 11), (17, 18),
(18, 2), (18, 6), (18, 17),
(19, 3), (19, 16)
  
Now, let's count the number of triangles:

Triangles: [93]

Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 10>, <0, 1, 12>, <0, 1, 15>, <0, 8, 14>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 10, 9>, <1, 12, 14>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 11>, <2, 3, 13>, <2, 3, 19>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 11, 13>, <7, 16, 19>, <7, 17, 11>, <7, 17, 18>, <9, 10, 12>, <11, 13, 17>, <11, 17, 18>, <13, 12, 14>, <16, 7, 17>
