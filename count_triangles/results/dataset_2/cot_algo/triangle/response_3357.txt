Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 17) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 18) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 13) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 19) (14, 16) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 19) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 7) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 12) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 7) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 18) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 11) (18, 16) (3, 9) (11, 9) (11, 18) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 2) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 0) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 18) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 17), (9, 4), (9, 11), (9, 3), (10, 13), (17, 5), (17, 18), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 13), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 15), (8, 12), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 13), (0, 13), (0, 2), (14, 19), (14, 16), (1, 6), (1, 15), (1, 19), (15, 8), (15, 1), (15, 7), (19, 14), (19, 1), (19, 7), (19, 12), (2, 0), (2, 12), (2, 16), (2, 7), (12, 8), (12, 19), (12, 2), (12, 18), (18, 17), (18, 12), (18, 11), (18, 16), (3, 9), (11, 9), (11, 18), (7, 6), (7, 15), (7, 19), (7, 2), (13, 10), (13, 4), (13, 6), (13, 0), (16, 14), (16, 2), (16, 18)

Next, let's sort the nodes by their degree in non-descending order:

Nodes by degree: 0(2), 3(2), 10(2), 17(2), 18(4), 19(4), 2(4), 7(4), 11(3), 14(2), 16(3), 1(3), 9(3), 13(4), 5(4), 6(4), 8(5), 12(4), 15(3), 4(4)

Now, we will list the triangles found using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [<0, 2, 13>, <2, 12, 7>, <2, 16, 18>, <7, 12, 19>]

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
