Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 5 has degree 2
Node 9 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 0 has degree 6
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 3 has degree 6
Node 2 has degree 5
Node 4 has degree 6

Sorting the nodes by their degrees in ascending order:

Nodes: 5, 9, 6, 1, 7, 8, 2, 3, 0, 4

Now, let's count the triangles formed by the edges:

1. (5, 6) shares no connections, so no triangle.
2. (5, 3) shares node 5, but nodes 3 and 5 have no shared connections.
3. (9, 4) shares node 9, but nodes 4 and 9 have no shared connections.
4. (9, 3) shares node 9, but nodes 3 and 9 have no shared connections.
5. (4, 9) forms a triangle <4, 9, 3>.
6. (4, 7) shares no connections, so no triangle.
7. (4, 8) forms a triangle <4, 8, 3>.
8. (4, 2) shares node 4, but nodes 2 and 4 have no shared connections.
9. (4, 3) shares node 4, but nodes 3 and 4 have no shared connections.
10. (7, 4) shares no connections, so no triangle.
11. (7, 0) forms a triangle <7, 0, 1>.
12. (7, 3) shares nodes 3 and 7, forming a triangle <7, 3, 8>.
13. (7, 2) shares no connections, so no triangle.
14. (6, 5) shares no connections, so no triangle.
15. (6, 1) forms a triangle <6, 1, 0>.
16. (6, 0) shares node 6, but nodes 0 and 6 have no shared connections.
17. (8, 4) shares node 4, but nodes 8 and 4 have no shared connections.
18. (8, 0) forms a triangle <8, 0, 1>.
19. (0, 7) shares no connections, so no triangle.
20. (0, 6) shares node 0, but nodes 6 and 0 have no shared connections.
21. (0, 8) forms a triangle <0, 8, 1>.
22. (0, 1) shares no connections, so no triangle.
23. (3, 5) shares no connections, so no triangle.
24. (3, 9) shares node 9, but nodes 3 and 9 have no shared connections.
25. (3, 4) shares node 4, but nodes 3 and 4 have no shared connections.
26. (3, 7) shares nodes 3 and 7, forming a triangle <3, 7, 8>.
27. (3, 8) shares no connections, so no triangle.
28. (2, 4) shares no connections, so no triangle.
29. (2, 7) shares no connections, so no triangle.
30. (2, 0) shares no connections, so no triangle.
31. (2, 1) shares no connections, so no triangle.
32. (2, 3) shares node 3, but nodes 2 and 3 have no shared connections.
