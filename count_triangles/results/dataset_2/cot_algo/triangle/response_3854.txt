Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7)
(9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0)
(6, 8) (6, 0)
(1, 10) (1, 7)
(3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4)
(10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 8)
(11, 12)
(4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3)
(7, 1)
(8, 2)
(2, 13)
(12, 11)
(13, 2)
(0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 8)
(14, 3) (14, 7)

Next, we will sort the vertices based on their degree from least to most connected:

Nodes sorted by degree:
1, 2, 5, 14
10
6, 4, 12
13
7, 11
0, 3, 8, 9

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

Triangles:
<5, 9, 6>
<5, 6, 4>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 13, 2>
<9, 6, 8>
<9, 6, 0>
<9, 6, 4>
<9, 10, 1>
<6, 8, 4>
<6, 0, 7>
<6, 0, 10>
<6, 8, 2>
<6, 4, 3>
<1, 10, 0>
<3, 11, 12>
<3, 11, 14>
<3, 11, 2>
<3, 14, 7>
<3, 8, 2>
<3, 4, 7>
<10, 0, 7>
<10, 8, 4>
<11, 12, 2>
<4, 7, 1>
<8, 2, 13>
<8, 10, 0>
<8, 4, 7>
<2, 13, 5>
<12, 11, 2>
<13, 2, 5>
<0, 7, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [30].
