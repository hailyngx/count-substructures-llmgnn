Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 11), (5, 0), (5, 7), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 11), (9, 10), (4, 1), (7, 6), (7, 10), (1, 3), (1, 13), (1, 12), (1, 8), (3, 6), (3, 12), (3, 8), (10, 13), (10, 14), (11, 9), (0, 14), (0, 12), (14, 12), (2, 13), (8, 3)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes sorted by degree: 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, 10, 3, 11, 6, 0, 2, 12, 13, 14, 8

Now, identify the triangles formed:
Triangles: 
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 12>
<0, 5, 14>
<0, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 12>
<1, 3, 13>
<2, 7, 13>
<4, 1, 3>
<4, 1, 12>
<4, 9, 11>
<4, 9, 2>
<5, 7, 6>
<5, 7, 10>
<9, 10, 13>

There are a total of 15 triangles in the given graph.  
Therefore, the answer is: [15]
