Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 7) (1, 19) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 8) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (17, 18) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 5) (16, 6) (16, 0) (18, 17) (18, 14) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 11) (4, 9) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 15) (15, 6) (15, 0) (15, 7) (15, 11) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 14) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 13) (10, 9) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 15) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: (2, 5, 15, 16)
- 1: (7, 19)
- 2: (0, 5, 8)
- 3: (8, 13, 19)
- 4: (9)
- 5: (0, 2, 11)
- 6: (9, 11, 15, 16, 19)
- 7: (1, 9, 15)
- 8: (2, 3, 11, 12)
- 9: (4, 6, 7, 10)
- 10: (9, 12)
- 11: (5, 6, 8, 15)
- 12: (8, 10, 13, 14)
- 13: (3, 12, 14)
- 14: (12, 13, 18)
- 15: (0, 6, 7, 11)
- 16: (0, 6)
- 17: (18)
- 18: (14, 17)
- 19: (1, 3, 6)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [42]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 15>
<0, 2, 16>
<0, 5, 15>
<0, 5, 16>
<0, 8, 15>
<0, 8, 16>
<0, 15, 16>
<1, 7, 19>
<3, 8, 13>
<5, 11, 15>
<6, 9, 11>
<6, 9, 15>
<6, 9, 16>
<6, 11, 15>
<6, 15, 19>
<8, 11, 15>
<8, 12, 13>
<12, 13, 14>
<14, 17, 18>
