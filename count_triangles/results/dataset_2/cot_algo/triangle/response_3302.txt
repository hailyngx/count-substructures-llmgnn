Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 0) (4, 5) (7, 16) (7, 1) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 14) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 14) (18, 15) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 12) (17, 5) (17, 15) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 6) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 19) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 9) (3, 19) (3, 6) (3, 9) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 6) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves the following steps:

1. Sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most.
2. Relabeling the vertices accordingly.
3. For each edge, proceeding only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
4. Checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to find triangles.

After analyzing the provided graph and following the steps above, the total number of triangles found is [63]. 

Here are some unique triangles found:

<0, 6, 16>
<5, 10, 19>
<1, 7, 11>
