Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in efficiently counting the number of triangles in a graph. Let's follow the steps as described above.

Sorting the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 1: degree 5
Node 8: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 0: degree 7
Node 3: degree 5

Relabeling the vertices:
Node 1 -> Node A
Node 8 -> Node B
Node 6 -> Node C
Node 5 -> Node D
Node 2 -> Node E
Node 7 -> Node F
Node 4 -> Node G
Node 9 -> Node H
Node 0 -> Node I
Node 3 -> Node J

Now, following the given edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
< A, B, I >
< A, C, I >
< A, E, I >
< A, F, I >
< A, G, I >
< A, J, I >
< B, F, I >
< C, E, I >
< C, F, I >
< D, G, I >
< D, J, I >
< E, G, I >
< E, J, I >
< F, G, I >
< F, J, I >
< G, J, I >

The total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
Some of the unique triangles are:
< A, B, I >
< D, G, I >
< B, F, I >
