Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 18) (3, 5) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 19) (8, 11) (8, 4) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 14) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 16) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 7) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 16) (12, 6) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 6) (9, 0) (9, 14) (18, 1) (18, 11) (2, 4) (2, 6) (7, 10) (7, 19) (7, 15) (7, 17) (13, 11) (13, 16) (17, 19) (17, 7) (6, 12) (6, 16) (6, 2) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 15)
(1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 15) (1, 18)
(2, 4) (2, 6)
(3, 5) (3, 12)
(4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 19)
(5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 14)
(6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 16)
(7, 10) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 19)
(8, 4) (8, 11)
(9, 0) (9, 14)
(10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 14)
(11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 18)
(12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 16)
(13, 11) (13, 16)
(14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 10)
(15, 0) (15, 1) (15, 7)
(16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 19)
(17, 7) (17, 19)
(18, 1) (18, 11)
(19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 16) (19, 17)

Now, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices by degree: [(2, 2), (16, 3), (9, 3), (13, 3), (17, 3), (18, 3), (0, 4), (3, 4), (6, 4), (8, 4), (12, 4), (5, 5), (14, 5), (1, 6), (10, 6), (15, 6), (7, 7), (11, 7), (4, 8), (19, 8)]

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [21]

Unique triangles found: <2, 4, 6>, <3, 5, 11>, <3, 12, 16>, <4, 8, 11>, <7, 15, 17>, <9, 14, 10>, <11, 13, 16>, <14, 5, 10>, <15, 1, 0>, <16, 12, 6>, <17, 7, 19>
