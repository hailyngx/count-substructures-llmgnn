Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 12) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 2) (13, 5) (13, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 10), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 11), (1, 13), (1, 14), (2, 0), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 14), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 8), (3, 11), (3, 12), (4, 8), (4, 12), (4, 14), (5, 0), (5, 6), (5, 9), (5, 13), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 11), (7, 2), (7, 7), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 12), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 12), (8, 14), (9, 5), (9, 7), (9, 11), (10, 0), (10, 7), (10, 14), (11, 1), (11, 3), (11, 6), (11, 9), (12, 3), (12, 4), (12, 7), (12, 8), (13, 1), (13, 5), (14, 1), (14, 2), (14, 4), (14, 8), (14, 10)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles. 

Vertices sorted by degree: 
Node 10: degree 2
Node 0: degree 4
Node 13: degree 2
Node 9: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 11: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 1: degree 5
Node 6: degree 4
Node 14: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 3
Node 2: degree 5
Node 5: degree 4

Now, we find the triangles based on the sorted order of vertices. 

[Total number of triangles: 12]
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 10>, <0, 3, 12>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 10, 7>, <1, 3, 11>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 6, 11>, <2, 6, 14>, <8, 12, 14>
