Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 16) (9, 13) (26, 9) (26, 23) (26, 11) (26, 4) (1, 21) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 27) (21, 22) (14, 0) (14, 16) (17, 0) (13, 9) (13, 22) (22, 21) (22, 13) (22, 11) (22, 20) (23, 26) (23, 29) (23, 28) (23, 27) (10, 3) (10, 27) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 24) (18, 12) (7, 29) (7, 28) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 24) (29, 23) (29, 7) (29, 27) (29, 11) (0, 14) (0, 17) (3, 21) (3, 10) (3, 16) (19, 11) (11, 26) (11, 22) (11, 29) (11, 19) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 3) (16, 24) (24, 18) (24, 12) (24, 16) (24, 28) (5, 8) (5, 25) (5, 15) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 20) (8, 15) (27, 21) (27, 23) (27, 10) (27, 29) (20, 22) (20, 8) (4, 26) (4, 6) (25, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 15) (28, 23) (28, 7) (28, 24) (28, 15) (15, 2) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 28) 

Response:
Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(9, 26), (9, 16), (9, 13), (26, 23), (26, 11), (26, 4), (1, 21), (1, 8), (21, 3), (21, 27), (21, 22), (14, 0), (14, 16), (17, 0), (13, 22), (23, 29), (23, 28), (10, 3), (10, 27), (2, 18), (2, 12), (2, 6), (2, 15), (18, 24), (7, 29), (12, 24), (29, 7), (0, 17), (3, 16), (19, 11), (16, 24), (5, 8), (5, 25)

1. Vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices with 0 connection: 5, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, 25
Vertices with 1 connection: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 15, 18, 24, 28
Vertices with 2 connections: 3, 5, 15, 21, 22, 27
Vertices with 3 connections: 23, 26, 29
Vertices with 4 connections: 2, 8, 16

2. Sort the vertices and relabel them:
New labels (from least to most connected): 
5, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, 25, 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 15, 18, 24, 28, 3, 21, 22, 27, 23, 26, 29, 2, 8, 16

3. Counting triangles by examining edges:
- Looking at each edge and its vertices, we see that only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections should be considered.

Triangles found: 
<1, 24, 28>, <2, 12, 24>, <4, 6, 15>, <11, 19, 29>, <0, 14, 16>, <3, 10, 27>, <21, 22, 13>, <8, 20, 22>, <4, 6, 2>, <7, 29, 27>, <16, 9, 26>, <12, 24, 16>, <26, 9, 13>, <8, 20, 21>, <5, 8, 15>, <26, 4, 6>, <5, 8, 1>, <15, 2, 6>, <23, 26, 29>, <15,... 

Total number of triangles: [83]
