Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 10) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 11) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 12) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 12) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed and sorted based on the degree of each node:

Nodes sorted by degree (from least to most):
Node 1: 1 edge
Node 0: 3 edges
Node 5: 3 edges
Node 13: 3 edges
Node 10: 4 edges
Node 12: 5 edges
Node 8: 5 edges
Node 9: 5 edges
Node 7: 5 edges
Node 3: 6 edges
Node 14: 6 edges
Node 2: 6 edges
Node 4: 6 edges
Node 11: 6 edges
Node 6: 6 edges

Based on the sorted nodes, we will count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [23]
