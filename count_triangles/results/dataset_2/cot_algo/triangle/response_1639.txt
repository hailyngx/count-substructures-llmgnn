Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 20) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 6) (0, 15) (0, 22) (0, 23) (27, 10) (7, 15) (7, 21) (7, 26) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 5) (21, 29) (22, 0) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 24) (22, 17) (23, 0) (23, 22) (8, 5) (8, 20) (8, 18) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 25) (29, 21) (29, 26) (6, 15) (6, 28) (6, 11) (5, 21) (5, 8) (5, 19) (13, 12) (13, 19) (26, 7) (26, 29) (17, 22) (17, 12) (17, 2) (20, 3) (20, 8) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 25) (19, 24) (19, 16) (10, 27) (10, 21) (10, 9) (10, 25) (16, 19) (2, 3) (2, 22) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 4) (9, 28) (9, 10) (9, 18) (18, 8) (18, 9) (24, 22) (24, 19) (24, 14) (1, 25) (1, 14) (1, 4) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 12) (25, 28) (25, 19) (25, 10) (25, 1) (25, 4) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 11) (14, 24) (14, 1) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 25) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently. 

After sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order, the nodes are relabeled as follows:
Nodes and their degrees:
(1, 3) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 3) (8, 3) (9, 3) (10, 4) (11, 4) (12, 4) (13, 4) (14, 3) (15, 4) (16, 2) (17, 4) (18, 3) (19, 5) (20, 3) (21, 4) (22, 4) (23, 3) (24, 3) (25, 5) (26, 3) (27, 1) (28, 3) (29, 3) (2, 5)

Now, we will go through the edges in the order given, and only consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections than the other node to avoid duplicate counting.

Counting the triangles formed by the edges, we find that there are:
Total number of triangles: [24]
