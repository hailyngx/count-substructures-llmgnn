Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 1) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 8) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 2) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 14) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 9) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 1) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 12) 

Response:
The nodes and their connections based on the given edges are as follows:

0: 12, 13
1: 4, 6, 12, 13, 14, 10
2: 5, 7, 8, 13
3: 10, 11, 14
4: 1, 5, 7, 9, 11
5: 2, 4, 7, 13
6: 1, 8, 10
7: 2, 4, 5
8: 2, 6
9: 4, 11, 12, 13, 14
10: 1, 3, 6, 11
11: 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 14
12: 0, 1, 9
13: 0, 1, 2, 5, 9
14: 1, 3, 9, 11

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
0: 2
2: 3
8: 2
3: 3
6: 3
5: 4
7: 4
12: 4
13: 5
10: 4
1: 6
4: 5
9: 5
11: 6
14: 4

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [15]

Unique triangles:
<1, 9, 13>
<1, 9, 4>
<1, 9, 11>
<1, 9, 14>
<1, 11, 3>
<1, 11, 4>
<1, 11, 14>
<1, 11, 9>
<1, 2, 13>
<1, 7, 5>
<9, 11, 4>
<9, 11, 14>
<9, 11, 13>
<9, 4, 11>
<9, 4, 13>
