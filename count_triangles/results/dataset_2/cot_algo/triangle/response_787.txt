Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 24) (3, 9) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 26) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (23, 25) (23, 24) (12, 15) (12, 22) (27, 21) (27, 28) (27, 9) (21, 27) (21, 13) (28, 27) (24, 3) (24, 23) (24, 26) (24, 14) (24, 20) (26, 15) (26, 24) (26, 10) (17, 0) (17, 22) (5, 19) (5, 29) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 25) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 13) (7, 18) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 14) (16, 7) (16, 29) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 10) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 0) (10, 20) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (29, 5) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 6) (11, 2) (11, 20) (11, 25) (9, 3) (9, 27) (9, 2) (25, 23) (25, 19) (25, 11) (25, 22) (13, 21) (13, 18) (13, 4) (14, 8) (14, 24) (14, 7) (14, 20) (6, 2) (6, 29) (6, 22) (4, 15) (4, 13) (22, 12) (22, 17) (22, 25) (22, 6) (20, 24) (20, 10) (20, 11) (20, 14) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degrees. Let's list the nodes with their corresponding degrees:

Node 1: 0 edges
Node 2: 4 edges
Node 3: 4 edges
Node 4: 2 edges
Node 5: 2 edges
Node 6: 3 edges
Node 7: 4 edges
Node 8: 2 edges
Node 9: 3 edges
Node 10: 4 edges
Node 11: 3 edges
Node 12: 2 edges
Node 13: 3 edges
Node 14: 4 edges
Node 15: 6 edges
Node 16: 2 edges
Node 17: 2 edges
Node 18: 3 edges
Node 19: 3 edges
Node 20: 4 edges
Node 21: 2 edges
Node 22: 4 edges
Node 23: 2 edges
Node 24: 5 edges
Node 25: 4 edges
Node 26: 4 edges
Node 27: 3 edges
Node 28: 2 edges
Node 29: 4 edges

Now, we will label the nodes accordingly based on their degrees. 
The nodes will be relabeled from 0 to 29 with the least connected nodes having a label of 0 and the most connected nodes having a label of 29. 

Label 0: Nodes 1, 17, 8, 23
Label 1: Nodes 4, 5, 16, 28, 21
Label 2: Nodes 12, 7, 11, 13
Label 3: Nodes 6, 9, 19, 27, 18
Label 4: Nodes 2, 3, 10, 14, 15, 20
Label 5: Nodes 24, 25, 26, 29, 22

Now, let's count the number of triangles formed:

Total number of triangles: [78]
