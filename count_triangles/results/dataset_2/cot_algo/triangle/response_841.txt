Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be illustrated as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 4), (6, 0), (0, 6), (0, 9), (0, 7), (0, 8)
- 1: (6, 1), (9, 1), (4, 1), (7, 1), (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 5), (1, 2), (1, 5)
- 2: (9, 2), (1, 2), (3, 2), (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 5)
- 3: (9, 3), (4, 3), (7, 3), (1, 3), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 5)
- 4: (6, 4), (9, 4), (4, 6), (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 3)
- 5: (1, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 2)
- 6: (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 4), (6, 0), (6, 4), (7, 6), (7, 4), (0, 6)
- 7: (6, 7), (4, 7), (7, 6), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 3), (0, 7)
- 8: (6, 8), (8, 6), (8, 0)
- 9: (6, 9), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0), (4, 9), (9, 0), (0, 9)

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Node 5 - Degree: 3
Node 8 - Degree: 3
Node 2 - Degree: 4
Node 3 - Degree: 4
Node 7 - Degree: 4
Node 5 - Degree: 4
Node 4 - Degree: 5
Node 1 - Degree: 6
Node 0 - Degree: 6
Node 9 - Degree: 8

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

Triangles: [15]

Unique Triangles:
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 9, 6>
<0, 9, 4>
<0, 9, 1>
<0, 7, 6>
<0, 8, 6>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 4>
<1, 9, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<6, 9, 4>
