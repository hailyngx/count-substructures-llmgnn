Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 0), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 8), (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 8), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 2), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 6), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 2), (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 6), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 7), (2, 8), (0, 9), (0, 4)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):
0 (2 connections),
2 (3 connections),
4 (3 connections),
6 (3 connections),
5 (4 connections),
1 (4 connections),
3 (4 connections),
7 (6 connections),
8 (6 connections),
9 (8 connections)

Let's relabel the nodes based on their degree:
0 -> 0 (2 connections),
2 -> 1 (3 connections),
4 -> 2 (3 connections),
6 -> 3 (3 connections),
5 -> 4 (4 connections),
1 -> 5 (4 connections),
3 -> 6 (4 connections),
7 -> 7 (6 connections),
8 -> 8 (6 connections),
9 -> 9 (8 connections)

Now, we will check each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections to count the triangles.

Triangles found: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [5]
