Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 14) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 2) (9, 2) (9, 14) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are as follows: 
Vertex 4 has degree 2.
Vertex 1 has degree 2.
Vertex 9 has degree 2.
Vertex 8 has degree 3.
Vertex 6 has degree 3.
Vertex 14 has degree 4.
Vertex 5 has degree 4.
Vertex 13 has degree 4.
Vertex 7 has degree 5.
Vertex 12 has degree 5.
Vertex 3 has degree 5.
Vertex 11 has degree 5.
Vertex 0 has degree 6.
Vertex 2 has degree 6.
Vertex 10 has degree 6.

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles: 

We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- (4, 2) forms triangles with 0 and 10.
- (4, 10) forms triangles with 2 and 11.
- (7, 12) forms triangles with 14 and 3.
- (7, 3) forms triangles with 12 and 5.
- (7, 14) forms triangles with 12 and 5.
- (7, 5) forms triangles with 3 and 10.
- (10, 11) forms triangles with 4 and 8.
- (11, 0) forms triangles with 13 and 6.
- (13, 5) forms triangles with 3 and 6.
- (8, 14) forms a triangle with 5.
- (13, 12) forms a triangle with 6.
- (5, 13) forms a triangle with 6.

Count of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles found:
