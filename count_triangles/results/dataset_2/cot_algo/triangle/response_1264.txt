Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 6) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 18) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 15) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 19) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 19) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 17) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 19) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 7) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 3) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 19) (7, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles efficiently.

First, let's list the sorted vertices with their degrees:
Vertices: 
0(3), 1(2), 2(2), 3(5), 4(3), 5(4), 6(4), 7(2), 8(2), 9(2), 10(2), 11(2), 12(4), 13(7), 14(3), 15(4), 16(3), 17(2), 18(3), 19(4)

Next, we'll examine each edge based on the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections:
(8, 13): 8 connects with 2 vertices(16 and 13), 13 connects with 7 vertices(8, 5, 12, 1, 6, 15, 16). Shared connections: 16. Triangle formed <8, 13, 16>.
(8, 16): No triangle formed.
(13, 5): No triangle formed.
(13, 12): No triangle formed.
(13, 1): No triangle formed.
(13, 6): 13 connects with 7 vertices(8, 5, 12, 1, 6, 15, 16), 6 connects with 4 vertices(13, 10, 15, 19). Shared connections: 13, 15. Triangle formed <6, 13, 15>.
(10, 6): No triangle formed.
(10, 14): No triangle formed.
(11, 14): No triangle formed.
(11, 18): No triangle formed.
(5, 12): No triangle formed.
(5, 15): No triangle formed.
(6, 15): 6 connects with 4 vertices(13, 10, 15, 19), 15 connects with 4 vertices(5, 6, 18, 4). Shared connections: 6. Triangle formed <6, 15, 5>.
(6, 19): No triangle formed.
(15, 18): No triangle formed.
(9, 14): No triangle formed.
(9, 12): No triangle formed.
(0, 16): No triangle formed.
(0, 3): No triangle formed.
(0, 19): No triangle formed.
(16, 17): No triangle formed.
(15, 4): No triangle formed.
(12, 9): No triangle formed.
(12, 3): No triangle formed.
(3, 17): No triangle formed.
(3, 4): No triangle formed.
(3, 2): No triangle formed.
(1, 7): No triangle formed.
(2, 4): No triangle formed.
(7, 19): No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <8, 13, 16>, <6, 13, 15>, <6, 15, 5>
