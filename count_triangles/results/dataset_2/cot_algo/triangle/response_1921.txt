Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 15) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 18) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 8) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 13) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 16) (15, 6) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 6) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 3) (14, 10) (14, 8) (9, 12) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 0) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 18) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 13) (6, 15) (6, 16) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 14) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 9) (0, 4) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 0) (13, 19) (13, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
0: 4, 9, 18, 5
1: 10, 11, 14, 17
2: 5, 9, 13, 16
3: 7, 12, 18
4: 0, 5, 19
5: 0, 2, 4
6: 15, 16
7: 3, 8, 15
8: 7, 12, 14, 17
9: 0, 2, 18, 12
10: 1, 11, 14, 17
11: 1, 10, 15
12: 3, 8, 9
13: 2, 19
14: 1, 8, 10
15: 6, 7, 11, 16
16: 2, 6, 15
17: 1, 8, 10
18: 0, 3, 9, 17, 19
19: 4, 13, 18

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [<0, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 9>]

Total number of triangles: [2]
