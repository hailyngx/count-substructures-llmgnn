Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 2) (16, 9) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 11) (17, 14) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 15) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 13) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 10) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 15) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 13) (15, 12) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 8) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 2) (2, 16) (2, 12) (3, 16) (3, 5) (1, 5) (1, 13) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 1) 

Response:
Let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
Nodes: 0, 1, 17, 2, 7, 11, 4, 8, 3, 18, 19, 12, 16, 6, 14, 5, 13, 9, 15, 10

Next, let's relabel the vertices accordingly:
Node 0 -> Vertex 0
Node 1 -> Vertex 1
Node 17 -> Vertex 2
Node 2 -> Vertex 3
Node 7 -> Vertex 4
Node 11 -> Vertex 5
Node 4 -> Vertex 6
Node 8 -> Vertex 7
Node 3 -> Vertex 8
Node 18 -> Vertex 9
Node 19 -> Vertex 10
Node 12 -> Vertex 11
Node 16 -> Vertex 12
Node 6 -> Vertex 13
Node 14 -> Vertex 14
Node 5 -> Vertex 15
Node 13 -> Vertex 16
Node 9 -> Vertex 17
Node 15 -> Vertex 18
Node 10 -> Vertex 19

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 28]
<0, 13, 14>
<0, 13, 2>
<0, 13, 16>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 12>
<1, 5, 14>
<1, 5, 16>
<4, 8, 6>
<4, 8, 9>
<4, 8, 10>
<4, 15, 12>
<7, 13, 1>
<7, 13, 15>

<13, 15, 4>
<13, 15, 7>
<13, 15, 10>
<13, 14, 17>
<9, 16, 2>
<9, 16, 3>
