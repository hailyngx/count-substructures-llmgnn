Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, we construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 8), (9, 8), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 2), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 1), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 2), (1, 8), (3, 0), (3, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 8), (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 2), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 3)

Next, we sort the vertices by their degree from least to most:

Vertices in order: 3, 5, 7, 8, 0, 2, 6, 1, 9, 4

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles []: 7
Unique triangles <>: <0, 1, 4>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <7, 8, 9>
