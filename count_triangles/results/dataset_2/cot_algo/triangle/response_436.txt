Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0--1, 0--2, 0--3, 0--7, 0--8
- 1--2, 1--4, 1--6, 1--7, 1--8, 1--9
- 2--5, 2--7, 2--9
- 3--5, 3--6, 3--0
- 4--1, 4--8, 4--9
- 5--2, 5--3, 5--9
- 6--1, 6--3, 6--8, 6--9
- 7--0, 7--1, 7--2
- 8--0, 8--1, 8--4, 8--6
- 9--1, 9--2, 9--4, 9--5, 9--6

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes sorted by degree: 0, 4, 7, 5, 3, 6, 8, 1, 2, 9

Now, we will calculate the triangles by considering the edges in the order specified in the degree-based ordering method:

Triangles: [<1, 2, 4>]

Therefore, there is a total of [1] triangle in the given graph.
