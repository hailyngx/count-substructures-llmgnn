Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 0)
(9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 7)
(6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 3)
(1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7)
(3, 6), (3, 4)
(4, 0)
(8, 5), (8, 2), (8, 7)
(2, 8)
(0, 5)
(7, 9)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:
Node 0 (Degree 2)
Node 4 (Degree 2)
Node 8 (Degree 3)
Node 6 (Degree 3)
Node 7 (Degree 3)
Node 3 (Degree 4)
Node 2 (Degree 5)
Node 1 (Degree 6)
Node 9 (Degree 6)
Node 5 (Degree 7)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
<1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 8>
<2, 5, 9>, <2, 8, 5>, <2, 9, 7>, <2, 9, 8>
<3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 1>, <3, 6, 1>
<5, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [12]
