Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 27) (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 10) (17, 20) (17, 12) (17, 5) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 28) (10, 14) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 24) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 12) (7, 18) (7, 26) (21, 24) (28, 29) (28, 3) (28, 13) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 25) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 23) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 26) (8, 22) (22, 6) (22, 8) (22, 5) (13, 28) (13, 26) (13, 15) (26, 7) (26, 18) (26, 8) (26, 13) (26, 1) (20, 14) (20, 17) (20, 12) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 1) (3, 28) (19, 2) (19, 11) (23, 14) (23, 18) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 20) (0, 6) (0, 11) (1, 10) (1, 26) (1, 16) (1, 27) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 22) (5, 25) (25, 2) (25, 4) (25, 5) (15, 13) (15, 24) (27, 9) (27, 1) (24, 10) (24, 21) (24, 15) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29
Edges: (6, 22), (6, 12), (6, 0), (9, 8), (9, 27), (14, 23), (14, 20), (14, 10), (17, 20), (17, 12), (17, 5), (2, 29), (2, 8), (2, 19), (2, 25), (10, 14), (10, 11), (10, 1), (10, 24), (10, 16), (11, 19), (11, 0), (11, 12), (7, 18), (7, 26), (21, 24), (28, 3), (28, 13), (4, 18), (4, 25), (18, 7), (18, 4), (18, 26), (8, 9), (8, 16), (8, 22), (22, 5), (13, 15), (26, 1), (20, 17), (16, 1), (19, 11), (23, 18), (0, 11), (5, 4), (25, 5), (27, 1), (24, 15)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, relabeling the nodes based on their number of connections in ascending order:
Nodes sorted by degree: (3, 21, 24, 15, 9, 7, 13, 27, 19, 4, 16, 23, 29, 1, 10, 28, 20, 17, 0, 22, 12, 14, 11, 25, 6, 8, 18, 26, 5)
Edges to consider in this order: (8, 22), (8, 16), (22, 5), (13, 28), (13, 26), (26, 1), (14, 20), (10, 11), (10, 1), (10, 24), (10, 16), (20, 17), (23, 18), (0, 11), (9, 8), (7, 18), (27, 1), (4, 25)

Using the method described earlier, I found the following triangles:
Total number of triangles: [14]
Unique triangles: <0, 6, 11>, <1, 16, 10>, <1, 16, 26>, <1, 27, 9>, <4, 5, 25>, <4, 5, 22>, <4, 5, 17>, <7, 18, 26>, <8, 22, 5>, <8, 22, 6>, <13, 28, 26>, <14, 20, 17>, <20, 14, 17>, <23, 18, 27>
