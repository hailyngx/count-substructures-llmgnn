Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:
Vertex 5: Degree 3
Vertex 7: Degree 3
Vertex 1: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 4
Vertex 2: Degree 4
Vertex 4: Degree 4
Vertex 0: Degree 4
Vertex 6: Degree 5
Vertex 9: Degree 6
Vertex 3: Degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

After examining the edges, we find that the triangles in the given graph are:
