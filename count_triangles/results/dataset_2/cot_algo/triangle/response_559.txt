Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 4) (8, 16) (8, 9) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 3) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 1) (14, 15) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 13) (17, 1) (17, 18) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 12) (2, 16) (2, 7) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 3) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 3) (5, 0) (5, 4) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 19) (15, 18) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 5) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their connections from least to most. Below is the list of vertices based on their degree:

Vertices: 16, 1, 5, 12, 14, 7, 11, 17, 19, 2, 8, 18, 6, 3, 19, 0, 13, 9, 15, 4

Calculating the total number of triangles and listing the unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles: <0, 3, 12>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 15>, <0, 5, 15>, <3, 7, 12>, <4, 5, 15>, <4, 9, 10>, <4, 9, 15>, <6, 4, 9>, <9, 13, 17>, <9, 15, 18>, <12, 3, 7>
