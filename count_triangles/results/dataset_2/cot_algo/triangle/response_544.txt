Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we will first create a graph with the nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 4), (9, 2), (9, 1), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 5), (4, 1), (7, 4), (7, 2), (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 5), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 0), (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 5), (2, 0), (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 2), (5, 4), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 8), (5, 2)

Now, we will sort the nodes by their number of connections from least to most and relabel them accordingly:

Degree-Based Ordering:
Node 9 (Degree 2)
Node 7 (Degree 2)
Node 0 (Degree 3)
Node 8 (Degree 3)
Node 5 (Degree 5)
Node 3 (Degree 5)
Node 2 (Degree 6)
Node 6 (Degree 8)
Node 1 (Degree 8)
Node 4 (Degree 8)

Next, we will count the triangles by looking for shared connections between the nodes of each edge:

Triangles:
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <2, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
