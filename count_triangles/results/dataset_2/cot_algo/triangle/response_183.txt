Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph by listing the nodes and their connections:

Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 8, 2  
Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 8     
Node 2: 9, 4, 0      
Node 3: 5, 9, 8, 4      
Node 4: 3, 6, 2, 0      
Node 5: 9, 8, 3      
Node 6: 9, 1, 7, 4, 0    
Node 7: 6, 1    
Node 8: 5, 9, 1, 3, 0    
Node 9: 5, 8, 6, 2, 3    

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

Node 7: Degree 2  
Node 2: Degree 3  
Node 1: Degree 4  
Node 5: Degree 4  
Node 4: Degree 4  
Node 3: Degree 4  
Node 0: Degree 5  
Node 8: Degree 5  
Node 9: Degree 5  
Node 6: Degree 5  

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering:

1. Edge (5, 9): Check shared connections: 8        
2. Edge (5, 8): Check shared connections: 3, 9      
3. Edge (5, 3): Check shared connections:      
4. Edge (9, 6): Check shared connections: 1       
5. Edge (6, 1): Check shared connections:      
6. Edge (6, 7): Check shared connections:      
7. Edge (6, 4): Check shared connections:      
8. Edge (6, 0): Check shared connections: 1      
9. Edge (1, 0): Check shared connections:      
10. Edge (1, 8): Check shared connections: 3      
11. Edge (3, 4): Check shared connections: 0       
12. Edge (4, 6): Check shared connections: 0         
13. Edge (4, 2): Check shared connections:      
14. Edge (4, 0): Check shared connections:      
15. Edge (8, 1): Check shared connections:      
16. Edge (8, 3): Check shared connections: 5      
17. Edge (8, 0): Check shared connections: 1, 3, 5      
18. Edge (0, 6): Check shared connections: 1    
19. Edge (0, 4): Check shared connections: 1, 3    
20. Edge (0, 2): Check shared connections: 4, 8  

Count of triangles = 2  
Triangles: <0, 4, 6>, <0, 8, 3>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
