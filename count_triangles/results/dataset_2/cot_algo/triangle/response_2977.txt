Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 13) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 13) (5, 7) (5, 10) (1, 11) (1, 4) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. Then, for each edge, we proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This helps ensure that each triangle is counted only once.

Here is the list of vertices sorted by their degree (number of connections):
Vertices: 
6 [5 connections]
9 [5 connections]
14 [5 connections]
3 [5 connections]
7 [5 connections]
2 [4 connections]
13 [4 connections]
4 [4 connections]
10 [4 connections]
0 [3 connections]
8 [3 connections]
12 [3 connections]
11 [3 connections]
5 [2 connections]
1 [2 connections]

Now, let's count the triangles:
Triangles: [<3, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <4, 14, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 13>, <10, 13, 14>]

Total number of triangles: [7]
