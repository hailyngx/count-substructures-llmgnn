Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 14) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 9) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (9, 11) (9, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. Let's first construct the graph with the given edges.

The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) 
(7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) 
(10, 0) (10, 8) 
(11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 2) 
(8, 6)
(12, 5) (12, 3) 
(5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 3) 
(6, 14) 
(0, 14) 
(13, 1) (13, 9)

Next, let's sort the vertices by their degrees (number of connections):

Vertices in increasing order of degrees: 
{1, 2, 9, 13, 11, 5, 10, 6, 12, 0, 4, 7, 3, 8, 14}

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Number of triangles: [42] 

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 3, 14>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 10>
<0, 6, 14>
