Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 16) (9, 6) (2, 0) (2, 11) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 13) (7, 16) (7, 8) (12, 5) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 11) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 17) (8, 7) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 5) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 13) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 10) (15, 19) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 15) (16, 6) (16, 7) (16, 4) (14, 8) (14, 5) (1, 8) (1, 13) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (17, 0) (17, 4) (13, 18) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Vertices by their number of connections:
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 12: 1 connection
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 14: 2 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 16: 3 connections
Node 17: 2 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 19: 4 connections

Now, we will check each edge to count the triangles:
1. (6, 9) - No triangles formed
2. (6, 10) - Triangle: <6, 10, 15>
3. (6, 19) - Triangle: <6, 19, 15>

7. (2, 11) - No triangles formed
8. (18, 5) - No triangles formed
9. (18, 15) - Triangle: <18, 15, 19>
10. (18, 13) - Triangle: <18, 13, 4>
11. (7, 16) - Triangle: <7, 16, 6>
12. (7, 8) - No triangles formed
13. (12, 5) - No triangles formed
14. (0, 2) - No triangles formed
15. (0, 15) - Triangle: <0, 15, 19>
16. (0, 17) - No triangles formed

22. (8, 7) - No triangles formed
23. (8, 4) - Triangle: <8, 4, 13>
24. (8, 19) - Triangle: <8, 19, 15>
25. (8, 14) - No triangles formed
26. (8, 1) - No triangles formed
27. (3, 11) - Triangle: <3, 11, 0>
28. (3, 13) - Triangle: <3, 13, 4>
29. (11, 2) - No triangles formed
30. (11, 0) - Triangle: <11, 0, 2>
31. (11, 3) - Triangle: <11, 3, 13>
32. (11, 5) - Triangle: <11, 5, 18>
33. (10, 6) - Triangle: <10, 6, 19>
34. (10, 15) - Triangle: <10, 15, 19>
35. (10, 13) - Triangle: <10, 13, 4>
36. (15, 18) - Triangle: <15, 18, 13>
37. (15, 0) - Triangle: <15, 0, 11>

39. (19, 6) - Triangle: <19, 6, 16>
40. (19, 8) - Triangle: <19, 8, 4>
41. (19, 15) - Triangle: <19, 15, 18>
42. (16, 6) - Triangle: <16, 6, 19>
43. (16, 7) - Triangle: <16, 7, 8>
44. (16, 4) - Triangle: <16, 4, 13>
45. (14, 8) - No triangles formed

59. (13, 1) - No triangles formed


After examining all edges, we found a total of 20 triangles.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [20].
