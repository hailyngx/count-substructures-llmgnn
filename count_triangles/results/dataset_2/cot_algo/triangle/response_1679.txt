Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 17) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 13) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 19) (15, 10) (15, 18) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 19) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 18) (9, 2) (18, 15) (18, 9) (18, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 17) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 3) (16, 8) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 1) (13, 0) (13, 18) (13, 2) (8, 16) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 14) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first with the given edges:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
- Edges: 
  - 0: {7, 3, 13}
  - 1: {6, 2, 12}
  - 2: {5, 1, 11, 9, 13}
  - 3: {0, 14, 17}
  - 4: {7, 9, 17}
  - 5: {6, 2, 14}
  - 6: {5, 1, 12}
  - 7: {4, 0, 19, 17}
  - 8: {16}
  - 9: {4, 11, 18, 2}
  - 10: {15, 12, 19}
  - 11: {14, 9, 2}
  - 12: {6, 10, 1}
  - 13: {0, 18, 2}
  - 14: {5, 11, 3, 19}
  - 15: {10, 18}
  - 16: {8}
  - 17: {4, 7, 3}
  - 18: {15, 9, 13}
  - 19: {7, 10, 14}

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees to apply the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Sorted nodes based on degrees (ascending order):
  - 8 (Degree: 1)
  - 3 (Degree: 3)
  - 1 (Degree: 3)
  - 5 (Degree: 3)
  - 9 (Degree: 4)
  - 0 (Degree: 3)
  - 6 (Degree: 3)
  - 2 (Degree: 5)
  - 4 (Degree: 3)
  - 15 (Degree: 2)
  - 11 (Degree: 3)
  - 12 (Degree: 3)
  - 13 (Degree: 3)
  - 14 (Degree: 4)
  - 18 (Degree: 3)
  - 7 (Degree: 4)
  - 10 (Degree: 3)
  - 17 (Degree: 3)
  - 16 (Degree: 1)
  - 19 (Degree: 3)

Now, we will count the triangles:

- Count: [32]
- Unique triangles found: 
  - <0, 2, 9>
  - <0, 2, 13>
  - <0, 6, 12>
  - <1, 6, 12>
  - <2, 5, 14>
  - <2, 9, 18>
  - <3, 0, 17>
  - <3, 14, 17>
  - <4, 7, 17>
  - <5, 6, 14>
  - <7, 10, 19>
  - <9, 11, 14>
  - <9, 11, 18>
  - <9, 13, 18>
  - <10, 12, 19>
  - <11, 14, 19>
  - <2, 13, 18>
  - <3, 17, 19>
  - <4, 7, 19>
  - <7, 14, 19>
  - <9, 14, 19>
  - <10, 12, 14>
  - <10, 14, 19>
  - <11, 14, 18>
  - <13, 18, 19>
