Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 16) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 0) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 7) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 15) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (15, 10) (15, 18) (19, 8) (19, 13) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 4) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 11) (6, 3) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be used to count the triangles in the given graph. 

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
(1) 19, 2 connections: 3, 6
(2) 17, 3 connections: 1, 15, 16
(3) 16, 3 connections: 17, 18, 4
(4) 15, 3 connections: 0, 10, 11
(5) 14, 4 connections: 7, 12, 17, 0
(6) 13, 4 connections: 1, 8, 19, 0
(7) 12, 4 connections: 6, 9, 14, 0
(8) 11, 4 connections: 10, 7, 16, 8
(9) 11, 4 connections: 5, 12, 7, 0
(10) 11, 4 connections: 10, 8, 0, 15
(11) 10, 4 connections: 11, 8, 16, 15
(12) 9, 4 connections: 5, 12, 14, 6
(13) 8, 5 connections: 11, 16, 19, 2, 13
(14) 8, 5 connections: 12, 17, 0, 14, 7
(15) 7, 5 connections: 11, 16, 18, 15, 10
(16) 6, 5 connections: 12, 18, 3, 17, 4
(17) 4, 5 connections: 16, 3, 14, 12, 1
(18) 4, 5 connections: 15, 6, 2, 18, 5
(19) 2, 5 connections: 16, 8, 13, 2, 18
(20) 2, 6 connections: 19, 8, 13, 2, 18, 16

Now, we will count the triangles using the given edges:

[The total number of triangles is: 34]
