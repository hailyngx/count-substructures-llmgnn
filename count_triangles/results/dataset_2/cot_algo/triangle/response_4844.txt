Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 22) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 8) (16, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 23) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 19) (7, 17) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 17) (20, 0) (20, 1) (20, 8) (15, 26) (15, 5) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 13) (28, 0) (28, 29) (28, 23) (29, 28) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 3) (6, 14) (6, 21) (6, 12) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 22) (22, 11) (22, 9) (21, 6) (21, 26) (27, 29) (27, 25) (27, 2) (18, 14) (18, 26) (18, 13) (26, 15) (26, 21) (26, 18) (25, 27) (25, 2) (2, 27) (2, 25) (1, 20) (24, 16) (24, 7) (24, 8) (24, 17) (5, 15) (5, 8) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 20) (8, 24) (8, 5) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 29) (19, 23) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 18) (23, 4) (23, 28) (23, 19) (23, 3) (17, 7) (17, 0) (17, 24) (12, 6) (12, 3) (3, 29) (3, 23) (3, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections). 

The sorted list of nodes from least to most connections is as follows:
Nodes: 5, 1, 2, 25, 27, 15, 18, 5, 1, 2, 25, 27, 15, 18, 12, 0, 4, 6, 21, 26, 3, 29, 13, 14, 20, 16, 22, 9, 24, 7, 17, 8, 11, 19, 23, 28

Now, we will go through each edge and check for triangles formed between the lower labeled node and its connected nodes.

After going through all the edges, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 14>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 14, 28>
<4, 13, 14>
<4, 7, 24>
<4, 9, 16>
<6, 14, 18>
<9, 4, 16>
<11, 16, 22>
