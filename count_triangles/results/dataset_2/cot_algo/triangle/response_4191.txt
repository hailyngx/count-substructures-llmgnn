Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 11) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 4) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 5) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 4) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 10) 

Response:
The vertices with their respective degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 3: 5 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 5 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 5 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 9: 5 connections
- Node 10: 4 connections
- Node 11: 3 connections
- Node 12: 2 connections
- Node 13: 3 connections
- Node 14: 4 connections

We will start by relabeling the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:
- Node 12 and Node 13 are tied with the lowest degree, so let's label them 0 and 1 (arbitrarily chosen).
- Node 0 and Node 1 are tied with the next lowest degree, so let's label them 2 and 3.
- Node 11 has the next lowest degree, so we label it 4.
- Node 4 and Node 6 are tied with the next degree, so let's label them 5 and 6.
- Node 8 and Node 10 are tied with the next degree, so we label them 7 and 8.
- Node 2 and Node 14 are tied with the next degree, so we label them 9 and 10.
- Node 5, Node 7, and Node 9 are tied with the highest degree, so we label them 11, 12, and 13 (arbitrarily chosen).

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The total number of triangles is: [7]

The unique triangles found are: 
- <0, 8, 13>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <1, 8, 10>
- <2, 5, 9>
- <2, 7, 10>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <5, 7, 9>
