Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 3), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 7), (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 3), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 1), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 3), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 0), (2, 9), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 6), (2, 1), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 2), (1, 0), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 0), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 1), (0, 3)

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices with their degrees:
0 -> 4, 1 -> 4, 6 -> 3, 8 -> 3, 3 -> 4, 5 -> 3, 7 -> 5, 9 -> 4, 2 -> 5, 4 -> 8

Now, we will count the number of triangles:

Triangles: [12]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 2>
<6, 7, 2>
<8, 4, 3>
<3, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 7>
