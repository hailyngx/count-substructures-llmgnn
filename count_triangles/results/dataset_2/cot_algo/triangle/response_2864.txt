Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 13) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 13) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 13) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 7) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by the number of connections each node has. 

Node degrees:
0: 2
1: 4
2: 3
3: 4
4: 1
5: 5
6: 4
7: 4
8: 6
9: 4
10: 4
11: 4
12: 4
13: 4
14: 3

Based on the degrees, the ordered list of nodes is as follows:
4, 0, 2, 14, 9, 12, 13, 10, 11, 3, 1, 7, 6, 5, 8

Now, we will count the triangles based on the given edges:

- For edge (4, 8), node 4 has 1 connection, and node 8 has 6 connections, so continue.
- For edge (8, 4), we skip this since node 4 has fewer connections.
- For edge (8, 9), we have a triangle <8, 4, 9>.
- For edge (8, 5), we have a triangle <8, 4, 5>.
- For edge (8, 6), we have a triangle <8, 4, 6>.
- For edge (8, 1), we have two triangles <8, 4, 1> and <8, 5, 1>.
- For the remaining edges, no more triangles are formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <8, 4, 9>, <8, 4, 5>, <8, 4, 6>, and <8, 5, 1>.
