Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 4) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 9) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 9) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 11) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 4) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 14) (13, 11) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 9) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, let's construct the Degree-Based Ordering as follows:

Nodes sorted by the number of connections:
(3) - 2 connections
(9) - 6 connections
(13) - 1 connection
(0) - 3 connections
(2) - 3 connections
(6) - 3 connections
(7) - 4 connections
(8) - 4 connections
(12) - 4 connections
(5) - 5 connections
(11) - 6 connections
(14) - 4 connections
(1) - 6 connections
(4) - 6 connections
(10) - 4 connections

Now, we will check the edges with the vertex having the lower label:

Triangles found: 
<0, 1, 4>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 10>
<1, 11, 13>
<2, 8, 14>
<4, 9, 12>
<5, 8, 12>
<5, 8, 14>
<5, 10, 10>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 12, 9>
<7, 9, 12>
<8, 10, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
