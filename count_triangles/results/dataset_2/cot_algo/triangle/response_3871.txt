Now, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

After sorting the vertices by their degrees, we have the following labels:
0 (degree 2)
6 (degree 2)
9 (degree 2)
13 (degree 2)
1 (degree 2)
5 (degree 3)
10 (degree 3)
16 (degree 4)
19 (degree 3)
4 (degree 4)
7 (degree 4)
14 (degree 2)
17 (degree 4)
2 (degree 5)
8 (degree 2)
11 (degree 2)
15 (degree 4)
18 (degree 5)
3 (degree 5)
12 (degree 5)

Now, let's count the triangles and output the result.
