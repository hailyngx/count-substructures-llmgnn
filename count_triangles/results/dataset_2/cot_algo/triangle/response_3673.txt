Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 18) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 19) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 18) (8, 2) (8, 7) (13, 11) (13, 4) (10, 7) (17, 12) (17, 15) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 16) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 12) (4, 13) (4, 18) (0, 9) (0, 6) (14, 9) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 1) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 17) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 18) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
(0, 9), (0, 6), 
(1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 19), 
(2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 18), 
(3, 16), (3, 5), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 18), 
(4, 13), (4, 18), 
(5, 19), (5, 12), (5, 3), (5, 7), 
(6, 11), (6, 3), (6, 0), 
(7, 5), (7, 8), (7, 10), (7, 2), 
(8, 2), (8, 7), 
(9, 15), (9, 14), (9, 0), 
(10, 7), 
(11, 16), (11, 19), (11, 13), (11, 6), 
(12, 5), (12, 17), (12, 18), 
(13, 11), (13, 4), 
(14, 9), 
(15, 16), (15, 9), (15, 17), 
(16, 11), (16, 15), (16, 3), (16, 18), 
(17, 12), (17, 15), 
(18, 16), (18, 3), (18, 2), (18, 4), (18, 12), 
(19, 11), (19, 5), (19, 1)

After sorting the nodes based on their degrees from least to most, the new labels are:
Nodes: 10, 14, 0, 6, 5, 7, 9, 1, 2, 4, 3, 19, 8, 18, 12, 17, 15, 16, 11, 13

Triangles:
[ <0, 6, 11>, <3, 6, 11>, <7, 8, 12>, <5, 7, 12>, <5, 12, 18>, <0, 6, 9>, <9, 14, 15>, <1, 3, 19>, <2, 7, 18>, <15, 16, 17> ]

Total number of triangles: [10]
