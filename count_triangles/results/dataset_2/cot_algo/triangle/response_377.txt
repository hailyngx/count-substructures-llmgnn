Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 19) (6, 4) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 19) (11, 9) (11, 12) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 18) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 4) (7, 5) (7, 10) (16, 17) (16, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 17) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 13) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 19) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 3) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 19) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 15) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 15) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 8) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 12) (0, 8)    
(1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 18)    
(2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 17)    
(3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 19)    
(4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 19)    
(5, 9) (5, 7)    
(6, 4)    
(7, 5) (7, 10)    
(8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18)    
(9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 19)    
(10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 19)    
(11, 9) (11, 12)    
(12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 8)    
(13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 15)    
(14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13)    
(15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 13)    
(16, 17) (16, 3)    
(17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 4)    
(18, 8) (18, 1) (18, 15)    
(19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 3)    

Next, let's sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:

Nodes sorted by degree:
7, 6, 16, 0, 3, 5, 11, 8, 14, 1, 17, 2, 15, 12, 18, 13, 19, 9, 4, 10

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 8]

<1, 2, 17>
<2, 9, 17>
<3, 16, 17>
<4, 14, 15>
<4, 17, 19>
<5, 7, 10>
<8, 12, 18>
<10, 13, 19>
