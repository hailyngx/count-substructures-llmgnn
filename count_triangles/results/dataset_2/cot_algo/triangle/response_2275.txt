Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Thus, the vertices will be relabeled as follows:

Node 0 -> degree 2
Node 3 -> degree 2
Node 7 -> degree 3
Node 8 -> degree 3
Node 6 -> degree 4
Node 1 -> degree 5
Node 9 -> degree 5
Node 2 -> degree 5
Node 4 -> degree 6
Node 5 -> degree 7

Following the method, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. By doing this, we can count the triangles formed by shared connections.

After calculating, the total number of triangles found is [10].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 4>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<0, 3, 1>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 5>
<7, 4, 8>
