Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 4) (15, 18) (8, 23) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 25) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 0) (23, 9) (13, 26) (13, 20) (13, 19) (26, 13) (26, 14) (26, 6) (0, 23) (7, 11) (7, 27) (16, 28) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 9) (28, 16) (28, 17) (28, 24) (17, 28) (17, 20) (17, 25) (17, 27) (20, 13) (20, 17) (20, 22) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 29) (9, 23) (9, 16) (9, 29) (9, 21) (29, 11) (29, 9) (4, 3) (4, 23) (4, 16) (4, 10) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 19) (2, 16) (2, 22) (22, 20) (22, 2) (22, 14) (25, 8) (25, 17) (25, 14) (25, 10) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 12) (19, 1) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 22) (14, 25) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 10) (1, 27) (24, 28) (24, 21) (21, 9) (21, 24) (5, 12) (5, 27) (18, 15) (18, 6) (6, 26) (6, 18) (10, 4) (10, 25) (10, 1) (27, 7) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Vertices sorted by their degree:
- Node 18: degree = 2
- Node 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 24, 29: degree = 3
- Node 0, 2, 6, 10, 12, 15, 17, 22: degree = 4
- Node 1, 13, 20, 26, 28: degree = 4
- Node 4, 14, 16, 19, 25: degree = 5
- Node 8, 9, 11, 27: degree = 5
- Node 23: degree = 6

Now, let's count the triangles by examining the connections:

[Total number of triangles: 18]
Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 19>
<0, 8, 14>
<0, 8, 25>
<0, 9, 29>
<2, 16, 22>
<2, 22, 26>
<4, 8, 25>
<4, 10, 25>
<4, 23, 8>
<4, 16, 25>
<4, 16, 28>
<4, 16, 9>
<4, 16, 10>
<5, 12, 27>
<6, 13, 26>
<7, 11, 27>
<15, 18, 6>
<17, 20, 22>
