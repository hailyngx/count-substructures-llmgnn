Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes: 5, 4, 7, 3
- Node 1 is connected to nodes: 5, 9, 4
- Node 2 is connected to nodes: 9, 4, 3
- Node 3 is connected to nodes: 9, 4, 2, 0, 7
- Node 4 is connected to nodes: 8, 0, 1, 3, 2
- Node 5 is connected to nodes: 9, 6, 1, 0, 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes: 5, 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes: 5, 8, 6, 0, 3
- Node 8 is connected to nodes: 9, 4, 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes: 5, 8, 2, 3, 1

Next step is to sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:
Sorted nodes: [6, 2, 8, 1, 0, 4, 7, 3, 5, 9]

Now, we will go through the edges by considering only cases where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. 
- Edge (5, 9): Both nodes have more connections than 6, 2, and 8.
- Edge (5, 6): 6 is a lower labeled vertex and has fewer connections. Shared connections: 7, 1, 0.
- Edge (5, 1): 1 is a lower labeled vertex and has fewer connections. Shared connections: 5, 9.
- Edge (5, 0): 0 is a lower labeled vertex and has fewer connections. Shared connections: 5, 7.
- Edge (5, 7): 6 is a lower labeled vertex and has fewer connections. Shared connections: 5, 1, 0.

The number of triangles in the graph is [3].

Unique triangles found:
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
