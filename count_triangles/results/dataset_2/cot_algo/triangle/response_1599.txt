Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees, from least connected to most connected. Then, we relabel the nodes accordingly before checking for triangles.

The degrees of the nodes in the given graph are as follows:
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 6
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 3

Therefore, the sorted node labels are:
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 6

We will now check the edges in order of the sorted labels:
1. Check edge (1, 5):
    Node 1 is less than Node 5, and they share Node 2 forming triangle <1, 2, 5>.

2. Check edge (8, 2):
    Node 8 is less than Node 2, and they share Node 6 forming triangle <2, 6, 8>.

3. Check edge (9, 3):
    Node 9 is less than Node 3, but they do not form a triangle.

4. Check edge (0, 4):
    Node 0 is less than Node 4, and they share Node 5 forming triangle <0, 4, 5>.

5. Check edge (2, 1):
    Node 1 is less than Node 2, and they share Node 5 forming triangle <1, 2, 5>.

6. Check edge (3, 4):
    Node 3 is less than Node 4, and they share Node 2 forming triangle <3, 2, 4>.

7. Check edge (4, 5):
    Node 4 is less than Node 5, and they share Node 0 forming triangle <4, 0, 5>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles and the unique triangles found are:
Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <1, 2, 5>, <2, 6, 8>, <0, 4, 5>, <3, 2, 4>, <4, 0, 5>
