Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 1) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 9) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 14) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the given nodes and edges. Now, let's proceed to count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted by their number of connections (degree):
Node 0: degree 5
Node 4: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 1: degree 6
Node 11: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 12: degree 5
Node 14: degree 3
Node 8: degree 6
Node 13: degree 5

Now, we will count the triangles:

Triangles:
[8, 13, 1]
[8, 13, 3]
[8, 13, 7]
[8, 13, 5]
[8, 13, 1]
[8, 13, 3]
[8, 13, 7]
[8, 13, 5]
[8, 1, 11]
[8, 1, 12]
[8, 1, 5]
[8, 3, 0]
[8, 10, 12]
[8, 10, 11]
[8, 10, 14]
[8, 10, 12]
[8, 10, 11]
[8, 10, 14]
[8, 10, 12]
[8, 10, 11]

Total number of triangles: [19]
