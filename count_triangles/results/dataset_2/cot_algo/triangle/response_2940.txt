Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. The sorted vertices with their degrees are as follows:

Node 0: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 6
Node 7: Degree 6
Node 4: Degree 6

Next, we will consider the edges in the increasing order of the starting node based on their labels. We will ignore self-loops. The triangles found in this graph are:
