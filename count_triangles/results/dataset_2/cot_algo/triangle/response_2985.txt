Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 5) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 12) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 3) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied to count the number of triangles in this graph. 

First, we identify the degrees of each node:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 6
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 5
Node 12: degree 2
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 5

Now, we relabel the nodes according to their degree in ascending order:
Node 12: degree 2
Nodes 1, 6, 8: degree 3
Nodes 4, 10, 13: degree 3
Nodes 0, 2, 5, 7, 9: degree 4
Nodes 11, 14: degree 5
Node 3: degree 6

Next, we only consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
1. Edge (4, 1) forms a triangle with connections to node 11.
2. Edge (4, 10) forms a triangle with connections to nodes 3 and 11.
3. Edge (7, 3) forms a triangle with connections to nodes 10 and 11.
4. Edge (4, 13) does not form a triangle.
5. Edge (7, 5) forms a triangle with connections to nodes 11 and 13.
6. Edge (10, 11) forms a triangle with connections to node 3.
7. Edge (8, 13) does not form a triangle.
8. Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle.
9. Edge (6, 13) forms a triangle with connections to nodes 2 and 5.
10. Edge (0, 14) forms a triangle with connections to nodes 3 and 11.
11. Edge (9, 8) does not form a triangle.
12. Edge (12, 2) forms a triangle with connections to node 3.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].

Unique triangles found:
<4, 10, 11>
<3, 7, 5>
<6, 13, 2>
<0, 3, 14>
<2, 12, 3>
