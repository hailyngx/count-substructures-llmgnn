Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (7, 3), (12, 0)
- 1: (3, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1)
- 2: (9, 2), (10, 2), (8, 2), (13, 2), (5, 2)
- 3: (7, 3), (1, 3), (11, 3), (0, 3), (13, 3)
- 4: (7, 4), (8, 4), (13, 4), (11, 4)
- 5: (1, 5), (8, 5), (12, 5), (2, 5), (14, 5)
- 6: (1, 6), (10, 6)
- 7: (4, 7), (12, 7), (0, 7), (3, 7), (11, 7)
- 8: (4, 8), (2, 8), (5, 8)
- 9: (2, 9), (11, 9), (14, 9), (12, 9)
- 10: (6, 10), (2, 10), (11, 10)
- 11: (4, 11), (7, 11), (3, 11), (9, 11), (10, 11)
- 12: (7, 12), (1, 12), (9, 12), (5, 12), (0, 12), (14, 12)
- 13: (4, 13), (3, 13), (2, 13)
- 14: (9, 14), (12, 14), (5, 14)

Now, let's list the nodes with their degrees (number of connections):
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 6
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 3

Next, we apply the Degree-Based Ordering method and calculate the number of triangles. 

[Total number of triangles: 6]

<1, 3, 5>
<2, 8, 5>
<2, 9, 14>
<3, 7, 11>
<3, 7, 12>
<5, 12, 14>
