Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (9, 6), (9, 8), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 2), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 3), (7, 0), (6, 3), (0, 2), (3, 8), (1, 0)

Now, we will perform the Degree-Based Ordering on the nodes based on their number of connections:

Nodes with connections in increasing order:
1. Node 7 (Degree: 1)
2. Node 1 (Degree: 1)
3. Node 5 (Degree: 3)
4. Node 9 (Degree: 3)
5. Node 2 (Degree: 3)
6. Node 7 (Degree: 4)
7. Node 8 (Degree: 4)
8. Node 1 (Degree: 4)
9. Node 3 (Degree: 5)
10. Node 4 (Degree: 6)

Now, we will count the number of triangles formed by the edges in the graph:

Triangles: [4]

Unique triangles:
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 3>
<3, 4, 6>
<1, 2, 4>
