The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 26) (15, 2) (6, 29) (6, 27) (9, 28) (1, 21) (22, 23) (22, 24) (23, 22) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 25) (21, 17) (4, 19) (4, 29) (8, 28) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 7) (26, 15) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 25) (28, 9) (28, 8) (28, 26) (28, 20) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 24) (17, 21) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 27) (10, 21) (18, 19) (18, 20) (18, 0) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 16) (11, 24) (11, 20) (24, 22) (24, 13) (24, 11) (24, 0) (24, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 24) (7, 14) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 5) (2, 15) (2, 19) (29, 6) (29, 4) (29, 26) (29, 0) (27, 6) (27, 17) (27, 5) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 12) (5, 14) (5, 27) (5, 20) (25, 21) (25, 26) (25, 16) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 25) (12, 14) (12, 0) (20, 28) (20, 18) (20, 11) (20, 5) 

Response:
The graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: (3, 15), (3, 7), (3, 14), (15, 3), (15, 26), (15, 2), (6, 29), (6, 27), (9, 28), (1, 21), (22, 23), (22, 24), (23, 22), (21, 1), (21, 10), (21, 25), (21, 17), (4, 19), (4, 29), (8, 28), (8, 17), (8, 0), (8, 7), (26, 15), (26, 28), (26, 29), (26, 25), (28, 9), (28, 8), (28, 26), (28, 20), (13, 17), (13, 16), (13, 24), (17, 21), (17, 8), (17, 13), (17, 27), (10, 21), (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 0), (19, 4), (19, 18), (19, 2), (19, 16), (11, 24), (11, 20), (24, 22), (24, 13), (24, 11), (24, 0), (24, 7), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 24), (7, 14), (14, 3), (14, 7), (14, 12), (14, 5), (2, 15), (2, 19), (29, 6), (29, 4), (29, 26), (29, 0), (27, 6), (27, 17), (27, 5), (0, 8), (0, 18), (0, 24), (0, 29), (0, 12), (5, 14), (5, 27), (5, 20), (25, 21), (25, 26), (25, 16), (16, 13), (16, 19), (16, 25), (12, 14), (12, 0), (20, 28), (20, 18), (20, 11), (20, 5)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees from least to most:

Nodes: 11, 1, 9, 10, 2, 6, 23, 22, 3, 26, 27, 4, 5, 29, 13, 16, 12, 7, 14, 8, 25, 21, 24, 0, 19, 18, 20, 17, 28, 15

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Total number of triangles: [52]
