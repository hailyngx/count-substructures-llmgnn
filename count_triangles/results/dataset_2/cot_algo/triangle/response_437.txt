Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 14) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 14) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 11) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 
(0, 7), (0, 9), (0, 14), 
(1, 2), (1, 13), 
(2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 11), 
(3, 6), (3, 12), (3, 14), 
(4, 2), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), 
(5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 13), 
(6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 14), 
(7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 12), 
(8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 10), 
(9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 8), 
(10, 7), (10, 8), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 13), 
(11, 2), (11, 7), (11, 10), (11, 13), (11, 12), 
(12, 3), (12, 7), (12, 10), (12, 11), 
(13, 1), (13, 5), (13, 10), (13, 11), (13, 14), 
(14, 0), (14, 3), (14, 6), (14, 13)

Now, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices in decreasing order of degree: 
0, 7, 1, 13, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, 3, 5, 9, 12

Thus, the triangles in the graph are:

[Total number of triangles: 21]
<0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 12>, <1, 2, 13>, <2, 4, 11>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 14>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 14>, <4, 7, 10>, <4, 7, 11>, <4, 8, 10>, <4, 8, 11>, <5, 8, 13>, <6, 7, 10>, <6, 7, 11>, <7, 10, 11>, <7, 10, 12>, <8, 10, 13>, <10, 11, 13>, <10, 11, 12>, <13, 14, 3>
