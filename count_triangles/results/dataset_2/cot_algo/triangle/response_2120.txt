Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 14) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 14)
(9, 2), (9, 14), (9, 10), (9, 3)
(4, 12), (4, 10), (4, 6)
(7, 11), (7, 2), (7, 13), (7, 1)
(1, 3), (1, 14), (1, 0)
(3, 12), (3, 8)
(2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 10), (2, 0)
(8, 14), (8, 10)
(13, 6)
(11, 12), (11, 14)
(0, 1), (0, 2)
(10, 8)

Next, to count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Sort vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
Nodes by degree: 11, 5, 12, 6, 10, 13, 1, 3, 7, 0, 4, 8, 2, 9, 14

Now, count the triangles:
Triangles: [6]

Triangles found: <5, 13, 6>
