Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 6) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 3) (11, 9) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 10) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 0) (13, 18) (10, 5) (10, 7) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 17) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 16) (17, 4) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 6) (4, 2) (4, 17) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 14) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 9) (9, 11) (9, 18) (9, 7) (0, 3) (0, 13) (1, 2) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 12) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 6) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 16) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 9) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be constructed as follows:

```
0: 3, 13
1: 2
2: 1, 6, 7, 4
3: 0, 11, 14
4: 2, 17, 12
5: 13, 17, 10
6: 2, 8, 19, 16
7: 2, 10, 9
8: 19, 16, 15, 6
9: 11, 18, 7
10: 5, 7
11: 3, 9
12: 4, 14
13: 5, 17, 0, 18
14: 3, 15, 12
15: 8, 14, 17
16: 8, 17, 6
17: 5, 13, 15, 16, 4
18: 13, 19, 9
19: 8, 18, 6
```

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
   ```
   1: 1
   10: 2
   12: 2
   16: 2
   18: 2
   0: 2
   9: 2
   11: 2
   5: 3
   7: 3
   15: 3
   19: 3
   3: 3
   4: 3
   6: 4
   8: 4
   2: 4
   13: 4
   14: 3
   17: 5
   ```
  
2. Proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Count the triangles formed by shared connections:
   - Triangles: <2, 1, 4>, <2, 4, 17>, <8, 6, 19>, <8, 6, 16>, <3, 0, 13>, <17, 15, 16>, <17, 15, 8>, <17, 16, 6>, <13, 0, 3>, <13, 0, 18>, <4, 17, 16>, <4, 17, 5>, <5, 17, 7>, <5, 17, 10>, <15, 17, 16>, <18, 13, 5>, <18, 13, 0>, <18, 13, 17>
  
3. Output the total number of triangles: [18]
