Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 20) (17, 16) (17, 19) (3, 9) (3, 29) (25, 5) (25, 26) (25, 4) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 21) (8, 26) (13, 8) (13, 0) (2, 5) (2, 11) (29, 3) (29, 19) (29, 4) (29, 10) (4, 25) (4, 29) (4, 15) (7, 20) (7, 23) (15, 4) (15, 20) (15, 26) (15, 21) (20, 14) (20, 7) (20, 15) (20, 6) (6, 20) (6, 28) (6, 12) (28, 6) (28, 16) (19, 17) (19, 29) (19, 26) (19, 27) (26, 25) (26, 8) (26, 15) (26, 19) (26, 23) (16, 17) (16, 28) (16, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 27) (9, 12) (10, 29) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 11) (24, 0) (24, 18) (24, 5) (23, 7) (23, 26) (23, 1) (23, 0) (11, 2) (11, 21) (11, 18) (18, 9) (18, 24) (18, 11) (5, 25) (5, 2) (5, 24) (5, 22) (1, 16) (1, 23) (1, 0) (0, 13) (0, 24) (0, 23) (0, 1) (0, 12) (27, 19) (27, 9) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 0) (22, 5) 

Response:
The given graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: [(14, 20), (17, 16), (17, 19), (3, 9), (3, 29), (25, 5), (25, 26), (25, 4), (8, 13), (8, 9), (8, 21), (8, 26), (13, 0), (2, 5), (2, 11), (29, 19), (25, 4), (7, 20), (15, 26), (20, 6), (6, 20), (6, 28), (19, 26), (16, 17), (9, 8), (9, 18), (10, 29), (21, 8), (24, 0), (24, 18), (23, 7), (11, 21), (5, 24), (1, 23), (0, 13), (27, 9), (12, 6), (22, 5)]

Next, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees from least to most:

0: degree 5
1: degree 3
2: degree 2
10: degree 1
11: degree 3
12: degree 3
13: degree 2
14: degree 1
15: degree 4
16: degree 2
17: degree 2
18: degree 3
19: degree 4
20: degree 4
21: degree 3
22: degree 1
23: degree 3
24: degree 3
25: degree 4
26: degree 5
27: degree 2
28: degree 2
29: degree 4
3: degree 2
4: degree 5
5: degree 4
6: degree 4
7: degree 2
8: degree 5
9: degree 5

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [24]

Unique triangles: 
<3, 4, 25>
<0, 9, 13>
<0, 9, 18>
<0, 13, 24>
<0, 12, 23>
<1, 16, 23>
<1, 16, 17>
<1, 23, 7>
<1, 23, 0>
<2, 5, 25>
<5, 24, 0>
<5, 24, 22>
<5, 25, 4>
<6, 12, 9>
<6, 12, 0>
<6, 20, 7>
<7, 20, 15>
<8, 13, 0>
<8, 13, 9>
<8, 21, 15>
<8, 21, 11>
<9, 12, 6>
<9, 18, 11>
<15, 20, 6>
