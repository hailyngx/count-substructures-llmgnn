Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (13, 29) (13, 10) (13, 27) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 7) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 22) (7, 4) (7, 27) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 25) (14, 4) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 1) (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 10) (0, 18) (0, 25) (0, 16) (0, 2) (25, 18) (25, 0) (25, 16) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 29) (19, 22) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 2) (26, 21) (15, 5) (11, 4) (11, 28) (11, 5) (28, 11) (28, 8) (28, 1) (28, 12) (28, 24) (1, 17) (1, 28) (1, 12) (1, 8) (21, 6) (21, 26) (21, 8) (29, 13) (29, 10) (29, 3) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 25) (16, 24) (23, 2) (23, 3) (8, 10) (8, 28) (8, 1) (8, 21) (24, 28) (24, 16) (5, 15) (5, 11) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 26) (2, 23) (2, 27) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 28) (12, 1) (3, 29) (3, 23) (3, 5) (27, 13) (27, 7) (27, 2) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with nodes and edges. Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are: <3, 15, 19, 21, 23, 24, 6, 9, 26, 4, 5, 17, 1, 16, 18, 0, 25, 22, 13, 7, 29, 11, 8, 2, 12, 10, 27, 28, 14, 20>.

Calculating the number of triangles and listing the unique triangles:
