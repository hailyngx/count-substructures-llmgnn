Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 14) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 3) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 10) (1, 5) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the triangles efficiently. 

Here is the list of unique triangles in the given graph represented by their node numbers: 
<9, 10, 13>, <7, 12, 14>, <0, 2, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 10, 11>, <0, 8, 13>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 12>, <10, 12, 13>, <10, 12, 2>, <10, 12, 3>, <10, 2, 3>, <6, 7, 14>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
