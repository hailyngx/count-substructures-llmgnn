Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 23) (15, 5) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 11) (25, 26) (25, 23) (25, 28) (1, 28) (1, 23) (1, 0) (21, 0) (21, 26) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 22) (8, 18) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 18) (4, 15) (4, 22) (4, 24) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 14) (12, 7) (19, 17) (26, 25) (26, 21) (16, 7) (16, 28) (16, 9) (16, 10) (28, 25) (28, 1) (28, 16) (9, 8) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 2) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 6) (2, 9) (2, 22) (2, 20) (2, 11) (22, 8) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 5) (22, 24) (0, 1) (0, 21) (0, 9) (0, 29) (0, 5) (6, 18) (6, 27) (29, 0) (29, 5) (29, 10) (20, 2) (20, 24) (20, 10) (10, 16) (10, 29) (10, 20) (27, 6) (24, 4) (24, 22) (24, 20) (5, 15) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 29) (23, 3) (23, 14) (23, 25) (23, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, relabel the vertices accordingly. 

Here is the list of vertices with their degrees:
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 5
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 25: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 21: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 26: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 28: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 22: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 29: degree 3
- Node 20: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 27: degree 1
- Node 24: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 23: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 3

The edges that satisfy the lower label having fewer connections are: 
- (3, 23)
- (15, 5)
- (7, 12)
- (0, 21)
