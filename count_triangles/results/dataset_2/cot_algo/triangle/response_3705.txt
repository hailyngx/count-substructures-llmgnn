Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 10) (14, 17) (14, 16) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 1) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 18) (10, 15) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 9) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 11) (4, 12) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 1) (18, 13) (18, 12) (18, 4) (18, 9) (1, 17) (1, 4) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 16) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 9) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 16) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly. 

After sorting the vertices and relabeling them, the new labels are as follows:
0: 1
1: 0
2: 6
3: 8
4: 7
5: 5
6: 9
7: 10
8: 4
9: 11
10: 2
11: 12
12: 13
13: 3
14: 14
15: 15
16: 16
17: 17
18: 18

Now, we will count the triangles by checking shared connections:
- Triangle <0, 10, 2>
- Triangle <0, 12, 4>
- Triangle <0, 12, 18>
- Triangle <0, 8, 16>
- Triangle <1, 4, 18>
- Triangle <2, 5, 7>
- Triangle <2, 5, 11>
- Triangle <2, 10, 9>
- Triangle <4, 12, 18>
- Triangle <5, 7, 11>
- Triangle <8, 10, 16>
- Triangle <9, 10, 16>
- Triangle <10, 14, 17>
- Triangle <10, 15, 3>
- Triangle <12, 18, 4>
- Triangle <12, 18, 9>
- Triangle <16, 8, 0>
- Triangle <16, 9, 10>
- Triangle <16, 9, 18>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [19] in this graph.
