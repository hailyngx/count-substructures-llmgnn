Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 17) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (0, 16) (0, 14) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (4, 14) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 7) (17, 15) (17, 1) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 8) (19, 5) (13, 1) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 10) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 14) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph. 

After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
```
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 3
Node 12: Degree 5
Node 13: Degree 1
Node 14: Degree 6
Node 15: Degree 4
Node 16: Degree 3
Node 17: Degree 2
Node 18: Degree 3
Node 19: Degree 2
```

Now, using the edges provided and the sorted vertices, we can count the number of triangles. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is **31**. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
```
<1, 5, 14>
<1, 5, 15>
<1, 5, 17>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 15>
<1, 7, 10>
<2, 8, 10>
<2, 8, 14>
<2, 8, 18>
<2, 14, 18>
<3, 10, 12>
<4, 14, 15>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 10>
<5, 6, 19>
<5, 7, 10>
<5, 18, 19>
<6, 7, 10>
<9, 8, 15>
<9, 8, 10>
<9, 15, 17>
<10, 7, 6>
<10, 8, 15>
<11, 12, 16>
<11, 12, 14>
<11, 16, 0>
<12, 3, 10>
<12, 3, 14>
<15, 14, 17>
<18, 2, 5>
```

The total number of triangles in the given graph is **[31]**.
