Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 11) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 11 - Degree 1
Node 9 - Degree 1
Node 7 - Degree 2
Node 2 - Degree 2
Node 5 - Degree 5
Node 1 - Degree 5
Node 3 - Degree 5
Node 8 - Degree 5
Node 4 - Degree 5
Node 14 - Degree 5
Node 6 - Degree 5
Node 12 - Degree 5
Node 0 - Degree 6
Node 13 - Degree 6
Node 10 - Degree 7
