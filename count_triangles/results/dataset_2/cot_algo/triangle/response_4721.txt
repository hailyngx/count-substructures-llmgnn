Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 24) (13, 9) (13, 7) (23, 12) (20, 25) (25, 20) (25, 29) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 1) (10, 28) (17, 10) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 7) (8, 9) (8, 29) (8, 15) (6, 28) (6, 3) (28, 10) (28, 6) (28, 18) (28, 5) (28, 15) (0, 14) (0, 21) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 27) (14, 7) (9, 13) (9, 8) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 11) (1, 10) (1, 4) (24, 13) (24, 11) (5, 28) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 15) (26, 10) (26, 5) (26, 2) (26, 16) (11, 21) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 29) (7, 13) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 11) (2, 5) (2, 26) (2, 27) (12, 23) (12, 15) (12, 19) (16, 26) (16, 19) (18, 17) (18, 28) (18, 14) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 16) (19, 27) (15, 8) (15, 28) (15, 5) (15, 12) (29, 25) (29, 8) (29, 11) (29, 3) (27, 14) (27, 2) (27, 19) (3, 6) (3, 29) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows: 

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: 
(0, 14), (0, 21), (0, 4)
(1, 10), (1, 4)
(2, 5), (2, 26), (2, 27)
(3, 6), (3, 29)
(4, 17), (4, 0), (4, 1)
(5, 28), (5, 2), (5, 26), (5, 15)
(6, 28), (6, 3)
(7, 13), (7, 17), (7, 14), (7, 11)
(8, 9), (8, 29), (8, 15)
(9, 13), (9, 8)
(10, 17), (10, 21), (10, 26), (10, 1), (10, 28)
(11, 21), (11, 24), (11, 7), (11, 19), (11, 29)
(12, 23), (12, 15), (12, 19)
(13, 24), (13, 9), (13, 7)
(14, 0), (14, 18), (14, 27), (14, 7)
(15, 8), (15, 28), (15, 5), (15, 12)
(16, 26), (16, 19)
(17, 10), (17, 18), (17, 4), (17, 7)
(18, 17), (18, 28), (18, 14)
(19, 11), (19, 12), (19, 16), (19, 27)
(20, 25)
(21, 10), (21, 0), (21, 11)
(23, 12)
(24, 13), (24, 11)
(25, 20), (25, 29)
(26, 10), (26, 5), (26, 2), (26, 16)
(27, 14), (27, 2), (27, 19)
(28, 10), (28, 6), (28, 18), (28, 5), (28, 15)
(29, 25), (29, 8), (29, 11), (29, 3)

Now, I will construct the Degree-Based Ordering by sorting the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Degree 1: {16, 22, 20, 3}
Degree 2: {0, 1, 7, 9, 17, 18, 23, 24}
Degree 3: {2, 6, 4, 14, 15, 26}
Degree 4: {11, 12, 13, 19, 27, 5}
Degree 5: {8, 10, 21, 25, 28, 29}

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

[Total number of triangles: 18]

<7, 17, 4>
<5, 15, 28>
<4, 17, 0>
<11, 24, 13>
<14, 7, 11>
<14, 18, 27>
<10, 17, 21>
<5, 26, 2>
<19, 12, 23>
<26, 16, 19>
<19, 27, 2>
<21, 11, 24>
<28, 5, 26>
<14, 7, 13>
<14, 18, 17>
<14, 4, 0>
<26, 2, 5>
<15, 5, 28>
