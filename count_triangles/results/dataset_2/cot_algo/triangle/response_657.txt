Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows:

- (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 0), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 8), (1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 0), (1, 8), (3, 5), (3, 1), (3, 8), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 2), (4, 0), (8, 6), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 2), (2, 5), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 0), (0, 9), (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 2), (0, 7), (7, 2), (7, 0)

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes in increasing order of degrees: 7, 9, 6, 4, 0, 3, 1, 8, 5, 2

Triangles: 
[23]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <3, 1, 8>, <4, 8, 2>, <5, 6, 1>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 9, 4>, <5, 9, 6>, <9, 4, 8>
