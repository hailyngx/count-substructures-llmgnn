Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 14) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 9) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 9) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 4) (14, 11) (14, 8) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 9) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 4) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order. With 15 nodes and given edges, the degrees of each node are as follows:

Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 6
Node 9: degree 5
Node 10: degree 5
Node 11: degree 6
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 5
Node 14: degree 2

Sorting the nodes by degrees in ascending order: (1, 5, 6, 0, 7, 12, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 13, 11, 8, 14).

Now, we'll count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
The total number of triangles is [18].

Unique triangles found:
