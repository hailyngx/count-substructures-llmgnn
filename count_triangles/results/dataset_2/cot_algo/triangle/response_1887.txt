Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following structure:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 4), (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 7), (9, 0), (6, 2), (6, 8), (6, 4), (1, 3), (1, 7), (3, 2), (4, 8), (8, 0)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
Degree of each node:  
0: 3  
1: 2  
2: 3  
3: 2  
4: 5  
5: 4  
6: 4  
7: 4  
8: 3  
9: 5  

Node ordering based on degree:  
1 -> 3 -> 8 -> 0 -> 2 -> 6 -> 7 -> 9 -> 5 -> 4  

Now we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

Triangles:
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 7, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 9, 5>
<0, 9, 7>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [11]
