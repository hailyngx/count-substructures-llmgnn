Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
(5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) 
(1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 1) 
(7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) 
(0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2)

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes sorted by number of connections: [3, 5, 7, 9, 0, 8, 2, 4, 6, 1]

Triangles:
[12]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 8, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <2, 1, 7>, <2, 1, 8>, <2, 7, 4>, <2, 7, 1>
