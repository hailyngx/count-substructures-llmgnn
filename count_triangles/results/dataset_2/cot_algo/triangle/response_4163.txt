Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 15) (14, 23) (17, 14) (17, 4) (17, 21) (15, 14) (15, 21) (20, 7) (20, 1) (20, 22) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 5) (7, 20) (12, 29) (11, 28) (11, 24) (11, 26) (11, 29) (28, 11) (28, 26) (28, 8) (26, 11) (26, 28) (26, 2) (26, 8) (10, 2) (6, 24) (6, 4) (6, 23) (24, 11) (24, 6) (24, 22) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 25) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 27) (25, 0) (25, 9) (25, 1) (25, 29) (25, 22) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 4) (2, 26) (2, 10) (27, 9) (27, 29) (27, 3) (29, 12) (29, 11) (29, 25) (29, 27) (3, 27) (3, 16) (3, 22) (3, 18) (1, 20) (1, 8) (1, 25) (1, 19) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 13) (4, 17) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 19) (13, 19) (18, 3) (18, 16) (16, 9) (16, 3) (16, 18) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 25) (22, 3) (23, 14) (23, 6) (21, 17) (21, 15) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(0, 14), (0, 25), (0, 5), 
(1, 20), (1, 8), (1, 25), (1, 19),
(2, 26), (2, 10),
(3, 27), (3, 16), (3, 22), (3, 18),
(4, 17), (4, 6), (4, 9), (4, 5), (4, 19),
(5, 0), (5, 8), (5, 4),
(6, 24), (6, 4), (6, 23),
(7, 20),
