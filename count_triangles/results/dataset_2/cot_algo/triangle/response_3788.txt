Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 6) (8, 3) (8, 11) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 17) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 17) (5, 19) (5, 17) (13, 18) (13, 9) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 9) (15, 0) (15, 16) (15, 14) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 9) (17, 0) (17, 4) (17, 5) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 4) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 16) 

Response:
The given graph with the provided edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(1, 3), (1, 14), (1, 19), 
(3, 1), (3, 8), 
(2, 18), (2, 6), (2, 11), 
(18, 2), (18, 10), (18, 13), 
(7, 12), (7, 10), (7, 14), 
(12, 7), (12, 10), (12, 6), 
(8, 3), (8, 11), 
(0, 16), (0, 15), (0, 17), 
(4, 11), (4, 6), (4, 17), 
(5, 19), (5, 17), 
(13, 18), (13, 9), 
(19, 1), (19, 5), (19, 9), 
(15, 0), (15, 16), (15, 14), 
(16, 0), (16, 15), (16, 10), (16, 6), 
(14, 1), (14, 7), (14, 15), (14, 9), 
(17, 0), (17, 4), (17, 5), 
(10, 18), (10, 7), (10, 12), (10, 16), 
(11, 2), (11, 8), (11, 4), 
(9, 13), (9, 19), (9, 14), 
(6, 2), (6, 12), (6, 4), (6, 16)

After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the nodes are:
0 (Degree: 3), 5 (Degree: 2), 9 (Degree: 3), 17 (Degree: 3), 
1 (Degree: 3), 4 (Degree: 3), 7 (Degree: 3), 10 (Degree: 4), 
2 (Degree: 3), 6 (Degree: 4), 11 (Degree: 3), 18 (Degree: 3), 
3 (Degree: 2), 8 (Degree: 2), 12 (Degree: 3), 13 (Degree: 2), 
14 (Degree: 4), 15 (Degree: 3), 16 (Degree: 4), 19 (Degree: 4)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the graph: 
We will only consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

Total number of triangles: [9]

Unique triangles: 
<2, 18, 13>, <6, 2, 18>, <6, 2, 11>, <6, 2, 4>, <6, 2, 12>, <10, 12, 7>, <10, 18, 13>, <14, 1, 3>, <19, 5, 17>
