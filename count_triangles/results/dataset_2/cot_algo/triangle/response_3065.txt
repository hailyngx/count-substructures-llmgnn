Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 24) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 19) (7, 17) (10, 11) (10, 22) (10, 24) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 17) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 28) (12, 26) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 22) (8, 2) (8, 27) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 29) (6, 23) (28, 12) (28, 6) (0, 19) (14, 18) (29, 6) (29, 13) (29, 3) (17, 7) (17, 11) (20, 5) (25, 7) (25, 9) (25, 21) (21, 6) (21, 25) (9, 25) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 15) (1, 22) (1, 18) (15, 1) (15, 22) (15, 13) (22, 10) (22, 2) (22, 1) (22, 15) (22, 27) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 27) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 23) (3, 29) (3, 13) (23, 6) (23, 19) (23, 16) (23, 13) (24, 4) (24, 10) (26, 12) (26, 27) (16, 10) (16, 23) (16, 5) (27, 8) (27, 22) (27, 18) (27, 26) (5, 4) (5, 20) (5, 16) (13, 29) (13, 15) (13, 3) (13, 23) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the given nodes and edges.

Let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0: 1 connection
14: 1 connection
20: 1 connection
9: 2 connections
29: 3 connections
3: 3 connections
1: 4 connections
18: 4 connections
15: 4 connections
5: 4 connections
16: 4 connections
26: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
13: 5 connections
24: 5 connections
17: 5 connections
11: 5 connections
21: 5 connections
25: 5 connections
19: 5 connections
12: 5 connections
2: 5 connections
10: 5 connections
27: 6 connections
7: 6 connections
22: 6 connections
28: 6 connections
4: 6 connections

Now, let's count the number of triangles and list them:

Total number of triangles: [14]

Unique triangles:
<7, 17, 11>
<4, 12, 28>
<4, 2, 12>
<7, 25, 9>
<6, 23, 16>
<6, 21, 25>
<6, 23, 13>
<6, 28, 12>
<16, 5, 20>
<18, 1, 22>
<18, 1, 15>
<18, 27, 22>
<1, 9, 25>
<1, 15, 13>
