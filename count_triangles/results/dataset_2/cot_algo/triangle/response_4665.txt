Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 9) (17, 6) (17, 5) (10, 9) (2, 15) (2, 4) (8, 0) (1, 0) (1, 18) (1, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 5) (5, 17) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 6) (15, 2) (15, 12) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 16) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 12) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 11) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 11) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 11) (3, 16) (3, 6) (11, 12) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then, we'll relabel the vertices accordingly. 

Here is the list of vertices sorted by their degree:
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 15: 2 connections
- Node 17: 2 connections
- Node 10: 2 connections
- Node 14: 2 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 16: 3 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 18: 4 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 12: 4 connections
- Node 0: 5 connections
- Node 7: 6 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 13: 5 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 19: 4 connections
- Node 11: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through each edge in the graph:

1. Edge (14, 7): Node 14 (2 connections) < Node 7 (6 connections)
   - Shared connections with 14 and 7: 1 (Node 1)

   - Shared connections with 14 and 9: None
