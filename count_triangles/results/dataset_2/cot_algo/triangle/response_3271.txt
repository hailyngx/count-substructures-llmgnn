Using the degree-based ordering method, we will start checking for triangles based on the vertices and their connections.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [32].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 15>
<0, 10, 26>
<0, 10, 6>
<0, 10, 16>
<0, 10, 21>
<0, 3, 15>
<0, 10, 21>
<0, 3, 24>
<0, 25, 15>
