Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 12) (9, 16) (26, 9) (26, 25) (26, 8) (3, 17) (3, 12) (15, 7) (15, 6) (2, 23) (2, 28) (2, 21) (29, 7) (29, 6) (29, 18) (14, 17) (14, 0) (17, 3) (17, 14) (17, 11) (20, 18) (20, 5) (20, 28) (25, 26) (25, 22) (5, 20) (5, 12) (5, 1) (8, 26) (8, 0) (23, 2) (23, 1) (23, 24) (13, 22) (13, 19) (13, 18) (13, 6) (22, 25) (22, 13) (22, 7) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 18) (7, 15) (7, 29) (7, 22) (7, 0) (7, 11) (6, 15) (6, 29) (6, 13) (6, 21) (6, 12) (21, 2) (21, 6) (21, 24) (4, 12) (27, 10) (27, 1) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 4) (11, 17) (11, 7) (16, 9) (16, 18) (1, 5) (1, 23) (1, 27) (10, 27) (10, 19) (10, 24) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 28) (28, 2) (28, 20) (28, 19) (18, 29) (18, 20) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 16) (24, 23) (24, 21) (24, 10) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}
Edges: {(9, 26), (9, 12), (9, 16), (26, 25), (26, 8), (3, 17), (3, 12), (15, 7), (15, 6), (2, 23), (2, 28), (2, 21), (29, 7), (29, 6), (29, 18), (14, 17), (14, 0), (17, 11), (20, 28), (20, 5), (25, 22), (5, 1), (8, 0), (23, 24), (13, 22), (13, 19), (13, 6), (22, 7), (0, 18), (7, 11), (6, 21), (4, 12), (27, 10), (12, 5), (11, 7), (16, 18), (1, 27), (10, 19), (19, 28), (18, 16), (24, 10)}

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

Vertices sorted by the number of connections (degree):
1. 4 (Degree: 1)
2. 26 (Degree: 1)
3. 15 (Degree: 2)
4. 29 (Degree: 2)
5. 14 (Degree: 2)
6. 2 (Degree: 3)
7. 25 (Degree: 3)
8. 24 (Degree: 3)
9. 21 (Degree: 3)
10. 4 (Degree: 3)
11. 13 (Degree: 4)
12. 8 (Degree: 4)
13. 16 (Degree: 4)
14. 3 (Degree: 4)
15. 0 (Degree: 5)
16. 20 (Degree: 5)
17. 5 (Degree: 5)
18. 1 (Degree: 6)
19. 7 (Degree: 6)
20. 12 (Degree: 6)
21. 10 (Degree: 6)
22. 27 (Degree: 6)
23. 11 (Degree: 7)
24. 17 (Degree: 7)
25. 18 (Degree: 7)
26. 22 (Degree: 7)
27. 6 (Degree: 8)
28. 9 (Degree: 8)
29. 23 (Degree: 8)
30. 28 (Degree: 9)
