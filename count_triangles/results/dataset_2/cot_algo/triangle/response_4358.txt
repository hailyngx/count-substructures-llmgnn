Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 17) (2, 9) (2, 13) (18, 15) (18, 4) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 16) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (4, 18) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 11) (19, 5) (19, 4) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 16) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 10) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (0, 3) (0, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 17) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 9) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (10, 6) (10, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, ..., 19

Edges: 
(0, 3), (0, 9),
(1, 12), (1, 13),
(2, 9), (2, 13),
(3, 0), (3, 7), (3, 9), (3, 15),
(4, 6), (4, 11), (4, 18), (4, 19),
(5, 6), (5, 14), (5, 16), (5, 19),
(6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 10), (6, 12),
(7, 3), (7, 11), (7, 13), (7, 14),
(9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 14),
(10, 6), (10, 16),
(11, 4), (11, 7), (11, 17),
(12, 1), (12, 6), (12, 16),
(13, 1), (13, 2), (13, 7),
(14, 5), (14, 6), (14, 7), (14, 9), (14, 15),
(15, 3), (15, 14), (15, 17), (15, 18),
(16, 5), (16, 10), (16, 12),
(17, 11), (17, 15),
(18, 4), (18, 15),
(19, 4), (19, 5)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Sorted vertices by degree: (0, 1, 2, 10, 13, 18), (7, 11, 12, 16, 17, 19), (4, 5), (3, 9), (6, 14), (15)

Number of triangles: [35]

Unique triangles: 
<7, 3, 11>, 
<1, 12, 16>, 
<4, 11, 17>, 
<13, 1, 12>, 
<5, 14, 6>, 
<0, 3, 9>, 
<3, 7, 11>, 
<6, 10, 16>, 
<4, 18, 15>, 
<2, 9, 3>, 
<5, 16, 12>, 
<6, 14, 7>, 
<9, 14, 6>, 
<2, 13, 7>, 
<4, 11, 7>, 
<6, 4, 19>, 
<0, 9, 3>, 
<6, 12, 1>, 
<5, 14, 15>, 
<5, 19, 4>, 
<14, 9, 3>, 
<4, 6, 5>, 
<5, 19, 4>, 
<9, 3, 0>, 
<9, 2, 13>, 
<15, 14, 5>, 
<17, 11, 4>, 
<16, 12, 6>,
