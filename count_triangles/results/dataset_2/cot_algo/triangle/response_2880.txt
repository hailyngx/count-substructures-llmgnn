Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 18) (9, 17) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 17) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 19) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 4) (11, 3) (11, 15) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 12) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 15) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 4) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 16) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 4) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 18) (7, 2) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 4) (16, 7) (18, 9) (18, 7) (15, 11) (15, 17) (2, 0) (2, 7) (10, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. Let's label the vertices accordingly:

Vertices by their degrees:
(0: 2), (1: 4), (2: 2), (3: 5), (4: 5), (5: 4), (6: 3), (7: 4), (8: 3), (9: 2), (10: 1), (11: 2), (12: 4), (13: 3), (14: 2), (15: 2), (16: 4), (17: 4), (18: 2), (19: 3)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Then, we will look for shared connections to count the triangles.

Using this method, the total number of triangles is [17]. 

Unique triangles found are:
<1, 5, 12>
<3, 4, 16>
<4, 12, 16>
<3, 8, 16>
<3, 11, 15>
<4, 13, 16>
<3, 11, 17>
<7, 14, 16>
<7, 14, 19>
<5, 12, 17>
<3, 4, 19>
<5, 8, 17>
<11, 15, 17>
<8, 16, 17>
<5, 12, 19>
<1, 13, 17>
<1, 12, 13>
