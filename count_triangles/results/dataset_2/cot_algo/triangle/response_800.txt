Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 12) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 2) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 13) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 10) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 14) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10)
(9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0)
(4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11)
(7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8)
(1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12)
(3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2)
(2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 12)
(8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 0)
(0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 13)
(12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 2)
(11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 13)
(14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 10)
(6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13)
(13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 6)
(10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 14)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices with their degrees are as follows:
(3, 2) <3>
(5, 4, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14) <5>
(1, 7, 9, 13) <6>
(0, 10) <7>

Now, let's count the triangles:
- For vertex 3:
  - No triangles can be formed.

- For vertex 5:
  - No triangles can be formed.

- For vertex 4:
  - No triangles can be formed.

- For vertex 6:
  - No triangles can be formed.

- For vertex 8:
  - No triangles can be formed.

- For vertex 11:
  - No triangles can be formed.

- For vertex 12:
  - No triangles can be formed.

- For vertex 14:
  - No triangles can be formed.

- For vertex 1:
  - Triangle <1, 0, 13>

- For vertex 7:
  - No triangles can be formed.

- For vertex 9:
  - Triangle <9, 0, 5>

- For vertex 13:
  - No triangles can be formed.

- For vertex 2:
  - Triangle <2, 1, 0>
  - Triangle <2, 1, 13>
  - Triangle <2, 3, 10>
  - Triangle <2, 9, 7>

- For vertex 10:
  - Triangle <10, 5, 9>

- For vertex 0:
  - No triangles can be formed.

Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 0, 13>
<9, 0, 5>
<2, 1, 0>
<2, 1, 13>
<2, 3, 10>
<2, 9, 7>
<10, 5, 9>
