Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 7) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 16) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 13) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 2) (11, 19) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 19) (15, 8) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 12) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 16) (7, 17) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 6) (10, 0) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 3) (17, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 19) (2, 14) (2, 6) (18, 12) (18, 13) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 18) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 18) (6, 16) (6, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. 
Here are the vertices labeled from 0 to 19 based on their degree:
Vertices sorted by degree: 
(11,19), (18), (6), (2), (0,4), (1,5,8,14,18), (7,16), (12), (3,9,10,15,17), (13)

Let's count the triangles based on the given edges and the degree-based ordering:
