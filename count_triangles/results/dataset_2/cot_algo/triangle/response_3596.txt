Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- 0: {6, 9, 8, 2, 3, 1}
- 1: {6, 8, 5, 0}
- 2: {4, 7, 9, 0, 3}
- 3: {4, 7, 0, 2}
- 4: {7, 8, 3, 2}
- 5: {8, 1}
- 6: {1, 0}
- 7: {4, 3, 8, 9, 2}
- 8: {4, 7, 5, 0, 1}
- 9: {7, 2, 0}

Degree-Based Ordering:
Vertices sorted by degree: [5, 6, 9, 1, 5, 3, 4, 0, 5, 3]
Relabeled vertices: {5: 0, 6: 1, 9: 2, 1: 3, 5: 4, 3: 5, 4: 6, 0: 7, 5: 8, 3: 9}
