Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows:
0 (degree 3), 7 (degree 3), 10 (degree 3), 14 (degree 3), 18 (degree 3), 9 (degree 3), 25 (degree 2), 1 (degree 4), 4 (degree 3), 8 (degree 4), 17 (degree 2), 19 (degree 4), 21 (degree 3), 29 (degree 2), 24 (degree 4), 26 (degree 3), 3 (degree 4), 6 (degree 4), 11 (degree 4), 20 (degree 4), 2 (degree 4), 15 (degree 3), 5 (degree 3), 28 (degree 4), 27 (degree 3), 22 (degree 4), 12 (degree 4), 13 (degree 3), 23 (degree 4).
