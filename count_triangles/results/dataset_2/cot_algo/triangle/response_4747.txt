Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 19) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 5) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 1) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 13) (8, 19) (9, 11) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 8) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 11) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 6) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 13) (15, 0) (4, 13) (4, 6) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 6) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (6, 4) (6, 13) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 15, 19, and 13.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 18, and 13.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 18, 1, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 14, 16, 5, and 12.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 13 and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 11, 18, 3, and 13.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 16, 4, and 13.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 14, 10, 11.
- Node 8 is connected to node 19.
- Node 9 is connected to node 11.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 12, and 7.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 7, 19, 9, 5, and 1.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 10, 3, and 13.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 12, 6, 18.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 17, 3, 7.
- Node 15 is connected to node 0.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 17, 3, 6.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 14, 16, 19.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 1.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 17, 11, 0, 8.

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:

Nodes with degree 1: 15, 8, 9, 4
Nodes with degree 2: 7, 18, 5, 6
Nodes with degree 3: 0, 2, 12, 17, 1, 16
Nodes with degree 4: 10, 13, 14, 3, 11, 19

Based on the labels, let's count the triangles:

Triangles:
<1, 15, 0>
<1, 13, 4>
<2, 12, 3>
<2, 18, 5>
<3, 14, 7>
<5, 18, 6>
<7, 11, 10>
<13, 18, 1>
<13, 6, 4>
<16, 17, 14>
<17, 19, 11>

Total number of triangles: [11]
