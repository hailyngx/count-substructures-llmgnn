Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 22) (25, 12) (25, 4) (25, 14) (25, 24) (22, 3) (22, 23) (22, 7) (23, 22) (23, 6) (12, 25) (12, 2) (12, 24) (27, 28) (27, 16) (28, 27) (28, 9) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 11) (17, 16) (17, 2) (26, 16) (13, 5) (13, 15) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 21) (20, 29) (20, 18) (20, 11) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 8) (16, 27) (16, 17) (16, 26) (16, 0) (16, 4) (2, 12) (2, 17) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 21) (9, 28) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 19) (18, 20) (18, 9) (18, 21) (7, 3) (7, 22) (7, 6) (7, 8) (15, 13) (15, 9) (19, 29) (19, 9) (19, 4) (21, 5) (21, 2) (21, 18) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 14) (1, 5) (1, 10) (14, 25) (14, 8) (6, 23) (6, 7) (6, 4) (4, 25) (4, 16) (4, 19) (4, 6) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 10) (11, 29) (11, 20) (11, 0) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 24) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges (sorted by node label): 
(0, 8), (0, 11), (0, 16), (1, 5), (1, 10), (2, 5), (2, 10), (2, 12), (2, 17), (2, 21), (3, 7), (3, 22), (4, 6), (4, 16), (4, 19), (4, 25), (5, 8), (5, 13), (5, 21), (6, 7), (6, 23), (7, 8), (7, 22), (9, 15), (9, 18), (9, 19), (9, 28), (10, 1), (10, 2), (10, 24), (11, 0), (11, 20), (11, 29), (12, 2), (12, 24), (12, 25), (13, 15), (14, 8), (14, 25), (15, 9), (16, 0), (16, 4), (16, 17), (16, 26), (16, 27), (17, 2), (17, 16), (18, 9), (18, 20), (18, 21), (19, 4), (19, 9), (19, 29), (20, 11), (20, 18), (20, 29), (21, 2), (21, 5), (21, 18), (22, 3), (22, 7), (22, 23), (23, 6), (23, 22), (24, 10), (24, 12), (24, 25), (25, 4), (25, 14), (25, 24), (25, 12), (26, 16), (27, 16), (27, 28), (28, 9), (28, 27), (29, 11), (29, 19), (29, 20)

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we label the nodes from least to most connections: 
Labels: 
0-1, 1-5, 2-5, 3-2, 4-4, 5-5, 6-3, 7-4, 8-4, 9-5, 10-3, 11-4, 12-3, 13-2, 14-2, 15-3, 16-6, 17-2, 18-3, 19-4, 20-3, 21-3, 22-3, 23-2, 24-4, 25-4, 26-1, 27-2, 28-2, 29-4
