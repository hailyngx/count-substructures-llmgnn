Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 11) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 0) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 15) (6, 10) (6, 11) (18, 3) (18, 13) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 10) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 0) (7, 3) (13, 18) (13, 19) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 19) (2, 16) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 3) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 9) (19, 13) (19, 16) (9, 11) (9, 15) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 9) (10, 6) (10, 1) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:
```
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: {(14, 17), (14, 8), (14, 5), (17, 1), (17, 3), (17, 11), (4, 8), (4, 1), (4, 15), (8, 16), (8, 15), (8, 0), (5, 12), (5, 15), (6, 10), (6, 11), (18, 13), (1, 16), (1, 10), (0, 7), (7, 3), (13, 19), (16, 2), (16, 19), (2, 11), (12, 3), (3, 7), (11, 9), (19, 13), (9, 15)}
```

Degree-Based Ordering:
```
Node Degrees: {0: 3, 1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 5, 4: 3, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 2, 8: 5, 9: 2, 10: 2, 11: 4, 12: 2, 13: 2, 14: 3, 15: 4, 16: 5, 17: 4, 18: 2, 19: 2}
Sorted Nodes based on Degrees: [2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 18, 19, 0, 1, 4, 5, 14, 11, 15, 17, 3, 8, 16]
```

Now, we will count the triangles:

Triangles: [33]
