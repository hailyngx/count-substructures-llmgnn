Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 0), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (0, 3), (0, 8), (7, 2), (7, 8), (7, 1), (1, 7), (1, 2), (1, 8), (3, 0), (8, 7)

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degrees in non-decreasing order:
Nodes by degree: 3, 7, 2, 0, 4, 8, 9, 1, 6, 5

After relabeling the nodes, the edges to consider in the Degree-Based Ordering method are:
(0, 3), (0, 8), (1, 7), (3, 0), (4, 5), (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 5), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 8), (8, 0)

Counting the triangles formed by the shared connections between the vertices in each edge:
Triangles: <0, 3, 8>, <4, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
