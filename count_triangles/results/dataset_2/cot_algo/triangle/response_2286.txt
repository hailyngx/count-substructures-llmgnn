Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method aids in counting triangles efficiently in large graphs. Let's proceed step by step:

1. The degrees of each node:
   - Node 0: degree 5
   - Node 1: degree 4
   - Node 2: degree 5
   - Node 3: degree 5
   - Node 4: degree 4
   - Node 5: degree 5
   - Node 6: degree 4
   - Node 7: degree 2
   - Node 8: degree 4
   - Node 9: degree 4

2. Sorting nodes by degree in ascending order:
   - Node 7, Node 1, Node 4, Node 8, and Node 9 have the lowest degrees.
   - Node 0, Node 6, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 5 have higher degrees.

3. Relabel the nodes based on their degree order:
   - Relabeled nodes: 
     - Node 7 (0), Node 1 (1), Node 4 (2), Node 8 (3), Node 9 (4), Node 0 (5), Node 6 (6), Node 2 (7), Node 3 (8), Node 5 (9)

4. Analyze the edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:
   - (7, 9) forms a triangle with common neighbor 4.
   - (1, 9) forms a triangle with common neighbor 4.
   - (4, 9) forms a triangle with common neighbor 1.
   - (8, 9) does not form a triangle.
   - (0, 1) forms a triangle with common neighbor 4.
   - (1, 4) does not form a triangle.
   - (1, 7) does not form a triangle.

5. Calculating the total number of triangles:
   - Total number of triangles: [3]

6. Unique triangles found:
   - <1, 4, 9>
   - <1, 7, 9>
   - <0, 1, 4>
