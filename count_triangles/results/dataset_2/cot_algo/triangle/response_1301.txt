Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 3) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 12) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 3) (13, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree, from least connected to most connected. Here is the list of sorted vertices based on the number of connections (degree):

Vertices sorted by degree:
0 (5 edges)
1 (5 edges)
13 (2 edges)
14 (4 edges)
7 (3 edges)
11 (4 edges)
12 (4 edges)
3 (5 edges)
10 (3 edges)
2 (5 edges)
6 (3 edges)
9 (4 edges)
8 (4 edges)
4 (5 edges)
5 (3 edges)

Now, we will count the triangles based on the given edges:

Triangles:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 9, 1>
<0, 9, 12>
<0, 4, 11>
<0, 4, 12>
<1, 10, 9>
<1, 10, 5>
<1, 14, 2>
<2, 7, 3>
<2, 7, 14>
<2, 11, 14>
<2, 12, 1>
<3, 7, 2>
<3, 7, 14>
<3, 8, 4>
<3, 8, 14>
<4, 7, 3>
<4, 8, 12>
<4, 11, 14>
<5, 6, 10>
<6, 5, 9>
<8, 4, 12>
<11, 4, 14>

Total number of triangles: [23]
