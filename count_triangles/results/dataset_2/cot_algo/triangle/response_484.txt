Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Constructed graph with nodes and edges:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges:
(5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 4), (9, 7), (9, 0), 
(4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), 
(7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 2), 
(1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 2), 
(3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 8), 
(2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 6), (2, 0), 
(8, 7), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 6), 
(6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 8), 
(0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 2)

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method: 

Sorted nodes by degree:
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 7
Node 2: Degree 6

Triangles found: 
<2, 5, 7>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 6>

Total number of triangles: [3]
