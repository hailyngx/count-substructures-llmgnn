Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 15) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 19) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 7) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 0) (2, 4) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 0) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 15) (1, 0) (1, 17) (17, 9) (17, 8) (17, 1) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 14) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 19) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 16) (16, 12) (16, 7) (3, 14) (3, 19) (6, 18) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 3) 

Response:
After constructing the graph and relabeling the nodes based on their degree, the sorted vertices are:
Nodes: 16 5 6 3 1 9 13 7 8 17 15 2 0 18 4 11 10 12 14 19

The edges between the nodes are:
(5, 12) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 17) (13, 15) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 19) (11, 7) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 6) (0, 14) (14, 3) (1, 17) (17, 1) (15, 14) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 16) (7, 16) (3, 19)

Now, let's count the triangles. 

The total number of triangles is: [8]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 14, 3>
<0, 14, 7>
<0, 4, 12>
<2, 9, 18>
<7, 11, 16>
<10, 11, 15>
<10, 4, 19>
