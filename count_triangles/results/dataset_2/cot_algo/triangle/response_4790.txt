Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 2) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 14) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. The vertices will be relabeled accordingly.

The sorted vertices and their connections are:
0: (14, 6, 3, 13)
1: (12, 10, 2, 13)
2: (13, 1, 3, 5, 7
3: (0, 11, 2)
4: (6, 10, 12)
5: (2, 7, 8)
6: (0, 4, 14)
7: (2, 7, 10, 13, 14)
8: (5, 9, 10)
9: (8, 11, 12)
10: (1, 4, 7, 8, 11)
11: (3, 9, 10, 12)
12: (1, 4, 9, 11, 14)
13: (0, 1, 2, 7, 13)
14: (0, 6, 7, 12, 13)

Now, we will count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 26]

<0, 6, 14>
<0, 3, 13>
<0, 13, 14>
<1, 12, 13>
<1, 12, 14>
<1, 13, 14>
<2, 7, 13>
<2, 7, 14>
<2, 13, 14>
<4, 6, 14>
<4, 10, 12>
<4, 10, 11>
<4, 10, 1>
<4, 11, 12>
<4, 10, 1>
<6, 10, 12>
<6, 0, 14>
<7, 10, 13>
<7, 10, 14>
<7, 13, 14>
<10, 11, 12>
<10, 11, 3>
<10, 11, 1>
<11, 12, 14>
