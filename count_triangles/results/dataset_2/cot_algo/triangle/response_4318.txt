Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) 

Response:
Given graph information:  
- Number of nodes: 10  
- Number of edges: 40  
Edges in the graph: (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 7), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 0), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 0), (1, 8), (3, 9), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 8), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 8), (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 7), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 3), (0, 9), (0, 1)  

Now, let's find the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices by their degree (number of connections):  
0 (Degree 2)  
4 (Degree 2)  
2 (Degree 4)  
5 (Degree 4)  
9 (Degree 4)  
6 (Degree 4)  
7 (Degree 5)  
8 (Degree 5)  
1 (Degree 6)  
3 (Degree 7)  

Sorted vertices after relabeling based on degree:  
0 (1)  
4 (2)  
2 (3)  
5 (4)  
9 (5)  
6 (6)  
7 (7)  
8 (8)  
1 (9)  
3 (10)  

Triangles found:

<0, 5, 7>  
<0, 5, 1>  
<0, 5, 8>  
<2, 5, 1>
