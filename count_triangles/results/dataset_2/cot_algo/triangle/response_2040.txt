Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 13) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18) (13, 1) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (4, 18) (4, 2) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 19) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 14) (15, 9) (15, 7) (15, 12) (12, 8) (12, 15) (12, 0) (7, 16) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 19) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Let's do that with the given graph:

Vertices sorted by degree:
0 -> 4
1 -> 3
2 -> 2
4 -> 2
5 -> 4
6 -> 2
8 -> 4
9 -> 5
10 -> 3
11 -> 2
12 -> 3
13 -> 2
14 -> 2
15 -> 3
16 -> 3
17 -> 4
18 -> 4
19 -> 3

Now, we will go through each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections and count the triangles:

Triangles:
[15]

Therefore, there is one triangle in the given graph, and the list of unique triangles found is <0, 12, 15>.
