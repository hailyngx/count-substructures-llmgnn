Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 14) (1, 28) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 8) (21, 25) (21, 22) (8, 21) (8, 13) (8, 26) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 14) (13, 18) (23, 11) (23, 7) (23, 0) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 11) (20, 15) (20, 16) (17, 19) (17, 18) (29, 0) (29, 22) (29, 10) (26, 1) (26, 8) (26, 5) (26, 3) (5, 26) (11, 23) (11, 15) (11, 22) (11, 4) (25, 21) (25, 13) (27, 21) (3, 26) (3, 28) (3, 22) (28, 1) (28, 3) (28, 9) (6, 24) (6, 18) (6, 16) (6, 12) (6, 4) (24, 6) (24, 16) (24, 0) (24, 9) (12, 6) (12, 9) (18, 13) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 10) (19, 15) (19, 17) (7, 23) (16, 20) (16, 6) (16, 24) (16, 10) (0, 23) (0, 15) (0, 29) (0, 24) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 4) (22, 21) (22, 29) (22, 11) (22, 3) (10, 29) (10, 18) (10, 16) (9, 28) (9, 24) (9, 12) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in non-decreasing order. The vertices will be relabeled accordingly:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 7: degree 1
Node 5: degree 2
Node 17: degree 2
Node 20: degree 2
Node 27: degree 2
Node 28: degree 2
Node 29: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 19: degree 3
Node 22: degree 3
Node 18: degree 4
Node 25: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 15: degree 4
Node 10: degree 5
Node 24: degree 5
Node 26: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5
Node 21: degree 5
Node 9: degree 6
Node 1: degree 6
Node 0: degree 6
Node 23: degree 6

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.

Total number of triangles: [36]
