Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 0) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is: 
1. Node 7 (Degree 1) 
2. Node 5 (Degree 2) 
3. Node 8 (Degree 4) 
4. Node 2 (Degree 4) 
5. Node 1 (Degree 4) 
6. Node 9 (Degree 4) 
7. Node 3 (Degree 4) 
8. Node 0 (Degree 6) 
9. Node 4 (Degree 6) 
10. Node 6 (Degree 10) 

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now go through the edges to count the triangles. 

The total number of triangles is [13]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 5> 
<0, 2, 6> 
<0, 3, 6> 
<0, 4, 6> 
<0, 5, 6> 
<0, 4, 9> 
<0, 8, 9> 
<2, 4, 8> 
<2, 5, 6> 
<4, 6, 8> 
<4, 8, 9> 
<5, 2, 6> 
<6, 0, 4>
