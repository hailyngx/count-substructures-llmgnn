Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 2) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (11, 8) (11, 0) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 3) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 14) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections). 

After sorting the vertices from the least connected to the most connected, we get the following order: 
Node 11 (Degree: 2) --> Node 2 (Degree: 3) --> Node 12 (Degree: 4) --> Node 1 (Degree: 4) --> Node 14 (Degree: 4) --> Node 0 (Degree: 5) --> Node 10 (Degree: 5) --> Node 6 (Degree: 5) --> Node 8 (Degree: 5) --> Node 7 (Degree: 5) --> Node 9 (Degree: 5) --> Node 5 (Degree: 6) --> Node 4 (Degree: 6) --> Node 3 (Degree: 6) --> Node 13 (Degree: 6)

Following the principle that for each edge, we only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles as follows:

- Node 11: No triangles since it only has 2 connections.
- Node 2: No triangles since it only has 3 connections.
- Node 12: No triangles since Node 2 and Node 11 have fewer connections.
- Node 1: No triangles since Node 2, Node 11, and Node 12 have fewer connections.
- Node 14: No triangles since Node 2, Node 11, and Node 12 have fewer connections.
- Node 0: Triangles: <5, 8, 9> and <5, 7, 4>
- Node 10: Triangles: <0, 12, 2> and <3, 12, 10>
- Node 6: Triangles: <5, 9, 13> and <5, 9, 6>
- Node 8: Triangles: <5, 9, 8> and <8, 1, 4>
- Node 7: Triangles: <5, 9, 7> and <5, 7, 1>
- Node 9: Triangles: <5, 9, 6> and <5, 9, 13>
- Node 5: Triangles: <5, 9, 8> and <5, 9, 13>
- Node 4: Triangles: <5, 9, 7> and <5, 7, 1>
- Node 3: Triangles: <6, 9, 13> and <6, 13, 4>
- Node 13: Triangles: <6, 9, 13> and <13, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [13]
Unique triangles found: <5, 8, 9>, <5, 7, 4>, <0, 12, 2>, <3, 12, 10>, <5, 9, 13>, <5, 9, 6>, <8, 1, 4>, <5, 9, 7>, <5, 7, 1>, <6, 9, 13>, <6, 13, 4>.
