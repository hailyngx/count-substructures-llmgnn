Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 14) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 16) (3, 1) (3, 9) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 0) (4, 16) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 17) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 8) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 6) (15, 11) (15, 2) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 0) (12, 4) (6, 19) (6, 7) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 10) (10, 2) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 13) (9, 3) (9, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 17) (17, 4) (17, 7) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 10) (14, 16) (14, 2) (14, 4) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles in the provided graph is as follows:

1. The vertices and their degrees:
   - Vertex 0: 3
   - Vertex 1: 3
   - Vertex 2: 4
   - Vertex 3: 3
   - Vertex 4: 5
   - Vertex 5: 3
   - Vertex 6: 2
   - Vertex 7: 3
   - Vertex 8: 3
   - Vertex 9: 2
   - Vertex 10: 4
   - Vertex 11: 2
   - Vertex 12: 1
   - Vertex 13: 3
   - Vertex 14: 3
   - Vertex 15: 2
   - Vertex 16: 5
   - Vertex 17: 2
   - Vertex 18: 3
   - Vertex 19: 4

2. Sorting vertices by degrees:
   - Vertices in increasing order of degrees: 12, 6, 9, 11, 15, 17, 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 13, 18, 19, 2, 4, 14, 16, 10

3. Counting triangles using the method described:
   - Triangles found: <0, 2, 14>, <0, 8, 10>, <0, 8, 19>, <0, 10, 13>, <1, 3, 13>, <4, 14, 16>, <4, 14, 18>, <4, 16, 18>, <4, 16, 14>, <5, 8, 19>, <5, 19, 13>, <5, 19, 10>, <8, 10, 19>, <10, 13, 19>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
