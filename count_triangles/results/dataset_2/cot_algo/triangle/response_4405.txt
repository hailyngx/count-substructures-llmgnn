Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 17) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 8) (27, 14) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 6) (25, 23) (22, 0) (22, 6) (22, 10) (23, 25) (23, 17) (23, 29) (5, 9) (5, 29) (5, 11) (5, 21) (9, 25) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 13) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 28) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 28) (7, 17) (12, 7) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 21) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 13) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 14) (8, 0) (8, 20) (13, 9) (13, 18) (26, 10) (26, 29) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 1) (19, 15) (19, 10) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 1) (17, 15) (17, 25) (17, 23) (17, 7) (10, 22) (10, 7) (10, 26) (10, 19) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 16) (21, 5) (21, 4) (21, 24) (24, 21) (6, 25) (6, 22) (6, 29) (29, 23) (29, 5) (29, 26) (29, 6) (28, 20) (28, 7) (28, 14) (14, 27) (14, 2) (14, 28) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed based on the edges provided:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
- 0: {20, 22, 8}
- 1: {2, 11, 16}
- 2: {1, 14, 16}
- 3: {15, 25, 11, 18}
- 4: {9, 18, 21}
- 5: {9, 29, 11, 21}
- 6: {22, 25, 29}

... and so on for all nodes.

By sorting the nodes based on their degree from lowest to highest, we get the following order: 
Nodes with degree 1: {12, 24, 27}
Nodes with degree 2: {13, 19, 23, 26}
Nodes with degree 3: {0, 1, 6, 10, 12, 20, 21, 24, 26, 28}
Nodes with degree 4: {2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18}
Nodes with degree 5: {3, 9, 11, 22, 25, 29}
Node with degree 6: {10}

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we count the triangles and find the unique triangles: 

Total number of triangles: [14]
Unique triangles: 
<3, 15, 17>
<3, 15, 19>
<3, 17, 23>
<3, 17, 25>
<3, 17, 7>
<3, 18, 25>
<3, 9, 25>
<3, 11, 5>
<3, 11, 6>
<3, 11, 7>
<3, 11, 19>
<15, 17, 19>
<15, 17, 7>
<15, 23, 25>
