Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 10) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 13) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:
Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
Edges: (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 0), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 14), (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 12), (6, 0), (7, 11), (7, 2), (7, 8), (12, 6), (12, 4), (12, 10), (12, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 14), (0, 1), (0, 13), (14, 9), (14, 0), (14, 1), (14, 4), (14, 10), (2, 9), (2, 7), (2, 1), (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 7), (8, 1), (3, 11), (3, 13), (11, 7), (11, 3), (11, 13), (11, 4), (4, 12), (4, 14), (4, 11), (4, 10), (1, 12), (1, 0), (1, 14), (1, 2), (1, 8), (10, 6), (10, 12), (10, 14), (10, 4), (10, 13),...
Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
Degree 1: [3, 13]
Degree 2: [5, 7, 11]
Degree 3: [2, 3, 4, 8]
Degree 4: [1, 10, 12]
Degree 5: [0, 9, 14]
Degree 6: [6]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles. 
After analyzing the graph, the total number of triangles is found to be [9]. 
The unique triangles are <0, 1, 14>, <0, 4, 10>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 12>, <4, 10, 14>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 10, 12>, <6, 12, 14>.
