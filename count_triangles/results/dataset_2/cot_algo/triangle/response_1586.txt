Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph using Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices in ascending order of connections:
Node 5 - Degree 2
Node 1 - Degree 3
Node 2 - Degree 3
Node 7 - Degree 3
Node 8 - Degree 4
Node 9 - Degree 4
Node 3 - Degree 5
Node 4 - Degree 5
Node 6 - Degree 6
Node 0 - Degree 6

Next, we will go through each edge and check for triangles:

Edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
(5, 0) - Forms a triangle with (0, 4) and (4, 5)

(1, 6) - Forms a triangle with (1, 3) and (3, 6)

(3, 2) - Forms a triangle with (2, 7) and (7, 3)

(1, 0) - Forms a triangle with (0, 4) and (4, 1)

(3, 1) - Forms a triangle with (1, 6) and (6, 3)

(6, 4) - Forms a triangle with (4, 7) and (7, 6)

(6, 3) - Forms a triangle with (3, 9) and (9, 6)

(6, 1) - Forms a triangle with (1, 7) and (7, 6)

(6, 8) - Forms a triangle with (8, 4) and (4, 6)

(9, 0) - Forms a triangle with (0, 4) and (4, 9)

(9, 3) - Forms a triangle with (3, 6) and (6, 9)

(9, 2) - Forms a triangle with (2, 7) and (7, 9)

(0, 5) - Forms a triangle with (5, 4) and (4, 0)

(0, 1) - Forms a triangle with (1, 6) and (6, 0)

(0, 8) - Forms a triangle with (8, 4) and (4, 0)

Total number of triangles: [15]

Unique triangles:

<1, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 0>
<1, 6, 3>
<4, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
