Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 8) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 19) (9, 18) (9, 12) (14, 19) (17, 8) (17, 15) (4, 12) (4, 2) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 1) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 15) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 1) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 15) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 15) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 0) (1, 16) (1, 8) (1, 12) (0, 13) (0, 19) (10, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 3) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 5) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 0) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes connected by edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 13, 19
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8, 12, 16
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, 13, 16
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 12
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 13, 15
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 10, 18, 19
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 11, 12, 15
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 16, 17
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 12, 18
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 7, 16
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 19
- Node 14 is connected to node 19
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 17, 18
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, 11
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 8, 15
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 15
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 13, 14

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
- Node 10, 14 have degree 1
- Node 0, 4, 9, 17 have degree 2
- Node 1, 2, 5, 6, 11 have degree 3
- Node 7, 8, 18 have degree 4
- Node 3, 13, 15, 16, 19 have degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider each edge where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:

After checking all edges and shared connections, we find the total number of triangles to be [14].
The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 12, 16>, <3, 5, 13>, <1, 8, 16>, <3, 7, 15>, <1, 12, 7>, <3, 7, 15>, <3, 13, 5>, <3, 5, 15>, <6, 9, 18>, <6, 18, 19>, <8, 16, 1>, <11, 7, 12>, <13, 19, 0>, <15, 18, 5>.
