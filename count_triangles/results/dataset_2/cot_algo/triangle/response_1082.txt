Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 8) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 2) 

Response:
The graph constructed with the given nodes and edges is as follows:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Edges: {(5, 9), (5, 12), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 10), (9, 4), (9, 10), (9, 3), (9, 13), (1, 6), (1, 13), (1, 8), (3, 0), (3, 8), (3, 4), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 11), (11, 14), (14, 8), (2, 13), (8, 10)}

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degree:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 2

Based on the relabeled nodes, the edges to proceed with are:
- (5, 9), (5, 12), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 10), (9, 4), (9, 10), (9, 3), (9, 13), (1, 6), (1, 13), (1, 8), (3, 0), (3, 8), (3, 4), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 11), (11, 14), (14, 8), (2, 13), (8, 10)

After checking for shared connections between the nodes, the total number of triangles is [5].

The unique triangles found are:
- <9, 5, 4>
- <9, 5, 10>
- <5, 4, 10>
- <5, 1, 6>
- <3, 8, 10>
