Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 5) (11, 8) (12, 10) (27, 26) (27, 19) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 22) (29, 28) (29, 25) (29, 13) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 17) (3, 11) (3, 23) (3, 19) (16, 28) (16, 8) (26, 27) (26, 5) (26, 20) (23, 11) (23, 3) (23, 14) (23, 25) (21, 10) (21, 25) (1, 10) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 8) (15, 1) (15, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 26) (6, 19) (6, 20) (17, 18) (17, 0) (17, 24) (17, 22) (0, 4) (0, 17) (0, 22) (25, 10) (25, 29) (25, 23) (25, 21) (20, 26) (20, 6) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 7) (19, 27) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) (13, 29) (13, 15) (24, 1) (24, 17) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 7) (14, 4) (14, 23) (22, 28) (22, 17) (22, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the number of triangles in the graph provided. Let's start by sorting the vertices based on the number of connections they have:

Node 0 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 3
Node 4 has degree 5
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 2
Node 10 has degree 5
Node 11 has degree 5
Node 12 has degree 1
Node 13 has degree 2
Node 14 has degree 2
Node 15 has degree 2
Node 16 has degree 2
Node 17 has degree 4
Node 18 has degree 2
Node 19 has degree 4
Node 20 has degree 2
Node 21 has degree 2
Node 22 has degree 3
Node 23 has degree 4
Node 24 has degree 2
Node 25 has degree 4
Node 26 has degree 3
Node 27 has degree 2
Node 28 has degree 3
Node 29 has degree 3

Now, let's identify the triangles based on the edges and the sorted vertices:

[Count of triangles inside brackets - []]
Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 17>
<0, 4, 22>
<1, 8, 10>
<1, 8, 11>
<2, 4, 19>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 9, 7>
<3, 11, 23>
<4, 5, 26>
<10, 11, 25>
<11, 23, 25>
<17, 22, 28>
