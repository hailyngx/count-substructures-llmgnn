Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 7) (16, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 16) (7, 2) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 13) (15, 4) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 13) (10, 14) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 14) (19, 13) (19, 12) (18, 10) (18, 17) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 8) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 15) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 17) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 10) (13, 19) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 17) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their degrees (number of connections). 

After sorting the vertices, the new labels will be as follows:
0: 3 connections
5: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
18: 2 connections
17: 3 connections
12: 3 connections
19: 3 connections
10: 4 connections
4: 5 connections
8: 5 connections
6: 5 connections
9: 5 connections
16: 5 connections
1: 7 connections
3: 3 connections
14: 5 connections
15: 5 connections
13: 8 connections
2: 5 connections
11: 4 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now identify and count the number of triangles.
