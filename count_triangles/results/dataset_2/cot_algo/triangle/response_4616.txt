Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 0) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 11) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 9, 10, 8, 13, 14
- Node 1: 3, 2, 14, 7
- Node 2: 9, 1, 11
- Node 3: 5, 6, 1, 7, 13
- Node 4: 10, 12, 14
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 9, 3, 13
- Node 7: 1, 10, 11, 3
- Node 8: 9, 10, 13, 0, 12
- Node 9: 6, 8, 2, 0
- Node 10: 11, 0, 8, 7, 4
- Node 11: 10, 7, 2
- Node 12: 8, 13, 4, 14
- Node 13: 6, 3, 8, 12, 0
- Node 14: 1, 4, 0, 12

Using Degree-Based Ordering method, we will sort the nodes by their degree:
Nodes in increasing degree order: 5 2 4 11 6 12 1 7 14 9 3 13 8 0 10

Now, we will count the number of triangles:
- Triangle <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle <0, 8, 9>
- Triangle <0, 8, 13>
- Triangle <0, 9, 13>
- Triangle <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle <1, 3, 14>
- Triangle <1, 7, 11>
- Triangle <2, 9, 11>
- Triangle <4, 10, 12>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
