Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 9) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 14) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 14) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, 13, 14
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 11, 12
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 13, 14
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 14
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 10
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 11, 12, 13, 14
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 9, 11, 12
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 11, 12, 14
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 11, 12
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 8, 9, 10, 12
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 8, 9, 10
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, 14
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 13

After sorting the nodes by their degree from least to most, the nodes are relabeled as follows:
- Node 0 is relabeled to 6
- Node 2 is relabeled to 8
- Node 5 is relabeled to 1
- Node 3 is relabeled to 4
- Node 1 is relabeled to 9
- Node 4 is relabeled to 7
- Node 6 is relabeled to 3
- Node 7 is relabeled to 5
- Node 8 is relabeled to 2
- Node 9 is relabeled to 0
- Node 10 is relabeled to 10
- Node 11 is relabeled to 11
- Node 12 is relabeled to 12
- Node 13 is relabeled to 8
- Node 14 is relabeled to 13

Now, we can count the number of triangles and list them:

The total number of triangles is [10].
The unique triangles found are:
<6, 1, 0>
<6, 1, 9>
<7, 5, 1>
<7, 5, 14>
<7, 9, 0>
<2, 8, 3>
<2, 8, 12>
<4, 11, 12>
<11, 12, 9>
<11, 12, 14>
