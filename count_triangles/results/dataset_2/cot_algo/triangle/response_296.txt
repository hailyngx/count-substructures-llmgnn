Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 19) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 19) (29, 28) (29, 16) (29, 13) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 23) (1, 8) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 6) (17, 15) (20, 21) (20, 22) (20, 24) (21, 20) (21, 25) (15, 17) (15, 8) (15, 14) (7, 25) (7, 18) (7, 26) (25, 17) (25, 21) (25, 7) (25, 22) (25, 14) (8, 1) (8, 15) (8, 27) (19, 9) (19, 28) (13, 29) (13, 27) (26, 5) (26, 7) (26, 23) (0, 10) (0, 22) (10, 1) (10, 0) (16, 9) (16, 28) (16, 29) (11, 24) (11, 18) (11, 4) (14, 15) (14, 25) (14, 22) (14, 2) (24, 20) (24, 11) (24, 6) (6, 17) (6, 24) (6, 2) (6, 23) (23, 1) (23, 26) (23, 6) (23, 12) (22, 20) (22, 25) (22, 0) (22, 14) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 23) (12, 4) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 27) (27, 8) (27, 13) (27, 18) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. The sorted list of vertices and their connections is as follows:

0: 2, 10, 20, 22
1: 8, 10, 15, 17, 23
2: 4, 6, 14
4: 2, 4, 5, 11, 12
5: 4, 5, 9, 26
6: 2, 6, 17, 23, 24
7: 8, 18, 25, 26
8: 1, 8, 15, 27
9: 5, 9, 16, 19, 28
10: 0, 1, 10
11: 4, 11, 18, 24
12: 4, 12, 23
13: 13, 27, 29
14: 2, 14, 15, 22, 25
15: 8, 14, 15, 17
16: 9, 16, 28, 29
17: 1, 6, 15, 17, 25
18: 7, 11, 18, 27
19: 9, 19, 28
20: 0, 20, 21, 22, 24
21: 20, 21, 25
22: 0, 14, 20, 22, 25
23: 1, 6, 12, 23, 26
24: 6, 11, 20, 24
25: 14, 17, 21, 22, 25
26: 5, 7, 23, 26
27: 8, 13, 18, 27
28: 9, 16, 19, 28, 29
29: 13, 16, 28, 29

Using this ordering, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [162]. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 17, 25>
<7, 25, 18>
<9, 19, 28>
<10, 1, 17>
<10, 1, 23>
<11, 18, 27>
<14, 22, 25>
<15, 14, 25>
<15, 17, 25>
<16, 19, 28>
<22, 14, 25>
<22, 20, 25>
<23, 6, 12>
<23, 6, 17>
<23, 1, 10>
<26, 5, 9>
<26, 7, 25>
<26, 23, 6>
