Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 15) (5, 17) (5, 11) (5, 16) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 3) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 19) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 16) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 15) (1, 17) (1, 18) (1, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 2) (11, 5) (11, 18) (11, 19) (11, 15) (19, 12) (19, 11) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(6, 3), (9, 8), (9, 10), (9, 12), (14, 17), (14, 0), (17, 14), (17, 1), (17, 5), (17, 15), (5, 17), (5, 11), (5, 16), (4, 18), (4, 13), (4, 16), (4, 3), (18, 4), (18, 11), (18, 1), (18, 13), (7, 12), (7, 15), (12, 9), (12, 7), (12, 19), (2, 8), (2, 1), (2, 13), (2, 16), (8, 9), (8, 2), (8, 3), (0, 14), (0, 10), (0, 15), (1, 17), (1, 18), (1, 2), (10, 9), (10, 0), (16, 5), (16, 4), (16, 2), (11, 5), (11, 18), (11, 19), (11, 15), (19, 12), (19, 11), (15, 17), (15, 7), (15, 0), (15, 11), (13, 4), (13, 18), (13, 2), (3, 6), (3, 4), (3, 8)

After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, the new labeling of the nodes is:
6, 9, 10, 14, 7, 3, 12, 13, 8, 0, 19, 11, 15, 16, 1, 17, 18, 4, 5, 2

Calculating the number of triangles based on the edge information and degree-based ordering, we find:
[14 triangles]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 14, 15>
<1, 17, 5>
<1, 17, 15>
<1, 18, 13>
<2, 13, 16>
<2, 13, 18>
<2, 16, 5>
<3, 4, 18>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 13, 18>
<5, 11, 15>
<5, 16, 2>
<7, 12, 15>
<11, 15, 17>
