Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 4) (16, 15) (5, 19) (5, 18) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 14) (3, 1) (3, 4) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 19) (0, 2) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 12) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 8) (19, 2) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 6) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 7) (12, 18) (12, 15) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 13) 

Response:
The graph given can be represented as follows:

Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 19) (0, 2)
(1, 9) (1, 3)
(2, 14) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 7)
(3, 14) (3, 1) (3, 4)
(4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 6)
(5, 19) (5, 18)
(6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 13)
(7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 2)
(8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 6)
(9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13)
(11, 0) (11, 4)
(12, 18) (12, 15)
(13, 9) (13, 6)
(14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 2)
(15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 12)
(16, 15)
(17, 14) (17, 7)
(18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 12)
(19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 8) (19, 2)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their degree:

Nodes by degree: 16 < 5 < 11 < 12 < 13 < 17 < 7 < 1 < 3 < 19 < 8 < 9 < 18 < 6 < 2 < 0 < 4 < 15 < 14

Since there are 60 edges in the graph, we can now start counting triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The total number of triangles is: [33]

The unique triangles found are:
<15, 6, 4>
<14, 9, 1>
<14, 9, 13>
<14, 9, 1>
<14, 2, 0>
<14, 2, 19>
<14, 2, 7>
<14, 0, 19>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 9, 3>
<0, 19, 2>
<0, 19, 2>
<0, 2, 19>
<0, 2, 19>
<17, 7, 15>
<17, 7, 2>
<18, 4, 6>
<19, 5, 18>
<8, 9, 6>
<8, 9, 4>
<8, 19, 2>
<7, 2, 14>
<3, 1, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
