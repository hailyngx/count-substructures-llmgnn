Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 6), (0, 13), (0, 23)
(1, 5), (1, 25)

(21, 16)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Relabel the nodes by their degree:
Nodes by degree: 
0: 4, 1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 4, 4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 4, 7: 2, 8: 3, 9: 1, 10: 4, 11: 2, 12: 1, 13: 3, 14: 2, 15: 2, 16: 2, 17: 1, 18: 2, 19: 1, 20: 1, 21: 2, 22: 1, 23: 1, 24: 1, 25: 2, 26: 2, 27: 2, 28: 2, 29: 2

2. Sort the nodes by degree: 
Nodes sorted by degree: 9, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26, 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21, 25, 27, 28, 29, 2, 6, 8, 3, 10, 13

3. Count the triangles based on the sorted nodes:
Total number of triangles: [16]

<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 25>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 1, 23>, <0, 6, 20>, <0, 6, 27>, <0, 6, 28>, <0, 13, 14>, <0, 13, 15>, <0, 13, 26>, <2, 6, 20>, <2, 6, 27>, <2, 6, 28>, <3, 8, 16>, <3, 8, 21>, <3, 8, 22>
