Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 19) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 7) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 14) (4, 17) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 15) (2, 16) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 5) (7, 13) (7, 10) (7, 15) (15, 6) (15, 7) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 3) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 18) (12, 16) (12, 14) (9, 18) (9, 14) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 17) (3, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: <1, 0, 7, 5, 9, 4, 6, 15, 3, 2, 12, 19, 8, 18, 16, 13, 10, 11, 17, 14>.

The total number of triangles in the graph is: [31]

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 18>, <0, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 8, 13>, <2, 8, 11>, <5, 6, 15>, <3, 14, 9>, <3, 14, 1>, <4, 17, 3>, <4, 17, 6>, <4, 17, 3>, <4, 6, 3>, <5, 18, 9>, <5, 18, 19>, <5, 18, 19>, <5, 18, 9>, <6, 15, 7>, <6, 15, 7>, <7, 15, 6>, <7, 15, 6>, <10, 14, 3>, <10, 14, 1>, <10, 14, 9>, <10, 14, 9>, <10, 14, 3>, <11, 8, 13>, <11, 8, 13>, <13, 16, 2>, <13, 16, 2>, <14, 10, 13>.
