Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 12) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 15) (1, 20) (1, 27) (21, 19) (21, 22) (21, 15) (6, 22) (6, 18) (9, 5) (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 29) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 18) (14, 17) (14, 3) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 4) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 23) (27, 1) (27, 2) (27, 3) (4, 8) (4, 17) (4, 20) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 21) (15, 20) (15, 28) (20, 1) (20, 17) (20, 4) (20, 15) (20, 26) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 27) (3, 25) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 29) (7, 2) (19, 11) (19, 21) (19, 23) (19, 18) (19, 24) (23, 0) (23, 25) (23, 19) (26, 20) (26, 29) (18, 6) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 29) (2, 13) (2, 27) (2, 7) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 24) (28, 15) (29, 5) (29, 25) (29, 26) (29, 18) (10, 12) (10, 22) (24, 19) (24, 12) (22, 16) (22, 21) (22, 6) (22, 10) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with 30 nodes and 90 edges.  
The Degree-Based Ordering method is applied to count the number of triangles in the graph:

Vertices sorted based on the number of connections:
(9) -  connect to: 5
(7) -  connect to: 2
(10) -  connect to: 12, 22
(1) -  connect to: 20, 27
(28) -  connect to: 15
(17) -  connect to: 4, 14, 20
(24) -  connect to: 12, 19
(14) -  connect to: 3, 17
(26) -  connect to: 20, 29
(0) -  connect to: 3, 16, 23
(6) -  connect to: 18, 22
(21) -  connect to: 15, 19, 22
(8) -  connect to: 4, 5, 13
(13) -  connect to: 2, 8, 18
(3) -  connect to: 0, 14, 25, 27
(4) -  connect to: 8, 17, 20
(12) -  connect to: 10, 11, 24
