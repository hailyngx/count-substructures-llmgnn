Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and the given 40 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 9)
(1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 0)
(2, 1), (2, 9)
(3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8)
(4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 9)
(5, 0), (5, 7), (5, 8)
(6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9)
(7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6)
(8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6)
(9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 6)

Next, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 3: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 6
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 6
Node 0: Degree 4

Now let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [15]
Unique triangles: <1, 6, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 7, 0>, <1, 0, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 7, 0>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 9, 0>, <4, 1, 7>, <5, 7, 0>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 0>, <8, 1, 6>
