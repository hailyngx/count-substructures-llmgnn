Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 0) (8, 4) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. After relabeling them accordingly, we can analyze the given graph:

The degrees of each vertex are as follows:
0: 4
1: 4
2: 4
3: 4
4: 7
5: 4
6: 2
7: 4
8: 1
9: 8

We will now analyze the edges based on the Degree-Based Ordering method. 
Starting from the edge with the lowest labeled vertex:
(0, 6) -> 0 and 6 have 4 connections in common (5, 3, 4, 9) <0, 6, 9>
Continuing this process for the remaining edges gives us the total number of triangles and the unique triangles:
Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4> <0, 1, 3> <0, 1, 5> <0, 3, 4> <1, 2, 3> <1, 2, 5> <1, 3, 7> <3, 4, 7>
