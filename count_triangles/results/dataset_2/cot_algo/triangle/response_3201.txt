Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 25) (20, 15) (20, 29) (20, 6) (19, 1) (19, 14) (19, 13) (26, 7) (21, 5) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 29) (13, 19) (13, 27) (4, 27) (27, 13) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 17) (27, 6) (7, 26) (7, 25) (7, 11) (25, 15) (25, 7) (25, 9) (25, 23) (25, 8) (8, 24) (8, 25) (8, 9) (8, 29) (9, 25) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 12) (10, 22) (10, 28) (10, 5) (29, 20) (29, 24) (29, 27) (29, 8) (12, 9) (12, 6) (16, 22) (16, 3) (16, 23) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 22) (11, 2) (1, 19) (1, 11) (1, 28) (0, 28) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 5) (28, 10) (28, 1) (28, 0) (28, 14) (28, 5) (14, 19) (14, 28) (2, 24) (2, 11) (2, 3) (5, 21) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 28) (18, 0) (18, 6) (22, 10) (22, 16) (22, 11) (17, 27) (17, 0) (23, 25) (23, 16) (3, 9) (3, 16) (3, 2) (6, 20) (6, 27) (6, 12) (6, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. Let's map the nodes to their corresponding degrees:

Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 16: 3 connections
Node 17: 3 connections
Node 18: 2 connections
Node 19: 3 connections
Node 20: 3 connections
Node 21: 1 connection
Node 22: 3 connections
Node 23: 2 connections
Node 24: 4 connections
Node 25: 5 connections
Node 26: 1 connection
Node 27: 5 connections
Node 28: 5 connections
Node 29: 5 connections

Next, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:

Nodes with degree 1: 21, 26
Nodes with degree 2: 4, 18, 23
Nodes with degree 3: 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24
Nodes with degree 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
Nodes with degree 5: 5, 6, 25, 27, 28, 29

Now, we will analyze the edges according to the relabeled vertices:

(4, 18), (23, 16), (14, 28) form a triangle.
(7, 25, 9) form a triangle.
(7, 25, 8) form a triangle.
(7, 25, 29) form a triangle.
(8, 24, 29), (8, 25, 29), (24, 29, 27) form a triangle.
(25, 8, 9) form a triangle.
(25, 9, 12) form a triangle.
(9, 12, 6) form a triangle.
(16, 22, 11) form a triangle.
(0, 28, 14), (0, 18, 6), (28, 14, 19) form a triangle.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10], and the unique triangles found are as follows: 
<4, 18, 23>
<7, 25, 9>
<7, 25, 8>
<7, 25, 29>
<8, 24, 29>
<8, 25, 29>
<24, 29, 27>
<25, 8, 9>
<25, 9, 12>
<9, 12, 6>
