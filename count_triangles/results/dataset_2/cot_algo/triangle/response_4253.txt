Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 8) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 8) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 14) (5, 1) (5, 11) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: [3, 8, 10, 11, 12]
- 1: [3, 5, 8, 11, 13]
- 2: [9, 10, 13]
- 3: [0, 1, 6, 10, 14]
- 4: [6, 7, 9, 13]
- 5: [1, 11]
- 6: [3, 4, 8, 11, 12, 14]
- 7: [4, 9, 10]
- 8: [0, 1, 6, 8, 12, 14]
- 9: [2, 4, 7]
- 10: [0, 2, 3, 7]
- 11: [1, 5, 6]
- 12: [0, 6, 8]
- 13: [1, 2, 4, 14]
- 14: [3, 6, 8, 13]

Now, counting triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
- [<3, 6, 14>]
- [<0, 6, 12>]
- [<1, 8, 13>]
- [<1, 6, 11>]
- [<6, 8, 14>]
- [<1, 3, 6>]
- [<0, 3, 8>]  

Total number of triangles: [7]
