Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
- 0: {28, 19, 12}
- 1: {8, 23, 5, 10}
- 2: {28, 14, 19}
- 3: {25, 7, 23}
- 4: {26}
- 5: {22, 29, 1, 27}
- 6: {16, 9}
- 7: {16, 3}
- 8: {16, 23, 10, 29, 1}
- 9: {13, 6, 17, 27}
- 10: {8, 24, 1}
- 11: {21}
- 12: {28, 0}
- 13: {22, 24, 9}
- 14: {22, 29, 2}
- 15: {22, 20}
- 16: {6, 8, 20, 7}
- 17: {9, 18}
- 18: {17, 19, 27}
- 19: {18, 2, 21, 24, 0}
- 20: {16, 15, 29}
- 21: {11, 19}
- 22: {13, 14, 5, 15}
- 23: {3, 8, 1, 24}
- 24: {13, 23, 19, 10}
- 25: {3, 26}
- 26: {25, 4}
- 27: {9, 18, 5}
- 28: {0, 2, 12}
- 29: {8, 20, 5, 14}

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes (in ascending order of degrees): 4, 11, 15, 17, 18, 21, 12, 26, 0, 2, 7, 25, 6, 16, 24, 29, 1, 5, 13, 14, 19, 27, 3, 8, 9, 20, 22, 23, 10, 28

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [51]

Unique triangles:
<5, 27, 9>
<0, 19, 28>
<8, 23, 1>
<3, 23, 7>
<5, 1, 29>
<6, 9, 13>
<8, 1, 10>
<9, 13, 22>
<9, 17, 18>
<2, 14, 29>
<13, 22, 15>
<16, 20, 29>
<16, 20, 8>
<16, 7, 3>
<19, 21, 11>
<19, 24, 10>

<19, 21, 24>
<22, 15, 20>
<22, 14, 29>
<22, 13, 24>
<23, 24, 10>
<16, 7, 3>
<18, 17, 9>
<27, 5, 29>
<27, 5, 22>
<0, 12, 28>
<2, 14, 28>
<16, 20, 15>
<23, 8, 1>
