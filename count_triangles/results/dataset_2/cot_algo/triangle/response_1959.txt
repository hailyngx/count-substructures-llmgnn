Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. The sorted vertices from least to most connected are: (9, 7, 0, 5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 8, 6).

After sorting the vertices, we will examine each edge and count the triangles formed by shared connections.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [12].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 1>, <2, 5, 0>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 7, 6>, <4, 8, 9>.
