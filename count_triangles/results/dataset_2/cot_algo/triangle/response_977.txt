Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 24) (22, 3) (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 6) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 2) (1, 9) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 9) (18, 22) (18, 19) (4, 13) (4, 8) (4, 23) (4, 14) (8, 4) (2, 1) (2, 20) (0, 16) (0, 28) (0, 12) (14, 11) (14, 4) (5, 26) (5, 23) (19, 18) (19, 25) (19, 28) (19, 23) (20, 2) (20, 29) (20, 3) (20, 9) (20, 23) (29, 1) (29, 20) (29, 6) (29, 15) (25, 19) (25, 15) (10, 21) (10, 26) (26, 5) (26, 10) (26, 15) (26, 27) (6, 16) (6, 29) (6, 17) (17, 6) (17, 27) (23, 4) (23, 5) (23, 19) (23, 20) (23, 24) (12, 11) (12, 0) (15, 29) (15, 25) (15, 26) (15, 24) (28, 22) (28, 0) (28, 19) (9, 1) (9, 21) (9, 20) (9, 24) (27, 21) (27, 26) (27, 17) (3, 22) (3, 20) (24, 22) (24, 23) (24, 15) (24, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will involve the following steps:
1. Sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections)
2. Relabel the vertices accordingly
3. For each edge, check if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections
4. Count the triangles formed by shared connections

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
(0, 1, 2, 9, 19, 18, 4, 20, 10, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 11, 6, 23, 5, 3, 8, 12, 15, 17, 22, 14, 26, 16, 13)

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the provided graph, the total number of triangles found is [12]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 8, 23>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 21>, <1, 9, 21>, <19, 20, 23>, <19, 20, 28>, <10, 21, 27>, <10, 21, 9>, <15, 24, 9>, <15, 24, 23>, <5, 15, 26>, <22, 3, 20>
