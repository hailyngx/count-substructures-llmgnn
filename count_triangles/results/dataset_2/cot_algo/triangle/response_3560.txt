Now, let's count the number of triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by degree: 
4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 9, 1, 7, 3, 12, 0, 5, 2, 11, 13 

Triangles: 
[<0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 2>, <1, 7, 2>, <2, 3, 14>, <2, 3, 1>, <2, 3, 11>, <2, 1, 7>, <2, 1, 12>, <2, 1, 3>, <3, 5, 11>, <3, 5, 2>, <3, 5, 1>, <3, 11, 12>, <3, 11, 0>, <3, 11, 13>, <3, 11, 2>, <4, 7, 0>, <5, 9, 10>, <5, 9, 8>, <5, 9, 3>, <5, 9, 2>, <5, 9, 11>, <5, 9, 12>, <5, 9, 7>, <5, 9, 13>, <6, 7, 0>, <8, 5, 11>, <8, 5, 13>, <8, 11, 10>, <8, 11, 13>, <8, 13, 14>, <9, 5, 10>, <9, 5, 8>, <9, 5, 3>, <9, 5, 2>, <9, 5, 11>, <9, 5, 12>, <9, 5, 7>, <9, 5, 13>, <11, 10, 2>, <11, 10, 13>, <11, 10, 12>, <11, 10, 0>, <11, 10, 14>, <11, 3, 1>, <11, 3, 12>, <11, 3, 2>, <11, 12, 13>, <11, 12, 1>, <11, 12, 2>, <11, 12, 0>, <11, 12, 14>, <12, 9, 11>, <12, 9, 13>, <12, 11, 13>, <13, 11, 8>, <13, 11, 12>, <13, 11, 0>, <13, 11, 14>, <13, 8, 14>, <13, 12, 1>, <13, 12, 2>, <13, 12, 11>, <13, 12, 0>, <14, 13, 2>]
