Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: 9, 2, 7, 4, 8
- 1: 3, 2, 8, 7
- 2: 1, 0, 7, 4
- 3: 6, 1, 7, 8
- 4: 6, 0, 2
- 5: 9, 7
- 6: 9, 3, 4, 8
- 7: 5, 1, 3, 0, 2
- 8: 9, 6, 1, 3, 0
- 9: 5, 7, 6, 8, 0

Using Degree-Based Ordering method, vertices can be sorted based on their number of connections:
Vertices in order: 5, 4, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 6, 0, 9

Now, let's count the triangles:
- For edge (5, 9): No triangle
- For edge (5, 7): No triangle
- For edge (9, 6): No triangle
- For edge (6, 3): No triangle
- For edge (6, 4): Triangle <4, 6, 0>
- For edge (1, 3): No triangle
- For edge (1, 2): No triangle
- For edge (1, 8): No triangle
- For edge (3, 6): No triangle
- For edge (0, 9): No triangle
- For edge (0, 2): No triangle
- For edge (0, 7): No triangle
- For edge (0, 4): Triangle <4, 6, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
The unique triangles found are <4, 6, 0>.
