The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 2) (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 16) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 6) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (0, 5) (0, 12) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 19) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 7) (19, 3) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 6) (2, 15) (2, 17) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1) (7, 15) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 18) (6, 15) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 14) (14, 10) (14, 6) (1, 16) (1, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first sort the nodes by their degree, and then follow the Degree-Based Ordering method as described. 

The sorted list of nodes by their degree is as follows:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 14: 2 connections
Node 16: 3 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 15: 5 connections
