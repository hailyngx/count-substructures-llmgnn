Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Now let's sort the vertices by their degree:

Vertices by degree:
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 0: degree 5
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 2: degree 6
Node 9: degree 7

Now we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Triangles found:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [10]
