Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 4) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 1) (4, 17) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 7) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 16) (13, 19) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 3) (15, 8) (15, 6) (16, 5) (16, 19) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 3) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 1) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 19) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 6) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 1) 

Response:
The graph constructed from the given information is as follows:

Nodes: 20
Edges: 60

Edges:
(10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 14)
(17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 4)
(2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0)
(18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 1)
(4, 8) (8, 15) (8, 7) (0, 18) (14, 3) (5, 11) (5, 16) (13, 19)
(9, 3) (16, 19) (12, 1) (6, 15) (3, 19) (1, 7)

By sorting the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes with degrees:
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 16: 3 connections
Node 13: 1 connection
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 18: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 15: 2 connections
Node 17: 5 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles, we find:

Triangles: [12]

Unique triangles:
<2, 0, 14>
<6, 15, 17>
<6, 11, 12>
<7, 1, 18>
<0, 14, 10>
<0, 14, 3>
<0, 10, 17>
<3, 14, 7>
<3, 14, 0>
<4, 8, 9>
<4, 9, 17>
<8, 9, 17>
