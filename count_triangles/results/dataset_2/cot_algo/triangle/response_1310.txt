After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, we can now count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The triangles found are:
- <2, 4, 1>
- <2, 7, 22>
- <1, 9, 19>
- <7, 8, 18>
- <4, 6, 25>
- <3, 18, 8>
- <18, 3, 4>
- <26, 8, 18>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
