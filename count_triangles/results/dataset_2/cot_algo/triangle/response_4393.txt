Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 15) (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 8) (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 17) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 6) (18, 16) (18, 7) (2, 9) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 12) (0, 5) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 10) (15, 16) (15, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling the nodes accordingly. 

Here are the nodes sorted by their degree:

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 13: 1 connection
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 17: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 18: 2 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 16: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 19: 6 connections
Node 11: 6 connections

Now, we will check each edge to count the number of triangles formed. We will only consider an edge if the lower labeled node has fewer connections.

After checking all the edges, we find that there are a total of [9] triangles in the graph.

Here are the unique triangles found:
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 3, 14>
<1, 6, 11>
<1, 7, 4>
<1, 11, 16>
<1, 11, 19>
<3, 9, 14>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 6>
