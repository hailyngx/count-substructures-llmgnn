Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 19) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 15) (8, 7) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 19) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 15) (15, 10) (15, 14) (15, 11) (15, 7) (12, 16) (12, 19) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 5) (1, 16) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 3) (19, 12) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 5) (5, 18) (5, 16) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering allows us to efficiently count the number of triangles in the graph provided.

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
Node 1 has degree 0
Node 6 has degree 0
Node 8 has degree 0
Node 12 has degree 0

Node 4 has degree 1
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 2 has degree 4

Node 0 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 5
Node 18 has degree 5
Node 3 has degree 5

Node 10 has degree 6
Node 19 has degree 6
Node 17 has degree 2
Node 11 has degree 4
Node 13 has degree 4

Node 14 has degree 5
Node 15 has degree 5
Node 16 has degree 6

We will now count the triangles:
1. Triangles involving node 0: <0, 4, 14> and <0, 10, 14>
2. Triangles involving node 2: <2, 11, 3> and <2, 18, 19>
3. Triangles involving node 3: <3, 11, 19> and <3, 18, 5>
4. Triangles involving node 4: None
5. Triangles involving node 5: <5, 7, 13> and <5, 7, 16>
6. Triangles involving node 7: <7, 8, 15> and <7, 13, 16>
7. Triangles involving node 10: None
8. Triangles involving node 11: <11, 13, 16> and <11, 15, 13>
9. Triangles involving node 13: <13, 16, 7>
10. Triangles involving node 14: None
11. Triangles involving node 15: None
12. Triangles involving node 16: None

Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 14>, <0, 10, 14>, <2, 11, 3>, <2, 18, 19>, <5, 7, 13>, <5, 7, 16>, <7, 8, 15>, <7, 13, 16>, <11, 15, 13>
