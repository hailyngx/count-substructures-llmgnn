Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (5, 13) (5, 2) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 0) (13, 18) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 8) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 9) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 16) (17, 0) (17, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (16, 0) (16, 15) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 3) (2, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (6, 17) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (18, 13) (18, 10) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 6) (19, 13) (19, 2) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 0) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 14) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges:
- 0: {7, 13, 16, 17, 8}
- 1: {7, 11}
- 2: {5, 12, 19, 3, 14}
- 3: {7, 12, 2, 6}
- 4: {7, 9, 14}
- 5: {13, 2}
- 6: {17, 3}
- 7: {4, 0, 3, 1}
- 8: {0, 15, 11, 14}
- 9: {4, 10, 11}
- 10: {15, 18, 9}
- 11: {1, 9, 8}
- 12: {2, 3}
- 13: {5, 19, 0, 18}
- 14: {4, 2, 8}
- 15: {10, 16, 8}
- 16: {0, 15}
- 17: {0, 6}
- 18: {13, 10}
- 19: {13, 2}

Now, let's calculate the total number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted by degree:
Vertices: {1, 5, 6, 4, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 12, 15, 2, 9, 11, 3, 8, 0, 13, 7, 14}

Triangles: 
[Total number of triangles: 44]
<0, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 13>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 16>, <0, 13, 18>, <0, 13, 8>, <0, 13, 17>, <0, 13, 16>, <1, 7, 11>, <2, 3, 12>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 14>, <2, 12, 14>, <2, 19, 3>, <4, 7, 14>, <5, 13, 19>, <5, 13, 2>, <6, 17, 3>, <8, 11, 14>, <8, 11, 15>, <8, 11, 4>, <8, 11, 14>, <8, 14, 4>, <8, 14, 15>, <8, 14, 0>, <8, 14, 11>, <8, 15, 10>, <8, 15, 16>, <8, 15, 0>, <8, 15, 11>, <9, 11, 4>, <9, 11, 10>, <9, 4, 10>, <10, 15, 16>, <10, 15, 18>, <10, 15, 8>, <10, 15, 9>, <10, 16, 0>, <10, 16, 15>, <10, 16, 18>, <10, 16, 15>, <13, 18, 10>, <13, 18, 0>, <13, 18, 8>, <14, 2, 4>
