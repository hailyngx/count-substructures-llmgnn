Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 7) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 12) (11, 1) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 14) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 2) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts with sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices in order of degree: 
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 12: Degree 5
Node 13: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 10: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 6
Node 9: Degree 6
Node 0: Degree 6
Node 1: Degree 6
Node 14: Degree 6

Now, we can iterate over the edges and count the triangles based on the rules mentioned. 

The total number of triangles is [14].

Unique triangles found are:
<1, 3, 12>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 10, 12>
<1, 10, 6>
<1, 10, 5>
<1, 10, 0>
<1, 3, 0>
<1, 0, 7>
<6, 3, 10>
<6, 5, 14>
<6, 5, 0>
<6, 5, 7>
<3, 0, 7>
<10, 0, 12>
