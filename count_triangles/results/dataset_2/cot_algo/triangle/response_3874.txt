Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in this graph is as follows:

1. Sort the nodes based on the number of connections:
Node 5 has 5 connections, Node 9 has 4 connections, Nodes 6, 1, and 4 have 2 connections each, Nodes 3, 8, 0, 7, and 2 have 5 connections each.

2. Relabel the nodes accordingly:
(5, 1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 9, 6, 7, 8)

3. Start counting the triangles using the sorted order.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 9, 8>, <5, 9, 3>, <5, 9, 7>, <5, 3, 1>, <5, 8, 0>, <3, 4, 8>.
