Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 6) (2, 3) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 10) (12, 3) (12, 11) (5, 11) (0, 8) (0, 11) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 15) (10, 16) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 10) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 19) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 17) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 14) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 9) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 14) (14, 9) (14, 19) (16, 8) (16, 10)
