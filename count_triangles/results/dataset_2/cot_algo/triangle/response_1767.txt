Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 7) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 1) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 11) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree:

Node 5 has degree 3
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 4 has degree 4
Node 12 has degree 3
Node 0 has degree 5
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 8 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 10 has degree 4
Node 13 has degree 4
Node 11 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 6
Node 6 has degree 5
Node 14 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 5

Sorting the vertices from least to most connections:

7, 5, 12, 8, 2, 4, 1, 10, 13, 11, 14, 3, 6, 0, 9

Based on the sorted vertices, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed. Following the guidelines to only consider triangles where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles: [20]
Unique triangles: <1, 8, 12>, <1, 7, 12>, <1, 7, 11>, <1, 7, 5>, <1, 12, 4>, <1, 12, 0>, <1, 8, 4>, <0, 10, 14>, <0, 10, 4>, <0, 14, 6>, <0, 14, 13>, <0, 14, 3>, <2, 13, 14>, <2, 13, 11>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 5, 0>, <6, 14, 13>, <6, 9, 3>, <9, 11, 3>, <10, 4, 12>
