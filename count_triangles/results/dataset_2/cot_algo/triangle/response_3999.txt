This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (10, 3) (11, 14) (11, 21) (11, 2) (8, 23) (8, 16) (23, 8) (23, 5) (23, 19) (0, 17) (20, 13) (20, 27) (20, 9) (5, 7) (5, 23) (5, 13) (6, 29) (6, 22) (1, 25) (1, 16) (1, 28) (1, 18) (17, 0) (17, 19) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 12) (28, 1) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 24) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 21) (3, 14) (21, 11) (21, 3) (21, 16) (21, 27) (18, 1) (18, 26) (18, 19) (13, 20) (13, 5) (13, 29) (12, 4) (12, 26) (12, 25) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 21) (16, 2) (14, 11) (14, 3) (19, 23) (19, 17) (19, 28) (19, 18) (25, 1) (25, 12) (25, 15) (29, 6) (29, 13) (27, 20) (27, 21) (27, 9) (9, 20) (9, 28) (9, 27) (9, 24) (24, 28) (24, 9) (24, 2) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 24) (22, 6) (15, 4) (15, 25) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(0, 17), (1, 25), (1, 16), (1, 28), (1, 18), (2, 4), (2, 11), (2, 16), (2, 24), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 10), (3, 21), (3, 14), (4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 15), (5, 7), (5, 23), (5, 13), (6, 29), (6, 22), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 5), (8, 23), (8, 16), (9, 20), (9, 27), (9, 28), (9, 24), (10, 3), (11, 14), (11, 21), (12, 4), (12, 26), (12, 25), (13, 20), (13, 5), (13, 29), (14, 11), (14, 3), (15, 4), (15, 25), (16, 8), (16, 1), (16, 21), (18, 1), (18, 26), (18, 19), (19, 23), (19, 17), (19, 28), (19, 18), (20, 13), (20, 27), (20, 9), (21, 11), (21, 3), (21, 16), (21, 27), (22, 6), (23, 8), (23, 5), (23, 19), (24, 28), (24, 9), (24, 2), (25, 1), (25, 12), (25, 15), (26, 28), (26, 18), (26, 12), (27, 20), (27, 21), (27, 9), (28, 1), (28, 26), (28, 9), (28, 19), (28, 24), (29, 6), (29, 13)

After relabeling based on the number of connections, we get the following order:
Nodes: 0, 18, 22, 10, 15, 17, 16, 24, 12, 5, 6, 25, 13, 20, 26, 28, 27, 19, 1, 8, 11, 14, 21, 29, 23, 9, 7, 3, 4, 2

Now, counting the triangles:
Triangles: [34]
Unique triangles: <1, 14, 21>, <1, 14, 26>, <1, 16, 18>, <1, 18, 26>, <1, 18, 28>, <1, 21, 11>, <1, 26, 12>, <1, 26, 18>, <1, 26, 28>, <1, 28, 9>, <1, 28, 19>, <3, 7, 4>, <3, 10, 21>, <3, 14, 11>, <3, 14, 21>, <3, 21, 11>, <16, 8, 23>, <16, 8, 24>, <16, 21, 11>, <16, 21, 27>, <18, 19, 17>, <18, 26, 12>, <18, 26, 28>, <18, 26, 1>, <19, 17, 0>, <19, 17, 28>, <19, 18, 26>, <19, 18, 28>, <19, 28, 1>, <19, 28, 9>, <21, 11, 3>, <21, 16, 2>, <23, 8, 16>, <23, 8, 24>
