Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly. 

The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is: 
4, 7, 9, 8, 1, 6, 0, 5, 3, 2

Now, we will iterate through each edge and count the number of triangles by checking shared connections between the two vertices of each edge. 

The total number of triangles found in the graph is [14]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 1, 5>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 1>
<4, 9, 7>
