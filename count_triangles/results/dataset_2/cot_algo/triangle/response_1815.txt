Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 12) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 12) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections. Then, we can relabel the vertices and count the triangles based on the sorted vertices. 

After sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, we get the following order:
Node 5 has degree 5,
Nodes 9 and 4 have degree 4,
Nodes 7, 1, 3, 6, and 2 have degree 3,
Nodes 8, 0, 14, 11, 12, 13, and 10 have degree 2.

Now, by following the steps of the Degree-Based Ordering method and checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge, we can count the number of triangles. 

The total number of triangles is [15].

The unique triangles found are:
