Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 10) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 11) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 0) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 14) 

Response:
The sorted vertices with their connections are as follows:
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 12: 2 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 8: 5 connections
- Node 11: 3 connections
- Node 13: 4 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 5: 5 connections
- Node 9: 5 connections
- Node 14: 4 connections
- Node 10: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, looking at the edges:
1. Edge (5, 9): Both nodes have the same degree, so we can proceed.
2. Edge (5, 6): Node 5 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
3. Edge (5, 8): Node 5 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
4. Edge (5, 1): Node 5 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
5. Edge (5, 4): Node 5 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
6. Edge (9, 6): Node 6 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
7. Edge (9, 14): Node 9 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
8. Edge (9, 10): Node 9 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
9. Edge (9, 1): Node 1 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
10. Edge (6, 3): Node 6 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
11. Edge (4, 10): Node 4 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
12. Edge (8, 11): Node 8 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
13. Edge (13, 0): Node 13 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
14. Edge (2, 1): Node 2 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
15. Edge (12, 13): Node 12 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
16. Edge (7, 2): Node 7 has fewer connections, so we proceed.

The triangles formed are:
<2, 7, 14>
<0, 10, 13>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 7>
