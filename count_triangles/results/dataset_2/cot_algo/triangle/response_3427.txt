Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
