Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) 

Response:
The given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows:
```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 8), (6, 0), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 7), (1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7), (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 2), (3, 8), (4, 9), (4, 1), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (7, 9), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 6), (8, 9), (8, 3), (8, 4), (2, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (0, 6), (0, 4), (0, 5), (5, 7), (5, 2), (5, 0)
```

Now, we will sort the nodes based on the number of connections:
```
Nodes by degree: 5(3), 2(3), 9(4), 0(4), 8(4), 5(4), 1(4), 7(5), 3(5), 6(5)
```

We will now count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
```
Triangles: [10]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 9>
```
