Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) 

Response:
Let's create the graph with the given edges: 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9), (1, 4, 7, 9), (2, 4, 5, 8, 9), (3, 0, 6, 8), (4, 0, 1, 2, 6, 8), (5, 0, 2, 4), (6, 0, 3, 4), (7, 1, 8), (8, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9), (9, 0, 1, 2, 8)
  
Now, we will sort the nodes by their degree:

Nodes by degree: 1(2), 7(2), 5(3), 6(3), 3(4), 7(4), 8(5), 0(6), 4(6), 2(6)

Let's count the triangles:

Triangles: [24]

The unique triangles found are:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
