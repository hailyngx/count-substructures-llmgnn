Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
Vertices by their number of connections:  
Node 0 : 4 connections  
Node 2 : 2 connections  
Node 5 : 4 connections  
Node 7 : 4 connections  
Node 9 : 3 connections  
Node 1 : 4 connections  
Node 8 : 4 connections  
Node 3 : 5 connections  
Node 6 : 5 connections  
Node 4 : 5 connections  

Sorted vertices are: 2, 9, 8, 1, 5, 7, 0, 6, 4, 3
