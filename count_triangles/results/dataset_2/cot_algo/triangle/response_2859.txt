Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
The vertices with their respective degrees are:
0: 3
1: 5
2: 4
3: 3
4: 4
5: 4
6: 3
7: 5
8: 4
9: 5

By sorting the nodes by their degrees, we get the following order: 0, 3, 6, 2, 4, 8, 5, 7, 1, 9.

Calculating triangles:
- Triangles involving node 0: None
- Triangles involving node 3: <1, 3, 5>
- Triangles involving node 6: None
- Triangles involving node 2: <1, 2, 5> and <2, 5, 9>
- Triangles involving node 4: <1, 4, 5> and <4, 5, 7>
- Triangles involving node 8: <1, 7, 8> and <1, 5, 8>
- Triangles involving node 5: <1, 5, 7>
- Triangles involving node 7: <1, 5, 7> and <1, 7, 9>
- Triangles involving node 1: <1, 5, 7> and <1, 4, 5> and <1, 0, 8>
- Triangles involving node 9: <1, 5, 9> and <9, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 14.
The unique triangles found are: <1, 3, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 0, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, and <9, 5, 7>.
