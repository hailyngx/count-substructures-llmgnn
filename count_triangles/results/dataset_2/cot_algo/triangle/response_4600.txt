Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted list of vertices with their respective degrees is as follows:
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 7
- Node 4: degree 5

Now, let's analyze each edge starting from the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. (5, 9): No triangles formed.
2. (5, 2): Triangle formed: <2, 5, 9>.
3. (5, 4): Triangle formed: <4, 5, 9>.
4. (5, 0): Triangle formed: <0, 5, 9>.
5. (5, 3): Triangle formed: <3, 5, 9>.
6. (9, 8): No triangles formed.
7. (9, 1): No triangles formed.
8. (4, 7): Triangle formed: <4, 7, 0>.
9. (4, 6): No triangles formed.
10. (7, 0): No triangles formed.
11. (3, 7): No triangles formed.
12. (3, 2): Triangle formed: <2, 3, 5>.
13. (8, 1): No triangles formed.
14. (8, 6): Triangle formed: <6, 8, 4>.
15. (2, 3): Triangle formed: <2, 3, 5>.
16. (1, 0): No triangles formed.
17. (0, 7): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5] and the unique triangles found are <2, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 7, 0>, and <6, 8, 4>.
