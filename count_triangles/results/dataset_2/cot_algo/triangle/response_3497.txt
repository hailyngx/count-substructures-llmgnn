Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (13, 16) (13, 12) (13, 2) (4, 18) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 14) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 17) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (1, 6) (3, 19) (3, 12) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 3) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 15) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 0) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 15) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 17) (10, 8) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 12) 

Response:
The graph described above can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: 2, 11, 15
- 1: 6
- 2: 0, 8, 13
- 3: 12, 19
- 4: 18
- 5: 6, 11, 14, 15
- 6: 1, 5, 16, 18
- 7: 11, 15, 19
- 8: 2, 8, 10
- 9: 6, 9, 14, 17
- 10: 8
- 11: 0, 5, 7, 16, 19
- 12: 3, 13, 17
- 13: 2, 12, 16
- 14: 5, 9, 15
- 15: 0, 5, 7, 14
- 16: 6, 11, 13
- 17: 9, 12, 18
- 18: 4, 6, 17
- 19: 3, 7, 11

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Vertices sorted by degree (from lowest to highest):
   Nodes with degree 1: 1, 4, 10
   Nodes with degree 2: 3, 8
   Nodes with degree 3: 0
   Nodes with degree 4: 12, 18, 19
   Nodes with degree 5: 2, 7, 9, 10, 13, 16
   Nodes with degree 6: 14, 17
   Nodes with degree 7: 5, 6
   Nodes with degree 8: 11
   Nodes with degree 9: 15

2. Counting the triangles:
   - From the edges, we see that only edges (11, 16) and (11, 7) can form triangles, as in each case, the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. 
   - The shared connections for each edge are nodes 5 and 19. 
   
3. Counting triangles:
   - Only one triangle can be formed: <5, 11, 16>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [1]
