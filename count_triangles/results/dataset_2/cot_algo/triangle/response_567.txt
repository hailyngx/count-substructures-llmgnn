Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 17) (9, 8) (9, 3) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 13) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 15) (4, 7) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 12) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 16) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 18) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (12, 15) (12, 19) (11, 8) (11, 2) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 19) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 16) (13, 14) (13, 1) (19, 14) (19, 12) (19, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently.
Let's relabel the nodes based on their degree in ascending order: 

Nodes:
0: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
5: 4 connections
9: 4 connections
4: 3 connections
7: 3 connections
11: 3 connections
12: 3 connections
17: 6 connections
1: 4 connections
10: 4 connections
13: 3 connections
15: 4 connections
6: 3 connections
14: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
18: 3 connections
16: 4 connections
19: 3 connections

Now, we will examine each edge while considering the order of the vertices (from lower label to higher label) and count the triangles formed.

After analyzing all the edges, we find the total number of triangles to be [25].

The unique triangles found are:
<13, 1, 3>
<10, 3, 17>
<10, 3, 9>
<10, 3, 1>
<10, 3, 16>
<10, 3, 6>
<10, 3, 15>
<10, 17, 14>
<10, 17, 15>
<10, 17, 5>
<8, 11, 2>
<8, 11, 6>
<8, 11, 2>
<8, 11, 6>
<8, 11, 2>
<8, 11, 6>
<8, 11, 2>
<8, 11, 6>
<12, 15, 7>
<12, 15, 18>
<12, 15, 7>
<12, 15, 18>
