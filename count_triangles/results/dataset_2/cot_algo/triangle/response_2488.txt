Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 12) (6, 17) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 0) (8, 15) (8, 10) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 16) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (13, 14) (1, 18) (1, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 19) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 2) (7, 18) (16, 5) (16, 18) (19, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections:
   - Vertex 7: Degree 1
   - Vertex 13: Degree 1
   - Vertex 19: Degree 1
   - Vertex 3: Degree 4
   - Vertex 6: Degree 3
   - Vertex 9: Degree 2
   - Vertex 11: Degree 4
   - Vertex 5: Degree 3
   - Vertex 1: Degree 2
   - Vertex 17: Degree 3
   - Vertex 18: Degree 4
   - Vertex 0: Degree 5
   - Vertex 8: Degree 4
   - Vertex 2: Degree 4
   - Vertex 15: Degree 4
   - Vertex 4: Degree 4
   - Vertex 10: Degree 3
   - Vertex 14: Degree 4
   - Vertex 12: Degree 5
   - Vertex 16: Degree 3

2. Relabel the vertices:
   - Vertex 7: 0
   - Vertex 13: 1
   - Vertex 19: 2
   - Vertex 3: 3
   - Vertex 6: 4
   - Vertex 9: 5
   - Vertex 11: 6
   - Vertex 5: 7
   - Vertex 1: 8
   - Vertex 17: 9
   - Vertex 18: 10
   - Vertex 0: 11
   - Vertex 8: 12
   - Vertex 2: 13
   - Vertex 15: 14
   - Vertex 4: 15
   - Vertex 10: 16
   - Vertex 14: 17
   - Vertex 12: 18
   - Vertex 16: 19

3. Count the number of triangles and list them:
   - Triangles: <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 15>, <2, 6, 12>, <2, 11, 14>, <2, 11, 18>, <2, 12, 18>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 8, 15>, <4, 8, 15>, <5, 6, 2>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 16>, <6, 7, 16>, <10, 11, 0>, <10, 11, 12>, <10, 11, 14>, <10, 12, 14>, <11, 14, 12>
   
The total number of triangles is [18].
