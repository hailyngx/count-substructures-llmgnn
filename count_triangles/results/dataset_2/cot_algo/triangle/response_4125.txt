Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 

Node 8: degree 2  
Node 9: degree 4  
Node 0: degree 4  
Node 5: degree 7  
Node 4: degree 3  
Node 2: degree 4  
Node 1: degree 4  
Node 6: degree 6  
Node 7: degree 5  
Node 3: degree 4  

Now, let's count the triangles:

1. Looking at the edge (5, 9), we see that both nodes have fewer connections than 5. So, we check for shared connections between nodes 5 and 9. We find that both 6 and 0 are connected to both 5 and 9, forming a triangle <5, 9, 6> and <5, 9, 0>.

2. For other edges, all the lower labeled nodes have more connections, so no other triangles are formed from these edges.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2], and the unique triangles found are <5, 9, 0> and <5, 9, 6>.
