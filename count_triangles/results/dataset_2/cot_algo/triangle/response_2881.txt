Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be illustrated as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7), 
(9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 4), 
(6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 8), 
(3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 2), (3, 0), 
(4, 8), (4, 2), (4, 0), 
(8, 6), 
(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)

After sorting the vertices by their degrees from least to most, the new vertex ordering is: 
{1, 7, 5, 6, 9, 2, 4, 0, 8, 3}

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we start with edges where the lower label vertex has fewer connections:

Triangles:
[2]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2]. 
The unique triangles found are: <2, 4, 8>.
