Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 25) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 11) (20, 15) (20, 25) (20, 12) (20, 23) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 16) (11, 25) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 13) (4, 27) (4, 24) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 26) (5, 23) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 27) (28, 11) (28, 29) (28, 17) (28, 22) (29, 28) (29, 7) (29, 12) (7, 29) (7, 12) (12, 20) (12, 29) (12, 7) (12, 16) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 23) (26, 8) (26, 21) (22, 28) (22, 24) (21, 3) (21, 26) (21, 27) (21, 9) (21, 14) (27, 4) (27, 6) (27, 21) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 21) (14, 0) (14, 9) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 17) (19, 1) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 17) (9, 15) (9, 21) (9, 14) (9, 18) (17, 28) (17, 18) (17, 16) (23, 20) (23, 5) (23, 13) (23, 2) (24, 4) (24, 22) (2, 4) (2, 23) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Let's first relabel the vertices based on the number of connections each node has:

Vertices in order of decreasing degree:  
Node 28 (Degree 4)  
Node 9 (Degree 4)  
Node 11 (Degree 4)  
Node 21 (Degree 4)  
Node 12 (Degree 4)  
Node 16 (Degree 4)  
Node 17 (Degree 3)  
Node 20 (Degree 3)  
Node 1 (Degree 3)  
Node 6 (Degree 3)  
Node 13 (Degree 3)  
Node 15 (Degree 3)  
Node 22 (Degree 3)  
Node 14 (Degree 3)  
Node 4 (Degree 3)  
Node 10 (Degree 3)  
Node 23 (Degree 3)  
Node 27 (Degree 3)  
Node 29 (Degree 3)  
Node 26 (Degree 2)  
Node 3 (Degree 2)  
Node 0 (Degree 2)  
Node 18 (Degree 2)  
Node 25 (Degree 2)  
Node 5 (Degree 1)  
Node 7 (Degree 1)  
Node 8 (Degree 1)  
Node 24 (Degree 2)  
Node 19 (Degree 1)  
Node 2 (Degree 2)  

Now, let's count the number of triangles.

Total number of triangles: [16]
