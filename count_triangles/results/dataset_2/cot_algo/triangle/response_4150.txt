Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Vertices:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7),
(1, 7), (1, 9),
(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 9),
(3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8),
(4, 6), (4, 9),
(5, 9),
(7, 8), (7, 9),
(8, 2), (8, 3)

We will now sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices degrees:
0: 5
1: 3
2: 4
3: 4
4: 4
5: 4
6: 3
7: 4
8: 3
9: 5

Sorted vertices:
1, 6, 8, 2, 3, 4, 7, 0, 5, 9

Now, we will find the triangles formed by the edges using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
[18] 
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 5>, 
<2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, 
<3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, 
<4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, 
<5, 7, 9>
