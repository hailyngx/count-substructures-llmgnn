Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order. Then, relabel the vertices accordingly.

The vertices with their connections are as follows:
- Vertex 0: 5, 7, 1, 2
- Vertex 1: 7, 6, 3, 0
- Vertex 2: 5, 7, 8, 0
- Vertex 3: 9, 4, 7, 6, 1
- Vertex 4: 7, 6, 3
- Vertex 5: 9, 2, 0
- Vertex 6: 9, 4, 1, 3
- Vertex 7: 9, 4, 0, 3, 1, 2
- Vertex 8: 9, 2
- Vertex 9: 5, 6, 8, 3, 7

Considering the edges, we only proceed when the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections than the other vertex. This ensures each triangle is only counted once.

Triangles found:
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 3, 1>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <3, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
