Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given graph and edges, let's construct the graph representation:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- 0: {5, 4, 7, 6, 1, 9}
- 1: {5, 9, 7, 3, 0}
- 2: {9, 4}
- 3: {5, 7, 6, 1}
- 4: {5, 9, 0, 8, 2}
- 5: {1, 4, 0, 3}
- 6: {9, 3, 0}
- 7: {0, 3, 8, 1}
- 8: {9, 4, 7}
- 9: {6, 8, 2, 1, 0}

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes in increasing order of degree: [2, 6, 8, 7, 3, 1, 4, 0, 5, 9]

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <0, 4, 7>
3. <0, 1, 5>
4. <3, 5, 7>
5. <1, 3, 5>
6. <0, 1, 9>
7. <0, 6, 9>
8. <0, 1, 7>
9. <7, 1, 3>
10. <4, 0, 5>
11. <4, 0, 7>
12. <4, 5, 8>
13. <4, 0, 8>
14. <4, 2, 9>

Total number of triangles: [14]
