Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 6
Node 0: Degree 7
