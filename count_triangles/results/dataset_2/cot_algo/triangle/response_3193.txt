Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 9) (11, 5) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 0) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 9) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 14) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 5) (6, 12) (6, 14) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:
Node 0 has connections to: [3, 10, 7, 12, 13, 9]
Node 1 has connections to: [3, 14, 10, 12, 7]
Node 2 has connections to: [3, 12, 5]
Node 3 has connections to: [1, 0, 2]
Node 4 has connections to: [13, 5]
Node 5 has connections to: [11, 4, 8, 13, 2, 14]
Node 6 has connections to: [12, 14]
Node 7 has connections to: [1, 8, 12, 0]
Node 8 has connections to: [5, 14, 7]
Node 9 has connections to: [10, 11, 13, 0, 14]
Node 10 has connections to: [1, 0, 12, 9]
Node 11 has connections to: [9, 5]
Node 12 has connections to: [1, 10, 7, 2, 0, 6]
Node 13 has connections to: [4, 5, 9, 0]
Node 14 has connections to: [1, 8, 5, 9, 6]

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering the given edge data, we have:
Triangles: [<0, 3, 1>, <0, 10, 1>, <0, 12, 1>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 13, 9>, <0, 9, 13>, <1, 10, 0>, <1, 12, 0>, <1, 7, 0>, <3, 2, 12>]

Total number of triangles: [10]
