Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph by listing the nodes and their connections:

Node 0: 5, 2, 3, 6
Node 1: 4, 6, 2
Node 2: 5, 1, 3, 6, 0
Node 3: 0, 2, 8
Node 4: 7, 8, 1
Node 5: 9, 6, 2, 0
Node 6: 5, 7, 1, 8, 2, 0
Node 7: 9, 4, 6, 8
Node 8: 9, 7, 4, 3, 6
Node 9: 5, 8, 7

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes in order of degree: 1, 3, 4, 0, 5, 7, 9, 2, 6, 8

Now, we will count the triangles:

Triangles: [15]
Unique triangles: <3, 0, 2>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 5, 6>, <1, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 3>, <4, 6, 8>, <7, 8, 9>
