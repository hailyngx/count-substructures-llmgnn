Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 27) (14, 28) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 26) (2, 18) (29, 7) (29, 27) (29, 5) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 19) (10, 23) (11, 24) (11, 0) (4, 7) (4, 24) (7, 29) (7, 4) (7, 23) (18, 2) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 24) (22, 6) (22, 8) (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 26) (24, 11) (24, 4) (24, 15) (24, 0) (5, 29) (5, 28) (5, 3) (23, 10) (23, 7) (23, 3) (23, 20) (9, 25) (9, 12) (25, 9) (25, 19) (25, 21) (0, 11) (0, 24) (0, 28) (0, 19) (28, 14) (28, 5) (28, 0) (28, 1) (16, 13) (27, 14) (27, 29) (27, 10) (27, 21) (27, 3) (21, 25) (21, 27) (21, 12) (13, 16) (13, 20) (13, 1) (13, 19) (1, 28) (1, 13) (19, 10) (19, 6) (19, 25) (19, 0) (19, 13) (20, 23) (20, 13) (8, 15) (8, 22) (8, 26) (3, 5) (3, 23) (3, 27) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 21) (26, 17) (26, 6) (26, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by relabelling the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):

Node 13 has degree 4
Node 0 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 2
Node 2 has degree 1
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 8 has degree 3
Node 9 has degree 3
Node 10 has degree 4
Node 11 has degree 3
Node 12 has degree 4
Node 14 has degree 3
Node 15 has degree 3
Node 16 has degree 1
Node 17 has degree 4
Node 18 has degree 1
Node 19 has degree 5
Node 20 has degree 2
Node 21 has degree 3
Node 22 has degree 2
Node 23 has degree 4
Node 24 has degree 4
Node 25 has degree 3
Node 26 has degree 3
Node 27 has degree 5
Node 28 has degree 4
Node 29 has degree 3

Now, we will go through the edges and count the triangles:

Triangles: 
[18]

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in the given graph.
