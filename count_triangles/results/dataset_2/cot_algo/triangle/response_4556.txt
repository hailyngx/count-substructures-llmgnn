Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:  

Vertices sorted by their number of connections (degrees):  
Node 3: 0 edges  
Node 5: 4 edges  
Node 8: 4 edges  
Node 4: 5 edges  
Node 9: 5 edges  
Node 7: 5 edges  
Node 2: 5 edges  
Node 6: 5 edges  
Node 0: 5 edges  
Node 1: 5 edges  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph:  

[Total number of triangles: 8]  

Unique triangles found:  

<0, 5, 7>  
<0, 1, 4>  
<0, 1, 6>  
<0, 6, 8>  
<1, 2, 9>  
<1, 4, 7>  
<2, 4, 9>  
<4, 6, 8>
