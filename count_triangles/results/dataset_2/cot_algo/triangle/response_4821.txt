Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 8) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 4) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 6) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 6) 

Response:
Let's first sort the vertices by their degree from least to most:

Nodes with degree 1: 5, 7, 8, 12
Nodes with degree 2: 15, 9, 2
Nodes with degree 3: 4, 14
Nodes with degree 4: 0, 13
Nodes with degree 5: 3, 6, 10, 11
Nodes with degree 6: 1

Now, we will proceed based on the degree-based ordering to count the number of triangles:
