Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 16) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 6) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 4) (17, 3) (17, 16) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 19) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 0) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 1) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 6) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 14) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. The vertices in this graph have the following degrees:

0: 6 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 6 connections
3: 3 connections
4: 5 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 5 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 3 connections
10: 0 connections
11: 4 connections
12: 4 connections
13: 3 connections
14: 4 connections
15: 3 connections
16: 5 connections
17: 2 connections
18: 5 connections
19: 4 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we can relabel the nodes as follows:
0 -> 17
1 -> 3
2 -> 7
3 -> 1
4 -> 5
5 -> 9
6 -> 13
7 -> 0
8 -> 8
9 -> 2
10 -> 18
11 -> 6
12 -> 12
13 -> 4
14 -> 10
15 -> 15
16 -> 19
17 -> 11
18 -> 14
19 -> 16

Now, we will check each edge (u, v) where u is the lower labeled vertex to count the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle <0, 5, 14>
- Triangle <0, 6, 15>
- Triangle <0, 6, 19>
- Triangle <1, 3, 12>
- Triangle <1, 12, 14>
- Triangle <2, 6, 11>
- Triangle <4, 8, 13>
- Triangle <4, 13, 8>
- Triangle <4, 13, 9>
- Triangle <4, 14, 5>
- Triangle <4, 14, 10>
- Triangle <5, 11, 14>
- Triangle <6, 15, 19>
- Triangle <8, 13, 4>
- Triangle <8, 14, 10>
- Triangle <11, 5, 14>
- Triangle <12, 14, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
