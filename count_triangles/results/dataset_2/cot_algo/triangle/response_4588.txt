Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are:
Node 5 - 3 connections
Node 9 - 3 connections
Node 6 - 4 connections
Node 8 - 4 connections
Node 0 - 5 connections
Node 7 - 4 connections
Node 1 - 3 connections
Node 3 - 5 connections
Node 2 - 6 connections
Node 4 - 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 10]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 6>
