Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (9, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (18, 14) (18, 7) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 19) (11, 2) (11, 1) (0, 16) (0, 12) (7, 18) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 11) (15, 8) (15, 17) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 12) (17, 15) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 8) (4, 6) (4, 5) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 5) (16, 3) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 17) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 8) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 10) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 14) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 19) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 10) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: {(6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 10), (6, 4), (9, 6), (2, 1), (2, 13), (2, 11), (18, 14), (18, 7), (3, 16), (3, 13), (3, 19), (11, 2), (11, 1), (0, 16), (0, 12), (7, 18), (7, 16), (7, 19), (7, 14), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 11), (15, 8), (15, 17), (13, 2), (13, 3), (13, 17), (13, 12), (17, 15), (17, 13), (17, 16), (17, 12), (17, 8), (4, 6), (4, 5), (12, 0), (12, 13), (12, 17), (12, 5), (16, 3), (16, 0), (16, 7), (16, 17), (14, 18), (14, 7), (14, 8), (5, 4), (5, 12), (5, 10), (8, 15), (8, 17), (8, 14), (10, 6), (10, 5), (10, 19), (19, 3), (19, 7), (19, 10)}

Next, we need to sort the vertices by their degrees (number of connections):

Vertices in order of degrees:
0 (2 connections)
4 (2 connections)
9 (2 connections)
11 (2 connections)
5 (3 connections)
8 (3 connections)
10 (3 connections)
14 (3 connections)
15 (3 connections)
18 (3 connections)
1 (4 connections)
2 (4 connections)
3 (4 connections)
7 (4 connections)
12 (4 connections)
13 (4 connections)
16 (5 connections)
17 (5 connections)
6 (6 connections)
19 (6 connections)

Now, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles and identify unique triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 3]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 12, 17>
<3, 13, 17>
