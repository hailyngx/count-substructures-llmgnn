Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 7), (4, 2), (7, 0), (6, 3), (0, 8), (3, 6), (2, 1), (7, 1)}

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Nodes sorted by degree: [0, 8, 7, 4, 6, 1, 2, 3, 9, 5]

Triangles found: [10]
Unique triangles: <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 7>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <5, 6, 9>
