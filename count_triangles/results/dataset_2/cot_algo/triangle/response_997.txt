Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 12) (6, 5) (6, 2) (13, 4) (13, 9) (0, 3) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 10) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 10) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 11) (11, 2) (11, 4) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 9) 

Response:
The given graph with nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (3, 0), (9, 0)
- 1: (3, 1), (2, 1), (10, 1), (12, 1), (8, 1)
- 2: (1, 2), (6, 2), (9, 2), (10, 2), (11, 2), (4, 2)
- 3: (1, 3), (0, 3), (9, 3), (12, 3), (8, 3)
- 4: (5, 4), (13, 4), (14, 4), (2, 4), (11, 4)
- 5: (7, 5), (6, 5), (4, 5), (10, 5)
- 6: (12, 6), (5, 6), (2, 6)
- 7: (10, 7), (14, 7), (5, 7)
- 8: (1, 8), (3, 8), (12, 8), (14, 8)
- 9: (3, 9), (13, 9), (0, 9), (2, 9), (10, 9)
- 10: (1, 10), (7, 10), (5, 10), (14, 10), (2, 10), (9, 10)
- 11: (2, 11), (4, 11)
- 12: (1, 12), (3, 12), (6, 12), (8, 12)
- 13: (4, 13), (9, 13)
- 14: (7, 14), (8, 14), (4, 14), (10, 14)

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Degree of each node:
0: 2
1: 5
2: 6
3: 5
4: 5
5: 4
6: 3
7: 3
8: 4
9: 5
10: 6
11: 2
12: 4
13: 2
14: 4

Vertices sorted in increasing order of degrees: 0, 11, 13, 6, 7, 5, 8, 12, 14, 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 2

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 9, 2>
<0, 3, 1>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 2, 10>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 8, 12>
<2, 4, 10>
<2, 4, 11>
<2, 6, 12>
<3, 8, 12>
<4, 10, 14>
