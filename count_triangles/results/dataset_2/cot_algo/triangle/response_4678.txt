Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 6) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 28) (27, 7) (7, 12) (7, 27) (7, 6) (7, 13) (0, 22) (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 10) (17, 20) (17, 8) (20, 14) (20, 17) (20, 3) (20, 5) (16, 28) (16, 24) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 26) (28, 27) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 4) (28, 15) (8, 17) (8, 9) (8, 22) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 4) (29, 9) (29, 11) (29, 18) (10, 14) (10, 22) (15, 28) (15, 18) (22, 0) (22, 8) (22, 10) (22, 19) (18, 29) (18, 15) (19, 22) (19, 11) (25, 9) (25, 6) (11, 29) (11, 19) (11, 24) (11, 26) (24, 16) (24, 11) (6, 12) (6, 7) (6, 25) (6, 26) (5, 20) (5, 23) (5, 21) (23, 14) (23, 5) (26, 16) (26, 11) (26, 6) (26, 21) (3, 27) (3, 20) (3, 4) (4, 28) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (1, 16) (1, 28) (1, 13) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 1) (21, 5) (21, 26) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29
Edges: (0, 22), (1, 16), (1, 13), (2, 14), (2, 20), ..., (27, 7), (28, 1), (28, 4), (29, 9)

Now, let's proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Sorted vertices by the number of connections (degree):
0 (degree 1)
2 (degree 1)
5 (degree 2)
9 (degree 2)
10 (degree 2)
11 (degree 2)
19 (degree 2)
21 (degree 2)
23 (degree 2)
24 (degree 2)
25 (degree 2)
26 (degree 2)
29 (degree 3)
15 (degree 4)
18 (degree 4)
3 (degree 5)
5 (degree 5)
8 (degree 5)
1 (degree 6)
4 (degree 6)
3 (degree 7)
7 (degree 7)
6 (degree 8)
22 (degree 8)
12 (degree 9)
20 (degree 9)
27 (degree 9)
16 (degree 10)
13 (degree 11)
28 (degree 11)

Now, we will count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 11]
<4, 13, 16>
<1, 4, 13>
<1, 13, 16>
<4, 13, 28>
<4, 16, 28>
<7, 12, 27>
<4, 13, 1>
<9, 18, 29>
<5, 20, 3>
<20, 27, 3>
<26, 21, 5>
