Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (16, 19) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 17) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 12) (10, 4) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 13) (2, 1) (2, 13) (18, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 19) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 8) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 7) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 14) (19, 16) (19, 9) (19, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 14) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently in the given graph.

Node degrees:
0: 3, 1: 5, 2: 2, 3: 5, 4: 4, 5: 4, 6: 3, 7: 4, 8: 3, 9: 5, 10: 2, 11: 2, 12: 3, 13: 5, 14: 4, 15: 4, 16: 1, 17: 4, 18: 2, 19: 3

Vertices sorted by their degrees: 16, 11, 18, 10, 2, 0, 6, 8, 12, 19, 7, 1, 4, 14, 5, 17, 3, 15, 13, 9

Triangles:
[31]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 2, 13>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 17>, <1, 9, 12>, <2, 13, 17>, <3, 5, 17>, <3, 7, 13>, <3, 9, 15>, <4, 8, 14>, <5, 6, 17>, <6, 7, 13>, <6, 9, 19>, <7, 8, 14>, <9, 12, 14>, <9, 13, 15>, <13, 15, 17>
