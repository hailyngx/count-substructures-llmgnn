Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the nodes are sorted by their number of connections:
Nodes in the sorted order: 12, 2, 8, 0, 1, 16, 18, 7, 10, 13, 21, 4, 6, 17, 12, 20, 3, 19, 14, 11, 15, 9, 5, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Now, we will count the number of triangles by checking shared connections between the nodes of each edge. 
The total number of triangles is [9].

Unique triangles (triads) found:
<2, 5, 22>
<2, 7, 14>
<2, 17, 28>
<3, 9, 27>
<3, 21, 27>
<6, 15, 23>
<6, 15, 29>
<6, 20, 16>
<9, 13, 29>
