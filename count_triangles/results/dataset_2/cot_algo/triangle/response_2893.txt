Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 8) (11, 17) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 14) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (5, 18) (5, 14) (4, 18) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 8) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 0) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 2) (0, 13) (0, 12) (8, 11) (8, 18) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 2) (10, 6) (10, 7) (17, 11) (17, 9) (7, 13) (7, 10) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 20
Edges: 60

Edges:
(11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 8) (11, 17) (11, 15)
(16, 3) (16, 14)
(3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13)
(15, 1) (15, 9)
(6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12)
(9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 19)
(1, 6)
(5, 14)
(4, 18)
(13, 7) (13, 0)
(2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 14)
(12, 0)
(19, 2)
(0, 12)
(18, 8)
(10, 7)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degree: 
Nodes: 20
Degree: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2
Sorted nodes based on degree: 12 19 0 7 8 5 4 6 18 1 2 9 3 15 16 14 17 10 13 11

Now, we will relabel the nodes:
0 -> 0
1 -> 1
2 -> 2
3 -> 3
4 -> 4
5 -> 5
6 -> 6
7 -> 7
8 -> 8
9 -> 9
10 -> 10
11 -> 11
12 -> 12
13 -> 13
14 -> 14
15 -> 15
16 -> 16
17 -> 17
18 -> 18
19 -> 19

Now, we will count the number of triangles:

[Number of triangles: 14]

Unique triangles:
<0, 12, 13>
<0, 12, 2>
<0, 12, 6>
<0, 7, 13>
<0, 8, 18>
<1, 15, 3>
<2, 12, 0>
<2, 12, 14>
<3, 13, 9>
<4, 14, 18>
<6, 12, 2>
<9, 13, 0>
<11, 15, 3>
<16, 14, 2>
