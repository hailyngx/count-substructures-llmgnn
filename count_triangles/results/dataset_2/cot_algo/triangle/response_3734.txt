Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 26) (3, 12) (3, 18) (15, 0) (15, 9) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 23) (22, 27) (22, 6) (22, 12) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (23, 18) (23, 8) (23, 7) (23, 27) (1, 8) (26, 3) (26, 5) (26, 20) (26, 0) (21, 28) (21, 0) (21, 9) (21, 14) (28, 21) (28, 7) (28, 24) (28, 25) (17, 8) (17, 13) (4, 12) (4, 29) (12, 3) (12, 22) (12, 4) (12, 29) (5, 26) (5, 20) (19, 18) (19, 29) (19, 14) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 6) (14, 21) (14, 19) (14, 11) (14, 24) (14, 2) (29, 4) (29, 12) (29, 19) (7, 23) (7, 28) (7, 24) (20, 26) (20, 5) (20, 9) (20, 16) (0, 15) (0, 26) (0, 21) (27, 22) (27, 23) (25, 28) (25, 16) (24, 28) (24, 14) (24, 7) (6, 22) (6, 11) (6, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 16) (9, 15) (9, 21) (9, 20) (9, 10) (2, 14) (16, 20) (16, 25) (16, 10) 

Response:
The graph provided with 30 nodes and 90 edges can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
(3, 26), (3, 12), (3, 18), 
(15, 0), (15, 9), 
(18, 3), (18, 19), (18, 23), 
(22, 27), (22, 6), (22, 12), 
(8, 13), (8, 23), (8, 11), (8, 17), (8, 1), 
(13, 8), (13, 17), 
(23, 18), (23, 8), (23, 7), (23, 27), 
(1, 8), 
(26, 5), (26, 20), (26, 0), 
(21, 28), (21, 0), (21, 9), (21, 14), 
(28, 7), (28, 24), (28, 25), 
(17, 13), 
(4, 29), 
(5, 20), 
(19, 29), 
(11, 14), (11, 6), 
(14, 24), (14, 2), 
(7, 24), 
(16, 25), 
(10, 9)

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in this graph.
