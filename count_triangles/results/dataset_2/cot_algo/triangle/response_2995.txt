Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. The degrees of each vertex in the given graph are:

Node 0: degree 5
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4

Sorted vertices based on their degrees:
Node 5 < Node 6 < Node 8 < Node 9 < Node 1 < Node 2 < Node 4 < Node 0 < Node 7 < Node 3

Now, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles:

1. Edge (5, 6): Nodes 5 and 6 share 0 common neighbors.
2. Edge (5, 0): Nodes 5 and 0 share 1 common neighbor, which is Node 3. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 5>
3. Edge (5, 3): Nodes 5 and 3 share 0 common neighbors.
4. Edge (9, 6): Nodes 9 and 6 share 0 common neighbors.
5. Edge (9, 2): Nodes 9 and 2 share 0 common neighbors.
6. Edge (9, 1): Nodes 9 and 1 share 1 common neighbor, which is Node 8. Triangle formed: <1, 8, 9>
7. Edge (9, 7): Nodes 9 and 7 share 2 common neighbors, which are Nodes 4 and 1. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 7>
8. Edge (6, 1): Nodes 6 and 1 share 0 common neighbors.
9. Edge (4, 7): Nodes 4 and 7 share 1 common neighbor, which is Node 0. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 7>
10. Edge (4, 0): Nodes 4 and 0 share 2 common neighbors, which are Nodes 3 and 7. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 4>
11. Edge (4, 3): Nodes 4 and 3 share 1 common neighbor, which is Node 0. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 4>
12. Edge (4, 2): Nodes 4 and 2 share 2 common neighbors, which are Nodes 9 and 3. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 4>
13. Edge (7, 9): Nodes 7 and 9 share 2 common neighbors, which are Nodes 1 and 4. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 7>
14. Edge (7, 4): Already counted.
15. Edge (7, 0): Nodes 7 and 0 share 1 common neighbor, which is Node 4. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 7>

17. Edge (7, 8): Nodes 7 and 8 share 0 common neighbors.
18. Edge (8, 2): Nodes 8 and 2 share 0 common neighbors.
19. Edge (8, 1): Nodes 8 and 1 share 0 common neighbors.
20. Edge (2, 9): Already counted.
21. Edge (2, 4): Already counted.
22. Edge (2, 8): Already counted.
