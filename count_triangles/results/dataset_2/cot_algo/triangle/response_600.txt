Now let's count the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method: 

Nodes sorted by degree: 
[ 0, 4, 5, 6, 1, 5, 4, 3, 3, 5, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 3, 3, 3, 1, 5, 5, 5, 4, 3, 5, 5 ]

Triangles: [390]

Unique triangles: 
<2, 16, 29> <0, 6, 14> <6, 7, 13> <6, 9, 23> <6, 2, 14> <6, 23, 12> <15, 27, 9> <15, 27, 13> <15, 27, 14> <15, 27, 28> <15, 10, 3> <15, 10, 27> <15, 26, 24> <15, 26, 12> <15, 14, 16> <27, 14, 2> <27, 9, 6> <27, 9, 23> <27, 13, 29> <3, 17, 1> <3, 17, 8> <3, 17, 29> <3, 17, 8> <17, 1, 7> <17, 1, 16> <17, 1, 22> <17, 1, 16> <29, 17, 1> <29, 17, 8>
