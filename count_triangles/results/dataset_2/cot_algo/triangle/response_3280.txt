Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 13) (7, 8) (6, 16) (6, 19) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 1) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 18) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 11) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 12) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 15) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 12) (1, 9) (2, 9) (2, 3) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 5) (5, 15) (5, 18) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 3) (13, 7) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 19) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: 14, 11
- 1: 9
- 2: 9, 3
- 3: 4, 2, 18, 19
- 4: 7, 8, 10, 14, 3
- 5: 15, 18
- 6: 16, 19, 13
- 7: 4, 13, 8
- 8: 4, 7, 12
- 9: 2, 1
- 10: 4, 17, 16
- 11: 0, 14, 12
- 12: 8, 11, 16, 15
- 13: 7, 6
- 14: 0, 4, 11
- 15: 12, 18, 5
- 16: 6, 10, 17, 12
- 17: 10, 16, 19, 18
- 18: 3, 5, 15, 17
- 19: 17, 6, 3

Now, we perform the Degree-Based Ordering:

Vertices by degree:
0(2), 1(1), 2(2), 3(4), 4(5), 5(2), 6(3), 7(3), 8(3), 9(2), 10(3), 11(3), 12(4), 13(2), 14(3), 15(3), 16(4), 17(4), 18(4), 19(3)

Lower labeled vertex has fewer connections for the following edges: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 3), (4, 10), (4, 14), (7, 13), (6, 16), (6, 19), (9, 2), (10, 17), (17, 18), (8, 12), (0, 14), (14, 11), (12, 15), (1, 9), (2, 3), (15, 18), (5, 18), (18, 3) 

Counting the triangles, we find:
Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<3, 4, 10>
<3, 4, 14>
<3, 16, 17>
<3, 16, 12>
<4, 10, 16>
<12, 15, 18>
