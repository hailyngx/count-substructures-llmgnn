Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 6) (22, 7) (15, 27) (15, 7) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 23) (27, 16) (5, 20) (5, 6) (5, 24) (20, 5) (20, 10) (18, 22) (18, 14) (18, 21) (0, 24) (0, 25) (7, 22) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 19) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 28) (12, 9) (6, 22) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 17) (1, 26) (1, 17) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 17) (24, 5) (24, 0) (24, 28) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 26) (2, 15) (2, 25) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 23) (4, 3) (10, 20) (10, 29) (23, 27) (23, 26) (23, 4) (23, 28) (16, 27) (16, 12) (16, 29) (16, 3) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 4) (9, 14) (29, 10) (29, 16) (29, 21) (3, 4) (3, 16) (3, 14) (11, 19) (11, 25) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 21) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 3) (28, 12) (28, 24) (28, 23) (21, 18) (21, 29) (21, 19) (25, 0) (25, 2) (25, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then renumbering the nodes accordingly. 

After sorting the nodes, the new numbering will be as follows:
0: 0
1: 1
2: 2
3: 3
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 7
8: 8
9: 9
10: 10
11: 11
12: 12
13: 13
14: 14
15: 15
16: 16
17: 17
18: 18
19: 19
20: 20
21: 21
22: 22
23: 23
24: 24
25: 25
26: 26
27: 27
28: 28
29: 29

After relabeling the nodes, we can count the triangles:
