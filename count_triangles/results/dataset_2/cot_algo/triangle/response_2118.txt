Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 5: Degree 3
Vertex 9: Degree 5
Vertex 4: Degree 4
Vertex 7: Degree 3
Vertex 10: Degree 6
Vertex 11: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 3
Vertex 6: Degree 5
Vertex 0: Degree 4
Vertex 14: Degree 4
Vertex 12: Degree 2
Vertex 13: Degree 4
Vertex 1: Degree 5
Vertex 3: Degree 3
Vertex 2: Degree 4

Now, we will relabel the vertices according to their degrees:

Vertex 12: Degree 2 
Vertices 5, 7, 8, 3: Degree 3
Vertices 4, 0, 11, 13: Degree 4
Vertices 9, 10, 14, 1, 2: Degree 5
Vertex 6: Degree 6

Now, we will examine each edge to count the number of triangles. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 10>
<0, 4, 13>
<0, 10, 13>
<1, 6, 11>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 10>
<9, 10, 11>
<9, 10, 13>
