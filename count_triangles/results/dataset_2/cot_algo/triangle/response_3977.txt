Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 23) (26, 20) (26, 6) (1, 14) (21, 4) (21, 2) (21, 29) (6, 9) (6, 26) (6, 24) (6, 3) (6, 4) (0, 27) (0, 18) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 18) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 5) (2, 21) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 17) (18, 0) (18, 27) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 8) (17, 2) (17, 23) (4, 21) (4, 6) (4, 16) (7, 3) (7, 28) (7, 23) (7, 14) (15, 13) (13, 15) (13, 12) (13, 29) (23, 26) (23, 11) (23, 17) (23, 7) (5, 26) (5, 11) (5, 20) (12, 2) (12, 13) (8, 18) (8, 20) (28, 7) (28, 14) (28, 24) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 22) (22, 19) (22, 24) (3, 6) (3, 7) (24, 9) (24, 6) (24, 28) (24, 22) (16, 18) (16, 4) (25, 9) (25, 10) (29, 21) (29, 27) (29, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 28) (20, 26) (20, 5) (20, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges is as follows:

1. Sort the nodes by the number of connections:
   Node 1: degree 1
   Node 3: degree 2
   Node 8: degree 2
   Node 16: degree 2
   Node 7: degree 3
   Node 17: degree 2
   Node 13: degree 3
   Node 15: degree 1
   Node 22: degree 2
   Node 12: degree 2
   Node 18: degree 5
   Node 0: degree 3
   Node 19: degree 3
   Node 2: degree 4
   Node 4: degree 3
   Node 21: degree 3
   Node 28: degree 3
   Node 20: degree 3
   Node 29: degree 3
   Node 14: degree 3
   Node 5: degree 3
   Node 10: degree 3
   Node 11: degree 3
   Node 25: degree 2
   Node 6: degree 5
   Node 24: degree 4
   Node 26: degree 5
   Node 9: degree 4
   Node 23: degree 4
   Node 27: degree 3

2. Relabel the nodes based on their degree:
   Nodes with the least connections get the lowest labels: 
   1 -> 0
   15 -> 1
   8 -> 2
   16 -> 3
   22 -> 4
   1: 0
   15: 1
   8: 2
   16: 3
   22: 4
   .
   .
   .

3. Proceed with the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:
   - Check for shared connections to count the triangles.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [46].
The unique triangles found are:
<23, 26, 5>
<2, 21, 4>
<29, 13, 15>
<6, 9, 26>
<7, 23, 17>
<0, 18, 27>
<6, 24, 28>
<18, 2, 17>
<4, 6, 24>
<6, 4, 16>
<10, 11, 25>
<5, 20, 26>
<7, 28, 14>
<9, 6, 24>
<11, 5, 20>
<7, 3, 23>
<0, 19, 10>
<21, 4, 6>
<25, 9, 26>
<18, 8, 20>
<27, 18, 2>
<24, 22, 19>
<16, 4, 21>
<13, 29, 27>
<16, 18, 8>
<2, 12, 13>
<24, 22, 19>

<6, 4, 21>
<14, 7, 28>
