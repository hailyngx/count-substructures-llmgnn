Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 3) (27, 7) (3, 27) (3, 24) (3, 10) (7, 27) (7, 17) (12, 15) (6, 21) (6, 17) (6, 29) (6, 19) (21, 6) (21, 13) (21, 2) (4, 27) (4, 28) (4, 20) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 1) (9, 13) (14, 26) (14, 11) (14, 20) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 0) (26, 17) (1, 9) (1, 22) (2, 21) (2, 26) (16, 22) (16, 5) (16, 20) (28, 4) (28, 13) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 13) (29, 6) (29, 18) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 26) (17, 19) (5, 16) (5, 23) (5, 25) (5, 22) (23, 5) (23, 0) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 17) (13, 21) (13, 9) (13, 28) (13, 11) (24, 3) (24, 18) (24, 25) (25, 9) (25, 5) (25, 24) (25, 0) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 22) (18, 29) (18, 24) (18, 10) (22, 1) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 20) (0, 26) (0, 23) (0, 25) (20, 4) (20, 14) (20, 16) (20, 22) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed from the given edges as follows:

Nodes: 30 
Edges: 90

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections).

Node degree:
0: 3
1: 2
2: 3
3: 4
4: 4
5: 4
6: 4
7: 3
8: 2
9: 5
10: 4
11: 4
12: 2
13: 4
14: 3
15: 2
16: 4
17: 5
18: 3
19: 4
20: 4
21: 3
22: 5
23: 2
24: 3
25: 4
26: 4
27: 5
28: 3
29: 3

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 26]
