Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 6) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 12) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 9) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 1) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices based on their degree. The vertices and their degrees are as follows:

Vertex 0: Degree 3
Vertex 1: Degree 3
Vertex 2: Degree 5
Vertex 3: Degree 2
Vertex 4: Degree 4
Vertex 5: Degree 4
Vertex 6: Degree 3
Vertex 7: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 2
Vertex 9: Degree 4
Vertex 10: Degree 6
Vertex 11: Degree 3
Vertex 12: Degree 3
Vertex 13: Degree 4
Vertex 14: Degree 6

Now, relabeling the vertices starting from 0 (the vertex with the lowest degree) to 14 (the vertex with the highest degree), we get the following new labels for the vertices:

New Label:
0 -> 3
1 -> 3
2 -> 4
3 -> 0
4 -> 2
5 -> 2
6 -> 3
7 -> 2
8 -> 0
9 -> 2
10 -> 6
11 -> 3
12 -> 3
13 -> 2
14 -> 6

Next, based on the condition that for each edge only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we consider the triangles formed by the edges:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 6, 13>
<1, 2, 5>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 13>
<2, 5, 10>
<2, 7, 10>
<2, 9, 13>
<3, 2, 4>
<3, 2, 5>
<3, 11, 12>
<4, 9, 13>
<6, 12, 14>
<10, 11, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
