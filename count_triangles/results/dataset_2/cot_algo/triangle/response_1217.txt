Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (4, 18) (4, 9) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 11) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 6) (15, 19) (15, 13) (13, 15) (13, 17) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 5) (0, 2) (0, 17) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 9) (7, 10) (7, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 17) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 14) (5, 17) (5, 12) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 10) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their number of connections in ascending order.

Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 5 connections.
Node 11 has 3 connections.
Node 10 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 5 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 18 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 5 connections.
Node 6 has 5 connections.
Node 0 has 4 connections.
Node 12 has 3 connections.
Node 15 has 2 connections.
Node 13 has 3 connections.
Node 17 has 5 connections.
Node 19 has 3 connections.
Node 16 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 14 has 3 connections.
   
Based on the degree-based ordering of nodes, we can now count the triangles formed by the edges given.

The total number of triangles is [51].

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 11>
<2, 6, 17>
<2, 9, 12>
<2, 9, 16>
<3, 10, 18>
<3, 11, 18>
<5, 12, 17>
<7, 10, 14>
<9, 12, 16>
<13, 15, 19>
