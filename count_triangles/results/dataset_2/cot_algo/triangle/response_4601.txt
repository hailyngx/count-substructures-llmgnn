Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 18) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (18, 17) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 10) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 10) (1, 0) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 10) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (19, 5) (19, 9) (19, 2) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 1) (16, 8) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 11) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degree is as follows:
Node 16: Degree 1
Node 18: Degree 1
Node 19: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 10: Degree 3
Node 11: Degree 3
Node 12: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 4
Node 15: Degree 3
Node 17: Degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will traverse the edges in the order of the lower labeled node having fewer connections. 

The triangles found within the graph are: 
- <0, 1, 10>
- <0, 17, 15>
- <0, 7, 10>
- <1, 10, 7>
- <1, 10, 13>
- <2, 9, 19>
- <4, 0, 17>
- <4, 0, 3>
- <6, 13, 10>
- <6, 13, 5>
- <6, 12, 11>
- <7, 14, 10>
- <15, 14, 17>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
