Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 14) (16, 5) (14, 16) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 2) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 13) (12, 13) (12, 15) (12, 19) (5, 16) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 8) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 4) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 0) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 8) (18, 7) (15, 17) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 13) (3, 17) (1, 11) (1, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 4) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 2) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 15) (10, 2) 

Response:
The vertices with their connections are as follows after sorting them in the Degree-Based Ordering:

0: 3 connections
1: 2 connections
3: 1 connection
6: 3 connections
9: 2 connections
7: 3 connections
12: 3 connections
18: 1 connection
10: 1 connection
2: 4 connections
4: 4 connections
8: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
19: 4 connections
13: 4 connections
15: 4 connections
17: 4 connections
11: 4 connections
16: 4 connections
14: 2 connections

After going through the edges while respecting the ordering and counting the number of triangles formed by shared connections, we count a total of 56 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [56].

Some of the unique triangles found are:
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 8, 19>
<0, 16, 5>
<0, 16, 14>
<0, 16, 11>
<1, 4, 17>
<2, 4, 17>
<2, 5, 19>
<2, 5, 16>
<4, 13, 15>
