Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 16) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 3) (4, 15) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 17) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 12) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 3) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 18) (5, 19) (5, 8) (19, 6) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 0) (15, 4) (15, 2) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 8) (13, 17) (13, 16) (0, 19) (0, 16) (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (14, 11) (14, 19) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 16) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 19) (2, 15) (2, 1) (18, 6) (18, 3) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be described as below:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (6, 18), (6, 19), (6, 16), (9, 2), (9, 7), (4, 3), (4, 15), (7, 9), (7, 12), (7, 17), (7, 8), (10, 11), (10, 17), (11, 10), (11, 3), (11, 14), (17, 7), (17, 10), (17, 13), (17, 12), (12, 7), (12, 17), (12, 3), (3, 4), (3, 11), (3, 12), (3, 2), (3, 18), (5, 19), (5, 8), (19, 6), (19, 5), (19, 2), (19, 14), (19, 0), (15, 4), (15, 2), (16, 6), (16, 0), (16, 13), (16, 8), (13, 17), (13, 16), (0, 19), (0, 16), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (14, 11), (14, 19), (8, 7), (8, 5), (8, 16), (2, 9), (2, 3), (2, 19), (2, 15), (2, 1), (18, 6), (18, 3)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on the number of connections they have:

Nodes: 1, 5, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 18, 4, 8, 12, 16, 0, 19, 6, 11, 7, 17, 2, 3

Now, let's count the number of triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [16]

Unique triangles found: <3, 11, 14>, <3, 12, 17>, <3, 2, 11>, <4, 3, 15>, <2, 3, 1>, <2, 3, 15>, <7, 8, 16>, <7, 9, 17>, <7, 12, 17>, <11, 10, 17>, <0, 1, 19>, <0, 16, 6>, <0, 16, 13>, <5, 8, 19>, <5, 8, 16>, <6, 16, 13>
