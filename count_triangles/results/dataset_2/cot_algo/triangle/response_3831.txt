Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Edges:
(5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7),
(4, 8), (4, 2), (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 3),
(8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 3),
(6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 7),
(2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 1), (2, 0),
(0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 1),
(7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 1),
(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 0), (1, 7),
(3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 7)

Now, let's identify the degree of each node:
Node 0: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 4

After sorting the nodes based on their degrees, the new labels are:
0 -> 2
1 -> 6
2 -> 8
3 -> 5
4 -> 0
5 -> 3
6 -> 7
7 -> 1
8 -> 4

Now, let's count the triangles:
Triangles: [<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 4>]

The total number of triangles is [3].
