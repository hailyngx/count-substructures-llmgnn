Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 12) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: [(4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 9), (4, 14), (7, 12), (7, 2), (7, 5), (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 0), (6, 13), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 10), (8, 0), (8, 3), (13, 12), (13, 10), (10, 11), (11, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 14), (0, 8), (0, 3), (2, 12), (2, 14), (12, 11), (1, 14)]

After sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections), we get the following ordering:
Nodes ordered by degree: [1, 4, 8, 11, 13, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 14, 0, 7, 10, 12]

Now, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:

1. For the edge (1, 14):
    - Node 1 has degree 2, node 14 has degree 5.
    - Check for shared connections between nodes 1 and 14. No triangles are formed.
2. For the edge (4, 7):
    - Node 4 has degree 4, node 7 has degree 4.
    - Check for shared connections between nodes 4 and 7. Shared connection with node 12 forms a triangle: <4, 7, 12>.
3. For the edge (8, 10):
    - Node 8 has degree 3, node 10 has degree 4.
    - Check for shared connections between nodes 8 and 10. No triangles are formed.
4. For the edge (11, 1):
    - Node 11 has degree 2, node 1 has degree 2.
    - Check for shared connections between nodes 11 and 1. No triangles are formed.
5. For the edge (13, 12):
    - Node 13 has degree 3, node 12 has degree 4.
    - Check for shared connections between nodes 13 and 12. No triangles are formed.
6. For the edge (2, 12):
    - Node 2 has degree 4, node 12 has degree 4.
    - Check for shared connections between nodes 2 and 12. No triangles are formed.
7. For the edge (3, 5):
    - Node 3 has degree 4, node 5 has degree 5.
    - Check for shared connections between nodes 3 and 5. No triangles are formed.
8. For the edge (5, 0):
    - Node 5 has degree 5, node 0 has degree 5.
    - Check for shared connections between nodes 5 and 0. No triangles are formed.
9. For the edge (6, 9):
    - Node 6 has degree 4, node 9 has degree 4.
    - Check for shared connections between nodes 6 and 9. No triangles are formed.

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <4, 7, 12>
