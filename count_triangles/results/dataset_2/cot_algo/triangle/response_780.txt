Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the nodes based on their number of connections. The labels are assigned as follows after sorting:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 8: 7 connections

Next, we will iterate through the edges of the graph and count the number of triangles. We will only count a triangle once, considering the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections. 

Using the given graph, we find that there are 8 triangles in total: 

[8]

The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
