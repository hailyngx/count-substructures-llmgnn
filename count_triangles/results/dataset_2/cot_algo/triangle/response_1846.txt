Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 0) (6, 13) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 9) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 9) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 14) 

Response:
The given graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: 4, 6, 7, 1
- 1: 10, 5, 8, 0
- 2: 9, 13
- 3: 7, 11, 8, 14, 13, 9
- 4: 12, 0, 5, 14
- 5: 4, 6, 13, 1
- 6: 11, 5, 0, 13
- 7: 12, 10, 0, 3
- 8: 10, 1, 14, 3
- 9: 12, 2, 3, 14
- 10: 7, 8, 1
- 11: 3, 6
- 12: 4, 7, 13, 9
- 13: 5, 6, 12, 3, 14, 2
- 14: 8, 4, 3, 13, 9

Now, let's find the triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices by number of connections (degree):
0(4), 1(4), 2(2), 3(6), 4(4), 5(4), 6(4), 7(4), 8(4), 9(4), 10(3), 11(2), 12(4), 13(6), 14(5)

Triangles: 12
