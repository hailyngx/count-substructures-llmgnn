Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method begins by sorting the vertices based on their degree. 

The number of connections for each node are:
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

The sorted vertices are:
6 (1 connection)
4 (4 connections)
5 (4 connections)
7 (4 connections)
9 (4 connections)
0 (5 connections)
1 (5 connections)
2 (5 connections)
3 (5 connections)
8 (5 connections)

Following the procedure of the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles. 

The total number of triangles is [6].  
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 9>
