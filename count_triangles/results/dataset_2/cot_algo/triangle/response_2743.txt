Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 18) (9, 21) (26, 9) (26, 28) (26, 15) (26, 2) (6, 24) (6, 3) (6, 16) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (25, 13) (25, 14) (25, 2) (10, 4) (10, 14) (17, 12) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 22) (4, 28) (4, 29) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 7) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 5) (28, 26) (28, 4) (28, 16) (0, 21) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 18) (7, 22) (20, 14) (20, 23) (29, 9) (29, 4) (16, 6) (16, 28) (16, 24) (1, 11) (1, 23) (1, 13) (22, 4) (22, 7) (22, 24) (24, 6) (24, 16) (24, 22) (24, 12) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 27) (18, 15) (15, 26) (15, 18) (15, 19) (19, 15) (2, 26) (2, 3) (2, 25) (21, 9) (21, 0) (13, 25) (13, 1) (13, 23) (13, 27) (27, 18) (27, 13) (27, 5) (27, 23) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 24) (23, 20) (23, 1) (23, 13) (23, 27) (14, 25) (14, 10) (14, 20) (5, 11) (5, 27) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with 30 nodes based on the given edges. 
Now, let's calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted by their degree:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 5
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 2
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 3
Node 16: degree 3
Node 17: degree 2
Node 18: degree 5
Node 19: degree 1
Node 20: degree 2
Node 21: degree 2
Node 22: degree 3
Node 23: degree 4
Node 24: degree 4
Node 25: degree 3
Node 26: degree 4
Node 27: degree 4
Node 28: degree 4
Node 29: degree 3
