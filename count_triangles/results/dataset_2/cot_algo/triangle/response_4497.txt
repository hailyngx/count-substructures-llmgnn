Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 3) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 4) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 4) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: 
- 0: {3, 12}
- 1: {2, 4, 10, 12, 14}
- 2: {1, 5, 9, 11}
- 3: {0, 8, 13, 14, 11}
- 4: {1, 6, 10, 11, 5}
- 5: {2, 4, 6, 9}
- 6: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- 7: {10, 11, 13, 14}
- 8: {3, 6, 9, 13}
- 9: {2, 5, 6, 8, 12}
- 10: {1, 4, 7, 12}
- 11: {2, 3, 4, 7}
- 12: {0, 1, 9, 10}
- 13: {3, 7, 8}
- 14: {1, 3, 7}

Degree-based Ordering:
Node Connections: 
0: 2
1: 5
2: 4
3: 5
4: 5
5: 4
6: 4
7: 4
8: 4
9: 5
10: 4
11: 4
12: 4
13: 3
14: 3

Reorder Nodes based on connections:
Nodes: {13, 14, 5, 2, 6, 8, 7, 10, 11, 12, 3, 4, 0, 1, 9}

Triangles:
[14]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph, and it is <14, 3, 7>.
