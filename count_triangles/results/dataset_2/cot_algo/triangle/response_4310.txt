Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on their degree and then checking for triangles using the specified procedure. 

Given that the graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges, the sorted list of vertices based on their degrees from lowest to highest is as follows:
1. Node 6 - degree 2
2. Node 7 - degree 2
3. Node 3 - degree 3
4. Node 8 - degree 3
5. Node 1 - degree 3
6. Node 4 - degree 4
7. Node 0 - degree 4
8. Node 2 - degree 5
9. Node 9 - degree 6
10. Node 5 - degree 7

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed by checking shared connections. 

After going through all the edges, the total number of triangles found is [35].
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 9, 5>
<0, 9, 2>
<0, 9, 1>
<0, 9, 7>
<0, 9, 8>
<0, 9, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 8, 7>
<0, 8, 2>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 2>
<0, 3, 1>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 8, 7>
<5, 9, 7>
<5, 9, 2>
<5, 9, 1>
<5, 9, 0>
