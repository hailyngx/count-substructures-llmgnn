Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 4) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 3) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 11) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 3) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices based on their degrees to label them accordingly. 
Here is the list of vertices with their degrees:
Vertex 0: Degree 3
Vertex 1: Degree 3
Vertex 2: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 5
Vertex 4: Degree 4
Vertex 5: Degree 3
Vertex 6: Degree 3
Vertex 7: Degree 3
Vertex 8: Degree 3
Vertex 9: Degree 6
Vertex 10: Degree 4
Vertex 11: Degree 4
Vertex 12: Degree 3
Vertex 13: Degree 6
Vertex 14: Degree 4

Based on the degree-based ordering, the list of edges to consider (lower labeled vertex has fewer connections) is as follows:
(0, 9), (0, 14), (0, 10), (1, 7), (1, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6), (4, 13), (4, 10), (4, 1), (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 3), (7, 14), (7, 3), (8, 10), (8, 12), (8, 3), (9, 2), (9, 10), (9, 13), (9, 0), (9, 12), (10, 4), (10, 3), (11, 6), (11, 4), (11, 2), (12, 9), (12, 8), (13, 5), (13, 9), (13, 14), (13, 4), (13, 3), (14, 0), (14, 7), (14, 2), (14, 13)

Counting the triangles formed by these edges, we find:
[Total number of triangles: 9] 

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 6, 11>, <4, 13, 3>, <4, 13, 11>, <4, 1, 11>, <0, 9, 2>, <0, 9, 12>, <3, 8, 10>, <13, 5, 9>, <13, 2, 14>
