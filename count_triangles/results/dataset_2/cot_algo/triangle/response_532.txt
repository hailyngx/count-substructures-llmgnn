Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 23) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 14) (5, 9) (5, 16) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 2) (0, 27) (0, 29) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 1) (23, 13) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 24) (20, 2) (20, 11) (2, 9) (2, 20) (2, 7) (18, 27) (18, 26) (18, 12) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 18) (26, 17) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 3) (4, 10) (4, 25) (4, 29) (4, 21) (12, 18) (12, 6) (3, 8) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 19) (28, 3) (28, 14) (17, 26) (17, 25) (17, 16) (17, 11) (25, 9) (25, 4) (25, 17) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 14) (15, 19) (19, 3) (19, 15) (7, 2) (7, 10) (29, 0) (29, 4) (1, 27) (1, 24) (11, 20) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 21) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 16) (21, 4) (21, 11) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 7) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 11) (24, 23) (24, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles in the graph efficiently. Let's compute the number of triangles based on the given graph information.

Sorting the nodes by their degree:
Nodes in increasing order of degree: 15, 28, 1, 5, 7, 20, 19, 21, 2, 18, 12, 4, 16, 14, 11, 17, 10, 8, 3, 25, 27, 0, 9, 29, 26, 24, 22, 23, 6, 13

Calculating the number of triangles:
<triangles count>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [<triangles count>].
