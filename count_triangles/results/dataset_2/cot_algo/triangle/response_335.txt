Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 3) (9, 27) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 29) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 8) (0, 7) (0, 20) (0, 19) (20, 9) (20, 0) (20, 28) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 24) (8, 21) (28, 20) (28, 11) (28, 16) (29, 4) (29, 16) (29, 18) (21, 8) (21, 26) (21, 18) (11, 28) (11, 12) (11, 15) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 22) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 19) (16, 27) (13, 15) (17, 25) (17, 6) (17, 24) (17, 27) (25, 17) (25, 23) (23, 25) (23, 10) (26, 21) (26, 2) (26, 15) (26, 27) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 22) (19, 1) (22, 3) (22, 19) (22, 24) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 2) (14, 3) (14, 18) (2, 26) (2, 6) (15, 11) (15, 13) (15, 26) (15, 6) (24, 8) (24, 17) (24, 22) (10, 23) (18, 29) (18, 21) (18, 14) (12, 5) (12, 11) (27, 9) (27, 16) (27, 17) (27, 26) (1, 5) (1, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. Let's begin by rearranging the vertices:

- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 5
- Node 10 has degree 1
- Node 11 has degree 4
- Node 12 has degree 2
- Node 13 has degree 1
- Node 14 has degree 2
- Node 15 has degree 4
- Node 16 has degree 4
- Node 17 has degree 4
- Node 18 has degree 3
- Node 19 has degree 5
- Node 20 has degree 3
- Node 21 has degree 3
- Node 22 has degree 3
- Node 23 has degree 2
- Node 24 has degree 3
- Node 25 has degree 2
- Node 26 has degree 4
- Node 27 has degree 4
- Node 28 has degree 3
- Node 29 has degree 4

Now, let's count the triangles:

1. For the edge between node 5 and node 9: (5, 9)
- Node 5: {1, 9, 12}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 20, 27}
- Shared connections between Node 5 and Node 9: {5}
- Triangle formed: <5, 9, 20>

2. For the edge between node 5 and node 12: (5, 12)
- Node 5: {1, 9, 12}
- Node 12: {5, 11}
- Shared connections between Node 5 and Node 12: {5}
- Triangle formed: <5, 12, 11>

3. For the edge between node 5 and node 1: (5, 1)
- Node 5: {1, 9, 12}
- Node 1: {5, 19}
- Shared connections between Node 5 and Node 1: {5}
- Triangle formed: <5, 1, 19>

[Total number of triangles: 3]
