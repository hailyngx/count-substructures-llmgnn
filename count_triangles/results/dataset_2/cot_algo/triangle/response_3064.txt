Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 4) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 5) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 15) (8, 6) (8, 18) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 9) (15, 16) (15, 2) (15, 18) (13, 1) (12, 16) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 18) (14, 11) (14, 10) (14, 4) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 0) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 6) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 19) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 12) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 9) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering can be done as follows:
Nodes with their degree in brackets:  
(0) -> 4  
(5) -> 4  
(13) -> 1  
(17) -> 2  
(3) -> 3  
(2) -> 4  
(15) -> 3  
(18) -> 3  
(8) -> 2  
(1) -> 4  
(12) -> 4  
(14) -> 3  
(4) -> 4  
(10) -> 3  
(6) -> 4  
(9) -> 3  
(19) -> 3  
(7) -> 3  
(11) -> 2  
(16) -> 4  

Using the degree-based ordering, we process the edges in the following order:
(13, 1), (17, 5), (8, 6), (11, 7), (15, 18), (9, 4), (19, 1), (6, 0), (16, 12), (10, 14), (4, 3), (9, 19), (12, 18), (14, 10), (5, 0), (2, 15), (7, 11), (3, 2), (6, 4), (17, 10), (5, 1), (14, 4), (12, 2), (15, 2), (16, 15), (11, 16), (16, 3), (16, 11), (0, 6), (1, 12), (7, 19), (11, 14), (10, 6), (3, 4), (18, 12), (19, 9), (4, 6), (2, 3), (18, 15), (7, 19), (1, 19), (8, 18), (0, 5), (18, 8), (4, 9), (6, 10), (6, 8), (5, 17), (14, 11), (15, 16), (19, 7), (12, 16)
