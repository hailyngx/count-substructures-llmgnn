Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 8) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 10) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph:

- Sort vertices based on the number of connections from least to most:
Node 12 has 0 connections.
Nodes 0, 9, 10 have 1 connection each.
Nodes 1, 11, 13 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 2, 5 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 6, 8 have 4 connections each.
Nodes 3, 7 have 5 connections each.
Node 4 has 6 connections.

- Relabel the vertices accordingly:
Node 12 -> 0
Node 0 -> 1
Node 9 -> 2
Node 10 -> 3
Node 1 -> 4
Node 11 -> 5
Node 13 -> 6
Node 2 -> 7
Node 5 -> 8
Node 6 -> 9
Node 8 -> 10
Node 3 -> 11
Node 7 -> 12
Node 4 -> 13

Now we will count the triangles:
For each edge, we only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

After checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge, we find that there are:
1 triangle: <1, 3, 4>
1 triangle: <1, 7, 12>
1 triangle: <2, 0, 5>
1 triangle: <2, 3, 11>
1 triangle: <2, 8, 13>
1 triangle: <3, 1, 4>
1 triangle: <3, 5, 12>
1 triangle: <3, 6, 10>
1 triangle: <5, 1, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
