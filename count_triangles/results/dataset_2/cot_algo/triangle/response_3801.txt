Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 7) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 19) (11, 8) (11, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 18) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 16) (5, 15) (5, 0) (19, 3) (6, 1) (6, 15) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 4) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 7) (12, 2) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 16) (7, 9) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 7) (9, 13) (9, 7) (18, 13) (18, 1) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently in a graph. Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges.

By sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes by degree:
Node 5: degree 2
Node 11: degree 2
Node 12: degree 2
Node 14: degree 2
Node 2: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 17: degree 3
Node 18: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 16: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 10: degree 5
Node 0: degree 6
Node 15: degree 6
Node 8: degree 6
Node 19: degree 6

Now, we will count the triangles by examining the edges in the graph:
- For each edge, we check if the node with the lower label has fewer connections.
- Then we count the triangles formed by shared connections.

After calculating, we find:
[Total number of triangles: 7]
<1, 4, 18>
<1, 15, 6>
<2, 7, 16>
<3, 10, 0>
<3, 10, 4>
<3, 11, 8>
<1, 18, 13>
