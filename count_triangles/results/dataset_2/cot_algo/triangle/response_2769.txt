Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. Then, relabel the vertices accordingly from lowest degree to highest degree. 

After relabeling the vertices, the new numbering is as follows:
Node 0 - Degree 8
Node 1 - Degree 4
Node 2 - Degree 5
Node 3 - Degree 4
Node 4 - Degree 4
Node 5 - Degree 5
Node 6 - Degree 4
Node 7 - Degree 4
Node 8 - Degree 3
Node 9 - Degree 4

Using the relabeled nodes, we can now count the number of triangles present in the graph by examining the shared connections between edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles is: [6]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
