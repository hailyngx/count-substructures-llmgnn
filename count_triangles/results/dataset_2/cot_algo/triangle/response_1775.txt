Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
(5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) 
(4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) 
(3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) 
(6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6)

After sorting the nodes based on their degree of connections in ascending order, we get:

Nodes: 0, 9, 5, 7, 2, 6, 8, 3, 1, 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges as following the rule where the lower labeled vertex should have fewer connections:

Triangles found in the graph are:
[8] <1, 3, 9>
