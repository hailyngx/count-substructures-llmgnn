Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 0) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 0) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 14) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 9) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) 

Response:
Let's now count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method as described earlier. 

The vertices and their degrees are:
- Node 0: degree 7
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 5

We will proceed in the order of vertices with the lowest degree:
- Starting from Node 6 (minimum degree), we move in increasing order based on the degree of the nodes.

Now, let's count the triangles and the total number of triangles:
- Triangles: <0, 1, 11>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 8, 11>, <0, 10, 13>, <1, 11, 14>, <3, 5, 13>, <3, 7, 14>, <5, 7, 14>
- Total number of triangles: [8]
