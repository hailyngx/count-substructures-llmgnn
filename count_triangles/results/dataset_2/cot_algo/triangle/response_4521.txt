Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 7), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 0), (6, 5), (6, 7), (1, 5), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7), (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 8), (3, 4), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 4), (2, 0), (8, 9), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 7), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 1), (7, 8), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 2), (0, 8), (0, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 0)

Next, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices by degree: 3 < 6 < 2 < 9 < 0 < 1 < 4 < 8 < 7 < 5

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 3 (Degree: 2) -> Vertex 0
Vertex 6 (Degree: 2) -> Vertex 1
Vertex 2 (Degree: 2) -> Vertex 2
Vertex 9 (Degree: 4) -> Vertex 3
Vertex 0 (Degree: 5) -> Vertex 4
Vertex 1 (Degree: 5) -> Vertex 5
Vertex 4 (Degree: 4) -> Vertex 6
Vertex 8 (Degree: 5) -> Vertex 7
Vertex 7 (Degree: 4) -> Vertex 8
Vertex 5 (Degree: 4) -> Vertex 9

Now, we will list the unique triangles found:

<1, 6, 7>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [20].
