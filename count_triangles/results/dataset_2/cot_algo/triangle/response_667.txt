Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 17) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 10) (0, 16) (0, 1) (0, 6) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 10) (18, 19) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 6) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (11, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 4) (14, 1) (2, 9) (2, 1) (17, 12) (6, 15) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 19) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Node Degrees:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 2
- Node 3: 3
- Node 4: 4
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 4
- Node 10: 3
- Node 11: 2
- Node 12: 5
- Node 13: 4
- Node 14: 2
- Node 15: 4
- Node 16: 3
- Node 17: 1
- Node 18: 1
- Node 19: 3

Based on the degrees, the ordering of the nodes is:
17, 18, 2, 11, 0, 16, 10, 5, 3, 19, 15, 8, 13, 9, 1, 4, 6, 14, 7, 12

Starting to count triangles:
- Triangle <1, 7, 12> found.

Total number of triangles = [1]
