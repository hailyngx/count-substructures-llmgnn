Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (14, 8) (14, 6) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (1, 11) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 12) 

Response:
The graph representation based on the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 9), (1, 9), (1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 13), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 10), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 13), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 13), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 14), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 14), (9, 11), (9, 13), (10, 11), (10, 8), (11, 12), (11, 9), (12, 13), (13, 4)

Next, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method by sorting the vertices based on their degree.

Vertices in order of degree (ascending): 0, 12, 5, 14, 3, 10, 4, 12, 6, 1, 13, 11, 8, 2, 9

After relabeling the vertices based on the degree order, we can move on to count the triangles by analyzing the unique triangles formed:

Total number of triangles: [10]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 12>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 9, 11>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 8, 10>
