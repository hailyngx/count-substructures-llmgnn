Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 3) (29, 2) (29, 25) (29, 15) (29, 22) (29, 18) (10, 17) (10, 22) (17, 10) (17, 23) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 23) (20, 0) (20, 27) (1, 26) (1, 7) (1, 27) (1, 8) (26, 1) (21, 28) (21, 8) (21, 18) (28, 21) (28, 16) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 15) (5, 2) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 24) (13, 9) (13, 27) (16, 0) (16, 28) (16, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 15) (7, 27) (14, 15) (14, 25) (8, 1) (8, 21) (8, 24) (8, 6) (24, 13) (24, 8) (19, 3) (19, 27) (19, 12) (15, 29) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 22) (4, 13) (4, 16) (22, 29) (22, 10) (22, 15) (25, 29) (25, 14) (25, 18) (23, 17) (23, 0) (23, 9) (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 6) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 3) (9, 13) (9, 23) (18, 29) (18, 21) (18, 11) (18, 25) (27, 20) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 7) (27, 19) (12, 19) 

Response:
The graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Now, applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we calculate the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree = 4
- Node 1: degree = 4
- Node 2: degree = 3
- Node 3: degree = 3
- Node 4: degree = 3
- Node 5: degree = 2
- Node 6: degree = 3
- Node 7: degree = 4
- Node 8: degree = 4
- Node 9: degree = 2
- Node 10: degree = 2
- Node 11: degree = 3
- Node 12: degree = 1
- Node 13: degree = 5
- Node 14: degree = 2
- Node 15: degree = 5
- Node 16: degree = 4
- Node 17: degree = 2
- Node 18: degree = 4
- Node 19: degree = 3
- Node 20: degree = 2
- Node 21: degree = 3
- Node 22: degree = 3
- Node 23: degree = 3
- Node 24: degree = 2
- Node 25: degree = 3
- Node 26: degree = 1
- Node 27: degree = 5
- Node 28: degree = 2
- Node 29: degree = 6

Relabeling the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 12 (degree 1): A
- Node 26 (degree 1): B
- Node 20 (degree 2): C
- Node 24 (degree 2): D
- Node 28 (degree 2): E
- Node 9 (degree 2): F
- Node 10 (degree 2): G
- Node 1 (degree 4): H
- Node 0 (degree 4): I
- Node 7 (degree 4): J
- Node 16 (degree 4): K
- Node 23 (degree 3): L
- Node 19 (degree 3): M
- Node 3 (degree 3): N
- Node 6 (degree 3): O
- Node 5 (degree 2): P
- Node 17 (degree 2): Q
- Node 4 (degree 3): R
- Node 22 (degree 3): S
- Node 15 (degree 5): T
- Node 14 (degree 2): U
- Node 8 (degree 4): V
- Node 11 (degree 3): W
- Node 25 (degree 3): X
- Node 18 (degree 4): Y
- Node 27 (degree 5): Z
- Node 2 (degree 3): AA
- Node 29 (degree 6): BB

Now, counting the triangles:
- Total triangles: [44]

Unique triangles found:
