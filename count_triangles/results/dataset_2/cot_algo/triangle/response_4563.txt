Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 7) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 14) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 5) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by degree: 
0(2) 11(1) 1(3) 3(3) 8(3) 12(3) 14(3) 9(4) 5(4) 6(4) 10(4) 7(5) 13(6) 4(7) 2(5)
