Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 14) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Node 10: 5 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

The edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections are:
(6, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 6, 9, 13
(6, 5) forms a triangle with nodes 6, 5, 13
(6, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 6, 1, 11
(6, 14) forms a triangle with nodes 6, 14, 10
(6, 2) forms a triangle with nodes 6, 2, 1
(9, 8) forms a triangle with nodes 9, 8, 4
(4, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 4, 7, 13
(4, 8) forms a triangle with nodes 4, 8, 9
(4, 11) forms a triangle with nodes 4, 11, 1
(4, 3) forms a triangle with nodes 4, 3, 14
(8, 3) forms a triangle with nodes 8, 3, 14
(13, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 13, 7, 4
(13, 5) forms a triangle with nodes 13, 5, 6
(12, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 12, 7, 4
(12, 10) forms a triangle with nodes 12, 10, 14
(5, 2) forms a triangle with nodes 5, 2, 6
(7, 0) forms a triangle with nodes 7, 0, 10
(0, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 9, 13
(1, 6) forms a triangle with nodes 1, 6, 2

Total number of triangles: [18]
