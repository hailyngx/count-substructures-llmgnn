Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 14) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 12) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes can be represented as follows based on their degree:
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 8: 5 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections
- Node 10: 2 connections
- Node 11: 4 connections
- Node 12: 4 connections
- Node 13: 6 connections
- Node 14: 4 connections

Based on the degree-based ordering, we can calculate the number of triangles in the graph.

Let's list the triangles formed by the shared connections:
- <0, 3, 12>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 8, 12>
- <2, 4, 13>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <2, 4, 13>
- <2, 4, 14>
- <2, 9, 6>
- <2, 9, 0>
- <2, 9, 6>
- <2, 13, 4>
- <3, 6, 11>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <3, 12, 11>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <6, 7, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
