Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph with nodes and edges is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: 2, 3, 4, 8, 9
- 1: 2, 3, 9
- 2: 0, 1, 6
- 3: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7
- 4: 0, 3, 7
- 5: 3, 6, 7
- 6: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- 7: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- 8: 0, 7, 9
- 9: 0, 1, 6, 8

Degree-Based Ordering (sorted by the number of connections):
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 6: 6 connections

Now, we will count the triangles:

Triangles: [<0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 1>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 8, 7>, <2, 6, 1>, <2, 6, 3>, <2, 6, 5>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 5>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 5>, <4, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 9>]

Total number of triangles: [22]
