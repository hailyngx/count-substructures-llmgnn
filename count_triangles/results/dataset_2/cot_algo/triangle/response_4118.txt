Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- 0: {1, 6, 8, 2}
- 1: {9, 4, 0}
- 2: {5, 4, 3, 6, 0}
- 3: {6, 2, 8}
- 4: {5, 7, 8, 2, 1, 6}
- 5: {9, 2, 8, 4, 7}
- 6: {9, 4, 3, 2, 0}
- 7: {5, 4}
- 8: {5, 4, 3, 0}
- 9: {5, 6, 1}

Next, let's apply Degree-Based Ordering by sorting the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes sorted by degree:
{7, 1, 3, 9, 8, 0, 6, 5, 2, 4}

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Triangles: 
[6]

Unique triangles: 
<5, 8, 4>
