Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 3) (8, 12) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 14) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order. Then, relabel the vertices accordingly. 

1. Node 6 (degree 1)
2. Node 8 (degree 1)
3. Node 11 (degree 2)
4. Node 10 (degree 3)
5. Node 0 (degree 4)
6. Node 2 (degree 4)
7. Node 12 (degree 4)
8. Node 14 (degree 4)
9. Node 5 (degree 5)
10. Node 1 (degree 5)
11. Node 9 (degree 5)
12. Node 7 (degree 5)
13. Node 4 (degree 6)
14. Node 13 (degree 6)
15. Node 3 (degree 7)

Now, we will process the edges based on the degree-based ordering:

1. Process edges involving vertices of degree 1 or 2: None
2. Process edges involving vertices of degree 3:
    - Edge (10, 3): None
3. Process edges involving vertices of degree 4:
    - Edge (2, 5): None
    - Edge (5, 1): None
    - Edge (8, 12): None
    - Edge (8, 1): None
    - Edge (11, 5): None
    - Edge (12, 1): None
    - Edge (14, 1): None
    - Edge (14, 2): None
    - Edge (14, 5): None
    - Edge (12, 14): None
4. Process edges involving vertices of degree 5:
    - Edge (5, 11): Shared connection with 1 forms triangle {1, 5, 11}
    - Edge (5, 9): Shared connection with 4 forms triangle {4, 5, 9}
    - Edge (5, 14): Shared connection with 1 forms triangle {1, 5, 14}
    - Edge (9, 5): Shared connection with 4 forms triangle {4, 5, 9}
    - Edge (4, 9): Shared connection with 13 forms triangle {9, 4, 13}
    - Edge (7, 4): Shared connection with 13 forms triangle {4, 7, 13}
    - Edge (7, 11): Shared connection with 3 forms triangle {3, 7, 11}
    - Edge (7, 1): Shared connection with 14 forms triangle {1, 7, 14}
    - Edge (10, 7): Shared connection with 13 forms triangle {10, 7, 13}
5. Process edges involving vertices of degree 6:
    - Edge (4, 13): Shared connection with 9 forms triangle {4, 9, 13}
    - Edge (13, 0): Shared connection with 10 forms triangle {0, 13, 10}
6. Process edges involving vertices of degree 7:
    - Edge (3, 9): Shared connection with 10 forms triangle {3, 9, 10}
    - Edge (3, 6): None
    - Edge (3, 11): Shared connection with 10 forms triangle {3, 11, 10}
    - Edge (3, 0): Shared connection with 10 forms triangle {0, 3, 10}
7. Process edges involving vertices of degree 8:
    - Edge (4, 12): None
    - Edge (4, 2): None
    - Edge (8, 1): None
    - Edge (12, 1): None
    - Edge (12, 4): None
    - Edge (12, 14): None
    - Edge (14, 1): None
    - Edge (14, 2): None
    - Edge (14, 12): None
8. Process edges involving vertices of degree 9: None
    
Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles: <1, 5, 11>, <4, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 14>, <9, 4, 13>, <4, 7, 13>, <3, 7, 11>, <1, 7, 14>, <10, 7, 13>
