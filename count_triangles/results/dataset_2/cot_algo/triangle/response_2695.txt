Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 26) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 3) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 4) (20, 23) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 0) (15, 20) (6, 25) (6, 27) (6, 0) (28, 1) (28, 27) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (3, 29) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 27) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 17) (13, 14) (24, 2) (24, 26) (24, 14) (26, 2) (26, 24) (26, 21) (26, 0) (26, 4) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 21) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 12) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 22) (7, 18) (21, 26) (21, 17) (0, 25) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 26) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 14) (23, 20) (23, 1) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 24) (14, 18) (14, 16) (22, 12) (22, 1) (10, 27) (27, 6) (27, 28) (27, 11) (27, 10) (1, 28) (1, 9) (1, 23) (1, 22) (16, 3) (16, 14) (19, 3) (19, 9) (4, 20) (4, 26) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most and then relabeling the vertices accordingly. 

After relabeling the nodes, the graph looks as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}
Edges: {  (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 25), (0, 26), (1, 9), (1, 22), (1, 23), (1, 28), (2, 12), (2, 24), (2, 26), (2, 29), (3, 12), (3, 16), (3, 19), (3, 29), (4, 20), (4, 26), (5, 12), (5, 14), (6, 27), (7, 18), (8, 9), (8, 2), (9, 12), (9, 17), (10, 27), (11, 3), (11, 18), (11, 27), (13, 14), (13, 17), (14, 16), (14, 18), (14, 24), (17, 21), (18, 7), (19, 3), (19, 9), (20, 15), (20, 23), (21, 17), (21, 26), (22, 1), (25, 0), (25, 6), (26, 0), (26, 4), (26, 24), (27, 10), (27, 28)}

By following the steps of the Degree-Based Ordering method on this graph, we find that there are:
Total Triangles: [25]
Unique Triangles: <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 25>, <0, 6, 26>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 8, 25>, <0, 8, 26>, <0, 25, 6>, <0, 25, 26>, <1, 9, 12>, <2, 12, 24>, <2, 12, 26>, <2, 12, 29>, <3, 12, 16>, <3, 12, 19>, <3, 12, 29>, <4, 20, 26>, <5, 12, 14>, <6, 27, 10>, <7, 18, 11>, <9, 12, 17>, <11, 18, 7>, <13, 14, 17>, <14, 16, 3>, <14, 16, 18>, <17, 21, 26>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [25].
