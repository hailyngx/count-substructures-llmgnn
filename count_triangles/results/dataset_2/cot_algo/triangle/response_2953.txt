Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
