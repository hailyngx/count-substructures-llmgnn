Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 9) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 15) (6, 17) (6, 19) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 14) (8, 17) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 18) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 7) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 13) (10, 0) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 9) (7, 19) (7, 17) (7, 9) (15, 5) (15, 13) (13, 16) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 9) (18, 5) (18, 14) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then we relabel the vertices accordingly and count the triangles.

After relabeling the vertices, the new list of edges becomes:

(0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (4, 11) (4, 12) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 18) (5, 19) (6, 17) (6, 19) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 19) (8, 3) (8, 17) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 7) (10, 0) (10, 13) (11, 16) (12, 13) (13, 15) (14, 2) (14, 18) (16, 2) (17, 5) (17, 6) (18, 14) (19, 5)

Now, we can count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 10>, <5, 17, 19>, <7, 9, 17>, <13, 15, 5>, <13, 9, 16>, <13, 15, 5>, <13, 12, 4>, <13, 15, 5>, <13, 12, 4>, <13, 15, 5>, <13, 12, 4>, <18, 14, 2>
