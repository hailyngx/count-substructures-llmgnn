Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 12) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 17) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 2) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 16) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 1) (6, 4) (19, 9) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 15) (11, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 9) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 5) (17, 2) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 4) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 5) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 3) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 17) (4, 6) (4, 16) (4, 17) (4, 3) 

Response:
After constructing the graph and sorting the nodes by their number of connections, the labels for the nodes are as follows:

Node 19: Degree 1
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 18: Degree 2
Node 10: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 3
Node 16: Degree 3
Node 17: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 15: Degree 3
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 5

Next, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
