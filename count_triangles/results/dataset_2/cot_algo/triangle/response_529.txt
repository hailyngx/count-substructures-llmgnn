Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 18) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 8) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 11) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 10) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 17) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 6) (17, 18) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 16) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 19) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 12) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 8) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 7) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(3, 1), (3, 11), (3, 18), (15, 16), (15, 0), (15, 8), (6, 17), (6, 7), (6, 13), (9, 4), (9, 2), (1, 3), (1, 11), (10, 11), (10, 16), (11, 3), (11, 1), (11, 10), (2, 9), (2, 18), (2, 5), (18, 3), (18, 2), (18, 16), (18, 12), (18, 17), (0, 15), (0, 14), (0, 5), (0, 8), (14, 0), (14, 4), (14, 13), (17, 6), (17, 18), (5, 2), (5, 0), (5, 19), (19, 5), (19, 7), (19, 16), (16, 15), (16, 10), (16, 18), (16, 19), (4, 9), (4, 14), (4, 12), (12, 18), (12, 4), (12, 8), (7, 6), (7, 19), (7, 13), (8, 15), (8, 0), (8, 12), (13, 6), (13, 14), (13, 7)

By sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order: (Node: Degree)
1: 2
10: 2
12: 2
7: 2
9: 2
5: 3
14: 3
17: 3
19: 3
8: 4
13: 4
4: 4
6: 4
0: 4
2: 4
16: 5
11: 5
3: 5
18: 6
15: 6

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 29]

<0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 15>, <0, 8, 12>, <0, 8, 15>, <0, 14, 4>, <0, 14, 13>, <0, 15, 8>, <0, 15, 16>, <1, 3, 11>, <1, 10, 11>, <2, 5, 0>, <2, 5, 19>, <3, 1, 11>, <4, 9, 2>, <6, 7, 13>, <6, 7, 19>, <8, 12, 18>, <9, 2, 18>, <10, 11, 16>, <11, 1, 3>, <14, 0, 4>, <14, 0, 13>, <15, 0, 8>, <15, 0, 16>, <16, 10, 11>, <16, 15, 0>, <18, 12, 8>, <18, 17, 6>
