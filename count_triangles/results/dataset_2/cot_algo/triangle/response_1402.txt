Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (15, 7) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 17) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 17) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 18) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 13) (6, 16) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 8) (0, 10) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 14) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 17) (1, 2) (1, 19) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 2) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 16) (14, 18) (8, 12) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 18) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections each vertex has, from least to most connections, and then relabeling the vertices accordingly. 

Here are the vertices sorted by their degree:

0: 4 connections
1: 2 connections
3: 2 connections
8: 1 connection
11: 1 connection
5: 4 connections
13: 2 connections
10: 3 connections
18: 4 connections
2: 6 connections
14: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
9: 4 connections
7: 3 connections
12: 3 connections
16: 4 connections
17: 4 connections
19: 4 connections
15: 2 connections

Now, we will look at each edge while considering the lower labeled vertex to have fewer connections. 

After examining all edges, we find that the total number of triangles in the graph is [24].

Unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<0, 10, 12>
<0, 16, 19>
<0, 16, 6>
<0, 19, 1>
<1, 19, 6>
<2, 15, 7>
<2, 15, 4>
<2, 9, 17>
<2, 13, 6>
<2, 13, 5>
<3, 2, 15>
<4, 7, 17>
<4, 9, 17>
<4, 9, 5>
<5, 9, 17>
<5, 12, 10>
<6, 16, 19>
<6, 16, 14>
<7, 4, 9>
<14, 18, 17>
<14, 18, 16>
<14, 16, 10>
<16, 19, 0>
