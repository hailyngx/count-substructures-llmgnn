Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 5: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

Next, we will proceed with checking the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections to count the triangles. Calculating the triangles gives the result:

Total number of triangles: [16]

Unique triangles:
<5, 2, 6>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 7>
<5, 2, 4>
<5, 0, 4>
<9, 8, 7>
<9, 6, 5>
<4, 1, 0>
<4, 2, 1>
<4, 8, 7>
<4, 0, 1>
<7, 3, 1>
<7, 2, 1>
<7, 8, 5>
<1, 3, 0>
<2, 7, 8>
