Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 11) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 9) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 10) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 12) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6)
(7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1)
(8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3)
(13, 6) (13, 7)
(5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 4)
(6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 4)
(2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 5)
(12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 8)
(3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 7)
(11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9)
(9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7)
(0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1)
(14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 6)

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degrees:
Nodes by degree: 0 (2), 10 (2), 14 (2), 7 (4), 8 (3), 13 (2), 5 (4), 1 (4), 4 (3), 9 (6), 2 (4), 12 (5), 3 (4), 11 (6), 6 (5)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 0 (2) becomes node A
Node 10 (2) becomes node B
Node 14 (2) becomes node C
Node 7 (4) becomes node D
Node 8 (3) becomes node E
Node 13 (2) becomes node F
Node 5 (4) becomes node G
Node 1 (4) becomes node H
Node 4 (3) becomes node I
Node 9 (6) becomes node J
Node 2 (4) becomes node K
Node 12 (5) becomes node L
Node 3 (4) becomes node M
Node 11 (6) becomes node N
Node 6 (5) becomes node O

Now, we will count the triangles. The number of triangles is [24] and the unique triangles found are as follows:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 11>
<0, 6, 11>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 6, 12>
<0, 6, 14>
<0, 9, 11>
<0, 9, 10>
<0, 11, 12>
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 6, 12>
<1, 6, 14>
<1, 9, 11>
<1, 9, 10>
<1, 11, 12>
<1, 11, 14>
<6, 7, 11>
<6, 9, 11>
<6, 12, 14>
<7, 9, 11>
<7, 11, 12>
<7, 11, 13>
<9, 10, 11>
<11, 12, 14>
