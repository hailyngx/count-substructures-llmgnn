Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 13) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (13, 14) (13, 12) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 10) 

Response:
The graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
0 -- 6 -- 5 -- 11 -- 9
|         |    |     |
14 -- 4 -- 3 -- 10 -- 1
|                   |
13 -- 12 -- 2 -- 7 -- 8
```

Now, let's calculate the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Vertices with the number of connections:
   - 0: 6 connections
   - 1: 4 connections
   - 2: 3 connections
   - 3: 4 connections
   - 4: 4 connections
   - 5: 4 connections
   - 6: 3 connections
   - 7: 2 connections
   - 8: 4 connections
   - 9: 4 connections
   - 10: 3 connections
   - 11: 5 connections
   - 12: 5 connections
   - 13: 2 connections
   - 14: 5 connections

2. Sort vertices by the number of connections in ascending order:
   - 2, 7, 13
   - 6, 10
   - 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
   - 0, 12, 14
   - 11

3. Proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
   - Counting triangles: <0, 6, 5>, <0, 6, 11>, <0, 6, 12>, <0, 5, 11>, <0, 5, 12>, <0, 11, 14>, <4, 8, 14>, <4, 5, 3>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 3, 10>, <8, 14, 11>, <8, 14, 4>, <8, 2, 4>, <8, 2, 7>

4. Finally, the total number of triangles inside brackets [] is: [14].
