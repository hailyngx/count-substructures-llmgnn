To count triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method: 

1. Sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:
(2, 16), (10, 12), (18, 12), (6, 13), (3, 14), (0, 15), (5, 15), (9, 15), (17, 15), (13, 16), (11, 19), (1, 19), (4, 19), (14, 19), (8, 20), (7, 21), (12, 21), (15, 21), (19, 21)

2. Count the number of triangles:
There are [14] triangles in the given graph.

Unique triangles found: 
<7, 12, 13>
<1, 4, 7>
<8, 12, 13>
<4, 15, 19>
<8, 13, 19>
<15, 18, 19>
<0, 7, 13>
<0, 11, 13>
<8, 12, 19>
<10, 14, 15>
<1, 7, 17>
<11, 15, 18>
<6, 8, 19>
<1, 16, 17>
