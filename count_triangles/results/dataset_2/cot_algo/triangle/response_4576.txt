Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 4) (9, 2) (26, 22) (26, 27) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 24) (21, 6) (21, 4) (21, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 28) (28, 13) (29, 16) (29, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 11) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 27) (22, 10) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 12) (6, 1) (6, 21) (6, 0) (6, 16) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 5) (16, 29) (16, 6) (16, 25) (16, 20) (23, 20) (23, 27) (4, 9) (4, 21) (4, 22) (4, 5) (4, 11) (11, 2) (11, 4) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 27) (5, 21) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 24) (18, 10) (18, 25) (27, 26) (27, 22) (27, 23) (27, 19) (27, 10) (3, 13) (3, 29) (3, 19) (10, 22) (10, 7) (10, 18) (10, 27) (20, 16) (20, 23) (12, 8) (12, 14) (17, 15) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 16) (25, 18) (25, 15) (24, 1) (24, 5) (15, 17) (15, 25) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges is as follows:

```
Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]

Edges:
(9, 4) (9, 2) (26, 22) (26, 27) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 24) 
(21, 6) (21, 4) (21, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 25) 
(8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 28) (29, 16) (2, 11) (22, 10) 
(0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 6) (16, 20) (23, 20) (4, 11) 
(19, 7) (5, 24) (18, 10) (27, 23) (3, 29) (12, 14) 
(17, 15) (25, 15)
```

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

After sorting the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections), we get the following new order:
``` 
[9, 26, 1, 21, 17, 23, 7, 0, 15, 24, 18, 16, 12, 5, 13, 19, 11, 28, 20, 3, 10, 6, 29, 8, 2, 22, 4, 27, 14, 25]
```

Counting the triangles and listing them once:
```
Total number of triangles: [14]

Unique triangles:
<3, 13, 29>
<3, 19, 27>
<4, 5, 21>
<2, 8, 25>
<2, 8, 13>
<2, 9, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 14>
<0, 6, 16>
<5, 7, 21>
<5, 24, 1>
<6, 16, 0>
<10, 18, 25>
<15, 17, 25>
