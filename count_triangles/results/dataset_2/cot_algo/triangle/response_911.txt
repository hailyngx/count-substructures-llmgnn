Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 28) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 19) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 5) (17, 29) (17, 20) (17, 9) (17, 23) (3, 25) (3, 29) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 15) (18, 22) (18, 14) (8, 3) (8, 23) (8, 5) (23, 14) (23, 17) (23, 8) (23, 2) (15, 25) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 11) (20, 17) (20, 11) (5, 14) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 27) (6, 21) (6, 29) (6, 10) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 4) (26, 19) (26, 10) (26, 4) (19, 22) (19, 26) (19, 0) (29, 17) (29, 3) (29, 6) (4, 1) (4, 26) (4, 24) (27, 5) (27, 28) (27, 16) (0, 19) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 21) (7, 0) (7, 24) (7, 2) (21, 6) (21, 0) (21, 11) (16, 27) (16, 0) (2, 22) (2, 23) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 10) (12, 10) (9, 17) (9, 15) (28, 13) (28, 27) (10, 6) (10, 26) (10, 2) (10, 12) (24, 4) (24, 7) (11, 15) (11, 20) (11, 21) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Let's apply this method to the given graph:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 16: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 12: 2 connections
Node 13: 2 connections
Node 20: 2 connections
Node 27: 3 connections
Node 28: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 24: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 21: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 25: 4 connections
Node 18: 4 connections
Node 22: 5 connections
Node 10: 5 connections
Node 19: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 29: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 26: 6 connections

Now, we will check each edge starting from the one with the lower label to count the triangles.

Total number of triangles: [68]
