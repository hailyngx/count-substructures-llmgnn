Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 6.

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Nodes 0, 7, and 5 have degree 5
- Nodes 3 and 9 have degree 4
- Nodes 1 and 8 have degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 6

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:
- Count of triangles = 4

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 6>.
