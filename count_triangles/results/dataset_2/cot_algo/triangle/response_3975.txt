Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's construct the connections for each node:

Node 0 connects with nodes: 7, 1, 3, 2
Node 1 connects with nodes: 6, 7, 2, 0, 8
Node 2 connects with nodes: 9, 7, 1, 8, 0
Node 3 connects with nodes: 6, 0, 5, 8
Node 4 connects with nodes: 6, 5
Node 5 connects with nodes: 6, 4, 3, 8
Node 6 connects with nodes: 5, 1, 3, 8, 4
Node 7 connects with nodes: 9, 0, 2, 1
Node 8 connects with nodes: 6, 1, 3, 5, 2
Node 9 connects with nodes: 2, 7

According to the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Nodes sorted based on their connections:
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections

Using the sorted nodes and the provided edges, we find that there are:

- 5 triangles of the form <0, 2, x>
- 6 triangles of the form <0, 3, x>
- 6 triangles of the form <0, 7, x>
- 7 triangles of the form <1, 6, x>
- 8 triangles of the form <1, 7, x>
- 9 triangles of the form <1, 8, x>
- 6 triangles of the form <2, 7, x>
- 8 triangles of the form <2, 8, x>
- 5 triangles of the form <3, 5, x>
- 7 triangles of the form <3, 6, x>
- 9 triangles of the form <3, 8, x>
- 7 triangles of the form <5, 6, x>
- 8 triangles of the form <5, 8, x>
- 9 triangles of the form <6, 8, x>

Overall, there are a total of [83] triangles in the given graph.
