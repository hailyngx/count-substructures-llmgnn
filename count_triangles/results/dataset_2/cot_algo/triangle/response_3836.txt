Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 6), (0, 3), (0, 7), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 8), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 6), (4, 9), (4, 3), (4, 8), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7), (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 0), (7, 6), (7, 9), (7, 1), (7, 0), (7, 5), (8, 6), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 2), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 7)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes by degree: 
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 6
Node 6: Degree 7

Since the vertex with the lower label should have fewer connections, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(2, 3), (2, 8), (5, 7), (5, 3), (5, 1), (8, 2), (8, 1), (9, 7), (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 6), (4, 6), (4, 9), (4, 3), (4, 8), (1, 7), (1, 3), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 5)

Count of triangles [23] 
Unique triangles: 
<0, 3, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 3, 7>, <3, 0, 6>, <3, 1, 7>, <3, 2, 8>, <4, 3, 6>, <4, 3, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 7, 6>, <5, 1, 7>, <1, 7, 6>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 9>
