Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 18) (15, 2) (15, 16) (6, 17) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 13) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 8) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 11) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 10) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 11) (4, 2) (12, 4) (12, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 12) (18, 15) (18, 0) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 7) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (16, 15) (16, 14) (16, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort the nodes by their degree:
   - Node 18 has degree 2
   - Nodes 6, 12, 19 have degree 2
   - Nodes 0, 1, 7, 13 have degree 3
   - Nodes 2, 4, 5, 15 have degree 4
   - Nodes 10, 11, 14, 16 have degree 5
   - Nodes 3, 8, 17, 9 have degree 6

2. Relabel the nodes from 0 to 19 according to their degree in ascending order:
   - Node 18 is relabeled as 0
   - Nodes 6, 12, 19 are relabeled as 1, 2, 3
   - Nodes 0, 1, 7, 13 are relabeled as 4, 5, 6, 7
   - Nodes 2, 4, 5, 15 are relabeled as 8, 9, 10, 11
   - Nodes 10, 11, 14, 16 are relabeled as 12, 13, 14, 15
   - Nodes 3, 8, 17, 9 are relabeled as 16, 17, 18, 19

3. Process each edge considering the lower label node has fewer connections:
   - Triangles formed: <3, 5, 8>, <11, 14, 16>, <2, 4, 15>
   
Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <3, 5, 8>, <11, 14, 16>, <2, 4, 15>
