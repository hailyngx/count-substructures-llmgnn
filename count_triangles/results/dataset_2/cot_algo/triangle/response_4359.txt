Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 3) (13, 15) (22, 0) (22, 24) (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 23) (21, 25) (0, 22) (0, 11) (0, 2) (27, 4) (27, 25) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 11) (18, 26) (18, 12) (18, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 8) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 20) (6, 28) (6, 10) (28, 6) (17, 29) (17, 26) (29, 17) (29, 26) (29, 25) (29, 24) (9, 19) (9, 16) (20, 12) (20, 8) (20, 5) (15, 13) (15, 1) (4, 27) (4, 25) (26, 18) (26, 17) (26, 29) (26, 3) (10, 6) (10, 23) (10, 14) (25, 21) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 4) (25, 11) (3, 13) (3, 26) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 19) (16, 5) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 25) (19, 2) (19, 9) (19, 16) (19, 23) (8, 1) (8, 18) (8, 7) (8, 20) (8, 24) (24, 22) (24, 29) (24, 8) (24, 14) (14, 10) (14, 24) (14, 5) (5, 20) (5, 16) (5, 14) (23, 21) (23, 10) (23, 19) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Nodes sorted by their degree:
Node 16: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 6: degree 2
Node 17: degree 2
Node 18: degree 4
Node 26: degree 4
Node 28: degree 2
Node 0: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 27: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 8: degree 5
Node 20: degree 4
Node 25: degree 6
Node 5: degree 3
Node 29: degree 5
Node 7: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 2
Node 19: degree 4
Node 21: degree 4
Node 23: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 22: degree 2
Node 24: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 13: degree 2

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

1. Triangle: <25, 4, 27>
2. Triangle: <25, 11, 0>
3. Triangle: <25, 11, 2>
4. Triangle: <25, 11, 7>
5. Triangle: <25, 11, 0>
6. Triangle: <25, 11, 2>
7. Triangle: <25, 11, 7>
8. Triangle: <25, 11, 0>
9. Triangle: <25, 11, 2>
10. Triangle: <25, 11, 7>
11. Triangle: <25, 27, 4>
12. Triangle: <25, 27, 21>
13. Triangle: <25, 27, 4>
14. Triangle: <25, 29, 24>
15. Triangle: <25, 29, 17>
16. Triangle: <25, 29, 17>
17. Triangle: <25, 29, 26>
18. Triangle: <25, 29, 26>
19. Triangle: <21, 1, 15>
20. Triangle: <21, 1, 8>
21. Triangle: <21, 23, 10>
22. Triangle: <21, 23, 19>
23. Triangle: <29, 17, 26>
24. Triangle: <29, 17, 26>

There are a total of [24] triangles in the given graph.
