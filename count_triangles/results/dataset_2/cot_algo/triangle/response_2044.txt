Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 19) (15, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (17, 10) (17, 16) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (11, 14) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 18) (8, 15) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 14) (18, 0) (18, 19) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 16) (16, 17) (16, 0) (16, 19) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 14) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 11) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 7), (0, 10), (0, 5), (0, 16), (0, 18), 
(1, 5), (1, 13), (1, 8), 
(2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 11), 
(4, 12), (4, 9), (4, 5), 
(5, 7), (5, 6), 
(6, 10), 
(7, 5), 
(8, 15), (8, 9), 
(9, 14), 
(10, 17), (10, 12), 
(11, 14), 
(12, 13), 
(13, 14), 
(14, 12), 
(15, 19), 
(16, 17), (16, 0), (16, 19), 
(17, 10), 
(18, 0), (18, 19), 
(19, 15), (19, 18)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
Vertices by degree: 11, 2, 18, 1, 8, 3, 7, 9, 17, 4, 6, 16, 15, 12, 5, 0, 10, 14, 13

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:
Triangles: [45]
Unique triangles found: <1, 5, 13>, <7, 0, 5>, <7, 2, 6>, <12, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <0, 7, 5>, <12, 14, 13>, <10, 12, 4>, <0, 16, 17>, <8, 1, 5>, <0, 18, 19>, <0, 16, 19>, <0, 10, 17>, <14, 9, 12>, <10, 6, 5>, <8, 9, 14>, <15, 19, 18>, <15, 8, 1>, <16, 0, 7>, <16, 19, 18>, <2, 11, 14>, <2, 7, 5>, <2, 6, 10>, <16, 17, 10>, <16, 0, 18>
