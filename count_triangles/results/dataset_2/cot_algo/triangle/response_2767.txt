Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 14) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 6) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 12) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves labeling the nodes based on their degrees.

Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 2
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 6
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start by examining edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

1. Edge between node 8 and node 2: Both vertices have label 2, proceed.
2. Edge between node 13 and node 14: Vertex 13 has a lower label than vertex 14, and both have 4 connections. Proceed.
3. Edge between node 1 and node 2: Vertex 1 has a lower label and fewer connections, proceed.
4. Edge between node 1 and node 3: Vertex 1 has a lower label and fewer connections, proceed.
5. Edge between node 0 and node 4: Vertex 0 has a lower label and fewer connections, proceed.
6. Edge between node 4 and node 7: Vertex 4 has a lower label and fewer connections, proceed.
7. Edge between node 4 and node 5: Vertex 4 has a lower label and fewer connections, proceed.
8. Edge between node 4 and node 3: Vertex 4 has a lower label and fewer connections, proceed.

By examining the shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we find the following triangles:
<1, 2, 3>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
