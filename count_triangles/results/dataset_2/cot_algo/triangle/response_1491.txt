Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) first. The sorted order of vertices is as follows:  

Node 0: degree 2  
Node 7: degree 2  
Node 6: degree 3  
Node 5: degree 3  
Node 9: degree 4  
Node 1: degree 5  
Node 7: degree 6  
Node 4: degree 6  
Node 8: degree 7  
Node 3: degree 7  

Now, we will go through each edge and check for shared connections to count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles is [12] in this graph.  

Unique triangles found are:
<4, 1, 5>
<6, 8, 7>
<6, 8, 3>
<6, 3, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 5, 1>
<2, 5, 4>
