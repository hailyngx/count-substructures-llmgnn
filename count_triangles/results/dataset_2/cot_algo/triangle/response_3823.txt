Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method aims to count the number of triangles in a graph efficiently. Let's apply this method to the given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges:

**Vertices sorted by degree (number of connections):**
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 6
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3

**For each edge, we will consider the one with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:**
- Edge (5, 9): Node 5 < Node 9, proceed
  - Shared connections between Node 5 and Node 9: [8]
- Edge (5, 8): Node 5 < Node 8, proceed
  - Shared connections between Node 5 and Node 8: [1]
- Edge (5, 1): Node 1 < Node 5, proceed
  - Shared connections between Node 5 and Node 1: [3]
- Edge (5, 3): Node 3 < Node 5, proceed
  - Shared connections between Node 5 and Node 3: [1]
- Edge (9, 8): Node 8 < Node 9, proceed
  - Shared connections between Node 9 and Node 8: [4]
- Edge (9, 4): Node 4 < Node 9, proceed
  - Shared connections between Node 9 and Node 4: [8]
- Edge (4, 7): Node 4 < Node 7, proceed
  - Shared connections between Node 4 and Node 7: [3]
- Edge (7, 3): Node 3 < Node 7, proceed
  - Shared connections between Node 7 and Node 3: [4]
  
**Count of triangles inside brackets []:**
[8]

**Unique triangles found inside <>:**
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 1>
<4, 7, 3>
<4, 9, 8>
