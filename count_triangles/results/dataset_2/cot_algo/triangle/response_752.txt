Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 20) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 17) (20, 9) (20, 25) (20, 19) (20, 23) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 12) (25, 10) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 12) (23, 20) (23, 8) (23, 27) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 28) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 24) (18, 28) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 17) (26, 18) (26, 2) (13, 21) (13, 6) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 27) (17, 15) (17, 22) (17, 1) (17, 6) (24, 18) (24, 0) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 20) (10, 25) (10, 21) (10, 14) (21, 13) (21, 10) (21, 29) (27, 5) (27, 25) (27, 23) (27, 1) (2, 5) (2, 22) (2, 26) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 12) (7, 3) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 10) (29, 1) (29, 21) (29, 6) (6, 11) (6, 15) (6, 13) (6, 17) (6, 29) (12, 25) (12, 8) (12, 0) (28, 4) (28, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 16: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 13: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 24: 4 connections
Node 29: 4 connections
Node 11: 5 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 26: 5 connections
Node 15: 5 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 23: 6 connections
Node 28: 6 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
Node 4: 7 connections
Node 20: 7 connections
Node 22: 7 connections
Node 19: 7 connections
Node 21: 7 connections
Node 17: 8 connections
Node 2: 8 connections
Node 25: 8 connections
Node 27: 8 connections
Node 18: 9 connections
Node 6: 9 connections
Node 12: 9 connections

Now, we can count the triangles based on the connections between vertices, considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

The total number of triangles in this graph is [50]. 

And some unique triangles found are:
<8, 12, 25>
<4, 8, 23>
<9, 14, 20>
<4, 12, 25>
<3, 15, 17>
<3, 22, 17>
<5, 19, 20>
<8, 12, 0>
<9, 20, 19>
<15, 17, 6>
