Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 1), (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 2), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (3, 6), (3, 0), (3, 8), (3, 4), (4, 5), (4, 3), (4, 8), (4, 0), (7, 6), (7, 1), (7, 8), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 0), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 2), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 0)

Let's label the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 3: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5

Now, we will only consider edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:
Edges to consider:
(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 4), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 1), (3, 0), (3, 8), (3, 4), (4, 0), (8, 0), (0, 2)

Counting the triangles formed by the shared connections between the two vertices of each edge, we find the total number of triangles: 
Total triangles: [14]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 8, 1>
<4, 8, 7>
<4, 8, 0>
