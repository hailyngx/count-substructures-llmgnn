Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 8) (0, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Node Degrees:
0: 2
1: 3
2: 4
3: 4
4: 4
5: 2
6: 3
7: 4
8: 5
9: 5

Sorted by Degrees:
0: 2
5: 2
1: 3   
6: 3
3: 4
4: 4
7: 4
2: 4
8: 5
9: 5

With the following edges:
(8, 0) (8, 1)
(5, 4) (5, 9)
(1, 6) (1, 7)
(4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8)
(2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9)
(7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8)
(3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8)
(9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7)

Calculating triangles:

[Total Number of Triangles: 3]
<Triangle 1: 4, 8, 9>
<Triangle 2: 3, 7, 8>
<Triangle 3: 2, 8, 9>
