Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 27) (20, 22) (20, 6) (20, 10) (25, 20) (25, 23) (25, 0) (25, 22) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 3) (13, 1) (26, 13) (26, 21) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 9) (15, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 21) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 27) (11, 19) (11, 27) (11, 18) (23, 25) (23, 18) (7, 16) (7, 24) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 19) (3, 13) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 29) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 12) (12, 16) (12, 28) (17, 28) (17, 4) (21, 13) (21, 26) (21, 8) (21, 2) (21, 24) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 4) (5, 8) (5, 10) (14, 9) (14, 22) (14, 2) (22, 20) (22, 25) (22, 14) (18, 11) (18, 23) (27, 20) (27, 9) (27, 11) (29, 3) (24, 7) (24, 3) (24, 21) (24, 10) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 10) (0, 25) (2, 15) (2, 16) (2, 21) (2, 14) (10, 20) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 24) (10, 4) (6, 20) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree. Then, the vertices are relabeled accordingly. Let's perform this process and count the number of triangles in the graph given the edge list:

1. Sort the vertices by their connections in ascending order:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}
Degree: {1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7}

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degrees (starting from 0):
New Labels: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

3. Count the triangles by checking shared connections:
Total number of triangles: [16]

Unique triangles:

<2, 14, 21>
<2, 14, 22>
<3, 13, 21>
<3, 13, 26>
<3, 13, 28>
<4, 9, 27>
<4, 10, 24>
<4, 10, 27>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 21>
<8, 9, 14>
<9, 10, 27>
<11, 18, 23>
<13, 21, 26>
<16, 19, 21>
