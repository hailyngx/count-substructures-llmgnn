Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order, the nodes are relabeled as follows: 

Nodes: 
0 (Degree 4) 
4 (Degree 4) 
5 (Degree 4) 
6 (Degree 4) 
3 (Degree 4) 
7 (Degree 5) 
2 (Degree 6) 
8 (Degree 6) 
1 (Degree 7) 
9 (Degree 7) 

Next, we will check the edges according to the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles. 
Here's the calculation of the triangles: 

1. Triangle <0, 2, 1> (Shared connection: 0-1) 
2. Triangle <0, 2, 7> (Shared connection: 0-2) 
3. Triangle <0, 2, 8> (Shared connection: 0-2) 
4. Triangle <0, 7, 1> (Shared connection: 0-1) 
5. Triangle <0, 7, 2> (Shared connection: 0-2) 
6. Triangle <0, 7, 8> (Shared connection: 0-7) 
7. Triangle <0, 1, 2> (Shared connection: 0-2) 
8. Triangle <0, 1, 7> (Shared connection: 0-1) 
9. Triangle <0, 1, 8> (Shared connection: 0-1) 
10. Triangle <2, 4, 6> (Shared connection: 2-4) 
11. Triangle <2, 4, 1> (Shared connection: 2-4) 
12. Triangle <2, 4, 8> (Shared connection: 2-4) 
13. Triangle <2, 6, 1> (Shared connection: 2-1) 
14. Triangle <2, 6, 8> (Shared connection: 2-8) 
15. Triangle <2, 1, 8> (Shared connection: 2-1) 
16. Triangle <2, 7, 1> (Shared connection: 2-1) 
17. Triangle <2, 7, 8> (Shared connection: 2-8) 
18. Triangle <6, 4, 1> (Shared connection: 6-4) 
19. Triangle <6, 4, 3> (Shared connection: 6-4) 
20. Triangle <6, 4, 2> (Shared connection: 6-4) 
21. Triangle <6, 1, 3> (Shared connection: 6-3) 
22. Triangle <6, 1, 2> (Shared connection: 6-2) 
23. Triangle <6, 1, 8> (Shared connection: 6-1) 
24. Triangle <6, 3, 4> (Shared connection: 6-4) 
25. Triangle <6, 3, 8> (Shared connection: 6-8) 
26. Triangle <6, 2, 1> (Shared connection: 6-1) 
27. Triangle <6, 2, 4> (Shared connection: 6-4) 
28. Triangle <6, 2, 8> (Shared connection: 6-8) 
29. Triangle <2, 8, 1> (Shared connection: 2-1) 
30. Triangle <2, 8, 7> (Shared connection: 2-8) 
31. Triangle <2, 1, 8> (Shared connection: 2-1) 
32. Triangle <2, 1, 7> (Shared connection: 2-1) 
33. Triangle <2, 1, 9> (Shared connection: 2-1) 
34. Triangle <2, 7, 8> (Shared connection: 2-8) 
35. Triangle <2, 7, 9> (Shared connection: 2-9) 
36. Triangle <4, 1, 8> (Shared connection: 4-1) 
37. Triangle <4, 2, 8> (Shared connection: 4-8) 
38. Triangle <4, 6, 1> (Shared connection: 4-1) 
39. Triangle <4, 6, 3> (Shared connection: 4-3) 
40. Triangle <4, 6, 2> (Shared connection: 4-2) 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [40].
