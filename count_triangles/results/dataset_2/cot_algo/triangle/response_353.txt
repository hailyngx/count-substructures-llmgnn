Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degrees:

Node 0: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 5: 6 connections

Now, we can go through each edge and count the number of triangles:

1. (5, 9): Nodes 5 and 9 have 5 common connections (1, 3, 6, 7, 1). So, <5, 9, common(1, 3, 6, 7, 1)> forms a triangle.
2. (5, 6): Nodes 5 and 6 have 3 common connections (1, 9, 4). So, <5, 6, common(1, 9, 4)> forms a triangle.
3. (5, 1): Nodes 5 and 1 have 3 common connections (3, 9, 3). So, <5, 1, common(3, 9, 3)> forms a triangle.
4. (5, 3): Nodes 5 and 3 have 4 common connections (1, 9, 7, 1). So, <5, 3, common(1, 9, 7, 1)> forms a triangle.
5. (5, 7): Nodes 5 and 7 have 3 common connections (1, 9, 3). So, <5, 7, common(1, 9, 3)> forms a triangle.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [5].

Therefore, the unique triangles found are <5, 9, common(1, 3, 6, 7, 1)>, <5, 6, common(1, 9, 4)>, <5, 1, common(3, 9, 3)>, <5, 3, common(1, 9, 7, 1)>, and <5, 7, common(1, 9, 3)>.
