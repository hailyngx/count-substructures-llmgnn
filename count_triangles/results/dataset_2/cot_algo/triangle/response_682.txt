Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 12) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 1) (14, 6) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. 

The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 4

Based on the degree-based ordering, the nodes can be relabeled as follows:
- Node 2 → Node 0
- Node 3 → Node 1
- Node 9 → Node 2
- Node 10 → Node 3
- Node 13 → Node 4
- Node 8 → Node 5
- Node 11 → Node 6
- Node 12 → Node 7
- Node 4 → Node 8
- Node 7 → Node 9
- Node 5 → Node 10
- Node 14 → Node 11

Let's consider the edges in the order according to the lower labeled nodes:

1. (2, 9): forms a triangle <0, 2, 5>
2. (3, 6): forms a triangle <1, 3, 7>
3. (9, 6): forms a triangle <0, 2, 5>
4. (10, 4): forms a triangle <3, 4, 8>
5. (13, 7): forms a triangle <4, 6, 9>
6. (8, 2): forms a triangle <0, 2, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, and <4, 6, 9>.
