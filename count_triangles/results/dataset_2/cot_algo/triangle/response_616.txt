Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 26) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 17) (1, 21) (1, 6) (1, 16) (21, 1) (21, 11) (7, 24) (7, 6) (7, 9) (24, 7) (24, 11) (24, 27) (24, 22) (24, 23) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 9) (27, 24) (27, 10) (27, 6) (4, 14) (4, 2) (18, 26) (18, 14) (17, 15) (17, 20) (29, 13) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 23) (2, 20) (8, 2) (8, 19) (11, 21) (11, 24) (11, 28) (28, 11) (28, 13) (28, 25) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 23) (5, 25) (5, 14) (13, 29) (13, 28) (13, 5) (20, 17) (20, 2) (20, 16) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 22) (19, 25) (22, 24) (22, 19) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 27) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 25) (10, 27) (10, 0) (10, 16) (26, 3) (26, 18) (23, 24) (23, 2) (23, 5) (16, 1) (16, 20) (16, 10) (16, 9) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 5) (25, 28) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 16) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29
Edges: 
(3, 15), (3, 26), (15, 19), (15, 17), (1, 21), (1, 6), (1, 16), (21, 11), (7, 24), (7, 6), (24, 11), (24, 27), (24, 22), (24, 23), (12, 14), (12, 0), (12, 9), (27, 10), (4, 14), (4, 2), (18, 26), (18, 14), (17, 20), (29, 13), (2, 8), (2, 23), (8, 19), (11, 28), (28, 25), (5, 13), (5, 25), (13, 29), (20, 16), (19, 8), (19, 22), (6, 1), (6, 7), (0, 10) 

Next, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices: 3, 4, 10, 16, 18, 0, 5, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 6, 11, 12, 19, 27, 1, 7, 8, 14, 17, 24, 29, 2, 9, 13, 15

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 5]
<5, 19, 25>
<7, 9, 24>
<0, 10, 25>
<1, 6, 21>
<2, 5, 8>
