The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 4) (4, 16) (4, 7) (4, 28) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 9) (18, 9) (18, 23) (18, 17) (18, 8) (22, 2) (5, 11) (5, 23) (5, 29) (5, 20) (13, 11) (24, 26) (24, 6) (24, 17) (26, 24) (26, 20) (26, 25) (26, 6) (28, 4) (28, 2) (8, 18) (8, 21) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 19) (10, 27) (15, 4) (15, 6) (21, 8) (21, 0) (21, 25) (21, 2) (2, 11) (2, 22) (2, 28) (2, 21) (2, 0) (17, 18) (17, 24) (17, 19) (17, 27) (25, 26) (25, 21) (25, 29) (6, 24) (6, 26) (6, 15) (6, 3) (19, 9) (19, 17) (19, 3) (19, 12) (23, 18) (23, 5) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 20) (14, 12) (1, 4) (1, 20) (20, 5) (20, 26) (20, 3) (20, 1) (0, 21) (0, 2) (0, 12) (27, 10) (27, 17) (12, 19) (12, 14) (12, 0) (29, 11) (29, 5) (29, 25) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling the vertices according to their sorted order. 

Here is the list of vertices and their respective degrees:
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 5 connections
- Vertex 3: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 5 connections
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 6: 4 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 3 connections
- Vertex 10: 1 connection
- Vertex 11: 5 connections
- Vertex 12: 3 connections
- Vertex 13: 1 connection
- Vertex 14: 1 connection
- Vertex 15: 2 connections
- Vertex 16: 3 connections
- Vertex 17: 4 connections
- Vertex 18: 4 connections
- Vertex 19: 4 connections
- Vertex 20: 4 connections
- Vertex 21: 4 connections
- Vertex 22: 1 connection
- Vertex 23: 2 connections
- Vertex 24: 4 connections
- Vertex 25: 3 connections
- Vertex 26: 4 connections
- Vertex 27: 2 connections
- Vertex 28: 2 connections
- Vertex 29: 3 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. (11, 16): No triangle is formed.
2. (11, 13): No triangle is formed.
3. (11, 5): No triangle is formed.
4. (11, 2): No triangle is formed.
5. (11, 29): No triangle is formed.
6. (16, 7): No triangle is formed.
7. (16, 4): Triangle <4, 16, 7> is formed.
8. (4, 7): No triangle is formed.
9. (4, 28): No triangle is formed.
10. (4, 1): No triangle is formed.
11. (4, 15): Triangle <4, 15, 6> is formed. (Shared connection: 4, 6)
12. (7, 9): No triangle is formed.
13. (18, 9): No triangle is formed.
14. (18, 23): No triangle is formed.
15. (18, 17): No triangle is formed.
16. (22, 2): No triangle is formed.
17. (5, 23): No triangle is formed.
18. (5, 29): No triangle is formed.
19. (5, 20): No triangle is formed.
20. (13, 11): No triangle is formed.
21. (24, 26): No triangle is formed.
22. (24, 6): No triangle is formed.
23. (24, 17): No triangle is formed.
24. (26, 20): No triangle is formed.
25. (26, 25): No triangle is formed.
26. (28, 2): No triangle is formed.
27. (8, 18): No triangle is formed.
28. (8, 21): No triangle is formed.
29. (9, 19): Triangle <9, 19, 3> is formed.
30. (10, 27): No triangle is formed.
31. (15, 6: No triangle is formed.
32. (21, 0): No triangle is formed.
33. (21, 25): No triangle is formed.
34. (2, 22): No triangle is formed.
35. (17, 24): No triangle is formed.
36. (17, 27): No triangle is formed.
37. (25, 29): Triangle <25, 29, 5> is formed.
38. (6, 3): No triangle is formed.
39. (19, 12): No triangle is formed.
41. (3, 20): No triangle is formed.
42. (1, 20): No triangle is formed.
43. (0, 21): No triangle is formed.
44. (27, 17): No triangle is formed.
45. (12, 14): No triangle is formed.

The total number of triangles is 4, and the unique triangles found are:
- <4, 16, 7>
- <4, 15, 6>
- <9, 19, 3>
- <25, 29, 5>

Therefore, the result is [4].
