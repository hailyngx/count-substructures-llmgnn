Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 12) (16, 2) (16, 19) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 9) (17, 2) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 17) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 5) (18, 1) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 8) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 18) (13, 5) (13, 1) (0, 5) (1, 17) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 19) (10, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 4) (8, 12) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 3) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 8) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 8) (4, 10) (4, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps count the number of triangles in the given graph. 

First, sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections):

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 11: 2 connections
Node 18: 2 connections
Node 20: 2 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 16: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 10: 5 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 17: 6 connections
Node 19: 6 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 2: 7 connections
Node 14: 7 connections

Now, we will check each edge following the method mentioned earlier:

<19, 16, 2>
<19, 1, 17>
<19, 1, 13>
<19, 6, 9>
<19, 6, 16>
<19, 8, 12>
<19, 8, 15>
<19, 8, 12>
<19, 8, 15>
<6, 9, 17>
<6, 9, 3>
<6, 9, 17>
<6, 9, 3>
<6, 16, 2>
<6, 16, 2>
<9, 17, 2>
<9, 17, 2>
<9, 17, 2>
<9, 10, 14>
<9, 10, 14>
<9, 10, 4>
<9, 10, 4>
<2, 16, 19>
<2, 16, 19>
<2, 16, 17>
<2, 16, 17>
<2, 5, 14>
<2, 5, 14>
<2, 5, 14>
<2, 5, 14>
<13, 1, 17>
<13, 1, 17>
<13, 1, 17>
<13, 1, 18>
<13, 1, 18>
<5, 14, 17>
<5, 14, 3>
<5, 14, 17>
<5, 14, 3>
<5, 7, 12>
<5, 7, 12>
<5, 7, 12>
<5, 7, 15>
<5, 7, 15>

After checking all edges, the total number of triangles in the graph is [42]. 
The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<19, 16, 2>
<19, 1, 17>
<19, 1, 13>
<19, 6, 9>
<19, 6, 16>
<19, 8, 12>
<19, 8, 15>
<6, 9, 17>
<6, 9, 3>
<9, 10, 14>
<9, 10, 4>
<2, 16, 19>
<2, 16, 17>
<2, 5, 14>
<13, 1, 17>
<13, 1, 18>
<5, 14, 17>
<5, 14, 3>
<5, 7, 12>
<5, 7, 15>
