Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 19) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 19) (14, 2) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 4) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 19) (2, 14) (2, 3) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 17) (6, 5) (6, 15) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (12, 9) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 15) (0, 3) (0, 19) (0, 13) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 0) (8, 5) (8, 15) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the number of triangles in the graph. Let's start by listing the nodes and their degrees in ascending order:

Node 14: Degree 1
Node 12: Degree 1
Node 18: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 11: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 17: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 15: Degree 3
Node 10: Degree 3
Node 16: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 19: Degree 4

Let's now count the triangles:
1. (Node 0, Node 3, Node 5)
2. (Node 0, Node 3, Node 19)
3. (Node 0, Node 13, Node 4)
4. (Node 0, Node 13, Node 1)
5. (Node 1, Node 10, Node 4)
6. (Node 1, Node 10, Node 13)
7. (Node 3, Node 5, Node 6)
8. (Node 3, Node 5, Node 15)
9. (Node 3, Node 16, Node 9)
10. (Node 3, Node 16, Node 19)
11. (Node 3, Node 16, Node 15)
12. (Node 4, Node 9, Node 15)
13. (Node 4, Node 9, Node 18)
14. (Node 4, Node 9, Node 16)
15. (Node 4, Node 13, Node 1)
16. (Node 4, Node 13, Node 10)
17. (Node 4, Node 17, Node 6)
18. (Node 5, Node 7, Node 8)
19. (Node 5, Node 7, Node 15)
20. (Node 6, Node 15, Node 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20]. The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 19>, <0, 13, 4>, <0, 13, 1>, <1, 10, 4>, <1, 10, 13>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 15>, <3, 16, 9>, <3, 16, 19>, <3, 16, 15>, <4, 9, 15>, <4, 9, 18>, <4, 9, 16>, <4, 13, 1>, <4, 13, 10>, <4, 17, 6>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 15>, <6, 15, 9>.
