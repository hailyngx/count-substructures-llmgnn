Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 1) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 4) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 6) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(8, 13), (8, 5), (8, 14), (8, 3), (8, 7)
(13, 5), (13, 10), (13, 1)
(10, 11), (10, 6), (10, 7), (10, 4)
(11, 9), (11, 12), (11, 4)
(7, 12), (7, 9), (7, 5)
(12, 0), (12, 1), (12, 9)
(0, 3), (0, 9)
(2, 5), (2, 14), (2, 4)
(6, 14)
(1, 5), (1, 4)

Now, let's count the triangles:

Degree-Based Ordering:
0: degree 2
1: degree 3
2: degree 3
3: degree 2
4: degree 4
5: degree 5
6: degree 2
7: degree 4
8: degree 4
9: degree 4
10: degree 4
11: degree 3
12: degree 4
13: degree 3
14: degree 3

Now, let's list the triangles:
<7, 9, 12>
<4, 10, 11>
<1, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 10>
<1, 4, 13>
<5, 7, 13>
<4, 7, 10>
<9, 11, 12>
<5, 7, 8>
<9, 11, 4>
<1, 5, 13>
<9, 12, 0>

Total number of triangles: [12]
