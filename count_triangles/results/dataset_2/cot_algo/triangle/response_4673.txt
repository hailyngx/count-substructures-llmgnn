Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 13) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 18) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 10) (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 15) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 7) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 16) (11, 6) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 12) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 7) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 10) (7, 2) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 16) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 18) (4, 9) (4, 17) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (12, 19) (12, 10) (12, 18) (18, 8) (18, 17) (18, 16) (18, 12) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are:  
Node 0 - degree 2  
Node 2 - degree 3  
Node 11 - degree 3  
Node 16 - degree 3  
Node 5 - degree 3  
Node 12 - degree 4  
Node 15 - degree 4  
Node 4 - degree 4  
Node 1 - degree 4  
Node 19 - degree 4  
Node 6 - degree 5  
Node 3 - degree 5  
Node 17 - degree 5  
Node 14 - degree 5  
Node 18 - degree 6  
Node 7 - degree 6  
Node 10 - degree 6  
Node 9 - degree 6  
Node 8 - degree 6  
Node 13 - degree 6  

The triangles in the graph are:  
[<10, 7, 19>, <10, 12, 18>, <1, 13, 15>, <1, 13, 3>, <1, 8, 18>, <1, 8, 3>, <13, 6, 10>]  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
