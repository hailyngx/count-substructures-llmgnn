Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 13) (14, 17) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 2) (8, 19) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 0) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 18) (3, 4) (3, 9) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 16) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 6) (0, 13) (0, 18) (0, 6) (5, 16) (15, 13) (15, 10) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 9) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 9) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 19) (9, 16) (18, 7) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their degree. Then we relabel the vertices based on this order. 

Sorted Nodes with the corresponding degree:
0: 4
5: 4
8: 4
12: 4
14: 4
3: 5
9: 5
15: 5 
1: 5 
11: 5 
19: 6
7: 6
13: 6
17: 6
2: 7
6: 7
10: 7
16: 7
4: 8
18: 8

Given the sorted vertices, we can start counting the triangles: 

Total number of triangles: [15]

Unique triangles found:
<2, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 18>
<0, 13, 18>
<7, 13, 18>
<1, 11, 19>
<6, 11, 17>
<6, 11, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 16>
<4, 6, 9>
<12, 16, 2>
<2, 16, 17>
<2, 16, 19>
<4, 16, 10>
<9, 16, 19>
