Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is:  
Node 0: degree 7  
Node 1: degree 4  
Node 2: degree 3  
Node 3: degree 5  
Node 4: degree 3  
Node 5: degree 5  
Node 6: degree 3  
Node 7: degree 3  
Node 8: degree 3  
Node 9: degree 5  

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will now count the triangles:  
1. Since Node 0 has the least connections, we check its edges with higher labeled nodes. Node 0 shares connections with Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, and Node 5.  
   - Triangle <0, 1, 5> is formed. (shared connection: Node 1)  
   - Triangle <0, 2, 5> is formed. (shared connection: Node 2)  
   - Triangle <0, 3, 5> is formed. (shared connection: Node 3)  
   - Triangle <0, 4, 5> is formed. (shared connection: Node 4)  
  
2. Next, Node 1 (the next with least connections) shares connections with Node 0, Node 2, and Node 5.  
   - Triangle <1, 0, 5> is formed. 

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
