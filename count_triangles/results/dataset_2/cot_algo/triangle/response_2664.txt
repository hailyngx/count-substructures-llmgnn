Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (26, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 12) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 14) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 25) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 5) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 24) (25, 4) (25, 20) (25, 21) (25, 18) (0, 15) (0, 27) (0, 28) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 24) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 11) (23, 5) (23, 14) (23, 29) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 1) (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 17) (18, 4) (18, 25) (18, 21) (18, 29) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 19) (16, 7) (16, 28) (28, 0) (28, 16) (28, 19) (28, 13) (21, 25) (21, 10) (21, 18) (21, 24) (5, 7) (5, 23) (5, 12) (19, 11) (19, 28) (22, 27) (22, 29) (24, 6) (24, 20) (24, 27) (24, 21) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 23) (14, 10) (13, 9) (13, 28) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 29) (29, 23) (29, 18) (29, 22) (29, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method consists of sorting vertices based on the number of connections (degrees) they have. Let me perform this sorting for the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges:

- Node 26: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 20: degree 3
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 25: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 28: degree 4
- Node 21: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 2
- Node 22: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 23: degree 3
- Node 29: degree 4
- Node 24: degree 4

Following the method where we only consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
We have 22 unique triangles in the graph:
<6, 9, 14>, <6, 9, 24>, <6, 14, 23>, <9, 8, 3>, <9, 14, 10>, <8, 9, 15>, <15, 8, 0>, <15, 8, 12>, <4, 7, 25>, <4, 18, 21>, <7, 4, 25>, <7, 5, 23>, <20, 24, 6>, <0, 15, 12>, <0, 15, 27>, <10, 21, 18>, <17, 10, 21>, <1, 17, 26>, <5, 7, 23>, <5, 12, 29>, <11, 2, 3>, <24, 20, 25>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [22].
