Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 14) (22, 8) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 17) (23, 10) (10, 23) (10, 17) (10, 21) (17, 23) (17, 10) (17, 4) (28, 29) (28, 24) (28, 18) (28, 5) (29, 28) (29, 1) (29, 27) (29, 0) (7, 6) (7, 26) (12, 24) (12, 8) (12, 9) (3, 14) (11, 23) (11, 19) (5, 28) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 20) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 4) (8, 22) (8, 12) (8, 18) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 13) (21, 26) (21, 4) (16, 21) (16, 13) (16, 9) (25, 27) (25, 14) (27, 29) (27, 25) (27, 6) (14, 22) (14, 3) (14, 25) (14, 26) (26, 7) (26, 21) (26, 14) (1, 29) (1, 13) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 20) (2, 0) (13, 21) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 24) (6, 7) (6, 27) (6, 15) (4, 23) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 21) (0, 29) (0, 1) (0, 2) (15, 6) (18, 28) (18, 5) (18, 8) (24, 28) (24, 12) (24, 13) (9, 12) (9, 16) (20, 5) (20, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's first list the degrees of each node:  
Node 0: degree 3  
Node 1: degree 3  
Node 2: degree 3  
Node 3: degree 2  
Node 4: degree 4  
Node 5: degree 5  
Node 6: degree 3  
Node 7: degree 2  
Node 8: degree 4  
Node 9: degree 3  
Node 10: degree 3  
Node 11: degree 4  
Node 12: degree 3  
Node 13: degree 4  
Node 14: degree 4  
Node 15: degree 1  
Node 16: degree 3  
Node 17: degree 4  
Node 18: degree 3  
Node 19: degree 3  
Node 20: degree 2  
Node 21: degree 5  
Node 22: degree 2  
Node 23: degree 4  
Node 24: degree 3  
Node 25: degree 2  
Node 26: degree 4  
Node 27: degree 3  
Node 28: degree 4  
Node 29: degree 4  

Now, we need to relabel the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:  
Node 15: degree 1  
Node 3: degree 2  
Node 7: degree 2  
Node 20: degree 2  
Node 25: degree 2  
Node 22: degree 2  
Node 0: degree 3  
Node 1: degree 3  
Node 2: degree 3  
Node 6: degree 3  
Node 9: degree 3  
Node 10: degree 3  
Node 12: degree 3  
Node 16: degree 3  
Node 18: degree 3  
Node 24: degree 3  
Node 27: degree 3  
Node 4: degree 4  
Node 8: degree 4  
Node 11: degree 4  
Node 13: degree 4  
Node 14: degree 4  
Node 17: degree 4  
Node 19: degree 4  
Node 23: degree 4  
Node 26: degree 4  
Node 28: degree 4  
Node 29: degree 4  
Node 5: degree 5  
Node 21: degree 5  

Now, we can count the triangles and list them inside <>:  
There are [27] triangles in the graph.  
The unique triangles found are:  
<2, 5, 28>  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 2, 20>  
<2, 5, 20>  
<10, 17, 23>  
<8, 12, 18>  
<8, 12, 24>  
<13, 21, 24>  
<13, 21, 26>  
<14, 22, 25>  
<4, 17, 23>  
<4, 17, 21>  
<4, 17, 19>  
<4, 19, 21>  
<1, 13, 29>  
<1, 13, 21>  
<1, 13, 16>  
<1, 13, 24>  
<1, 29, 27>  
<5, 18, 28>  
<5, 18, 8>  
<5, 18, 12>  
<5, 18, 24>  
<16, 21, 24>  
<16, 21, 26>  
<9, 12, 16>
