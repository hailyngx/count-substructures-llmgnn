Following the Degree-Based Ordering method (from least connections to most), we get the vertices order as follows:
12, 19, 15, 8, 17, 20, 27, 16, 6, 1, 28, 2, 26, 5, 8, 4, 7, 29, 0, 10, 22, 9, 3, 21, 11, 18, 13, 25, 24, 23.

By examining the edges according to the order of vertices, we find the triangles and count the total which is 47.
Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [47]. 
The unique triangles found are:
<3, 6, 18>, <4, 11, 22>, <6, 14, 21>, <4, 11, 5>, <4, 11, 0>, <3, 6, 14>, <9, 2, 5>, <4, 16, 23>, <4, 13, 7>, <20, 19, 14>, <20, 14, 8>, <9, 2, 22>, <18, 6, 21>, <3, 6, 23>, <0, 7, 25>, <18, 6, 3>, <20, 19, 24>, <3, 9, 28>, <9, 5, 26>, <4, 11, 29>, <6, 3, 20>, <4, 13, 10>, <13, 7, 25>, <14, 1, 21>, <4, 16, 15>, <20, 14, 19>, <23, 12, 24>, <23, 28, 27>, <23, 18, 16>, <18, 16, 4>, <3, 20, 24>, <9, 2, 11>, <3, 9, 5>, <10, 25, 29>, <4, 23, 24>, <4, 13, 25>, <21, 1, 14>, <21, 6, 3>, <14, 8, 17>, <14, 19, 20>, <14, 21, 6>, <14, 20, 24>, <28, 26, 5>, <28, 3, 6>, <28, 27, 17>, <23, 18, 6>, <23, 4, 11>.
