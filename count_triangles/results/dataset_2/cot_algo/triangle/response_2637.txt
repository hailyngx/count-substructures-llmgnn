Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6
- 1: 0, 3, 7, 8, 9
- 2: 3, 4, 8, 9
- 3: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6
- 4: 0, 2, 7, 8, 9
- 5: 0, 3
- 6: 0, 3, 9
- 7: 1, 4, 9
- 8: 1, 2, 4, 9
- 9: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:

Order: 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 9

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 23]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
