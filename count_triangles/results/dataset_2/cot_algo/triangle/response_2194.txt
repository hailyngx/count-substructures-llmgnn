Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. The sorted vertices are then labeled accordingly. 

Here is the list of vertices sorted with their labels:
- Vertex 5 (degree 2)
- Vertex 9 (degree 2)
- Vertex 7 (degree 2)
- Vertex 1 (degree 3)
- Vertex 3 (degree 3)
- Vertex 0 (degree 4)
- Vertex 6 (degree 6)
- Vertex 4 (degree 6)
- Vertex 2 (degree 6)
- Vertex 8 (degree 9)

Now, let's find the triangles in the graph based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles found:
- <0, 4, 1>
- <0, 4, 3>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 6>

Total number of triangles: [6]
