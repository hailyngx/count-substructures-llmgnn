Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 5) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 17) (13, 16) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 17) (7, 3) (7, 15) (16, 4) (16, 13) (16, 12) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 18) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 15) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 18) (1, 12) (2, 3) (2, 15) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 17) (15, 7) (15, 11) (15, 2) (15, 9) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 3) (17, 5) (17, 19) (17, 12) (17, 9) (18, 0) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first reorder the nodes based on their degrees. Then we will identify the triangles formed by shared connections between the vertices of each edge.

Here is the reordered list of nodes based on their degrees:

0 (degree: 3)
1 (degree: 1)
2 (degree: 2)
3 (degree: 4)
4 (degree: 4)
5 (degree: 3)
6 (degree: 3)
7 (degree: 2)
8 (degree: 3)
9 (degree: 3)
10 (degree: 3)
11 (degree: 3)
12 (degree: 4)
13 (degree: 1)
14 (degree: 3)
15 (degree: 4)
16 (degree: 3)
17 (degree: 4)
18 (degree: 3)
19 (degree: 3)

Next, we will check for triangles among the edges:

- Triangle <0, 14, 6>
- Triangle <0, 14, 10>
- Triangle <0, 14, 18>
- Triangle <3, 10, 12>
- Triangle <3, 10, 14>
- Triangle <3, 10, 18>
- Triangle <3, 12, 14>
- Triangle <3, 12, 17>
- Triangle <3, 14, 18>
- Triangle <4, 5, 8>
- Triangle <4, 9, 15>
- Triangle <4, 16, 13>
- Triangle <4, 16, 12>
- Triangle <4, 16, 12>
- Triangle <4, 16, 13>
- Triangle <4, 16, 12>
- Triangle <4, 16, 13>
- Triangle <4, 16, 12>
- Triangle <4, 16, 13>
- Triangle <5, 8, 19>
- Triangle <8, 19, 11>
- Triangle <8, 19, 17>
- Triangle <10, 12, 17>
- Triangle <14, 6, 18>
- Triangle <15, 9, 17>
- Triangle <15, 11, 18>

Total number of triangles: [26]
