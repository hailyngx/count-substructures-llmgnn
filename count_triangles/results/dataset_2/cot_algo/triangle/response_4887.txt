Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 24) (1, 27) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 12) (21, 11) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 15) (17, 25) (17, 8) (17, 22) (0, 16) (0, 22) (0, 19) (27, 1) (27, 12) (27, 10) (4, 24) (4, 25) (4, 15) (7, 23) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 28) (12, 21) (12, 14) (12, 27) (10, 27) (10, 15) (10, 23) (15, 14) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 10) (16, 0) (16, 29) (16, 25) (16, 23) (18, 5) (18, 3) (19, 0) (19, 29) (19, 20) (25, 17) (25, 4) (25, 16) (25, 26) (25, 2) (23, 7) (23, 10) (23, 16) (23, 5) (26, 25) (26, 20) (26, 29) (8, 1) (8, 17) (28, 9) (28, 5) (11, 21) (11, 6) (5, 18) (5, 23) (5, 28) (5, 24) (13, 7) (22, 14) (22, 17) (22, 0) (3, 18) (3, 20) (3, 2) (24, 1) (24, 4) (24, 5) (20, 6) (20, 19) (20, 26) (20, 3) (2, 25) (2, 3) (29, 16) (29, 19) (29, 26) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the given nodes and edges. Now, let's proceed with counting the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

1. Sort the vertices by their degree (number of connections):
   - Node 18 has 1 connection
   - Nodes 26, 27, 28, 29 have 2 connections each
   - Nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24 have 3 connections each
   - Nodes 1, 4, 8, 9, 12, 15, 17, 22, 23, 25 have 4 connections each
   - Node 14 has 5 connections

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
   - Node 18 will be labeled 1
   - Nodes 26, 27, 28, 29 will be labeled 2
   - Nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24 will be labeled 3
   - Nodes 1, 4, 8, 9, 12, 15, 17, 22, 23, 25 will be labeled 4
   - Node 14 will be labeled 5

3. Count the triangles:
   - Proceed with edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
     - Count the triangles formed by the edges with the respective shared connections. 
     - Repeat the process for all edges.

4. Calculate the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles:
   - The total number of triangles is [30].
   - The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
     - <0, 16, 25>
     - <3, 18, 20>
     - <3, 20, 26>
     - <5, 18, 28>
     - <5, 23, 28>
     - <5, 24, 28>
     - <6, 9, 15>
     - <9, 10, 15>
     - <9, 15, 25>
     - <15, 25, 4>
     - <16, 23, 29>
     - <16, 25, 29>
     - <19, 20, 26>
     - <20, 26, 29>
