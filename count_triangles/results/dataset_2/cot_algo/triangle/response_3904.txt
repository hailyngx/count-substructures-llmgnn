Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 9) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 24) (22, 1) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 4) (23, 21) (8, 9) (8, 28) (8, 6) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 24) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 4) (20, 0) (20, 19) (1, 22) (1, 26) (1, 16) (26, 1) (26, 10) (26, 17) (6, 8) (6, 28) (6, 2) (6, 12) (28, 8) (28, 6) (28, 16) (19, 20) (19, 5) (19, 29) (17, 13) (17, 26) (17, 29) (29, 19) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 14) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (5, 19) (5, 7) (5, 4) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 11) (25, 11) (27, 3) (27, 29) (27, 2) (16, 1) (16, 28) (16, 24) (21, 22) (21, 23) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 25) (11, 24) (24, 22) (24, 13) (24, 16) (24, 11) (10, 26) (10, 18) (2, 6) (2, 27) (14, 0) (14, 29) (14, 18) (4, 23) (4, 0) (4, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 
0 (degree 3),
2 (degree 2),
5 (degree 3),
7 (degree 3),
10 (degree 2),
12 (degree 2),
18 (degree 4),
25 (degree 1),
4 (degree 3),
6 (degree 4),
8 (degree 3),
16 (degree 3),
20 (degree 2),
1 (degree 3),
26 (degree 3),
14 (degree 3),
19 (degree 3),
29 (degree 4),
17 (degree 3),
11 (degree 4),
3 (degree 3),
15 (degree 2),
27 (degree 3),
21 (degree 2),
23 (degree 3),
24 (degree 4),
9 (degree 5),
22 (degree 5),
28 (degree 3).

Based on the degree-based ordering of the vertices, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.
[Number of triangles: 19]

Unique triangles:
