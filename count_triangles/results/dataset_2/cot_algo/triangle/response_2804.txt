Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 6) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 3) 

Response:
From the given graph, first, we need to sort the nodes by their degrees:
Node 5: degree 5
Node 9: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 2: degree 3
Node 12: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 7: degree 3
Node 6: degree 6
Node 1: degree 2
Node 13: degree 5

Now, we will relabel the nodes:
Node 1 -> A
Node 2 -> B
Node 3 -> C
Node 7 -> D
Node 10 -> E
Node 11 -> F
Node 13 -> G
Node 4 -> H
Node 8 -> I
Node 12 -> J
Node 0 -> K
Node 14 -> L
Node 5 -> M
Node 9 -> N
Node 6 -> O

Now, let's see which edges we should consider based on the Degree-Based Ordering method and count the triangles:
We only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections than the other vertex.

Unique triangles:
<C, N, F>
<B, F, G>
<D, G, O>
<A, E, I>
<J, O, L>
<H, I, K>
<K, M, N>
<H, K, J>
<M, N, F>
<A, M, K>
<D, O, L>
<H, M, N>
<D, E, O>
<H, F, N>
<K, M, I>
