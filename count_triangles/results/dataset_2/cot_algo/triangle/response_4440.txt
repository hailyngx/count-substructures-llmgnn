Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 19) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 19) (15, 4) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 18) (5, 3) (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 17) (9, 5) (1, 5) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 0) (19, 16) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 6) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 8) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 10) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 2) (2, 14) (2, 10) (12, 3) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 7) (6, 13) (7, 6) (7, 13) (13, 16) (13, 6) (13, 7) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given 20 nodes and 60 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: (11, 16), (11, 0), (11, 8), (11, 4), (11, 17), (16, 11), (16, 0), (16, 13), (16, 19)
- 1: (3, 5), (3, 12), (3, 4), (5, 3), (5, 9), (5, 1), (9, 17), (9, 5), (1, 5)
- 2: (14, 4), (14, 2), (17, 11), (17, 6), (17, 9), (17, 18), (18, 17), (18, 19), (18, 10), (10, 18), (10, 4), (10, 2), (2, 14), (2, 10)
- 3: (15, 19), (15, 4), (19, 16), (19, 15), (19, 8), (19, 18), (19, 6), (0, 11), (0, 16), (0, 8), (8, 11), (8, 19), (8, 0), (6, 17), (6, 19), (6, 7), (6, 13), (7, 6), (7, 13), (13, 16), (13, 6), (13, 7), (4, 11), (4, 3), (4, 15), (4, 14), (4, 10)

Next, we use Degree-Based Ordering to find the triangles:

1. Sort nodes by their degrees (number of connections):
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 5
- Node 15: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 6
- Node 13: degree 6
- Node 6: degree 6
- Node 5: degree 6
- Node 18: degree 6
- Node 3: degree 9
- Node 16: degree 9
- Node 17: degree 9
- Node 11: degree 11
- Node 4: degree 11
- Node 19: degree 11

2. Iterate through the edges based on the sorted nodes and count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 9]
<3, 4, 11>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 15>
<3, 6, 13>
<3, 4, 10>
<4, 10, 14>
<4, 10, 2>
<11, 16, 19>
<3, 4, 16>
