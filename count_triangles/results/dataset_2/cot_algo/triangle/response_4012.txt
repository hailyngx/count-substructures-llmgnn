Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 24) (29, 28) (29, 0) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 21) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 13) (1, 10) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 15) (26, 20) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 24) (21, 11) (21, 27) (21, 22) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 14) (25, 15) (16, 28) (16, 19) (16, 27) (5, 26) (5, 12) (5, 0) (0, 29) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 24) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 23) (15, 26) (15, 25) (15, 8) (15, 24) (20, 26) (20, 13) (20, 22) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 22) (8, 15) (8, 14) (22, 6) (22, 21) (22, 20) (22, 14) (27, 21) (27, 16) (27, 17) (13, 18) (13, 20) (13, 4) (24, 2) (24, 28) (24, 0) (24, 15) (12, 6) (12, 18) (12, 5) (4, 13) (23, 3) (23, 17) (17, 27) (17, 23) (17, 19) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 17) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}
Edges: 
(6, 9), (6, 22), (6, 12), (6, 19), (9, 2), (9, 11), (2, 18), (2, 10), (2, 24), (29, 0), (10, 7), (10, 1), (11, 7), (11, 21), (18, 12), (18, 13), (1, 26), (26, 5), (26, 15), (26, 20), (28, 16), (28, 24), (21, 27), (7, 14), (25, 15), (5, 0), (3, 14), (3, 23), (8, 14), (20, 13), (13, 4), (12, 5), (23, 17), (19, 17)

Now, we will order the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes sorted by degree: [3, 4, 8, 25, 1, 13, 15, 23, 20, 29, 10, 12, 14, 18, 21, 22, 24, 26, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 16, 17, 19, 27, 28, 0]

Now, we will count the number of triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [13]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 5, 26>
<0, 15, 24>
<0, 24, 28>
<2, 10, 18>
<2, 12, 18>
<2, 18, 24>
<3, 14, 23>
<4, 13, 20>
<7, 10, 11>
<7, 11, 21>
<8, 14, 15>
<13, 18, 20>
<14, 22, 24>
