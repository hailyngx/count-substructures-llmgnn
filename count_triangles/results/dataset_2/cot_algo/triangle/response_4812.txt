Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and the given 40 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (9, 5), (6, 5), (4, 9), (7, 9)
- 1: (6, 1), (4, 1), (8, 1)
- 2: (9, 2), (8, 2), (3, 2)
- 3: (6, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3)
- 4: (6, 4), (0, 4), (1, 4), (8, 4)
- 5: (9, 5), (6, 5)
- 6: (5, 6), (9, 6), (1, 6), (3, 6), (0, 6), (4, 6)
- 7: (9, 7), (0, 7), (8, 7), (3, 7)
- 8: (4, 8), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 7)
- 9: (9, 0), (2, 9), (7, 9)

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections):

Nodes in increasing order of degree: 5, 1, 2, 3, 7, 4, 0, 8, 6, 9

Now, we'll count the triangles:

Triangles:
1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <1, 4, 8>
3. <1, 4, 6>
4. <2, 3, 8>

Total number of triangles: [4]
