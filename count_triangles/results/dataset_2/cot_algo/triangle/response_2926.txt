Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 22) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 25) (27, 28) (27, 7) (27, 23) (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 25) (13, 29) (13, 14) (22, 26) (22, 13) (22, 28) (7, 9) (7, 27) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 24) (21, 7) (21, 1) (21, 17) (10, 24) (11, 19) (11, 17) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 16) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 6) (23, 27) (23, 8) (23, 5) (23, 17) (5, 23) (5, 3) (28, 27) (28, 22) (28, 16) (28, 19) (29, 13) (29, 20) (29, 0) (1, 21) (17, 21) (17, 11) (17, 23) (17, 24) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 29) (16, 18) (16, 28) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 2) (20, 29) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 28) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 13) (12, 16) (12, 19) (12, 3) (24, 7) (24, 10) (24, 8) (24, 17) (25, 15) (25, 13) (3, 5) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 12) (3, 6) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 16) (2, 6) (14, 13) 

Response:
Let's sort the vertices by their degrees from least to most:
Vertices: 
0 (degree 3)
1 (degree 1)
2 (degree 2)
5 (degree 2)
10 (degree 1)
11 (degree 2)
14 (degree 1)
20 (degree 1)
6 (degree 3)
8 (degree 3)
9 (degree 3)
15 (degree 3)
21 (degree 3)
23 (degree 4)
27 (degree 4)
28 (degree 4)
2 (degree 1)
12 (degree 4)
16 (degree 5)
3 (degree 5)
17 (degree 5)
19 (degree 5)
24 (degree 5)
22 (degree 5)
13 (degree 6)
25 (degree 6)
29 (degree 4)
26 (degree 3)
7 (degree 5)
18 (degree 4)

Next, we will count the triangles:
Triangles: [368]
Unique triangles: <0, 15, 18>, <0, 15, 25>, <0, 29, 15>, <3, 12, 13>, <1, 21, 7>, <1, 21, 17>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 12, 16>, <3, 12, 19>, <3, 12, 16>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 16>, <3, 6, 2>, <3, 6, 12>, <3, 16, 2>, <3, 16, 6>, <3, 16, 12>, <5, 23, 27>, <5, 3...12, 19, 16>, <12, 19, 3>, <12, 19, 28>, <12, 3, 16>, <12, 3, 19>, <12, 3, 6>, <12, 3, 12>, <16, 18, 15>, <16, 18, 19>, <16, 28, 19>, <16, 28, 22>, <16, 3, 6>, <16, 3, 12>, <16, 12, 19>, <16, 12, 3>, <17, 11, 21>, <19, 11, 17>, <19, 18, 15>, <20, 29, 13>
