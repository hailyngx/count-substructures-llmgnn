Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Degree of each node:
Node 0: 2
Node 1: 4
Node 2: 4
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 4
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 2
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 4

Sorted vertices based on degree:
0 < 7 < 9 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 8 < 1

Triangles:
[12]
