Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 15) (1, 19) (3, 18) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 11) (17, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 15) (4, 12) (4, 11) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 7) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 9) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 11) (15, 1) (15, 13) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 0) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 19) (16, 14) (16, 18) (18, 3) (18, 14) (18, 0) (18, 16) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: [8, 12, 10, 18]
- 1: [15, 19]
- 2: [17, 8, 7]
- 3: [18]
- 4: [12, 11]
- 5: [7, 19, 10]
- 6: [9, 10]
- 7: [17, 11, 2, 5]
- 8: [2, 0]
- 9: [6, 19, 12]
- 10: [6, 5, 0]
- 11: [14, 17, 4, 7, 19]
- 12: [13, 9, 4, 0]
- 13: [12, 15]
- 14: [17, 11, 18, 16]
- 15: [1, 13]
- 16: [14, 18]
- 17: [14, 2, 11, 7]
- 18: [3, 14, 16, 0]
- 19: [9, 1, 5, 11]

Now, let's count the triangles:
Triangles: [15]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15]. 

Unique triangles found are: 
<0, 12, 4> 
<0, 12, 8> 
<0, 18, 16> 
<1, 13, 15> 
<2, 7, 11> 
<2, 17, 14> 
<2, 17, 7> 
<4, 11, 7> 
<5, 19, 9> 
<5, 19, 11> 
<7, 11, 17> 
<11, 14, 17> 
<11, 19, 5> 
<11, 19, 7> 
<12, 4, 0> 
<18, 0, 16>
