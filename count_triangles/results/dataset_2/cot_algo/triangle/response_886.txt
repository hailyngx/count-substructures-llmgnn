Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 17) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 19) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 17) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 16) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 6) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 18) (17, 11) (17, 2) (17, 1) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 19) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 9) (7, 13) (7, 16) (16, 14) (16, 7) (16, 3) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 18) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 19) (12, 11) (12, 8) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: 20
Edges: (10, 2), (10, 14), (11, 6), (11, 12), (11, 17), (4, 8), (4, 14), (4, 3), (8, 4), (8, 19), (8, 0), (8, 12), (0, 8), (0, 3), (0, 19), (2, 10), (2, 9), (2, 17), (14, 10), (14, 4), (14, 16), (5, 13), (13, 5), (13, 15), (13, 7), (13, 18), (13, 6), (1, 17), (1, 15), (1, 9), (1, 18), (17, 11), (17, 2), (17, 1), (15, 13), (15, 1), (15, 19), (19, 8), (19, 0), (19, 15), (19, 9), (7, 13), (7, 16), (16, 14), (16, 7), (16, 3), (3, 4), (3, 0), (3, 16), (3, 18), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 19), (12, 11), (12, 8), (18, 13), (18, 1), (18, 3), (6, 11), (6, 13)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 5: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 16: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 15: Degree 4
Node 17: Degree 4
Node 18: Degree 4
Node 19: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 13: Degree 6
Node 2: Degree 6
Node 4: Degree 6
Node 8: Degree 6
Node 3: Degree 7
Node 11: Degree 7
Node 14: Degree 7

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:

Triangles: [22]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 8, 19>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 19, 8>
<6, 11, 13>
<6, 11, 17>
<6, 13, 7>
