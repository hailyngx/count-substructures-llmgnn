Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 25) (6, 11) (6, 26) (9, 29) (9, 18) (9, 16) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 13) (21, 7) (21, 13) (21, 26) (21, 8) (21, 5) (4, 8) (4, 25) (8, 21) (8, 4) (8, 25) (28, 0) (28, 25) (29, 9) (29, 11) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 15) (1, 7) (1, 15) (1, 10) (26, 6) (26, 21) (26, 14) (0, 28) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 26) (14, 0) (14, 2) (5, 21) (5, 0) (5, 24) (5, 15) (13, 7) (13, 21) (13, 17) (17, 12) (17, 13) (17, 20) (17, 24) (20, 17) (20, 19) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 5) (25, 6) (25, 4) (25, 8) (25, 28) (25, 27) (27, 25) (27, 11) (27, 16) (27, 23) (10, 12) (10, 1) (2, 14) (22, 16) (22, 24) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 3) (19, 7) (19, 20) (16, 9) (16, 27) (16, 22) (16, 18) (24, 5) (24, 17) (24, 22) (24, 23) (11, 6) (11, 29) (11, 27) (3, 18) (23, 27) (23, 24) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly. 

After relabeling the nodes based on degree in ascending order: 
- Node 2 has 0 connections.
- Node 19 has 1 connection.
- Node 22 has 1 connection.
- Node 3 has 1 connection.
- Node 20 has 2 connections.
- Node 18 has 3 connections.
- Node 10 has 3 connections.
- Node 4 has 3 connections.
- Node 1 has 4 connections.
- Node 5 has 4 connections.
- Node 15 has 4 connections.
- Node 12 has 5 connections.
- Node 14 has 5 connections.
- Node 13 has 5 connections.
- Node 24 has 5 connections.
- Node 23 has 5 connections.
- Node 0 has 6 connections.
- Node 8 has 6 connections.
- Node 21 has 6 connections.
- Node 16 has 6 connections.
- Node 17 has 6 connections.
- Node 7 has 7 connections.
- Node 27 has 7 connections.
- Node 29 has 7 connections.
- Node 11 has 7 connections.
- Node 6 has 8 connections.
- Node 25 has 8 connections.
- Node 9 has 8 connections.
- Node 28 has 8 connections.
- Node 26 has 8 connections.

Following the next steps of the Degree-Based Ordering method as mentioned earlier, we can now proceed to count the triangles in the graph. Let's count the triangles.
