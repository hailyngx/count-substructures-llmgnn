Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 1) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 4) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in efficiently counting the number of triangles in the given graph by sorting the vertices based on their number of connections.

After sorting the vertices based on the number of connections, the labels for the 15 nodes are as follows:
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 10: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 6
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 5

By examining the edges and the labeled nodes, we can proceed with counting the triangles. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [12].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 10>
<1, 3, 14>
<1, 8, 2>
<3, 7, 14>
<3, 10, 13>
<4, 6, 12>
<4, 10, 11>
<6, 12, 5>
<9, 11, 5>
