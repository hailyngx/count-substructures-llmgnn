Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
The degrees of the nodes in the graph are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5

Vertices in decreasing order of degree:
9, 7, 8, 0, 1, 2, 6, 4, 5, 3

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
- (7, 9) forms a triangle with (9, 1) and (7, 1) -> <7, 9, 1>
- (7, 0) forms a triangle with (0, 9) and (7, 9) -> <7, 0, 9>
- (7, 3) forms a triangle with (3, 7) and (7, 8) -> <7, 3, 8>
- (7, 2) forms a triangle with (2, 7) and (7, 8) -> <7, 2, 8>
- (7, 8) forms a triangle with (8, 5) and (7, 5) -> <7, 8, 5>
- (1, 9) forms a triangle with (9, 4) and (1, 4) -> <1, 9, 4>
- (1, 4) forms a triangle with (4, 9) and (1, 9) -> <1, 4, 9>
- (1, 6) forms a triangle with (6, 5) and (1, 5) -> <1, 6, 5>
- (3, 8) forms a triangle with (8, 2) and (3, 2) -> <3, 8, 2>
- (0, 9) forms a triangle with (9, 4) and (0, 4) -> <0, 9, 4>

Total number of triangles: [10]

Each unique triangle: <7, 9, 1>, <7, 0, 9>, <7, 3, 8>, <7, 2, 8>, <7, 8, 5>, <1, 9, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 5>, <3, 8, 2>, <0, 9, 4>
