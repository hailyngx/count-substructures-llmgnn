Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 14) (16, 6) (4, 16) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 15) (8, 0) (13, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (1, 4) (1, 17) (1, 18) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 18) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 6) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 12) (14, 16) (14, 4) (14, 3) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 2) (6, 16) (6, 15) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 0) (12, 10) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 19) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 17) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. After relabelling the vertices accordingly, the sorted list of vertices with their degrees is as follows:

(13: 1), (5: 2), (13: 2), (8: 3), (10: 3), (12: 3), (3: 4), (6: 4), (0: 4), (9: 4), (2: 4), (1: 4), (14: 4), (7: 4), (15: 4), (11: 4), (16: 5), (4: 5), (17: 5), (18: 5), (19: 5)

The edges that can form triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method are:

(4, 1, 17), (4, 6, 15), (4, 7, 2), (4, 7, 9), (17, 1, 18), (17, 3, 14), (16, 6, 15), (16, 14, 3)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8], and the unique triangles found are:

<4, 1, 17>, <4, 6, 15>, <4, 7, 2>, <4, 7, 9>, <17, 1, 18>, <17, 3, 14>, <16, 6, 15>, <16, 14, 3>
