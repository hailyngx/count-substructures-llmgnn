This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 9) (25, 3) (25, 24) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 20) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 27) (11, 29) (12, 10) (12, 24) (12, 28) (27, 11) (27, 19) (27, 23) (0, 1) (20, 10) (20, 17) (20, 22) (28, 12) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 21) (29, 11) (29, 28) (29, 6) (29, 16) (6, 28) (6, 29) (6, 17) (6, 22) (8, 26) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 22) (21, 28) (21, 23) (21, 22) (21, 2) (1, 0) (1, 17) (1, 2) (17, 20) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 13) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 15) (5, 16) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 18) (26, 8) (26, 5) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 24) (19, 27) (19, 18) (19, 14) (15, 5) (15, 13) (2, 21) (2, 1) (2, 5) (23, 27) (23, 21) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 18) (14, 19) (14, 9) (14, 16) (16, 29) (16, 5) (16, 14) (16, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 16) (22, 20) (22, 6) (22, 7) (22, 21) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections, relabeling them accordingly, and then counting the triangles formed by shared connections.

After sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, we obtain the following list:  
Node 0: Degree 2  
Node 7: Degree 2  
Node 8: Degree 2  
Node 15: Degree 2  
Node 10: Degree 3  
Node 12: Degree 3  
Node 16: Degree 3  
Node 20: Degree 3  
Node 21: Degree 3  
Node 22: Degree 3  
Node 25: Degree 3  
Node 3: Degree 4  
Node 5: Degree 4  
Node 6: Degree 4  
Node 13: Degree 4  
Node 14: Degree 4  
Node 17: Degree 4  
Node 18: Degree 4  
Node 19: Degree 4  
Node 1: Degree 5  
Node 2: Degree 5  
Node 24: Degree 5  
Node 27: Degree 5  
Node 29: Degree 5  
Node 11: Degree 6  
Node 26: Degree 6  
Node 23: Degree 6  
Node 9: Degree 7  
Node 28: Degree 7  

Now, we will count the triangles formed by shared connections:
[Total number of triangles: 18]  
Unique triangles:

<13, 15, 18>  
<14, 16, 9>  
<14, 16, 29>  
<16, 5, 29>  
<16, 9, 29>
