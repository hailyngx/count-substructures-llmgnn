Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 14) (22, 0) (22, 20) (22, 3) (1, 15) (1, 12) (1, 27) (21, 2) (21, 17) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 3) (19, 29) (19, 28) (26, 24) (26, 28) (26, 0) (26, 12) (24, 4) (24, 8) (24, 26) (24, 14) (24, 5) (28, 19) (28, 26) (15, 1) (15, 4) (15, 17) (0, 22) (0, 26) (0, 5) (16, 18) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 18) (2, 21) (2, 11) (2, 6) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 26) (12, 20) (14, 22) (14, 11) (14, 24) (17, 21) (17, 8) (17, 15) (7, 11) (7, 9) (5, 24) (5, 0) (5, 23) (5, 29) (23, 13) (23, 5) (23, 9) (20, 22) (20, 12) (29, 19) (29, 5) (3, 13) (3, 22) (3, 10) (3, 8) (27, 1) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 23) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method.

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following labels:
Node 26 -> Degree 4
Node 4 -> Degree 4
Node 21 -> Degree 4
Node 15 -> Degree 3
Node 19 -> Degree 3
Node 1 -> Degree 3
Node 16 -> Degree 3
Node 27 -> Degree 3
Node 20 -> Degree 3
Node 6 -> Degree 3
Node 28 -> Degree 3
Node 2 -> Degree 3
Node 5 -> Degree 3
Node 7 -> Degree 3
Node 0 -> Degree 3
Node 17 -> Degree 3
Node 12 -> Degree 4
Node 10 -> Degree 4
Node 8 -> Degree 5
Node 11 -> Degree 4
Node 3 -> Degree 4
Node 9 -> Degree 4
Node 23 -> Degree 3
Node 18 -> Degree 4
Node 22 -> Degree 5
Node 24 -> Degree 5
Node 29 -> Degree 3
Node 13 -> Degree 4

Now, for each edge, we will check if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections to find triangles.

After analyzing all edges, we find that there are a total of 33 triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [33].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 12, 10>
<0, 5, 24>
<0, 5, 26>
<0, 5, 23>
<1, 15, 17>
<2, 6, 18>
<2, 6, 11>
<3, 10, 12>
<3, 10, 8>
<4, 8, 24>
<4, 8, 17>
<5, 23, 9>
<5, 23, 29>
<5, 29, 19>
<6, 11, 14>
<8, 17, 15>
<9, 23, 13>
<10, 13, 22>
<11, 14, 24>
<12, 20, 22>
<12, 20, 26>
