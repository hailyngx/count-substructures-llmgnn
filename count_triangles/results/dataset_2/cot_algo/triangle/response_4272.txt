Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 18) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 19) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 17) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 19) (17, 2) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 6) (8, 3) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 19) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 13) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 13) (14, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Count the degrees of each node:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 1
Node 9: degree 5
Node 10: degree 2
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 1
Node 15: degree 3
Node 16: degree 3
Node 17: degree 5
Node 18: degree 3
Node 19: degree 4

2. Reorder nodes by degree (ascending):
Nodes 8, 10, 14 have the smallest degrees so we first assign new labels as follows:
New label 8 --> A
New label 10 --> B
New label 14 --> C
Now, continuing in ascending order:
Node 1: D
Node 2: E
Node 4: F
Node 11: G
Node 12: H
Node 15: I
Node 16: J
Node 18: K
Node 0: L
Node 3: M
Node 5: N
Node 6: O
Node 7: P
Node 9: Q
Node 13: R
Node 17: S
Node 19: T

3. Reassign nodes and recreate the graph:
The edges now become: (M, Q) (M, D) (M, I) (Q, M) (Q, S) (Q, K) (A, B) (A, C) (A, F) (D, M) (D, L) (D, O) (F, A) (F, M) (I, D) (I, F) (I, H) (N, K) (N, R) (N, E) (N, L) (A, M) (A, F) (A, N) (A, K) (A, L) (B, M) (B, D) (H, I) (H, R) (H, O) (K, Q) (K, A) (K, T) (L, M) (L, K) (L, T) (D, L) (D, M) (D, S) (S, Q) (S, D) (S, R) (S, T) (S, E) (R, N) (R, S) (R, E) (R, O) (C, B) (G, J) (G, H) (G, R)

4. Count the triangles:
There are 7 triangles in this graph. The triangles are:
< A, F, M >
< B, D, M >
< D, I, F >
< D, L ,M >
< K, A, M >
< Q, K, A >
< R, S, D >

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
