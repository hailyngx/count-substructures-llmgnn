Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 10) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 0) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 11) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 13) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 15
Edges: 60

Edges:
(5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) 
(9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) 
(1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) 
(3, 10) 
(4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) 
(8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) 
(6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 13) 
(2, 7) (2, 0) 
(7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 13) 
(12, 9) (12, 7) 
(0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) 
(14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 0) 
(13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 11) 
(10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) 
(11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 13) 

Next, we will sort the nodes by their degree:

Nodes degree:
Node 3: 1
Node 12: 2
Node 2: 2
Node 4: 3
Node 13: 3
Node 0: 4
Node 10: 5
Node 14: 5
Node 7: 5
Node 6: 5
Node 12: 5
Node 1: 5
Node 8: 6
Node 9: 6
Node 11: 6
Node 5: 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we count the total number of triangles as follows:

[Total Triangles: 15]

Unique Triangles:
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 8, 14>
<1, 11, 14>
<1, 8, 4>
<9, 12, 7>
<9, 12, 7>
<6, 11, 13>
<2, 0, 14>
<2, 7, 13>
<0, 10, 13>
<10, 7, 13>
<10, 0, 13>
<5, 11, 9>
<5, 11, 13>
<5, 6, 11>
