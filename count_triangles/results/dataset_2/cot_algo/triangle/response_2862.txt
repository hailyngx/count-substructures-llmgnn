Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 4) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 10) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 11) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 1) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
(0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 13), (0, 12), (0, 14), (0, 11)
(1, 7), (1, 14), (1, 2), (1, 10)
(2, 5), (2, 14), (2, 6), (2, 1), (2, 10)
(3, 7), (3, 10)
(4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 14), (4, 6), (4, 11)
(5, 2), (5, 12), (5, 4), (5, 7)
(6, 8), (6, 14), (6, 2), (6, 4)
(7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 3), (7, 1)
(8, 10), (8, 0), (8, 6)
(9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 0)
(10, 8), (10, 3), (10, 2), (10, 1)
(11, 13), (11, 12), (11, 0), (11, 4)
(12, 5), (12, 13), (12, 0), (12, 11)
(13, 12), (13, 11), (13, 0)
(14, 0), (14, 6), (14, 1), (14, 4), (14, 2)

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:

Nodes by degree:
Node 3: Degree 2
Nodes 1, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14: Degree 4
Nodes 2, 11, 12: Degree 5
Nodes 0, 6, 7: Degree 6
Node 4: Degree 7
Node 5: Degree 8

Applying the degree-based ordering method to count triangles:

1. (3, 7): Forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <3, 7, 1>
2. (1, 7): Does not form a triangle since 1 has higher degree than 7.
3. (8, 10): Does not form a triangle since 8 has higher degree than 10.
4. (13, 12): Does not form a triangle since 13 has higher degree than 12.
5. (7, 5): Forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <7, 5, 2>
6. (11, 13): Forms a triangle with shared connection 13: <11, 13, 12>
7. (2, 14): Forms a triangle with shared connection 14: <2, 14, 1>
8. (4, 14): Forms a triangle with shared connection 14: <4, 14, 1>
9. (10, 3): Does not form a triangle since 10 has higher degree than 3.
10. (5, 12): Forms a triangle with shared connection 12: <5, 12, 13>
11. (9, 0): Forms a triangle with shared connection 0: <9, 0, 8>
12. (6, 2): Forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <6, 2, 5>
13. (0, 13): Forms a triangle with shared connection 13: <0, 13, 12>
14. (0, 14): Forms a triangle with shared connection 14: <0, 14, 1>
15. (0, 11): Forms a triangle with shared connection 11: <0, 11, 4>
16. (6, 4): Forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <6, 4, 5>

Total number of triangles: [8]
