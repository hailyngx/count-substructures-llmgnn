Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 10) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 14) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 4) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 13) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 10) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 10) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the number of triangles in the given graph.

The nodes with their connections are:
- Node 0: 6 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 3: 5 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 10: 4 connections
- Node 11: 5 connections
- Node 12: 3 connections
- Node 13: 2 connections
- Node 14: 5 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, the ordered nodes are:
1. Node 1 (2 connections)
2. Node 13 (2 connections)
3. Node 6 (3 connections)
4. Node 7 (3 connections)
5. Node 12 (3 connections)
6. Node 4 (4 connections)
7. Node 5 (4 connections)
8. Node 8 (4 connections)
9. Node 9 (4 connections)
10. Node 10 (4 connections)
11. Node 0 (6 connections)
12. Node 2 (5 connections)
13. Node 3 (5 connections)
14. Node 11 (5 connections)
15. Node 14 (5 connections)

Based on the ordering, we will count the triangles. 
Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles:
1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <0, 2, 3>
3. <0, 3, 4>
4. <8, 10, 11>
