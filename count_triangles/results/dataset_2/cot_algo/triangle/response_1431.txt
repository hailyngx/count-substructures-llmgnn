Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 27) (7, 20) (7, 24) (21, 3) (21, 11) (20, 7) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 6) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 8) (25, 0) (18, 22) (18, 9) (18, 10) (15, 23) (15, 17) (15, 28) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 17) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 10) (3, 29) (28, 15) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 24) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 0) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 10) (9, 13) (9, 18) (9, 27) (11, 21) (11, 29) (24, 7) (24, 28) (24, 12) (16, 1) (16, 23) (16, 29) (5, 25) (5, 8) (8, 20) (8, 25) (8, 5) (26, 27) (26, 17) (14, 4) (14, 1) (0, 25) (0, 2) (0, 23) (23, 15) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 6) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 28) (17, 26) (17, 19) (27, 22) (27, 9) (27, 26) (19, 17) (19, 6) (1, 16) (1, 14) (29, 3) (29, 11) (29, 16) (10, 18) (10, 3) (10, 12) (6, 20) (6, 4) (6, 23) (6, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help in counting the number of triangles in the given graph:

Nodes by their degree:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 2
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 2
Node 15: degree 3
Node 16: degree 3
Node 17: degree 5
Node 18: degree 3
Node 19: degree 2
Node 20: degree 4
Node 21: degree 2
Node 22: degree 3
Node 23: degree 4
Node 24: degree 4
Node 25: degree 4
Node 26: degree 2
Node 27: degree 3
Node 28: degree 4
Node 29: degree 3

Sorting nodes based on their degree:
Nodes: 1, 7, 11, 14, 19, 26, 9, 18, 10, 0, 4, 5, 13, 12, 6, 22, 17, 27, 15, 16, 23, 29, 2, 3, 20, 24, 25, 8, 21, 28
