Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 10) (9, 1) (26, 16) (6, 14) (6, 29) (6, 3) (10, 9) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 27) (11, 13) (11, 25) (8, 15) (8, 7) (23, 4) (23, 0) (23, 28) (4, 23) (4, 22) (4, 16) (4, 14) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 28) (18, 13) (21, 28) (21, 5) (28, 23) (28, 18) (28, 21) (28, 24) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 14) (17, 29) (17, 19) (17, 22) (17, 27) (29, 6) (29, 17) (29, 25) (5, 18) (5, 21) (19, 17) (19, 1) (15, 8) (25, 11) (25, 29) (25, 22) (22, 4) (22, 17) (22, 25) (22, 24) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 16) (0, 23) (0, 2) (0, 18) (24, 28) (24, 22) (24, 1) (24, 20) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 13) (20, 24) (20, 16) (27, 11) (27, 17) (1, 9) (1, 19) (1, 24) (16, 26) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 3) (16, 20) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized with the following nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: (9, 10), (9, 1), (26, 16), (6, 14), (6, 29), (6, 3), (10, 11), (8, 15), (8, 7), (23, 4), (23, 0), (23, 28), (4, 22), (7, 12), (2, 18), (18, 5), (21, 28), (28, 24), (17, 19), (17, 27), (5, 21), (25, 29), (3, 16), (0, 2), (0, 24), (14, 12), (20, 24)

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Nodes by degree (increasing order):  
1: 0, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 19, 20, 26, 27  
2: 1, 2, 3, 5, 12, 13, 17, 18, 21  
3: 4, 6, 7, 22, 23, 28, 29  
4: 11, 14, 24, 25  

Now, count the triangles:
Triangles: [12]

Unique triangles:  
<0, 2, 24>  
<0, 18, 2>  
<0, 24, 20>  
<1, 9, 10>  
<1, 19, 17>  
<2, 18, 0>  
<3, 6, 14>  
<4, 7, 12>  
<4, 16, 3>  
<4, 22, 24>  
<10, 9, 1>  
<13, 18, 5>
