Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
1. Degree of each node:  
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 5: 5 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 10: 3 connections
- Node 11: 5 connections
- Node 12: 3 connections
- Node 13: 2 connections
- Node 14: 4 connections
- Node 15: 4 connections
- Node 16: 4 connections
- Node 17: 3 connections
- Node 18: 4 connections
- Node 19: 2 connections
- Node 20: 3 connections
- Node 21: 4 connections
- Node 22: 3 connections
- Node 23: 4 connections
- Node 24: 3 connections
- Node 25: 0 connections
- Node 26: 2 connections
- Node 27: 2 connections
- Node 28: 3 connections

- Node 4: 2 connections  
- Node 8: 2 connections  
- Node 13: 2 connections  
- Node 27: 2 connections  
- Node 3: 2 connections  
- Node 26: 2 connections  
- Node 19: 2 connections  
- Node 20: 3 connections  
- Node 10: 3 connections  
- Node 7: 3 connections  
- Node 18: 4 connections   
- Node 12: 4 connections  
- Node 17: 3 connections  
- Node 28: 3 connections  
- Node 22: 3 connections  
- Node 14: 4 connections  
- Node 24: 3 connections  
- Node 6: 3 connections  
- Node 16: 4 connections  
- Node 9: 4 connections  
- Node 0: 4 connections  
- Node 21: 4 connections  
- Node 23: 4 connections  
- Node 15: 4 connections  
- Node 11: 5 connections  
- Node 5: 5 connections  
- Node 2: 3 connections

3. Count the number of triangles (triangles are formed by shared connections between nodes on each edge sorted by the lower label node):  
- Number of triangles: [4]
- Unique triangles found:  
    - <7, 10, 17>  
    - <5, 11, 29>  
    - <0, 12, 20>  
    - <18, 21, 28>
