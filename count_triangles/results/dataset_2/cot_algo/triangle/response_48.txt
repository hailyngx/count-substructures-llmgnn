Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 19) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 12) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 15) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 12) (7, 18) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 10) (1, 13) (15, 14) (15, 4) (15, 5) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 1) (16, 0) (16, 6) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 19) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 5) (6, 18) (6, 16) (19, 17) (19, 9) (19, 10) (5, 15) (5, 3) (5, 10) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 0) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:  

Node 19: 4 connections  
Nodes 1, 16, 17, 3, 6, 8, 18: 1 connection each  
Nodes 0, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13: 2 connections each  
Nodes 2, 4, 15, 11: 3 connections each  
Node 14: 6 connections  
Node 9: 5 connections  

Based on the sorted list, we'll check the edges accordingly to count the triangles.  

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is: [2].  

The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 7, 12>  
<4, 9, 15>
