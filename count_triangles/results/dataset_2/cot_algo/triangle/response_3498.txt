Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 21) (26, 28) (26, 7) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 20) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 11) (2, 14) (2, 29) (2, 18) (29, 2) (29, 20) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 5) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 15) (22, 9) (22, 23) (22, 27) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 4) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 24) (3, 1) (3, 18) (0, 17) (0, 20) (0, 7) (20, 14) (20, 29) (20, 1) (20, 0) (18, 2) (18, 3) (18, 4) (4, 23) (4, 18) (4, 21) (4, 8) (7, 26) (7, 0) (7, 16) (21, 9) (21, 4) (28, 26) (28, 8) (28, 15) (5, 10) (5, 24) (13, 11) (13, 27) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 28) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 25) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 24) (12, 8) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 12) (8, 27) (6, 14) (6, 11) (25, 22) (25, 16) (25, 19) (27, 22) (27, 13) (27, 8) (24, 1) (24, 5) (24, 12) (19, 25) 

Response:
The graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges is constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: 
- 0: {17, 20, 7}
- 1: {18, 20, 24}
- 2: {14, 29, 18}
- 3: {1, 18}
- 4: {23, 18, 21, 8}
- 5: {10, 24}
- 6: {14, 11}
- 7: {26, 0, 16}
- 8: {4, 28, 12, 27}
- 9: {22, 15, 21}
- 10: {11, 15, 5}
- 11: {17, 10, 13, 6, 15}
- 12: {17, 16, 24, 8}
- 13: {11, 27}
- 14: {17, 6, 20, 2}
- 15: {9, 10, 11, 28}
- 16: {7, 12, 25}
- 17: {14, 0, 12, 11}
- 18: {2, 3, 4}
- 19: {25}
- 20: {14, 29, 1, 0}
- 21: {9, 4}
- 22: {23, 9, 27, 25}
- 23: {22, 4}
- 24: {1, 5, 12}
- 25: {22, 16, 19}
- 26: {28, 7}
- 27: {22, 13, 8}
- 28: {26, 8, 15}
- 29: {2, 20}

Next, we sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):
Nodes sorted by degree (ascending): [19, 3, 5, 6, 13, 1, 16, 0, 21, 29, 4, 9, 10, 24, 27, 2, 25, 26, 14, 7, 8, 18, 11, 12, 15, 17, 22, 20, 23, 28]

As we iterate through each edge, we find the triangles formed:
Triangles: [0] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
The unique triangle found is <4, 8, 28>.
