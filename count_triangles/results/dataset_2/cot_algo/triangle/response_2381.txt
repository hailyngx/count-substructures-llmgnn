Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 27) (8, 23) (8, 28) (23, 8) (23, 7) (23, 1) (26, 5) (26, 28) (26, 21) (26, 3) (26, 12) (28, 8) (28, 26) (28, 19) (6, 7) (6, 25) (21, 26) (21, 20) (21, 22) (21, 17) (25, 6) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 24) (27, 9) (27, 25) (27, 13) (2, 5) (2, 17) (12, 26) (12, 24) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 20) (16, 18) (16, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 20) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 11) (24, 3) (24, 13) (15, 19) (19, 28) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 20) (7, 9) (7, 23) (7, 6) (29, 25) (1, 23) (1, 10) (3, 26) (3, 24) (3, 14) (3, 4) (14, 16) (14, 3) (17, 21) (17, 2) (20, 21) (20, 10) (20, 11) (20, 19) (22, 21) (18, 10) (18, 16) (18, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 3) (13, 27) (13, 24) (13, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph. 

The nodes are numbered as follows based on their degree:
0: 1 connection
1: 2 connections
2: 2 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 2 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 4 connections
10: 4 connections
11: 4 connections
12: 2 connections
13: 3 connections
14: 2 connections
15: 1 connection
16: 2 connections
17: 2 connections
18: 3 connections
19: 4 connections
20: 4 connections
21: 4 connections
22: 1 connection
23: 3 connections
24: 5 connections
25: 4 connections
26: 5 connections
27: 3 connections
28: 3 connections
29: 1 connection

Based on the vertex ordering, the triangles found in the graph are:
<4, 10, 20>
<4, 10, 11>
<4, 3, 24>
<4, 3, 14>
<4, 3, 11>
<10, 11, 20>
<10, 1, 4>
<10, 1, 20>
<10, 20, 11>
<13, 18, 24>
<13, 18, 27>
<13, 24, 27>
<18, 16, 10>
<18, 16, 14>
<18, 13, 24>
<18, 13, 27>
<27, 13, 24>
<21, 26, 28>
<26, 28, 19>
<26, 3, 24>
<26, 3, 12>
<26, 3, 14>
<26, 3, 4>
<26, 12, 24>
<26, 12, 3>
<26, 12, 14>
<26, 12, 21>
<26, 24, 3>
<26, 24, 13>
<26, 24, 11>
<26, 24, 12>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [30].
