Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 14) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 11) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 10) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 13) (12, 8) (12, 11) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (13, 10) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(0, 1), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 11), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 14), (5, 8), (5, 9), (5, 10), (5, 11), (6, 8), (6, 13), (6, 14), (7, 11), (8, 12), (8, 6), (8, 12), (9, 13), (9, 14), (10, 13), (10, 14), (11, 12), (11, 14), (11, 12), (13, 14)

After sorting the nodes by their degrees from least to most:
Nodes: 0, 4, 6, 10, 12, 7, 5, 9, 1, 3, 11, 8, 13, 2, 14

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
1. Starting with the edge (0, 1): No triangles are formed.
2. Moving to the edge (0, 7): No triangles are formed.
3. Proceeding to the edge (1, 2): Formed a triangle with node 0. Triangle <0, 1, 2>.
4. Continuing with the rest of the edges and counting triangles accordingly.

After considering all edges, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <2, 3, 8>, <5, 9, 14>, <6, 13, 14>.
