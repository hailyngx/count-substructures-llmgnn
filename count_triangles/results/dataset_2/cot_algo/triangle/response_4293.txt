Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 

The degrees of the nodes are:  
- Node 0 has degree 5  
- Node 1 has degree 4  
- Node 2 has degree 4  
- Node 3 has degree 5  
- Node 4 has degree 4  
- Node 5 has degree 4  
- Node 6 has degree 4  
- Node 7 has degree 4  
- Node 8 has degree 3  
- Node 9 has degree 3  

Sorting the nodes by degree in ascending order:  
Nodes 8 and 9 have the lowest degree, tiebreaker based on node numbers:  
Node 8 is assigned label 0  
Node 9 is assigned label 1  

Labeling nodes by degree-based ordering:  
Nodes and their labels:  
- Node 8 (degree 3) is labeled as 0  
- Node 9 (degree 3) is labeled as 1  
- Node 2 (degree 4) is labeled as 2  
- Node 1 (degree 4) is labeled as 3  
- Node 6 (degree 4) is labeled as 4  
- Node 7 (degree 4) is labeled as 5  
- Node 4 (degree 4) is labeled as 6  
- Node 5 (degree 4) is labeled as 7  
- Node 3 (degree 5) is labeled as 8  
- Node 0 (degree 5) is labeled as 9  

Now, we will count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering.  

Number of triangles:  
[16]  

Unique triangles:  
<0, 2, 4>  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 2, 6>  
<0, 3, 6>  
<0, 5, 6>  
<1, 3, 8>  
<1, 4, 5>  
<1, 4, 8>  
<1, 5, 6>  
<2, 3, 8>  
<2, 6, 7>  
<4, 5, 7>  
<4, 6, 7>  
<4, 7, 8>  
<5, 6, 7>  
<6, 7, 8>
