Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be depicted as follows:

```
     0 -- 6
    /|    |\
   7 2 -- 8 1
    |\  | /|
     5 9(4)3
      \ | /
        6
```

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, and relabeling accordingly, we get the following ordered list:
Nodes: 0(2), 3(2), 5(3), 6(3), 4(4), 1(5), 7(5), 9(5), 8(6), 2(7)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

1. Triangle: <1, 2, 6>
2. Triangle: <1, 2, 7>
3. Triangle: <1, 2, 8>
4. Triangle: <1, 4, 6>
5. Triangle: <1, 4, 7>
6. Triangle: <1, 4, 8>
7. Triangle: <1, 6, 8>
8. Triangle: <2, 4, 6>
9. Triangle: <2, 4, 7>
10. Triangle: <2, 4, 8>
11. Triangle: <2, 6, 7>
12. Triangle: <2, 6, 8>
13. Triangle: <2, 7, 8>
14. Triangle: <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
