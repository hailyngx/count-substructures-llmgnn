Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 9) (14, 4) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 2) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 12) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 15) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 7) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 19) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 10) (5, 4) (8, 17) (8, 10) (6, 2) (7, 18) (7, 13) (7, 15) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 7) (9, 14) (9, 16) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 19) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 19) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 0)
