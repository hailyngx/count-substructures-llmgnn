Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 15) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 8) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 1) (12, 19) (15, 10) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 19) (8, 16) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 8) (19, 16) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 16) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 1) (13, 6) (13, 0) (17, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method as described earlier. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Construct the graph with the given nodes and edges.
2. Sort the vertices based on the number of connections they have, from least to most.
3. Relabel the vertices according to their sorted order.
4. Iterate through each edge, and for each edge, check if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
5. For the valid edges, find any shared connections between the two vertices, which will form triangles.

Let's start by constructing the graph and sorting the vertices based on their degree:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Sorted vertices based on degree (from least to most connections):
5, 17, 2, 15, 13, 14, 16, 18, 1, 5, 17, 2, 3, 11, 12, 14, 15, 19, 0, 4, 6, 9, 10, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the triangles and count the total number of triangles.

Vertices connected to each vertex in the sorted order:

0: 6, 9, 11, 3, 13
1: 16, 2, 12, 14, 5
2: 1, 18
3: 7, 6, 0
4: 7, 19
5: 1
6: 9, 10, 3, 0, 13
7: 3, 12, 4, 8
8: 7, 18, 19, 16
9: 6, 17, 0
10: 6, 11, 15
11: 0, 14, 10
12: 1, 18, 7, 19
13: 6, 0
14: 11, 1
15: 10
16: 8, 19, 1
17: 9
18: 2, 12, 8
19: 12, 4, 16, 8

Counting the triangles:
Total number of triangles: [18]

Unique triangles found: 
<6, 9, 0>, <6, 9, 10>, <6, 9, 17>, <6, 10, 11>, <6, 10, 15>, <6, 11, 0>, <6, 11, 14>, <6, 13, 0>, <6, 0, 3>, <9, 17, 0>, <10, 11, 0>, <1, 12, 18>, <1, 12, 19>, <1, 14, 11>, <12, 7, 8>, <12, 7, 18>, <12, 8, 16>, <19, 4, 7>
