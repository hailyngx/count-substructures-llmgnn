Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 12) (17, 22) (2, 1) (29, 14) (29, 17) (29, 28) (22, 17) (22, 23) (22, 11) (23, 22) (23, 4) (23, 16) (23, 9) (10, 0) (10, 9) (4, 23) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 20) (8, 12) (28, 14) (28, 29) (28, 13) (28, 15) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 20) (18, 21) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 26) (12, 19) (0, 10) (0, 25) (20, 8) (20, 18) (24, 26) (24, 1) (24, 15) (26, 12) (26, 24) (26, 11) (26, 3) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 21) (5, 16) (13, 28) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 6) (9, 23) (9, 10) (9, 13) (25, 0) (25, 21) (27, 11) (27, 1) (3, 26) (3, 6) (3, 19) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 24) (1, 27) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 27) (11, 6) (15, 28) (15, 18) (15, 24) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 11) (19, 12) (19, 3) (21, 18) (21, 5) (21, 25) (16, 23) (16, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied as follows:

1. Sort the nodes based on their number of connections:
Node 2 has 1 connection.
Nodes 7, 0, 14, and 27 have 2 connections.
Nodes 4, 5, 8, 10, 15, 16, 20, 21, 24, 25, and 28 have 3 connections.
Nodes 1, 6, 9, 13, 18, 19, 22, 23, and 29 have 4 connections.
Nodes 3, 11, and 26 have 5 connections.
Node 12 has 6 connections.
Node 17 has 7 connections.

2. Relabel the nodes based on degree:  
Node 2 -> A
Nodes 7, 0, 14, and 27 -> B
Nodes 4, 5, 8, 10, 15, 16, 20, 21, 24, 25, and 28 -> C
Nodes 1, 6, 9, 13, 18, 19, 22, 23, and 29 -> D
Nodes 3, 11, and 26 -> E
Node 12 -> F
Node 17 -> G

3. Count the triangles:
- For each edge, consider only cases where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.
- Check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

Triangles:
<5, 13, 28>
<5, 15, 28>
<5, 18, 15>
<5, 16, 23>
<9, 13, 28>
<9, 13, 6>
<9, 23, 16>
<13, 15, 28>
<13, 6, 11>
<15, 18, 21>
<15, 18, 20>
<18, 20, 8>

Total number of triangles: [12]
