Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 14) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 12) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 3) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 10) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges:
- 0: {6, 9, 12}
- 1: {6, 7, 9}
- 2: {3, 7, 13}
- 3: {2, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- 4: {7, 8, 9, 10, 14}
- 5: {6, 10, 13, 14}
- 6: {0, 1, 5, 10}
- 7: {1, 2, 4}
- 8: {4, 11, 12}
- 9: {0, 1, 4, 10, 13}
- 10: {4, 5, 6, 9, 13}
- 11: {8, 3, 12}
- 12: {0, 3, 8, 11}
- 13: {2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 14}
- 14: {4, 5, 13, 3}

Now, we will perform Degree-Based Ordering to simplify the counting of triangles.

Vertices sorted by degree (from lowest to highest):
0, 1, 8, 2, 11, 6, 12, 7, 5, 9, 10, 4, 13, 3, 14

Now, we will count the triangles:

Triangles: [<3, 12, 14>, <3, 5, 13>]

Total number of triangles: [2]
