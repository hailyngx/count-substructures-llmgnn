Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 4) (15, 11) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 10) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 16) (12, 5) (4, 15) (4, 18) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) (17, 7) (17, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 16) (19, 0) (0, 19) (0, 16) (0, 2) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 0) (1, 2) (6, 10) (6, 17) (6, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) (14, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (9, 13) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Based on the given edges, the connections for each node are:
0: 2, 16, 19
1: 2
2: 0, 1, 5, 13
3: 8, 11, 15
4: 15, 18
5: 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14
6: 8, 10, 17
7: 5, 7, 13, 17, 18
8: 3, 6, 8, 10, 14, 19
9: 13
10: 5, 6, 8, 10, 11
11: 3, 10, 15
12: 5, 16
13: 2, 7, 9
14: 5, 8, 18
15: 3, 4, 11
16: 0, 12, 19
17: 6, 7
18: 4, 7, 14
19: 0, 8, 16

Sorting the nodes based on degree:
Degree 0: {1, 9}
Degree 1: {4, 17}
Degree 2: {6, 12}
Degree 3: {3}
Degree 4: {0, 19}
Degree 5: {11}
Degree 6: {5, 13}
Degree 8: {14}
Degree 9: {2}
Degree 10: {18}
Degree 12: {7}
Degree 16: {16}
Degree 18: {10}
Degree 19: {8, 15}

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:
Number of triangles: [10]

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 14>
<2, 5, 12>
<2, 5, 14>
<2, 7, 13>
<4, 7, 18>
<5, 7, 12>
<5, 8, 14>
<6, 10, 17>
<8, 10, 14>
