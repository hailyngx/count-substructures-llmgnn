Vertex 17: degree 2  
Vertex 4: degree 2  
Vertex 21: degree 2  
Vertex 28: degree 3  
Vertex 7: degree 4  
Vertex 29: degree 4  
Vertex 3: degree 4  
Vertex 8: degree 4  
Vertex 18: degree 4  
Vertex 12: degree 4  
Vertex 10: degree 5  
Vertex 14: degree 5  
Vertex 22: degree 5  
Vertex 6: degree 5  
Vertex 2: degree 5  
Vertex 19: degree 2  
Vertex 27: degree 2  
Vertex 24: degree 1  
Vertex 9: degree 3  
Vertex 1: degree 3

Now, counting the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:  

\[ [21] \]  

Unique triangles found: 
<1, 18, 4>, <0, 15, 26>, <0, 15, 24>, <0, 15, 22>, <3, 2, 6>, <3, 6, 12>, <3, 6, 14>, <3, 6, 2>, <8, 7, 22>, <8, 22, 4>, <8, 22, 15>, <9, 0, 26>, <9, 0, 15>, <9, 7, 5>, <12, 14, 10>, <12, 14, 6>, <12, 14, 25>, <12, 25, 25>, <13, 7, 22>, <17, 21, 26>, <18, 1, 28>
