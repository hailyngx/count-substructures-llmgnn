Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 15) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 17) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 16) (15, 5) (15, 19) (13, 19) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 0) (0, 17) (0, 11) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 1) (16, 3) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 12) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 3) (19, 6) (3, 16) (3, 19) (7, 10) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12) (12, 14) (12, 10) (6, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in the graph efficiently. 

Let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices in ascending order of degree: [0, 6, 7, 13, 3, 15, 2, 12, 1, 7, 13, 16, 5, 17, 10, 18, 11, 4, 14, 19, 8, 9]

Now, let's find the triangles:
Triangles:
<0, 11, 14>
<0, 11, 18>
<0, 11, 4>
<1, 10, 12>
<1, 10, 14>
<1, 10, 8>
<1, 12, 14>
<1, 16, 2>
<1, 16, 5>
<2, 14, 11>
<3, 16, 5>
<4, 11, 14>
<4, 11, 18>
<4, 11, 8>
<4, 14, 2>
<5, 15, 19>
<6, 13, 19>
<8, 11, 4>
<8, 11, 14>
<8, 11, 18>
<8, 14, 2>
<9, 10, 8>
<9, 10, 12>
<10, 12, 14>
<14, 11, 18>

Total number of triangles: [25]
