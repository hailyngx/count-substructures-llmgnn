Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 2) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 10) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 0) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 12) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the triangles efficiently. 
Here are the steps followed:

Vertices by their number of connections from least to most: 
Nodes: [6, 9, 11, 7, 12, 4, 0, 5, 2, 14, 10, 13, 3, 8, 1]

Sorted edges based on node labels:
(0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) 
(1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 14) 
(2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 13) 
(3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 13) 
(4, 11) 
(5, 10) (5, 12) 
(6, 7) (6, 8) 
(7, 10) (7, 11) 
(8, 14) 
(9, 10) 

Triangles found based on shared connections:
Total number of triangles: [12] 
Unique triangles: 
<0, 5, 6> 
<3, 4, 11> 
<3, 4, 13> 
<3, 5, 12> 
<3, 7, 11> 
<3, 7, 10> 
<3, 9, 10> 
<3, 10, 13> 
<5, 10, 12> 
<7, 10, 11> 
<12, 5, 0> 
<13, 2, 4>
