Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled as follows based on their degree:
- Node 0: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 4
- Node 2: Degree 4
- Node 3: Degree 3
- Node 4: Degree 4
- Node 5: Degree 4
- Node 6: Degree 3
- Node 7: Degree 6
- Node 8: Degree 3
- Node 9: Degree 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will list the unique triangles found:
- <1, 5, 4>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <1, 7, 2>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <2, 7, 9>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
