Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 28) (17, 5) (17, 21) (1, 28) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 27) (3, 25) (3, 0) (3, 16) (25, 3) (25, 5) (25, 6) (25, 22) (8, 23) (8, 21) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 18) (23, 10) (28, 17) (28, 1) (29, 5) (29, 24) (22, 25) (22, 11) (22, 12) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 27) (11, 23) (11, 22) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 2) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 20) (19, 9) (27, 1) (27, 13) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 5) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 9) (16, 20) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 2) (6, 14) (6, 25) (6, 18) (24, 29) (24, 10) (0, 3) (15, 9) (15, 18) (18, 23) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 15) (20, 19) (20, 16) (21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 2) (9, 19) (9, 16) (9, 15) (12, 1) (12, 22) (12, 13) (12, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 21) (10, 23) (10, 4) (10, 24) (10, 12) (5, 17) (5, 25) (5, 29) (5, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
```
0: [3]
1: [7, 12, 27, 28]
2: [4, 11, 21]
3: [0, 16, 25]
4: [2, 10, 19]
5: [7, 17, 25, 29]
6: [14, 18, 25]
7: [1, 5, 16]
8: [21, 23]
9: [15, 16, 19]
10: [4, 12, 23, 24]
11: [2, 18, 19, 22, 23]
12: [1, 10, 13, 22]
13: [12, 14, 27]
14: [6, 13, 17]
15: [9, 18]
16: [3, 7, 9, 20]
17: [5, 14, 21, 28]
18: [6, 11, 15, 18]
19: [4, 9, 11, 20]
20: [16, 19]
21: [2, 8, 17]
22: [11, 12, 25]
23: [8, 10, 11]
24: [10, 29]
25: [3, 5, 6, 22]
28: [1, 17]
29: [5, 24]
```

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices are:
```
0 < 3
1 < 7 < 12 < 27 < 28
2 < 4 < 21 < 11
5 < 16 < 25 < 17
6 < 14 < 18
8 < 21 < 23
9 < 15 < 19
10 < 4 < 12 < 23 < 24
11 < 2 < 18 < 19 < 22
13 < 12 < 27 < 14
29 < 24
```

By following the edge rule mentioned in the question and counting triangles by finding shared connections, it is found that:
<7, 16, 21>, <11, 18, 19>, and <4, 10, 12> are the unique triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
