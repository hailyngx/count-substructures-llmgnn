Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method is as follows:

Node 9 has 4 connections  
Node 6 has 2 connections  
Node 8 has 3 connections  
Node 7 has 5 connections  
Node 1 has 4 connections  
Node 3 has 4 connections  
Node 0 has 5 connections  
Node 5 has 3 connections  
Node 4 has 5 connections  
Node 2 has 4 connections  

Applying the degree-based ordering, we will start with the edges involving nodes with the lowest degrees first. 
After checking each edge, we find the triangles formed by shared connections. 

<0, 1, 4>  
<0, 2, 4>  
<0, 4, 7>  
<1, 4, 7>  
<2, 4, 7>  
<3, 1, 7>  
<3, 5, 9>  
<4, 7, 1>  
<4, 7, 2>  
<5, 3, 9>  

The total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
