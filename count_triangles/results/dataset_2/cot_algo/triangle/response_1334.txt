Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 14) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 6) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 6) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 14) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 10), (7, 0), (7, 10), (7, 2), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 14), (8, 1), (0, 3), (0, 6), (5, 14), (5, 2), (5, 12), (13, 14), (13, 1), (9, 11), (2, 5), (2, 12), (2, 1), (6, 14)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node degrees:
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 10: 2 connections
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 13: 2 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 14: 5 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 11: 5 connections
- Node 12: 3 connections

Nodes by degree (from least to most connected):
10, 0, 13, 6, 1, 3, 12, 4, 5, 9, 8, 7, 11, 2, 14
