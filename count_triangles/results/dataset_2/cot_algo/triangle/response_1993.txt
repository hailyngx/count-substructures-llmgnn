The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (16, 27) (16, 15) (0, 4) (0, 18) (27, 16) (27, 29) (27, 26) (18, 0) (18, 14) (18, 28) (22, 26) (22, 7) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 8) (13, 20) (13, 24) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 21) (17, 10) (17, 5) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (20, 13) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 2) (25, 20) (7, 22) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 26) (12, 7) (12, 19) (21, 14) (21, 3) (21, 9) (21, 5) (28, 18) (28, 4) (28, 2) (26, 27) (26, 22) (26, 7) (26, 5) (24, 13) (24, 9) (3, 21) (3, 6) (3, 19) (29, 27) (29, 20) (29, 15) (4, 0) (4, 28) (4, 23) (4, 2) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 21) (5, 26) (5, 1) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 9) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 29) (9, 10) (9, 21) (9, 24) (9, 1) (9, 19) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 19) (2, 20) (2, 28) (2, 4) (2, 23) (23, 14) (23, 4) (23, 2) (19, 12) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their connections (edges):

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: 
(0, 4), (0, 18), (4, 2), (4, 23), (4, 28), 
(1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 11), (5, 8), (5, 17), 
(5, 21), (5, 26), (5, 1), (8, 13), (9, 1), 
(9, 19), (9, 10), (9, 21), (9, 24), (10, 6), 
(10, 9), (10, 17), (13, 8), (13, 20), (13, 24), 
(14, 18), (14, 21), (14, 23), (17, 5), (18, 0), 
(18, 14), (18, 28), (19, 3), (19, 6), (19, 9), 
(19, 12), (20, 2), (20, 13), (20, 25), (20, 29), 
(21, 3), (21, 5), (21, 14), (21, 9), (22, 7), 
(22, 26), (23, 2), (23, 4), (23, 14), (24, 9), 
(24, 13), (26, 5), (26, 7), (26, 22), (26, 27), 
(27, 16), (27, 26), (27, 29), (28, 2), (28, 4), 
(28, 18), (29, 15), (29, 20), (29, 27)

The Degree-Based Ordering method begins by sorting the nodes based on the number of connections (degree):

Nodes by degree: 
{11, 16, 3, 6, 12, 25, 17, 0, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 23, 28, 20, 21, 29, 0, 2, 4, 5, 13, 14, 18, 1, 22, 24, 27}

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph. 

The total number of triangles is: [10]
Unique triangles found: 
<5, 21, 26>, <4, 14, 21>, <4, 14, 23>, <4, 14, 18>, <4, 2, 28>, <4, 2, 23>, <4, 0, 28>, <4, 0, 18>, <0, 18, 28>, <9, 1, 5>
