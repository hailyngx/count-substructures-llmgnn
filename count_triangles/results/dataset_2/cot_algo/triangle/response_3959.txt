The edges are as follows: (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 29) (9, 8) (9, 12) (4, 24) (4, 10) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 10) (0, 27) (0, 17) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 26) (27, 8) (22, 14) (22, 20) (22, 29) (23, 25) (23, 1) (28, 6) (28, 16) (28, 2) (29, 9) (29, 22) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 13) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 21) (19, 3) (26, 27) (26, 19) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 10) (20, 22) (20, 12) (20, 21) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 16) (21, 19) (21, 20) (21, 13) (21, 2) (1, 23) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 8) (8, 9) (8, 27) (8, 1) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 14) (17, 4) (17, 0) (17, 24) (15, 5) (15, 12) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 1) (3, 19) (14, 22) (14, 8) (14, 13) (12, 9) (12, 20) (12, 15) (24, 4) (24, 27) (24, 17) (24, 25) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 25) (25, 23) (25, 24) (25, 18) (2, 28) (2, 21) (2, 13) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows with the provided nodes and edges:

Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 29) (9, 8) (9, 12) (4, 24) (4, 10) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 10) (0, 27) (0, 17) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 26) (27, 8) (22, 14) (22, 20) (22, 29) (23, 25) (23, 1) (28, 6) (28, 16) (28, 2) (29, 9) (29, 22) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 13) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 21) (19, 3) (26, 27) (26, 19) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 10) (20, 22) (20, 12) (20, 21) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 16) (21, 19) (21, 20) (21, 13) (21, 2) (1, 23) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 8) (8, 9) (8, 27) (8, 1) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 21) (...


After sorting the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: 3, 5, 7, 2, 20, 23, 28, 29, 0, 14, 15, 17, 22, 4, 10, 11, 18, 25, 1, 6, 12, 13, 16, 21, 24, 26, 8, 9, 19, 27

Using the degree-based ordering approach to count triangles, we found the total number of triangles to be [28].

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 10, 16>
<1, 8, 27>
<6, 13, 21>
<6, 13, 14>
<6, 16, 28>
<10, 16, 28>
<19, 21, 13>
<19, 26, 27>
<21, 2, 13>
<8, 1, 11>
<0, 17, 24>
<11, 7, 10>
<11, 7, 19>
<12, 9, 29>
<17, 4, 24>
<18, 6, 16>
<18, 6, 25>
<22, 14, 8>
<22, 20, 21>
<23, 1, 6>
<26, 19, 27>
<13, 21, 2>
<14, 8, 13>
<22, 14, 13>
<25, 18, 24>
<25, 18, 6>
