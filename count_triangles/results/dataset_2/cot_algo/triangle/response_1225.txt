Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 17) (1, 0) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 19) (10, 6) (10, 18) (11, 3) (11, 2) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 6) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 0) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 16) (12, 13) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 15) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 16) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 15) (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 13) (14, 3) (14, 15) (4, 9) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 6) (13, 12) (13, 19) (13, 16) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 15) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 17), (5, 16), (5, 7), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 2), (1, 17), (1, 0), (3, 11), (3, 14), (3, 19), (10, 6), (10, 18), 
(11, 2), (2, 18), (7, 0), (12, 16), (12, 13), (0, 15), (8, 19), (19, 13), (16, 13), (14, 15), (15, 6)

Next, let's sort the nodes by their number of connections:

Node 5: 4 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 12: 2 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 17: 3 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 16: 5 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 14: 2 connections
Node 15: 4 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles.
  
Total number of triangles: [16]

Unique triangles: 
<4, 9, 2>, <7, 0, 15>, <9, 2, 18>, <9, 4, 2>, <9, 8, 2>, <9, 8, 19>, <9, 4, 8>, <3, 11, 2>, <3, 11, 14>, 
<3, 11, 19>, <1, 17, 5>, <16, 17, 5>, <16, 12, 13>, <16, 19, 13>, <16, 19, 3>, <6, 10, 18>
