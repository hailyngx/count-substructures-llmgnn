Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8), 
(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), 
(2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), 
(3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 1), 
(4, 8), (4, 0), 
(5, 7), (5, 9), 
(6, 9), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 1), 
(7, 0), (7, 5), 
(8, 9), (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 4), 
(9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 0)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Sorted vertices by degree: 7, 3, 7, 7, 4, 6, 7, 5, 6, 8

Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 6>
3. <0, 2, 4>
4. <0, 4, 8>
5. <0, 5, 9>
6. <0, 8, 9>
7. <1, 2, 4>
8. <1, 3, 6>
9. <2, 4, 8>
10. <3, 4, 6>

Total number of triangles: [10]
