Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
The graph constructed based on the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (1, 3, 7, 2, 9)
- 1: (0)
- 2: (5, 6, 4, 0, 7)
- 3: (6, 0, 4, 8)
- 4: (6, 3, 8, 2)
- 5: (9, 6, 2)
- 6: (5, 9, 3, 2, 8, 4)
- 7: (9, 8, 0, 2)
- 8: (6, 3, 4, 7)
- 9: (5, 6, 7, 0)

Now, let's count the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 7>
2. <0, 3, 8>
3. <0, 7, 9>
4. <2, 4, 7>

Total number of triangles: [4]
