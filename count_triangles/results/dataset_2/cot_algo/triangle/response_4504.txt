Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Sorted vertices by their number of connections:
(7, 16, 28, 0, 3, 16, 20, 24, 28, 4, 28, 6, 16, 19, 4, 7, 7, 8, 5, 4, 6, 2, 3, 25, 6, 27, 19, 19, 23, 19)

Triangles: [14]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 17>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 27>
<0, 17, 2>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 27, 0>
<1, 27, 2>
<2, 4, 21>
<2, 14, 11>
<2, 15, 5>
<2, 15, 24>
<2, 17, 10>
<2, 17, 28>
<2, 25, 23>
