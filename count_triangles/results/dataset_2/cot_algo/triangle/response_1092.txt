Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
The given graph has the following edges:
(5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0)

Next, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most in order to use the Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles.

Here is the sorted list of vertices with their degrees:
(6, 2) (3, 3) (0, 3) (5, 3) (7, 4) (2, 4) (4, 5) (8, 5) (1, 6) (9, 6)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by these edges using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The total number of triangles is: [8]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<2, 1, 7>
<2, 1, 9>
<7, 1, 5>
