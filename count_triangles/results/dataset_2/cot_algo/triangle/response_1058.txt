Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 11) (14, 7) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Count the number of connections for each node:
   - Node 0: 4 connections
   - Node 1: 6 connections
   - Node 2: 4 connections
   - Node 3: 5 connections
   - Node 4: 6 connections
   - Node 5: 3 connections
   - Node 6: 3 connections
   - Node 7: 5 connections
   - Node 8: 3 connections
   - Node 9: 2 connections
   - Node 10: 6 connections
   - Node 11: 4 connections
   - Node 12: 4 connections
   - Node 13: 6 connections
   - Node 14: 1 connection

2. Sort nodes based on their connections:
   - Node 14 < Node 9 < Node 6 < Node 8 < Node 5 < Node 0 < Node 3 < Node 2 < Node 11 < Node 12 < Node 1 < Node 7 < Node 10 < Node 4 < Node 13

3. Analyze the edges that meet the condition:
   - (9, 2) forms a triangle with (9, 12).
   - (4, 7) forms a triangle with (4, 1) and (7, 1).
   - (7, 10) forms a triangle with (7, 3) and (10, 3).
   - (8, 1) forms a triangle with (8, 12).
   - (6, 13) forms a triangle with (6, 4) and (13, 4).
   - (2, 9) forms a triangle with (2, 10).
   - (3, 7) forms a triangle with (3, 2).
   - (11, 2) forms a triangle with (11, 3).
   - (13, 5) forms a triangle with (13, 4).
   - (0, 6) forms a triangle with (0, 3) and (6, 13).
   - (10, 5) forms a triangle with (10, 2) and (5, 13).
   - (1, 5) forms a triangle with (1, 11).

4. Total number of triangles: [11]

Unique triangles found:
   <9, 2, 12>
   <4, 7, 1>
   <7, 10, 3>
   <8, 1, 12>
   <6, 13, 4>
   <2, 9, 10>
   <3, 7, 2>
   <11, 2, 3>
   <13, 5, 4>
   <0, 6, 3>
   <10, 5, 13>
