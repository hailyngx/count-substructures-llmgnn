Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 19) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 10) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 15) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 18) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 7) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 19) (16, 17) (18, 5) (18, 11) (18, 15) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 17) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 18) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 19) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 10) (0, 12) 

Response:
The graph with the provided information arranged in the required format is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 5, 10, 8
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 15, 19
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 13, 1
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 4, 2, 10
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 18, 15
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 11, 7, 17
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 14, 7, 18
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8, 14, 7
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 3, 16, 2, 7
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 13, 12
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 2, 0
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 13, 17, 12
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11, 1, 19
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 17
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 5, 11, 15
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 11, 1, 17
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 9, 5, 18
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 13, 19
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 9, 14, 10
- Node 0 is connected to node 12

After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, we have the following order: 

Nodes: 0, 16, 18, 19, 4, 10, 12, 5, 15, 1, 3, 11, 14, 7, 17, 2, 6, 8, 9, 13

Now, by following the Degree-Based Ordering method and examining each edge to count triangles, we find that the total number of triangles in the graph is [27].

The unique triangles found are as follows:
<4, 12, 0>, <1, 7, 17>, <6, 8, 9>, <2, 13, 10>, <5, 15, 18>, <2, 17, 7>, <11, 14, 19>, <3, 11, 18>, <6, 9, 15>, <13, 14, 19>, <10, 13, 6>, <3, 7, 17>, <5, 6, 15>, <3, 7, 11>, <1, 7, 3>, <1, 7, 11>, <7, 17, 3>, <6, 9, 19>, <10, 13, 19>, <9, 6, 15>, <2, 12, 0>, <11, 18, 15>, <2, 17, 3>, <11, 18, 5>, <2, 12, 4>, <8, 6, 13>, <13, 10, 6>
