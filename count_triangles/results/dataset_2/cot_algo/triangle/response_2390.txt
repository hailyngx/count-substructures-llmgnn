Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 14) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 0) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently in a graph. Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges first:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
- 0: (10), (7), (2)
- 1: (12), (3)
- 2: (13), (11), (4), (0), (3)
- 3: (1), (9), (6), (14), (2)
- 4: (8), (13), (7), (2), (14)
- 5: (8), (7), (14)
- 6: (9), (10), (3), (11)
- 7: (5), (13), (4), (0), (14)
- 8: (5), (4), (14)
- 9: (6), (11), (14), (3), (12)
- 10: (6), (11), (0)
- 11: (9), (6), (2), (12), (10)
- 12: (1), (9), (11)
- 13: (4), (2), (7)
- 14: (5), (9), (3), (8), (4), (7)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:
Degree: 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
0 -> 0
1 -> 1
2 -> 2
3 -> 2
4 -> 4
5 -> 4
6 -> 4
7 -> 7
8 -> 7
9 -> 7
10 -> 10
11 -> 10
12 -> 10
13 -> 13
14 -> 13

Now, we will count the triangles:
Triangles: 23
Unique Triangles: <4, 9, 14>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 14>, <2, 4, 7>, <6, 9, 11>, <0, 2, 13>, <2, 7, 14>, <4, 7, 14>, <7, 8, 14>, <2, 9, 12>, <3, 9, 14>, <9, 11, 12>, <4, 8, 14>, <3, 6, 14>, <4, 13, 14>, <4, 7, 13>, <1, 3, 12>, <10, 11, 6>, <2, 3, 6>, <7, 13, 4>, <2, 3, 14>, <5, 7, 14>, <5, 8, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [23].
