Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 14) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 4) 

Response:
Let's sort the vertices by the number of connections:

0: 2 connections (0, 9), (0, 2)
11: 2 connections (11, 7), (11, 12)
6: 3 connections (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 2)
14: 4 connections (14, 1), (14, 10), (14, 13), (14, 5)
5: 4 connections (5, 1), (5, 8), (5, 13), (5, 14)
12: 4 connections (12, 1), (12, 11), (12, 13), (12, 4)
1: 5 connections (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 14), (1, 5), (1, 12)
3: 5 connections (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 1)
4: 5 connections (4, 9), (4, 3), (4, 12), (4, 2), (4, 9)
7: 5 connections (7, 3), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 8), (7, 3)
13: 6 connections (13, 9), (13, 8), (13, 5), (13, 12), (13, 14)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider edges only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles formed:
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 5, 12>
<1, 5, 14>
<1, 3, 12>
<2, 6, 10>
<2, 8, 13>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 7, 10>
<5, 8, 13>

Total number of triangles: [9]
