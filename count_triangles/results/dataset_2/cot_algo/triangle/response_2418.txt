Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 23) (1, 19) (1, 27) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 1) (6, 28) (6, 0) (28, 6) (28, 16) (28, 24) (28, 18) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 16) (0, 2) (14, 23) (22, 26) (22, 27) (22, 5) (26, 22) (26, 15) (11, 9) (11, 17) (11, 20) (17, 11) (17, 2) (29, 21) (7, 3) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 18) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 8) (16, 28) (16, 0) (10, 9) (10, 5) (21, 29) (21, 18) (2, 0) (2, 17) (2, 9) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 4) (12, 20) (12, 8) (12, 23) (27, 1) (27, 22) (27, 25) (15, 26) (19, 1) (19, 13) (20, 11) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 8) (20, 13) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 25) (13, 19) (13, 20) (13, 9) (13, 24) (8, 25) (8, 12) (8, 20) (23, 1) (23, 14) (23, 12) (5, 22) (5, 10) (5, 4) (18, 28) (18, 7) (18, 21) (18, 24) (24, 28) (24, 13) (24, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, and then relabeling them accordingly. 

The sorted list of vertices with their connections is as follows:
(3: 4), (6: 4), (0: 4), (16: 4), (28: 4), (2: 4), (13: 5), (8: 5), 
(14: 2), (22: 3), (26: 3), (11: 3), (17: 3), (29: 2), (7: 4), 
(25: 4), (12: 4), (27: 4), (15: 2), (19: 2), (20: 5), (9: 4), 
(10: 2), (21: 2), (4: 2), (5: 3), (18: 4), (24: 3)

Using this ordering, we will count the triangles by considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Total number of triangles: [16]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 16>
<0, 6, 28>
<0, 16, 28>
<2, 9, 13>
<7, 18, 21>
<7, 18, 24>
<8, 12, 20>

<9, 11, 17>
<9, 11, 20>
<9, 13, 25>
<10, 5, 22>
<13, 20, 25>
