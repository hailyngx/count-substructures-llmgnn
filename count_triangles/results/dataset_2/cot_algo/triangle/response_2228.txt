Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 26) (22, 23) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 14) (23, 10) (23, 0) (23, 12) (8, 4) (8, 22) (8, 24) (6, 4) (6, 28) (6, 26) (28, 6) (28, 16) (17, 29) (17, 13) (17, 25) (17, 0) (17, 21) (29, 17) (29, 11) (26, 7) (26, 6) (26, 10) (26, 25) (16, 28) (16, 2) (16, 5) (13, 17) (25, 17) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 5) (27, 25) (27, 9) (11, 29) (11, 5) (14, 23) (10, 23) (10, 26) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 20) (0, 23) (0, 17) (0, 10) (0, 2) (24, 22) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 15) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 24) (15, 18) (2, 16) (2, 0) (2, 24) (2, 9) (2, 20) (9, 27) (9, 2) (9, 21) (9, 20) (12, 23) (21, 17) (21, 9) (1, 10) (1, 18) (20, 22) (20, 10) (20, 2) (20, 9) (5, 16) (5, 25) (5, 11) (18, 7) (18, 15) (18, 1) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 6), (4, 15), (7, 15), (7, 18), (7, 26), (22, 23), (22, 20), (22, 24), (22, 8), (23, 14), (23, 10), (23, 0), (23, 12), (8, 24), (6, 28), (6, 26), (28, 16), (17, 29), (17, 13), (17, 25), (17, 0), (17, 21), (29, 11), (26, 25), (16, 2), (16, 5), (13, 25), (25, 27), (27, 9), (11, 5), (14, 10), (14, 23), (0, 1), (24, 15), (2, 24), (2, 9), (21, 9), (1, 18), (20, 2), (5, 11)

Next, let's perform the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles. 

Based on their degrees, the nodes can be reordered as follows:
(1) 11, 12, 1, 20, 21, 29, 5, 6, 13, 14
(2) 0, 2, 22
(3) 8, 10, 16, 23
(4) 15, 17, 24, 25, 26
(5) 4, 7, 9, 18, 27, 28

Now, we will count the triangles based on the ordered nodes and the given edges. 

The total number of triangles is [8].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 24>
<10, 23, 26>
<10, 0, 23>
<10, 15, 24>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 16, 24>
<2, 9, 20>
<15, 24, 18>
