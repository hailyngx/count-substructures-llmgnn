Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 5) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 12) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 1) (7, 12) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 0) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 4) (15, 17) (15, 10) (15, 11) (8, 9) (8, 0) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 13) (13, 17) (13, 9) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 6) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 5) (19, 2) (5, 3) (5, 18) (5, 11) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 16) (16, 2) (16, 6) (16, 4) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 16) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: 
- 0: {12, 8, 11, 6}
- 1: {14, 10, 7}
- 2: {17, 18, 19, 16}
- 3: {5}
- 4: {10, 6, 16}
- 5: {3, 18, 11}
- 6: {0, 4, 16}
- 7: {14, 17, 1, 12}
- 8: {9, 0}
- 9: {14, 8, 13}
- 10: {1, 15, 4}
- 11: {15, 0, 5}
- 12: {18, 7, 0}
- 13: {17, 9}
- 14: {17, 1, 7, 9}
- 15: {17, 10, 11}
- 16: {2, 18, 6, 4}
- 17: {14, 13, 2, 15, 7}
- 18: {2, 5, 12, 16}
- 19: {2}

Next, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in this graph.
