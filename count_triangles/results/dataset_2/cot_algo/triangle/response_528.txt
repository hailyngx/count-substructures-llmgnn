Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 10) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 0) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 2) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first.  

The graph has the following nodes with their connections:
- Node 0: 8, 4, 5, 14
- Node 1: 3, 12
- Node 2: 8, 5, 10
- Node 3: 1, 11, 10, 13, 5
- Node 4: 6, 7, 0, 5, 14
- Node 5: 3, 4, 2, 12, 0
- Node 6: 9, 12, 8, 4
- Node 7: 4, 11, 10, 14
- Node 8: 6, 13, 2, 0
- Node 9: 6, 11, 14, 12
- Node 10: 3, 13, 7, 2
- Node 11: 9, 3, 7, 12
- Node 12: 6, 9, 1, 5, 11
- Node 13: 3, 8, 10
- Node 14: 9, 4, 7, 0

Now, let's proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort nodes by their degree in ascending order:
Nodes with degree 2: 1, 2
Nodes with degree 3: 11, 13
Nodes with degree 4: 0, 7, 10
Nodes with degree 5: 5
Nodes with degree 6: 8
Nodes with degree 7: 4
Nodes with degree 8: 12, 6
Nodes with degree 9: 14, 9
Nodes with degree 10: 3

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
1 -> 0, 2 -> 1, 11 -> 2, 13 -> 3, 0 -> 4, 7 -> 5, 10 -> 6, 5 -> 7, 8 -> 8, 4 -> 9, 6 -> 10, 12 -> 11, 9 -> 12, 14 -> 13, 3 -> 14

3. Check for triangles by considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- <0, 2, 1>
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 6, 1>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 7, 4>
- <0, 5, 4>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <0, 6, 4>
- <0, 7, 14>
- <0, 6, 12>
- <0, 7, 12>
- <0, 5, 12>
- <0, 14, 9>
- <0, 14, 4>
- <1, 11, 12>
- <1, 13, 3>
- <1, 13, 8>
- <11, 13, 3>
- <5, 8, 13>
- <5, 2, 10>
- <5, 4, 7>
- <5, 2, 10>
- <5, 12, 11>
- <6, 9, 12>
- <6, 8, 13>
- <6, 14, 9>
- <4, 7, 14>
- <4, 14, 9>
- <7, 14, 9>
- <10, 3, 13>
- <10, 2, 8>
