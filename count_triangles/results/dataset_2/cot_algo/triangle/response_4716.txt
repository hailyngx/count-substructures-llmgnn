Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 27) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 23) (3, 29) (17, 29) (17, 18) (17, 21) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 25) (29, 22) (0, 3) (0, 25) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 9) (14, 21) (11, 24) (11, 18) (28, 27) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 19) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 21) (23, 3) (23, 25) (26, 10) (26, 8) (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 6) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 22) (24, 11) (24, 9) (24, 20) (8, 26) (8, 16) (8, 25) (8, 27) (25, 29) (25, 0) (25, 23) (25, 8) (22, 29) (22, 10) (22, 20) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 16) (9, 1) (9, 14) (9, 24) (19, 12) (19, 20) (19, 6) (27, 1) (27, 28) (27, 8) (6, 0) (6, 16) (6, 19) (6, 15) (15, 6) (15, 13) (20, 24) (20, 22) (20, 19) (20, 5) (13, 1) (13, 15) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 20) (21, 17) (21, 14) (21, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is used to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling of the nodes is as follows:
```
Node 0 : Degree 4
Node 1 : Degree 4
Node 2 : Degree 3
Node 3 : Degree 4
Node 4 : Degree 3
Node 5 : Degree 3
Node 6 : Degree 4
Node 7 : Degree 2
Node 8 : Degree 4
Node 9 : Degree 4
Node 10 : Degree 3
Node 11 : Degree 3
Node 12 : Degree 4
Node 13 : Degree 2
Node 14 : Degree 2
Node 15 : Degree 2
Node 16 : Degree 4
Node 17 : Degree 3
Node 18 : Degree 4
Node 19 : Degree 3
Node 20 : Degree 4
Node 21 : Degree 3
Node 22 : Degree 3
Node 23 : Degree 2
Node 24 : Degree 3
Node 25 : Degree 4
Node 26 : Degree 3
Node 27 : Degree 3
Node 28 : Degree 1
Node 29 : Degree 4
```

Calculating the triangles:
- Triangle <4, 12, 16> with shared connections at nodes 4, 12, and 16.
- Triangle <4, 3, 12> with shared connections at nodes 4, 3, and 12.
- Triangle <7, 1, 9> with shared connections at nodes 7, 1, and 9.
- Triangle <0, 3, 25> with shared connections at nodes 0, 3, and 25.
- Triangle <0, 6, 16> with shared connections at nodes 0, 6, and 16.
- Triangle <0, 5, 20> with shared connections at nodes 0, 5, and 20.
- Triangle <9, 14, 21> with shared connections at nodes 9, 14, and 21.
- Triangle <11, 18, 24> with shared connections at nodes 11, 18, and 24.
- Triangle <10, 26, 22> with shared connections at nodes 10, 26, and 22.
- Triangle <17, 21, 14> with shared connections at nodes 17, 21, and 14.
- Triangle <19, 20, 24> with shared connections at nodes 19, 20, and 24.
- Triangle <27, 8, 25> with shared connections at nodes 27, 8, and 25.
- Triangle <6, 16, 19> with shared connections at nodes 6, 16, and 19.
