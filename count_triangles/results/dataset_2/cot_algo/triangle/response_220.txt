Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 14) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and labeling them accordingly. In this case, the sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is:

Node 11 -> Node 13 -> Node 2 -> Node 4 -> Node 7 -> Node 5 -> Node 3 -> Node 1 -> Node 10 -> Node 0 -> Node 14 -> Node 6 -> Node 8 -> Node 12 -> Node 9

Now, applying the method by considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. (6, 9) forms triangle with 0: <6, 9, 0>
