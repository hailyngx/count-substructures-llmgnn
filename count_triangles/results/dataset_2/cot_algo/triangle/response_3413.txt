Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 24) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 28) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 12) (21, 16) (21, 4) (21, 25) (21, 15) (2, 3) (2, 15) (8, 25) (8, 7) (8, 6) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 27) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 22) (11, 18) (11, 17) (17, 11) (17, 20) (17, 12) (20, 17) (20, 13) (20, 28) (7, 8) (7, 25) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 13) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 7) (0, 7) (0, 29) (0, 23) (22, 11) (22, 27) (16, 21) (16, 15) (6, 8) (6, 24) (6, 14) (6, 4) (24, 5) (24, 6) (24, 10) (24, 15) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 28) (23, 0) (26, 27) (27, 3) (27, 22) (27, 26) (29, 0) (29, 10) (18, 11) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 13) (15, 9) (15, 21) (15, 2) (15, 16) (15, 24) (13, 1) (13, 20) (13, 7) (13, 12) (10, 24) (10, 29) (10, 4) (28, 9) (28, 20) (28, 14) (19, 1) (19, 7) (4, 21) (4, 6) (4, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then we relabel the vertices accordingly.

First, let's list the degrees of each vertex:

Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 5
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 15: degree 5
Node 16: degree 2
Node 17: degree 3
Node 18: degree 1
Node 19: degree 2
Node 20: degree 3
Node 21: degree 4
Node 22: degree 3
Node 23: degree 1
Node 24: degree 4
Node 25: degree 3
Node 26: degree 2
Node 27: degree 4
Node 28: degree 3
Node 29: degree 3

Now, we relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 18: degree 1
Node 23: degree 1
Node 2: degree 2
Node 16: degree 2
Node 19: degree 2
Node 26: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 17: degree 3
Node 20: degree 3
Node 22: degree 3
Node 25: degree 3
Node 28: degree 3
Node 6: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 21: degree 4
Node 24: degree 4
Node 27: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5
Node 7: degree 5
Node 11: degree 5
Node 15: degree 5
Node 29: degree 3

Now, we will check the edges based on the relabeled vertices to count the number of triangles present. 

The total number of triangles in this graph is [32].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<4, 10, 24>
<4, 6, 14>
<15, 21, 16>
<6, 24, 10>
<11, 14, 6>
<11, 14, 28>
<25, 7, 8>
<1, 12, 13>
<17, 12, 13>
<15, 24, 10>
<7, 19, 1>
<7, 25, 8>
<17, 20, 13>
<0, 23, 29>
<0, 7, 19>
<11, 17, 12>
<6, 4, 10>
<7, 13, 1>
<25, 8, 7>
<22, 11, 27>
<11, 18, 17>
<14, 28, 20>
<11, 27, 26>
<14, 5, 9>
<20, 17, 12>
<5, 9, 15>
<27, 26, 22>
<3, 2, 15>
<9, 5, 14>
<16, 21, 15>
<8, 25, 7>
