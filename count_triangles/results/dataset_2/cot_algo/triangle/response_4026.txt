Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1)

Next, we will determine the degree of each node and sort them accordingly for Degree-Based Ordering:

Node Degrees:
0: 4
1: 3
2: 3
3: 3
4: 6
5: 4
6: 6
7: 6
8: 3
9: 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we relabel the nodes as follows:
1 -> 0, 2 -> 1, 3 -> 2, 8 -> 3, 5 -> 4, 9 -> 5, 7 -> 6, 4 -> 7, 6 -> 8, 0 -> 9

Edges with lower labeled node having fewer connections:
(1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 6)

Now, we count the number of triangles formed by the shared connections between each pair of edges:

Triangles:
<1, 0, 6>
<1, 5, 4>
<1, 4, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
