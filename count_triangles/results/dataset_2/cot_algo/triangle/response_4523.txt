Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 11) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (12, 4) (12, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) 
(9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) 
(1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) 
(3, 7) (3, 5) 
(4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) 
(7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) 
(10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 13) 
(11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 2) 
(8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) 
(5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 11) 
(2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) 
(12, 4) (12, 7) 
(0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 13) 
(14, 6) (14, 13) 
(13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on the number of connections:

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes with connections in increasing order:
3: 1
2: 2, 12
5: 1, 7, 10
4: 8, 14
6: 0, 6, 9
7: 3, 5, 11
1: 4, 13

Now, we will count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles found: <0, 11, 13>, <6, 9, 13>, <5, 7, 11>, <4, 8, 11>, <5, 6, 11>, <1, 2, 11>, <4, 7, 12>
