Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and the given 40 edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 7, 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 8.

Next, we'll sort the nodes by their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order to apply the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Degree 0: Nodes {3, 7}
Degree 1: Nodes {5}
Degree 3: Node {6}
Degree 4: Nodes {0, 1}
Degree 5: Nodes {8}
Degree 6: Nodes {4}
Degree 7: Node {2}
Degree 8: Node {9}

Now, we'll count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found:

Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles:
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
