Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 10) (6, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (18, 10) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 7) (8, 11) (8, 2) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 19) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 12) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 7) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 13) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 14) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 19) (13, 16) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 18) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 17) (0, 19) (17, 2) (17, 0) (14, 7) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Let's proceed with this method.

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
   - Node 16: 5 connections
   - Node 1: 3 connections
   - Nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8: 2 connections
   - Nodes 0, 3, 7, 10, 12, 15, and 19: 4 connections
   - Nodes 9, 13, and 17: 3 connections
   - Node 11: 5 connections
   - Node 14: 1 connection
   - Node 18: 2 connections

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   - Node 14 (1 connection) -> Node 0
   - Nodes 2, 4, and 18 (2 connections) -> Nodes 1, 2, and 3
   - Nodes 1, 13, 17, and 9 (3 connections) -> Nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7
   - Nodes 0, 3, 7, 10, 12, 15, and 19 (4 connections) -> Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
   - Nodes 16 and 11 (5 connections) -> Nodes 15 and 16
   - Node 5 (5 connections) -> Node 17
   - Node 6 (2 connections) -> Node 18
   - Node 8 (2 connections) -> Node 19

3. Go through the edges and count the triangles:
   - Triangles found: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 10>, <1, 2, 12>, <1, 2, 17>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 17>, <1, 8, 9>, <1, 10, 12>, <1, 10, 17>, <1, 12, 17>, <1, 13, 17>, <1, 13, 19>, <2, 4, 18>, <2, 8, 11>, <2, 10, 18>, <2, 12, 13>, <2, 12, 17>, <2, 12, 18>, <4, 5, 12>, <4, 5, 15>, <4, 8, 11>, <4, 10, 18>, <5, 10, 12>, <5, 10, 18>, <7, 9, 15>, <10, 12, 15>, <10, 12, 18>, <10, 17, 19>, <11, 15, 16>, <12, 13, 16>
  
4. Count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles:
   - Total number of triangles: [31]
   - Unique triangles: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 10>, <1, 2, 12>, <1, 2, 17>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 17>, <1, 8, 9>, <1, 10, 12>, <1, 10, 17>, <1, 12, 17>, <1, 13, 17>, <1, 13, 19>, <2, 4, 18>, <2, 8, 11>, <2, 10, 18>, <2, 12, 13>, <2, 12, 17>, <2, 12, 18>, <4, 5, 12>, <4, 5, 15>, <4, 8, 11>, <4, 10, 18>, <5, 10, 12>, <5, 10, 18>, <7, 9, 15>, <10, 12, 15>, <10, 12, 18>, <10, 17, 19>, <11, 15, 16>, <12, 13, 16>
