Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 3) (15, 13) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 14) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 25) (6, 19) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 13) (9, 12) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 17) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 28) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 17) (1, 10) (1, 19) (21, 2) (21, 29) (8, 23) (8, 19) (3, 15) (3, 13) (3, 18) (5, 6) (5, 25) (5, 10) (26, 28) (26, 16) (28, 22) (28, 26) (28, 4) (28, 10) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 29) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 8) (24, 27) (24, 16) (16, 0) (16, 26) (16, 24) (4, 28) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 14) (11, 7) (29, 21) (29, 7) (29, 14) (14, 27) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 29) (14, 25) (17, 0) (17, 23) (17, 4) (17, 2) (25, 6) (25, 5) (25, 14) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 4) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 28) (10, 2) (18, 3) (20, 6) (20, 9) (2, 21) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 10) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree from least to most are as follows:
```
Node 18 has degree 1
Node 20 has degree 2
Node 1 has degree 2
Node 16 has degree 3
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 11 has degree 3
Node 12 has degree 3
Node 18 has degree 3
Node 21 has degree 3
Node 26 has degree 3
Node 29 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 10 has degree 4
Node 24 has degree 4
Node 22 has degree 4
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 19 has degree 4
Node 0 has degree 4
Node 27 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 25 has degree 4
Node 6 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 5
Node 14 has degree 5
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 5
Node 23 has degree 4
Node 17 has degree 5
Node 13 has degree 5
Node 15 has degree 2
```

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. We iterate through each edge.
2. For each edge, we only consider it if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
3. We then count the number of triangles using shared connections between the two vertices of the edge.

After following the above steps, we find that there are a total of 15 triangles in the graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 16, 26>
<0, 17, 4>
<0, 19, 8>
<0, 27, 14>
<1, 10, 21>
<2, 17, 4>
<2, 17, 10>
<2, 4, 28>
<3, 13, 4>
<4, 13, 14>
<4, 17, 28>
<4, 17, 2>
<6, 9, 20>
<6, 19, 8>
<14, 22, 29>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
