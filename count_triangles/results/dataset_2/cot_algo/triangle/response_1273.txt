Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 6) (8, 14) (8, 11) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 8) (14, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 9: degree 1
Node 10: degree 2
Node 14: degree 2
Node 3: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 7: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 11: degree 5
Node 12: degree 6
Node 0: degree 6
Node 2: degree 7
Node 13: degree 6

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will examine the edges in the order specified. Only edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections than the other node will be considered for triangle calculations.

Calculating the triangles:
1. Edge (5, 12) forms triangles with nodes 4 and 7: <5, 4, 7>.
2. Edge (5, 1) forms triangles with nodes 11 and 7: <5, 1, 11>.
3. Edge (5, 11) forms triangles with nodes 1 and 7: <5, 11, 1>.
4. Edge (5, 4) forms a triangle with node 7: <5, 4, 7>.
5. Edge (5, 7) forms no triangles.
6. Edge (9, 13) forms no triangles.
7. Edge (8, 14) forms no triangles.
8. Edge (4, 12) forms no triangles.
9. Edge (4, 2) forms no triangles.
10. Edge (4, 6) forms no triangles.
11. Edge (8, 11) forms no triangles.
12. Edge (7, 0) forms a triangle with nodes 12 and 3: <7, 0, 12>.
13. Edge (7, 3) forms no triangles.
14. Edge (12, 0) forms a triangle with nodes 7 and 3: <12, 0, 7>.
15. Edge (12, 3) forms a triangle with node 7: <12, 3, 7>.
16. Edge (3, 2) forms a triangle with nodes 12 and 0: <3, 2, 12>.
17. Edge (11, 8) forms no triangles.
18. Edge (11, 1) forms no triangles.
19. Edge (11, 6) forms no triangles.
20. Edge (0, 10) forms a triangle with nodes 7 and 13: <0, 10, 13>.
21. Edge (0, 14) forms no triangles.
22. Edge (6, 11) forms no triangles.
23. Edge (13, 9) forms no triangles.
24. Edge (13, 10) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 6: <13, 10, 0>.
25. Edge (13, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 6: <13, 1, 0>.
26. Edge (13, 6) forms no triangles.

Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles found: <5, 4, 7>, <5, 1, 11>, <5, 11, 1>, <7, 0, 12>, <12, 0, 7>, <12, 3, 7>, <3, 2, 12>, <0, 10, 13>.
