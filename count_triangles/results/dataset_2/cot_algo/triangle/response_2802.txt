Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 11) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling the vertices accordingly. 

After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the relabeled vertices are as follows: 
Node 5 (degree 1) -> Node 9 (degree 2) -> Node 8 (degree 2) -> Node 12 (degree 2) -> Node 0 (degree 4) -> Node 5 (degree 1) -> Node 6 (degree 4) -> Node 7 (degree 4) -> Node 10 (degree 4) -> Node 14 (degree 4) -> Node 2 (degree 5) -> Node 13 (degree 6) -> Node 1 (degree 6) -> Node 3 (degree 6) -> Node 4 (degree 7)

Now, we will list the triangles formed by the given edges using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
