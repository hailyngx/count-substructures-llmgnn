Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) 

Response:
Let's sort the vertices by their degree in ascending order:  
Node 6 has 1 connection  
Nodes 0, 6, and 7 have 2 connections  
Nodes 1 and 8 have 3 connections  
Nodes 3 and 4 have 5 connections  
Nodes 2 and 9 have 6 connections  
Now, we will proceed with the degree-based ordering method:  
1. Edge (0, 5): Proceeding because node 0 has fewer connections than node 5.  
2. Edge (0, 2): Proceeding because node 0 has fewer connections than node 2. Shared connection with node 5 creates triangle <0, 5, 2>.  
3. Edge (2, 5): Not considering to avoid duplicate counting.  
4. Edge (2, 9): Proceeding because node 2 has fewer connections than node 9. Shared connection with node 5 creates triangle <2, 5, 9>.  
5. Edge (2, 1): Not considering to avoid duplicate counting.  
6. Edge (2, 4): Proceeding because node 2 has fewer connections than node 4. Shared connections with nodes 5 and 9 create triangles <2, 5, 4> and <2, 9, 4>.  
7. Edge (6, 4): Proceeding because node 6 has fewer connections than node 4. No shared connections to form a triangle.  
8. Edge (7, 3): Proceeding because node 7 has fewer connections than node 3. No shared connections to form a triangle.  
9. Edge (7, 1): Proceeding because node 7 has fewer connections than node 1. Shared connection with node 8 creates triangle <7, 1, 8>.  
10. Edge (7, 8): Not considering to avoid duplicate counting.  
11. Edge (1, 9): Proceeding because node 1 has fewer connections than node 9. No shared connections to form a triangle.  
12. Edge (1, 2): Not considering to avoid duplicate counting.  
13. Edge (1, 7): Not considering to avoid duplicate counting.  
14. Edge (1, 8): Not considering to avoid duplicate counting.  
15. Edge (3, 5): Proceeding because node 3 has fewer connections than node 5. Shared connections with nodes 9 and 4 create triangles <3, 5, 9> and <3, 5, 4>.  
16. Edge (3, 9): Not considering to avoid duplicate counting.  
17. Edge (3, 7): Not considering to avoid duplicate counting.  
18. Edge (3, 4): Not considering to avoid duplicate counting.  
19. Edge (3, 8): Not considering to avoid duplicate counting.  
20. Edge (8, 5): Proceeding because node 8 has fewer connections than node 5. Shared connection with node 7 creates triangle <8, 5, 7>.  
21. Edge (8, 7): Not considering to avoid duplicate counting.  
22. Edge (8, 1): Not considering to avoid duplicate counting.  
23. Edge (8, 3): Not considering to avoid duplicate counting.  
Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6] and the unique triangles found are <0, 5, 2>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 9, 4>, <7, 1, 8>, and <8, 5, 7>.
