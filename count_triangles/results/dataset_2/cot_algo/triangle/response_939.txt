Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 13) (1, 2) (1, 19) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 7) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 17) (7, 0) (15, 5) (15, 6) (8, 17) (8, 19) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 16) (16, 0) (16, 19) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 18) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 18) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 18) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (18, 12) (18, 14) (18, 3) (10, 12) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
(5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 14) 
(9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) 
(6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 13) 
(1, 2) (1, 19) 
(17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 7) 
(0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
(15, 5) (15, 6) 
(8, 17) (8, 19) 
(19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 16) 
(16, 0) (16, 19) 
(2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) 
(12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 18) 
(11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) 
(14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 18) 
(3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 18) 
(4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 11) 
(13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) 
(18, 12) (18, 14) (18, 3) 
(10, 12)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

1. Sort the nodes by their degrees in ascending order:
{10, 1, 17, 8, 16, 18, 5, 7, 15, 2, 4, 3, 0, 14, 11, 12, 6, 19, 9, 13}

2. Relabel the nodes accordingly:
10 -> 0, 1 -> 1, 17 -> 2, 8 -> 3, 16 -> 4, 18 -> 5, 5 -> 6, 7 -> 7, 15 -> 8, 2 -> 9, 4 -> 10, 3 -> 11, 0 -> 12, 14 -> 13, 11 -> 14, 12 -> 15, 6 -> 16, 19 -> 17, 9 -> 18, 13 -> 19

3. Go through each edge and count triangles:

Total number of triangles: [24]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 16>
<0, 12, 16>
<0, 12, 3>
<3, 7, 17>
<3, 7, 16>
<3, 16, 18>
<7, 17, 19>
<3, 0, 12>
<7, 17, 8>
<7, 16, 19>
<0, 12, 2>
<12, 16, 19>
<12, 16, 2>
<12, 19, 2>
<12, 16, 0>
<12, 16, 3>
<0, 16, 19>
<0, 16, 2>
<16, 3, 18>
<16, 19, 2>
<16, 19, 8>
<16, 2, 4>
<16, 2, 10>
