Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 6) (16, 10) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 2) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 8) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 18) (7, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 15) (5, 13) (5, 18) (13, 5) (13, 19) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 2) (0, 16) (0, 8) (9, 7) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 6) (2, 17) (2, 15) (2, 4) (19, 3) (19, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (6, 16) (6, 18) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 0) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. 

The sorted vertices are: 
Vertex 16: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 15: 3 connections
Vertex 18: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 13: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 11: 4 connections
Vertex 14: 3 connections
Vertex 17: 4 connections
Vertex 10: 3 connections
Vertex 12: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 19: 2 connections

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will check for shared connections between the vertices to count the number of triangles. 

There are 15 triangles in total:
