Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the provided information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: 1, 2, 4, 9
- 1: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7
- 2: 0, 1, 5, 7
- 3: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- 4: 0, 1, 6
- 5: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- 6: 1, 3, 4, 5
- 7: 1, 2, 3, 5
- 8: 3, 9
- 9: 0, 3, 5, 8

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

Nodes in increasing order of degrees: 8, 4, 0, 7, 1, 2, 6, 9, 5, 3

With this labeling, we can count the number of triangles:

Number of triangles: [12]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 3>
