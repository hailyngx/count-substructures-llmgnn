Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the vertices is as follows:
(1) 0 - degree 3
(2) 1 - degree 2
(3) 3 - degree 2
(4) 2 - degree 4
(5) 8 - degree 5
(6) 5 - degree 5
(7) 4 - degree 5
(8) 7 - degree 5
(9) 9 - degree 5
(10) 6 - degree 5

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will go through each edge to count the triangles:

Triangles:
[17]
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
