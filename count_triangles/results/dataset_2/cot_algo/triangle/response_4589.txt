Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 9) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 2) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 9) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 4) (14, 8) (14, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 10) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: [(1, 3), (1, 11), (1, 2), (1, 0), (3, 10), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 4), (7, 12), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 5), (12, 0), (12, 9), (5, 11), (5, 10), (2, 13), (11, 9), (11, 4), (14, 9), (8, 14), (6, 10), (6, 0), (9, 11), (10, 4)]

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Degree of each node:
0: 3, 1: 4, 2: 3, 3: 5, 4: 4, 5: 4, 6: 4, 7: 4, 8: 5, 9: 5, 10: 4, 11: 4, 12: 3, 13: 1, 14: 2

Nodes sorted by degree (ascending order):
[13, 14, 12, 0, 2, 11, 1, 5, 7, 4, 6, 10, 8, 9, 3]

Triangles found:
[<1, 3, 4>, <5, 7, 8>]

Total number of triangles: [2]
