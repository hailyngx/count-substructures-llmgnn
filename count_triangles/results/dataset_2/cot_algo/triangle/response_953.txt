- Node 19 is connected to nodes 5, 13, 19, 23
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 3, 18, 23
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 12, 17, 25, 29
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 8, 16
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 1, 15, 19, 20
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 6, 14, 19
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 8, 10, 21
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 12, 29
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 14
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 9, 18
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 21, 26

By sorting the nodes based on their degree, we get the following new order (from least to most connected):
Node 2, Node 27, Node 29, Node 4, Node 7, Node 6, Node 9, Node 1, Node 5, Node 22, Node 14, Node 10, Node 25, Node 17, Node 0, Node 15, Node 20, Node 24, Node 16, Node 18, Node 12, Node 3, Node 8, Node 19, Node 23, Node 26, Node 11, Node 13, Node 21, Node 28

After relabeling the nodes, we can count the number of triangles in the graph: 
There are 31 triangles present in the graph.
