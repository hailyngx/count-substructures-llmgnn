Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 24) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 28) (17, 19) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 22) (11, 9) (11, 12) (12, 11) (12, 27) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 16) (27, 23) (2, 9) (2, 25) (18, 5) (18, 20) (18, 8) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 28) (6, 1) (28, 17) (28, 6) (28, 1) (28, 13) (28, 5) (13, 28) (26, 15) (26, 20) (26, 29) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 23) (21, 3) (21, 16) (21, 25) (21, 29) (8, 18) (8, 9) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 8) (16, 14) (16, 27) (16, 21) (24, 14) (24, 23) (24, 20) (19, 17) (19, 22) (19, 15) (22, 11) (22, 19) (22, 4) (22, 15) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 29) (1, 4) (4, 22) (4, 1) (4, 15) (29, 26) (29, 21) (29, 1) (29, 25) (15, 26) (15, 19) (15, 22) (15, 4) (15, 23) (20, 18) (20, 26) (20, 24) (23, 27) (23, 3) (23, 24) (23, 15) (5, 18) (5, 28) (25, 2) (25, 21) (25, 29) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:  
Node 7: degree 1  
Node 10: degree 1  
Node 13: degree 1  
Node 26: degree 1  
Node 5: degree 2  
Node 16: degree 3  
Node 19: degree 3  
Node 20: degree 3  
Node 22: degree 4  
Node 2: degree 4  
Node 8: degree 4  
Node 4: degree 4  
Node 15: degree 5  
Node 12: degree 5  
Node 3: degree 5  
Node 24: degree 5  
Node 18: degree 5  
Node 27: degree 6  
Node 11: degree 6  
Node 21: degree 6  
Node 29: degree 6  
Node 9: degree 6  
Node 25: degree 6  
Node 6: degree 7  
Node 1: degree 7  
Node 28: degree 7  
Node 14: degree 7  

Based on the above ordering, we can count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 6]

<1, 6, 28>  
<1, 6, 29>  
<1, 28, 5>  
<1, 28, 4>  
<1, 28, 14>  
<6, 28, 4>
