Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 8) (21, 7) (21, 23) (21, 11) (21, 2) (21, 14) (12, 27) (12, 6) (27, 12) (27, 17) (27, 1) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 13) (2, 21) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 25) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 22) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 29) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 3) (11, 21) (28, 13) (28, 25) (29, 4) (29, 1) (29, 10) (10, 29) (10, 15) (10, 16) (15, 10) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 22) (16, 0) (16, 10) (16, 17) (5, 1) (5, 22) (5, 24) (26, 0) (26, 23) (26, 3) (22, 8) (22, 19) (22, 5) (23, 21) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 14) (1, 27) (1, 29) (1, 5) (24, 5) (24, 3) (24, 13) (9, 0) (9, 25) (25, 2) (25, 28) (25, 9) (3, 18) (3, 26) (3, 24) (17, 27) (17, 16) (17, 23) (13, 20) (13, 28) (13, 24) (13, 14) (6, 12) (6, 2) (14, 21) (14, 4) (14, 23) (14, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree of connections. The nodes are then relabeled accordingly. Here is the list of nodes sorted by their degrees:

Nodes:  
1. 5 (Degree: 3)  
2. 9 (Degree: 3)  
3. 10 (Degree: 3)  
4. 12 (Degree: 3)  
5. 15 (Degree: 3)  
6. 16 (Degree: 3)  
7. 18 (Degree: 3)  
8. 24 (Degree: 3)  
9. 25 (Degree: 3)  
10. 28 (Degree: 3)  
11. 11 (Degree: 4)  
12. 19 (Degree: 4)  
13. 20 (Degree: 4)  
14. 22 (Degree: 4)  
15. 29 (Degree: 4)  
16. 26 (Degree: 4)  
17. 27 (Degree: 4)  
18. 2 (Degree: 5)  
19. 3 (Degree: 5)  
20. 14 (Degree: 5)  
21. 4 (Degree: 6)  
22. 6 (Degree: 6)  
23. 13 (Degree: 6)  
24. 21 (Degree: 6)  
25. 7 (Degree: 7)  
26. 8 (Degree: 7)  
27. 17 (Degree: 7)  
28. 0 (Degree: 8)  
29. 1 (Degree: 8)  

Next, we will check each edge to count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. After counting the triangles, we will provide the total count in brackets and list the unique triangles found in angle brackets.

Please wait for the final count and unique triangles.
