Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) and then checking for triangles. Let's start by relabelling the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 4 has degree 2.
Node 1 has degree 3.
Node 8 has degree 3.
Node 3 has degree 4.
Node 0 has degree 4.
Node 5 has degree 5.
Node 7 has degree 6.
Node 6 has degree 4.
Node 2 has degree 6.
Node 9 has degree 7.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering, we proceed to count the triangles formed by the edges:

1. Edge (0, 4): No triangle formed.
2. Edge (0, 9): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (0, 2): Triangle <0, 2, 9>.
4. Edge (1, 5): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (1, 7): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (1, 8): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (1, 2): Triangle <1, 2, 9>.
8. Edge (2, 5): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (2, 8): Triangle <0, 2, 8>.
10. Edge (2, 3): No triangle formed.
11. Edge (2, 9): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (3, 7): No triangle formed.
13. Edge (3, 9): No triangle formed.
14. Edge (3, 2): Triangle <1, 2, 3>.
15. Edge (4, 0): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (4, 7): No triangle formed.
17. Edge (5, 1): No triangle formed.
18. Edge (5, 6): No triangle formed.
19. Edge (5, 7): No triangle formed.
20. Edge (5, 8): No triangle formed.
21. Edge (5, 2): Triangle <0, 2, 5>.
22. Edge (6, 7): No triangle formed.
23. Edge (6, 5): No triangle formed.
24. Edge (6, 9): Triangle <6, 9, 2>.
25. Edge (7, 4): No triangle formed.
26. Edge (7, 1): No triangle formed.
27. Edge (7, 3): No triangle formed.
28. Edge (8, 1): No triangle formed.
29. Edge (8, 5): No triangle formed.
30. Edge (8, 9): No triangle formed.
31. Edge (8, 2): Triangle <0, 2, 8>.
32. Edge (9, 0): No triangle formed.
33. Edge (9, 8): No triangle formed.
34. Edge (9, 2): Triangle <0, 2, 9>.
35. Edge (9, 3): No triangle formed.

The total number of triangles is [6].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 9>, <6, 9, 2>, <0, 2, 5>.
