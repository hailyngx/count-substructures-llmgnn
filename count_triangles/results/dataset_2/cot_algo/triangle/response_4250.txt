Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph to visualize it:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 0), (0, 6), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7)
- 1: (2, 6), (2, 1), (1, 8), (1, 7)
- 2: (6, 3), (6, 2), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (2, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4)
- 3: (5, 3), (6, 3), (4, 3), (2, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2)
- 4: (5, 4), (9, 4), (6, 4), (4, 2), (4, 0), (0, 4), (4, 5), (4, 9)
- 5: (8, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (5, 8)
- 6: (8, 6), (4, 6), (2, 6), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 8), (6, 4), (6, 0), (0, 6)
- 7: (9, 7), (1, 7), (8, 7), (7, 0)
- 8: (5, 8), (9, 8), (6, 8), (1, 8), (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 6), (8, 1), (8, 7)
- 9: (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 7), (7, 9), (4, 9)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Vertices by their number of connections:
0(8) < 1(4) < 5(4) < 7(4) < 9(4) < 2(5) < 4(7) < 8(9) < 6(9) < 3(8)

Triangles:
[28]
<0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 3>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <6, 2, 3>, <6, 2, 4>, <6, 2, 8>, <6, 1, 2>, <6, 1, 8>, <6, 3, 5>, <6, 3, 4>, <6, 3, 2>, <6, 3, 0>, <6, 3, 8>, <6, 8, 7>, <6, 8, 1>, <6, 8, 5>, <3, 2, 1>, <3, 2, 5>, <3, 2, 4>, <3, 2, 6>, <3, 1, 8>
