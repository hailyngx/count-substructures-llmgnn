Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, we get the following relabeling:  
Node 0 has 5 connections.  
Node 5 and Node 6 both have 3 connections.  
Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, and Node 7 all have 4 connections.  
Node 8 has 6 connections.  
Node 3 and Node 9 both have 6 connections.  

Next, we will consider the edges in the order that nodes are processed and count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 9]

Unique triangles found:  
<1, 3, 7>  
<0, 3, 9>  
<0, 3, 1>  
<2, 4, 7>  
<0, 4, 9>  
<4, 2, 7>  
<8, 1, 7>  
<8, 0, 9>  
<8, 3, 9>
