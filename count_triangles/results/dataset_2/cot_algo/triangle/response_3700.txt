Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The ordered vertex degrees are as follows:
Node 5: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 1: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 6: degree 4
Node 8: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5

The edges are listed in the order based on the lower labeled vertex with fewer connections:

(0, 6), (0, 1), (0, 9), (0, 2), 
(1, 9), (1, 7), (1, 0), 
(2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 6), 
(3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 4), (3, 8), 
(4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 8), 
(5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 7), 
(6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 9), 
(7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 9), 
(8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), 
(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 6), (9, 7)

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 0, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 0, 6>
<3, 2, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
