Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 9 has degree 6
Node 6 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 0 has degree 5
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 4 has degree 3

Based on the method, we rearrange the nodes in ascending order of their degrees:
Nodes in order: 5, 2, 1, 4, 0, 6, 3, 7, 8, 9

Now, we count the triangles using the given edges:
- For edge (5, 9), proceed as 5 has degree < 9, we find shared connections with nodes 6 and 2: <5, 2, 6>.
- For edge (5, 6), proceed as 5 and 6 both have the same degree 4. Shared connections: 9 <5, 6, 9>.
- For edge (5, 2), proceed as 5 has degree < 2. Shared connections: 9, 6 <5, 2, 9> and <5, 2, 6>.
- Continue this process for the remaining edges.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
Unique triangles are: <2, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 2, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 9>.
