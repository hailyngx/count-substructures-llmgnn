Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 6) (7, 12) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 16) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 9) (14, 16) (4, 19) (4, 13) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 17) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 14) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 3) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 13) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 15) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 3) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 15) (9, 17) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 15) (1, 10) (17, 18) (17, 9) (17, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 17) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 20 nodes and the given 60 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: (10, 11), (10, 1), (10, 19), (11, 10), (11, 18), (11, 5), (11, 6), (7, 12), (7, 8), (12, 7), (12, 2), (12, 16), (0, 16), (0, 8), (0, 9), (14, 9), (14, 16), (4, 19), (4, 13), (18, 11), (18, 15), (18, 17), (16, 12), (16, 0), (16, 14), (2, 12), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 13), (3, 5), (5, 11), (5, 2), (5, 3), (15, 18), (15, 19), (15, 9), (15, 13), (19, 10), (19, 4), (19, 15), (6, 11), (6, 2), (6, 3), (9, 0), (9, 14), (9, 15), (9, 17), (13, 4), (13, 3), (13, 15), (1, 10), (17, 18), (17, 9), (17, 8), (8, 7), (8, 0), (8, 17)

Now, let's do the Degree-Based Ordering:

Nodes with their degrees:
1: 2
2: 4
3: 4
4: 3
5: 3
6: 3
7: 2
8: 4
9: 4
10: 3
11: 4
12: 4
13: 4
14: 2
15: 4
16: 4
17: 4
18: 4
19: 4
0: 3

Degree-Based Ordering:
Node 1 (degree 2): 1, 7, 14
Node 2 (degree 3): 4, 5, 6
Node 3 (degree 3): 3, 13, 5
Node 4 (degree 3): 11, 4, 19
Node 5 (degree 3): 2, 11, 3
Node 6 (degree 3): 11, 13, 6
Node 7 (degree 2): 1, 12
Node 8 (degree 4): 3, 17, 8, 16
Node 9 (degree 4): 17, 15, 14, 9
Node 10 (degree 3): 10, 1, 19
Node 11 (degree 4): 11, 10, 6, 5
Node 12 (degree 4): 12, 2, 16, 7
Node 13 (degree 4): 13, 3, 15, 4
Node 14 (degree 2): 9, 1
Node 15 (degree 4): 9, 13, 18, 15
Node 16 (degree 4): 0, 8, 12, 14
Node 17 (degree 4): 17, 18, 9, 8
Node 18 (degree 4): 18, 17, 15, 11
Node 19 (degree 4): 4, 15, 10, 19
Node 0 (degree 3): 8, 0, 16

Now, we will count the triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 25]

Unique triangles:
<5, 3, 13>
<5, 2, 3>
<5, 3, 6>
<5, 11, 6>
<9, 13, 15>
<9, 14, 1>
<9, 14, 16>

<4, 13, 15>
<16, 12, 2>
<16, 12, 7>
<16, 0, 8>
<16, 8, 17>
<10, 1, 19>
<10, 11, 5>
<10, 11, 6>
<18, 17, 9>
<18, 15, 13>
