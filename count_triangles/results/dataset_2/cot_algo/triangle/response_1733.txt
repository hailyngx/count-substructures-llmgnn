Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 19) (15, 0) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 1) (8, 0) (8, 12) (11, 13) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 16) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 7) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 12) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 16) (16, 5) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 6) (7, 17) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 9) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 18) (1, 16) (1, 7) (1, 14) (6, 16) (6, 7) (4, 10) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 12) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges:
- 0: {8, 15, 16}
- 1: {7, 14, 16, 18}
- 2: {3, 12}
- 3: {2, 9}
- 4: {10}
- 5: {10, 13, 16, 19}
- 6: {7, 16}
- 7: {1, 6, 13, 16, 17}
- 8: {0, 12}
- 9: {3, 12, 17}
- 10: {4, 5, 17}
- 11: {13}
- 12: {2, 8, 9, 18, 19}
- 13: {5, 7, 11}
- 14: {1, 18}
- 15: {0, 19}
- 16: {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}
- 17: {7, 9, 10, 19}
- 18: {1, 12, 14}
- 19: {5, 12, 15, 17}

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degree:
Nodes sorted by degree: [4, 11, 0, 14, 6, 8, 2, 3, 15, 13, 18, 16, 7, 1, 9, 10, 5, 17, 12, 19]

Now, let's identify the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
