Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (16, 4) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 18) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 19) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 4) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 14) (7, 13) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 15) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 19) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 2) (19, 12) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 5) (15, 12) (10, 16) (10, 3) (5, 17) (5, 15) (5, 12) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 0) (18, 6) (18, 14) (13, 1) (13, 7) (0, 4) (0, 12) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on the number of connections they have. 

Here is the sorted list of nodes based on their degree (number of connections):
Node 16: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 17: degree 2
Node 10: degree 2
Node 18: degree 2
Node 13: degree 2
Node 0: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 12: degree 5
Node 8: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4

Now, we will count the triangles based on the edges provided. 
After going through the edges and checking for shared connections, the number of triangles found is [32].

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 10>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 11>
<2, 6, 19>
<2, 11, 8>
