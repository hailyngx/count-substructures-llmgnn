Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 14) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 6) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 7) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are as follows:  
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.  

The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:  
1 < 2 < 7 < 6 < 0 < 9 < 8 < 4 < 12 < 5 < 13 < 11 < 10 < 14 < 3.  

Now, starting from the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:  
- Edge (1, 3) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (1, 5) forms a triangle: <1, 5, 3>.  
- Edge (1, 9) does not form a triangle.

- Edge (8, 13) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (8, 9) forms a triangle: <8, 9, 3>.  
- Edge (8, 0) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (13, 10) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (13, 11) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (13, 8) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (13, 2) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (9, 1) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (9, 8) forms a triangle: <9, 1, 3>.  
- Edge (9, 4) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (4, 3) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (4, 10) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (4, 2) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (4, 14) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (12, 1) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (12, 3) does not form a triangle.
