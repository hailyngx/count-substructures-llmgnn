Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 11) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (2, 4) (2, 13) (12, 13) (12, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) 

Response:
The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 12: 2 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 14: 5 connections

Now, for each edge, we will only consider the edges where the node with the smaller label has fewer connections.

Based on the degrees and edges provided, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
[Total triangles: 13]
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 14>
<0, 8, 4>
<7, 8, 13>
<6, 8, 7>
<1, 5, 6>
<7, 10, 13>
<0, 10, 12>
<9, 11, 4>
<7, 9, 5>
<6, 7, 5>
<1, 5, 9>
