Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 16) (9, 3) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 4) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 2) (7, 0) (7, 18) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 18) (16, 5) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 19) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 12) (11, 0) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 14) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 2) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 2) (14, 13) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 11) (15, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
Let's start by constructing the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 16) 
(9, 3) 
(6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 4)
(10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4)
(17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 3)
(1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8)
(0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 2)
(7, 0) (7, 18)
(8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 18)
(16, 5)
(18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 19)
(19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 12)
(11, 0) (11, 12)
(3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 2)
(2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 14)
(4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 2)
(14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 2) (14, 13)
(12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 11)
(15, 6)
(13, 3) (13, 14)

Next, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Vertices sorted by degree:
9 < 16 < 7 < 15 < 11 < 9 < 12 < 13 < 14 < 17 < 19 < 18 < 0 < 8 < 1 < 10 < 5 < 6 < 3 < 4

Triangles:
[89]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 2> <0, 1, 7> <0, 1, 10> <0, 2, 4> <0, 2, 14> <0, 7, 18> <1, 8, 18> <1, 10, 17> <2, 3, 4> <3, 9, 17>
