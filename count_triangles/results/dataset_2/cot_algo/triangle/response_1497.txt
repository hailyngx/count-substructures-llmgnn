Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph with its nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 0), (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 1), (7, 9), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 2), (3, 7), (3, 0), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 8), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 2), (8, 0), (2, 9), (2, 7), (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 8), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 8)

Next, we will order the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):

Nodes (sorted by degree): 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 8, 1, 9, 2

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph based on the degree-based ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 12]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
