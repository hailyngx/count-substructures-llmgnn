Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and the given 40 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1)

Next, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

Node 5 - Degree: 3
Node 9 - Degree: 3
Node 6 - Degree: 5
Node 8 - Degree: 5
Node 0 - Degree: 3
Node 7 - Degree: 5
Node 3 - Degree: 5
Node 1 - Degree: 5
Node 4 - Degree: 3
Node 2 - Degree: 8

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 21]

Unique triangles: 
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 8, 2>
