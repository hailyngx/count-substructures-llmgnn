Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 11) (10, 18) (10, 16) (2, 18) (2, 8) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 7) (6, 5) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 19) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 15) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 15) (16, 10) (15, 5) (15, 11) (15, 7) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 13) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 19) (13, 12) (1, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to efficiently count the number of triangles in the graph. Let's follow the steps outlined earlier.

First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 16: 1 connection
- Node 13: 2 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 10: 3 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 12: 4 connections
- Node 17: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 18: 5 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 14: 5 connections
- Node 19: 6 connections
- Node 11: 6 connections
- Node 9: 6 connections
- Node 15: 6 connections

We will relabel the vertices based on this ordering. Now, let's count the triangles:

1. Using the given edges and the ordering, we count the triangles and the total number of triangles is 4:
- <0, 4, 14> 
- <3, 8, 12> 
- <3, 11, 15> 
- <4, 6, 18>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
