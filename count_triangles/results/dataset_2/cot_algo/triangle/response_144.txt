Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (5, 1), (5, 7), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0), (4, 3), (4, 1), (4, 6), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 8), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 8), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 8), (6, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 8), (8, 9), (8, 7), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 2), (8, 0), (0, 9), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 8)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):
0: degree 5
2: degree 3
5: degree 2
7: degree 3
4: degree 3
1: degree 6
3: degree 6
6: degree 6
8: degree 7
9: degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph, we find that there are:
[<0, 3, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [9]
