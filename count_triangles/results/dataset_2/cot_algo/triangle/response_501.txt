Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 11) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 15) (1, 16) (1, 13) (17, 4) (17, 12) (10, 3) (10, 5) (15, 12) (13, 18) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (16, 14) (16, 1) (16, 5) (9, 18) (9, 11) (19, 6) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 16) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 13) (6, 19) 

Response:
After constructing the graph with the given nodes and edges, we can identify the number of connections for each node. Then, we can apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

The nodes with their number of connections are as follows:  
0: 2 connections  
1: 2 connections  
2: 3 connections  
3: 6 connections  
4: 5 connections  
5: 6 connections  
6: 4 connections  
7: 2 connections  
8: 3 connections  
9: 3 connections  
10: 3 connections  
11: 3 connections  
12: 4 connections  
13: 4 connections   
14: 4 connections  
15: 2 connections  
16: 4 connections  
17: 3 connections  
18: 4 connections  
19: 2 connections  

Sorting the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order, we get:  
0, 1, 7, 15, 19, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 17, 4, 6, 13, 14, 16, 3, 5, 12, 18  

Now, we can count the number of triangles formed in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The total number of triangles is [24].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:  
<0, 4, 14>  
<1, 13, 16>  
<1, 13, 3>  
<3, 5, 12>  
<3, 5, 13>  
<3, 5, 16>  
<3, 6, 13>  
<3, 6, 5>  
<4, 14, 16>  
<4, 14, 3>  
<4, 17, 12>  
<5, 12, 17>  
<5, 12, 16>  
<5, 13, 6>  
<5, 13, 16>  
<5, 16, 14>  
<6, 2, 13>  
<6, 2, 19>  
<6, 13, 16>  
<11, 0, 14>  
<13, 18, 4>  
<13, 18, 2>  
<13, 18, 6>  
<16, 1, 5>
