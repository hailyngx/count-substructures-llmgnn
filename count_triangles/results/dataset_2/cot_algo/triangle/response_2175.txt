Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 14) (1, 8) (1, 14) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Nodes sorted by their number of connections:

Node 7 : 3 connections  
Node 1 : 3 connections  
Node 0 : 4 connections  
Node 12 : 4 connections  
Node 9 : 4 connections  
Node 8 : 4 connections  
Node 14 : 4 connections  
Node 4 : 4 connections  
Node 6 : 5 connections  
Node 5 : 5 connections  
Node 2 : 5 connections  
Node 13 : 6 connections  
Node 11 : 6 connections  
Node 3 : 6 connections  
Node 10 : 6 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Using the given edges:
(4, 9) forms a triangle with 2 shared connections (13, 11)  
(4, 13) does not form a triangle as vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 13  
(4, 6) does not form a triangle as vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 6  
(7, 3) does not form a triangle as both have the same number of connections  
(7, 6) does not form a triangle as vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 6  
(7, 13) forms a triangle with 1 shared connection (11)  
(10, 11) does not form a triangle as both have the same number of connections  
(10, 8) does not form a triangle as vertex 10 has more connections than vertex 8  
(10, 12) does not form a triangle as vertex 10 has more connections than vertex 12  
(10, 2) does not form a triangle as vertex 10 has more connections than vertex 2  
(11, 10) does not form a triangle as both have the same number of connections  
(11, 3) does not form a triangle as both have the same number of connections  
(11, 13) does not form a triangle as vertex 11 has more connections than vertex 13  
(11, 5) forms a triangle with 2 shared connections (13, 2)  
(5, 11) does not form a triangle as both have the same number of connections  
(5, 13) does not form a triangle as vertex 13 has more connections than vertex 5  
(5, 2) does not form a triangle as vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 2  
(5, 8) forms a triangle with 1 shared connection (10)  
(13, 4) does not form a triangle as vertex 13 has more connections than vertex 4  

Continuing to check the remaining edges, we find various triangles based on the shared connections:

[Total number of triangles: 4]
<4, 9, 13>
<7, 11, 13>
<5, 8, 10>
<5, 11, 13>
