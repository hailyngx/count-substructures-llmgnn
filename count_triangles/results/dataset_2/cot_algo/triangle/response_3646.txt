Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 9) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 15) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 15) (2, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 8) (6, 0) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) (9, 17) (9, 11) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 15) (3, 17) (3, 12) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 1) (19, 6) (19, 10) (4, 2) (4, 1) (15, 18) (15, 2) (15, 11) (15, 12) (1, 5) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 12) (10, 19) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges and the list of edges provided, we first need to construct the graph. 

The graph G can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: {(14, 17), (14, 7), (14, 13), (17, 18), (17, 3), (17, 16), (17, 9), (18, 2), (18, 15), (2, 16), (2, 15), (2, 4), (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 1), (6, 19), (6, 8), (6, 0), (13, 11), (0, 8), (7, 13), (9, 11), (9, 17), (11, 15), (3, 12), (16, 1), (4, 1), (15, 12), (10, 19)}

Now, we will sort the vertices by their degree:

Nodes by Degree: {10, 4, 0, 7, 12, 9, 19, 5, 8, 11, 3, 6, 18, 2, 1, 16, 15, 13, 14, 17}

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on the sorting:

Relabeled Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph. After counting, the total number of triangles is [4].

The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 4, 12>
<1, 4, 15>
<1, 6, 12>
