Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 3) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 6) (4, 15) (4, 17) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 13) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 14) (13, 5) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 16) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 10) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 9) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 16) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 17) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 15) (11, 7) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 9) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 9) (15, 4) (15, 7) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 17) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in increasing order.

After sorting the nodes and relabeling them, the vertices are as follows:
Node 0: degree 5
Node 11: degree 1
Node 1: degree 2
Node 12: degree 3
Node 14: degree 2
Node 13: degree 3
Node 15: degree 2
Node 16: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 18: degree 3
Node 19: degree 4
Node 5: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 7: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 5
Node 6: degree 4

Now we will count the triangles using these relabeled nodes and the provided edges:
1. Node 4 (degree 5) is connected to nodes 18 (degree 3), 19 (degree 4), 6 (degree 4), 15 (degree 2), and 17 (degree 4). Among these, we have shared connections with nodes 6 and 17, forming triangles <4, 6, 17> and <4, 6, 17>.
2. Node 18 (degree 3) is connected to nodes 4, 12 (degree 3), and 3 (degree 4). Among these, we have shared connections with node 4, forming triangle <4, 18, 12>.
3. Node 5 (degree 3) is connected to nodes 0 (degree 5), 13 (degree 3), and 12 (degree 3). Among these, we have shared connections with nodes 0 and 12, forming triangle <0, 5, 12>.
4. Node 17 (degree 4) is connected to nodes 4, 8 (degree 4), 16 (degree 4), and 9 (degree 3). Among these, we have shared connections with nodes 4, 8, and 16, forming triangle <4, 8, 16>.
5. Node 0 (degree 5) is connected to nodes 10 (degree 3), 5, 8, 1 (degree 2), and 14 (degree 2). Among these, we have shared connections with nodes 10 and 8, forming triangle <0, 10, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [5], and the unique triangles found inside <> are:
<4, 6, 17>
<4, 18, 12>
<0, 5, 12>
<4, 8, 16>
<0, 10, 8>
