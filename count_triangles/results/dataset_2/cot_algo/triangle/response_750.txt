Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) 

Response:
Let's sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:  

Vertices by degree:  
Node 6: Degree 2  
Node 8: Degree 2  
Node 0: Degree 4  
Node 2: Degree 4  
Node 1: Degree 4  
Node 3: Degree 4  
Node 4: Degree 4  
Node 7: Degree 4  
Node 5: Degree 6  
Node 9: Degree 6  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now analyze the edges and count the triangles:  
- Node 6 forms triangles with:  
  - (1, 6, 3)  

- Node 8 forms triangles with:  
  - (1, 8, 3)  
- Node 0 forms triangles with:  
  - (1, 0, 5)  
  - (1, 0, 7)  
  - (3, 0, 5)  

- Node 2 forms triangles with:  
  - (1, 2, 9)  
  - (2, 4, 5)  
- Node 1 forms triangles with:  
  - (1, 6, 3)  
  - (1, 0, 5)  
  - (1, 0, 7)  
  - (1, 8, 3)  

- Node 3 forms triangles with:  
  - (1, 6, 3)  
  - (1, 8, 3)  
  - (1, 0, 5)  
  - (3, 0, 5)  

- Node 4 forms triangles with:  
  - (2, 4, 5)  
  - (4, 7, 5)  
- Node 7 forms triangles with:  
  - (4, 7, 5)  
  - (1, 7, 0)  

- Node 5 forms triangles with:  
  - (2, 4, 5)  
  - (4, 7, 5)  
  - (1, 0, 5)  
  - (3, 0, 5)  

- Node 9 forms triangles with:  
  - (1, 2, 9)  

### Output:
Total number of triangles: [16]  
Unique triangles found: <1, 6, 3>, <1, 8, 3>, <1, 0, 5>, <1, 0, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <4, 7, 5>, <1, 7, 0>, <1, 2, 9>.
