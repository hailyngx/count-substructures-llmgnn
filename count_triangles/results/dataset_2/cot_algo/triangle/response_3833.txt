Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 24) (9, 1) (26, 24) (26, 27) (26, 12) (8, 5) (13, 14) (13, 7) (0, 2) (0, 22) (2, 0) (2, 27) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 11) (17, 1) (17, 27) (17, 15) (24, 9) (24, 26) (24, 5) (24, 19) (6, 21) (6, 16) (21, 6) (21, 11) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 15) (22, 0) (22, 4) (22, 19) (22, 20) (25, 15) (25, 28) (25, 14) (4, 22) (4, 28) (4, 11) (12, 26) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 29) (19, 24) (19, 22) (3, 7) (3, 10) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 29) (7, 20) (7, 28) (15, 17) (15, 16) (15, 25) (29, 12) (29, 7) (29, 18) (29, 10) (11, 1) (11, 21) (11, 4) (5, 8) (5, 24) (5, 18) (5, 10) (5, 20) (20, 22) (20, 7) (20, 5) (10, 3) (10, 29) (10, 5) (10, 23) (18, 29) (18, 5) (27, 26) (27, 2) (27, 17) (27, 28) (28, 25) (28, 4) (28, 7) (28, 27) (14, 13) (14, 25) (14, 12) (14, 23) (23, 10) (23, 14) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges is constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: 
(9, 24) (9, 1) (26, 24) (26, 27) (26, 12) 
(8, 5) (13, 14) (13, 7) (0, 2) (0, 22) 
(2, 0) (2, 27) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 11) 
(17, 1) (17, 27) (17, 15) (24, 9) (24, 26) 
(24, 5) (24, 19) (6, 21) (6, 16) (21, 6) 
(21, 11) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 15) (22, 0) 
(22, 4) (22, 19) (22, 20) (25, 15) (25, 28) 
(25, 14) (4, 22) (4, 28) (4, 11) (12, 26) 
(12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 29) (19, 24) (19, 22) 
(3, 7) (3, 10) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 29) 
(7, 20) (7, 28) (15, 17) (15, 16) (15, 25) 
(29, 12) (29, 7) (29, 18) (29, 10) (11, 1) 
(11, 21) (11, 4) (5, 8) (5, 24) (5, 18) 
(5, 10) (5, 20) (20, 22) (20, 7) (20, 5) 
(10, 3) (10, 29) (10, 5) (10, 23) (18, 29) 
(18, 5) (27, 26) (27, 2) (27, 17) (27, 28) 
(28, 25) (28, 4) (28, 7) (28, 27) (14, 13) 
(14, 25) (14, 12) (14, 23) (23, 10) (23, 14)

Now, by sorting the nodes based on their degrees, we have the following labels: 
{8, 0, 3, 6, 2, 13, 20, 1, 4, 14, 5, 21, 16, 19, 22, 27, 23, 18, 10, 7, 25, 11, 9, 24, 15, 26, 17, 28, 12, 29}

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and checking for shared connections, we find that there are 88 triangles in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [88]. 
Some of the unique triangles found are: 
<10, 29, 18>
<2, 0, 22>
<5, 8, 24>
<7, 29, 18>
<14, 23, 10>
<14, 25, 15>
<15, 25, 17>
