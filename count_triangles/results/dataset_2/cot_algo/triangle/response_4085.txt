Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:  

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}  
Edges:  
- 0: {5, 9, 3, 1}  
- 1: {9, 8, 0}  
- 2: {5, 4, 7, 3}  
- 3: {5, 4, 7, 0, 2}  
- 4: {9, 7, 8, 3, 6, 2}  
- 5: {9, 2, 0, 3}  
- 6: {4, 7, 8}  
- 7: {4, 3, 6, 2}  
- 8: {4, 6, 1}  
- 9: {5, 4, 1, 0}  
  
Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:  
- 0 (Degree: 4)  
- 8 (Degree: 3)  
- 1 (Degree: 3)  
- 2 (Degree: 4)  
- 6 (Degree: 3)  
- 7 (Degree: 4)  
- 9 (Degree: 4)  
- 3 (Degree: 5)  
- 5 (Degree: 4)  
- 4 (Degree: 6)  
  
We will now count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method to avoid double-counting triangles.  
  
[Total number of triangles: 9]  
  
Unique triangles found:  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 9, 5>  
<0, 9, 1>  
<0, 3, 5>  
<2, 4, 7>  
<2, 4, 3>  
<2, 3, 7>  
<6, 4, 7>  
<6, 4, 8>
