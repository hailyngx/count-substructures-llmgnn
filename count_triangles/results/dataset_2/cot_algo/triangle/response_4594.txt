Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 13) (14, 8) (14, 7) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 19) (1, 11) (1, 5) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 2) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 6) (6, 17) (6, 16) (6, 4) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (9, 17) (9, 12) (9, 18) (18, 15) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 18) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 10) (13, 15) (13, 12) (13, 18) (10, 4) (10, 7) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 10) (19, 3) (19, 17) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is a way to count the number of triangles efficiently. Let's label the vertices according to their degree (number of connections) in increasing order.

The vertices with their respective degrees are:
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 11: 2 connections
Vertex 19: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 17: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 13: 4 connections
Vertex 10: 2 connections
Vertex 0: 6 connections
Vertex 15: 6 connections
Vertex 14: 2 connections
Vertex 18: 6 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 6 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 12: 4 connections
Vertex 16: 4 connections

Now, we will go through each edge in the original graph and see which ones to process based on the labels assigned. We will count the triangles formed and output the total count in the end.

The total number of triangles is [9].
