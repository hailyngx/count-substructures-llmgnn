Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 1) 

Response:
The given graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 3) (14, 0)
- 1: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 14) (1, 14) (1, 10)
- 2: (12, 2) (2, 11) (11, 2)
- 3: (8, 3) (14, 3) (12, 3) (3, 12)
- 4: (8, 4) (4, 10)
- 5: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 5)
- 6: (9, 6) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (14, 6) (12, 6) (10, 6)
- 7: (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 11) (11, 7)
- 8: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 8)
- 9: (5, 9) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9)
- 10: (8, 10) (13, 10) (4, 10) (0, 10) (10, 6) (10, 1)
- 11: (13, 11) (14, 11) (2, 11) (11, 7)
- 12: (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (3, 12)
- 13: (8, 13) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 8)
- 14: (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1)

Next, we reorder the vertices based on their degrees from lowest to highest:
Nodes: 0, 2, 4, 5, 3, 13, 11, 12, 7, 1, 9, 14, 6, 8, 10

Now we count the number of triangles:
There are [11] triangles in the graph.

Unique triangles found:
<1, 6, 14>
<7, 11, 13>
<6, 7, 11>
<1, 9, 5>
<6, 9, 1>
<6, 14, 0>
<1, 10, 6>
<7, 11, 2>
<8, 13, 10>
<7, 13, 8>
<8, 3, 14>
