Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (17, 8) (17, 21) (8, 17) (8, 28) (8, 16) (8, 21) (23, 2) (23, 9) (23, 19) (15, 20) (15, 6) (15, 4) (20, 15) (20, 19) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 27) (26, 13) (26, 2) (26, 27) (26, 0) (26, 12) (1, 4) (1, 19) (0, 26) (0, 7) (0, 28) (0, 6) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 25) (25, 7) (25, 2) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 4) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 5) (11, 21) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 6) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 3) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 16) (6, 24) (24, 3) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 14) (29, 21) (21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 13) (21, 11) (21, 29) (2, 23) (2, 26) (2, 25) (2, 16) (2, 9) (9, 23) (9, 2) (9, 12) (12, 26) (12, 9) (12, 14) (27, 13) (27, 26) (27, 24) (14, 24) (14, 12) (22, 11) (4, 15) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (19, 23) (19, 20) (19, 1) 

Response:
The graph constructed based on the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
(0, 26) (0, 7) (0, 28) (0, 6) 
(1, 4) (1, 19) 
(2, 23) (2, 9) (2, 26) (2, 25) (2, 16) 
(3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 4) 
(4, 15) 
(5, 10) (5, 11) 
(6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 16) (6, 24) 
(7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 25) 
(8, 17) (8, 28) (8, 16) (8, 21) 
(9, 23) (9, 2) (9, 12) 
(10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) 
(11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 5) (11, 21) 
(12, 26) (12, 9) (12, 14) 
(13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 27) 
(14, 24) (14, 12) 
(15, 20) (15, 6) (15, 4) 
(16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 6) 
(17, 8) (17, 21) 
(19, 23) (19, 20) (19, 1) 
(20, 15) (20, 19) 
(21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 13) (21, 11) (21, 29) 
(22, 11) 
(23, 2) (23, 9) (23, 19) 
(24, 3) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 14) 
(25, 7) (25, 2) 
(26, 13) (26, 2) (26, 27) (26, 0) (26, 12) 
(27, 13) (27, 26) (27, 24) 
(28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 3) 
(29, 21) 

After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, we get: 
Nodes: 18, 10, 16, 22, 29, 1, 5, 25, 4, 17, 7, 20, 19, 11, 15, 12, 9, 24, 14, 13, 27, 23, 6, 8, 2, 21, 0, 3, 26, 28

Now, applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 8]

Unique triangles:
<1, 4, 19>
<2, 16, 26>
<2, 16, 6>
<2, 16, 25>
<2, 25, 7>
<6, 15, 4>
<7, 10, 0>
<21, 11, 29>
