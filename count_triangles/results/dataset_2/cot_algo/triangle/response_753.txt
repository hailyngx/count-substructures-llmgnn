Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 21) (9, 16) (9, 13) (26, 28) (26, 8) (26, 27) (4, 18) (4, 17) (7, 21) (7, 29) (7, 5) (3, 25) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 0) (25, 3) (25, 29) (21, 9) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 20) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 23) (2, 13) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 0) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 29) (28, 19) (29, 7) (29, 25) (29, 28) (29, 6) (17, 4) (17, 20) (17, 11) (20, 21) (20, 17) (20, 14) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 28) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 23) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 5) (11, 17) (11, 19) (1, 2) (1, 13) (23, 2) (23, 19) (6, 29) (6, 22) (22, 6) (22, 27) (22, 8) (27, 26) (27, 22) (27, 16) (27, 8) (5, 7) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 12) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 14) (24, 12) (24, 13) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 24) (8, 26) (8, 22) (8, 27) (8, 16) (16, 9) (16, 27) (16, 8) (14, 20) (14, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is used to count triangles in the graph. Let's follow the steps:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections (degree):
   Vertices in increasing order of degree: [10, 1, 24, 7, 6, 11, 5, 14, 12, 4, 3, 0, 23, 19, 17, 20, 2, 18, 9, 25, 21, 15, 29, 8, 16, 22, 27, 26, 13, 28]

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   After relabeling: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]

3. Check each edge, proceeding if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
   Count the total number of triangles: [6]

4. List the unique triangles found:
   <3, 0, 5>
   <3, 0, 21>
   <3, 5, 7>
   <3, 5, 15>
   <0, 3, 18>
   <0, 3, 21> 

The total number of triangles is [6].
