Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 11) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 12) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph using Degree-Based Ordering, we follow these steps:

1. Sort the vertices based on the number of connections:
   - Vertex 5: degree 5
   - Vertex 9: degree 5
   - Vertex 8: degree 5
   - Vertex 0: degree 5
   - Vertex 7: degree 5
   - Vertex 2: degree 4
   - Vertex 13: degree 3
   - Vertex 10: degree 3
   - Vertex 6: degree 3
   - Vertex 14: degree 3
   - Vertex 12: degree 3
   - Vertex 11: degree 4
   - Vertex 1: degree 2
   - Vertex 4: degree 4
   - Vertex 3: degree 4

2. Relabel the vertices:
   - Vertex 1: degree 2
   - Vertex 4: degree 4
   - Vertex 3: degree 4
   - Vertex 2: degree 4
   - Vertex 13: degree 3
   - Vertex 10: degree 3
   - Vertex 6: degree 3
   - Vertex 14: degree 3
   - Vertex 12: degree 3
   - Vertex 11: degree 4
   - Vertex 5: degree 5
   - Vertex 9: degree 5
   - Vertex 8: degree 5
   - Vertex 0: degree 5
   - Vertex 7: degree 5

3. Count the triangles:
   - Looking at the edges, only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found: 
   1. <2, 4, 12>
   2. <2, 4, 14>
   3. <2, 4, 11>
   4. <2, 3, 6>
   5. <2, 3, 7>
   6. <2, 13, 8>
   7. <11, 12, 4>
   8. <11, 12, 7>
   9. <4, 11, 1>
   10. <4, 11, 7>

Total number of triangles: [10]
