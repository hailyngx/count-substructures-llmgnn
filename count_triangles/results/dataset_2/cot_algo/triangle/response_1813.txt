Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 12) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 13) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 15) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (18, 6) (19, 3) (19, 14) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (0, 11) (0, 8) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 13) (7, 1) (7, 13) (17, 5) (17, 15) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 9) (8, 0) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 17) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 13) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 16) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. 

Here is the sorted list of vertices with their connections: 
0: 2 connections
8: 1 connection
7: 2 connections
17: 2 connections
19: 2 connections
1: 3 connections
9: 3 connections
10: 3 connections
11: 4 connections
3: 6 connections
5: 6 connections
4: 6 connections
16: 3 connections
6: 4 connections
15: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
12: 4 connections
18: 1 connection
13: 4 connections
14: 4 connections

Now, we will count the triangles by checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge.

Total number of triangles: [14]

Unique triangles:
<0, 11, 2>
<11, 13, 5>
<3, 12, 4>
<3, 19, 14>
<3, 12, 2>
<3, 14, 9>
<5, 2, 11>
<5, 16, 4>
<5, 16, 10>
<5, 17, 15>
<6, 15, 4>
<6, 13, 11>
<10, 4, 16>
<13, 11, 7>
