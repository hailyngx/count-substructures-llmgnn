Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 14) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 11) (15, 16) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 16) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 13) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (17, 3) (17, 1) (17, 7) (2, 9) (2, 14) (8, 0) (8, 18) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 1) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 5) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 5) (19, 4) (19, 12) (12, 11) (12, 19) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 1) (7, 6) (7, 17) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections. The vertices are listed below with their connections in braces:

Vertex 8: {0, 18}
Vertex 7: {6, 17}
Vertex 12: {11, 19}
Vertex 3: {17, 14}
Vertex 16: {15, 9, 1} 
Vertex 6: {7, 13}
Vertex 5: {4, 14, 1}
Vertex 2: {9, 14}
Vertex 18: {10, 8, 4}
Vertex 0: {8, 14, 13}
Vertex 4: {18, 19, 5, 1}
Vertex 10: {15, 11, 18, 13}
Vertex 15: {10, 9, 11, 16}
Vertex 1: {17, 4, 16, 5}
Vertex 9: {15, 2, 16}
Vertex 17: {3, 1, 7}

Now, we will list the edges in the order described by the method:

(8, 0), (7, 6), (12, 11), (3, 17), (16, 15), 
(6, 7), (5, 4), (5, 1), (3, 14), (16, 9), 
(6, 13), (4, 18), (12, 19), (16, 1), (4, 5), 
(14, 2), (14, 0), (14, 5), (18, 8), (10, 11), 
(10, 18), (9, 15), (15, 11), (9, 16), (2, 9), 
(0, 8), (7, 17), (13, 6), (13, 10), (13, 11)

By following this order, we can count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [23]

Unique triangles:
<5, 1, 4>
<5, 1, 16>
<5, 4, 18>
<4, 18, 10>
<14, 5, 1>
<16, 1, 17>
<3, 17, 1>
<16, 15, 10>
<13, 6, 7>
<13, 11, 10>
<13, 10, 11>
<2, 14, 3>
<7, 6, 13>
<16, 9, 15>
<16, 9, 2>
<16, 1, 4>
<16, 1, 5>
<9, 15, 11>
