Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 19) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 17) (1, 16) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (2, 11) (2, 18) (18, 16) (18, 2) (18, 5) (0, 1) (0, 5) (14, 15) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 1) (13, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (10, 3) (10, 8) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 12) (9, 15) (9, 8) (12, 8) (12, 17) (6, 11) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 19) (19, 16) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 17) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 19) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 20
Edges: 60
Edge list:
(11, 16) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 19) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 10) 
(3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 17) (1, 16) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (2, 11) (2, 18) (18, 16) (18, 2) 
(18, 5) (0, 1) (0, 5) (14, 15) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 1) (13, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) 
(10, 3) (10, 8) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 12) (9, 15) (9, 8) (12, 8) (12, 17) (6, 11) (4, 11) (4, 5) 
(4, 19) (19, 16) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 17) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 19)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Sorted nodes by their degree:
Node 7: degree 2
Node 0: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 6: degree 2
Node 10: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 12: degree 2
Node 14: degree 2
Node 18: degree 4
Node 13: degree 2
Node 8: degree 4
Node 5: degree 6
Node 1: degree 4
Node 16: degree 6
Node 15: degree 4
Node 3: degree 6
Node 19: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 4: degree 5
Node 11: degree 4

Triangles found: 13

The total number of triangles is [13].
Unique triangles: <8, 13, 15>, <1, 3, 16>, <8, 9, 15>, <1, 13, 15>, <13, 5, 1>, <5, 0, 1>, <8, 9, 17>, <8, 5, 18>, <10, 8, 9>, <5, 4, 0>, <7, 5, 13>, <7, 5, 18>, <3, 1, 16>.
