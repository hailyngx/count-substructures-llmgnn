Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 9) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree. Let's find the degrees of each node:

Node 0: degree 6
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 6
Node 14: degree 3

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:

Node 1: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 5: degree 2
Node 2: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 14: degree 3
Node 0: degree 6
Node 3: degree 5
Node 13: degree 6

Following the edge rule for the lower labeled node, let's count the triangles:
