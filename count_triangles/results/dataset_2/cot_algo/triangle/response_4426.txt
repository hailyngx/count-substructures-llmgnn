Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 5) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 12: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 14: 4 connections
Vertex 10: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 11: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 6 connections
Vertex 13: 4 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

Triangles:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 10>
<0, 4, 12>
<0, 8, 10>
<0, 10, 12>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 12>
<3, 5, 12>
<4, 5, 14>
<4, 12, 14>
<6, 1, 7>
<6, 1, 9>
<6, 7, 13>
<6, 9, 13>
<7, 1, 9>
<7, 1, 14>
<7, 9, 13>
<8, 10, 11>
<8, 10, 12>
<8, 11, 13>
<8, 12, 14>
<10, 11, 13>
<10, 11, 2>
<10, 12, 14>
<11, 2, 13>
<12, 14, 5>
<5, 11, 14>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [26].
