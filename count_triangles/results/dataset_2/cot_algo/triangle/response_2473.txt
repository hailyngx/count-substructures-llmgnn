Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 7) (2, 18) (2, 8) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 12) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 15) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 1) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 15) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 14) (6, 5) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 16) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 7) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 15) (19, 1) (19, 16) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 19) (9, 13) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 7) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 1) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 19) (1, 12) (13, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be used to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

The sorted list of vertices based on their connections is as follows:
Node 9: 1 edge
Node 13: 1 edge
Node 19: 2 edges
Node 2: 2 edges
Node 4: 2 edges
Node 7: 3 edges
Node 11: 3 edges
Node 18: 3 edges
Node 3: 3 edges
Node 5: 4 edges
Node 8: 4 edges
Node 6: 4 edges
Node 12: 4 edges
Node 0: 5 edges
Node 1: 5 edges
Node 17: 6 edges
Node 16: 6 edges
Node 10: 6 edges
Node 14: 6 edges
Node 15: 6 edges

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method with the sorted vertices list, we examine each edge to count the triangles. We only count a triangle if the lower label vertex has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles found in the graph is 25.
