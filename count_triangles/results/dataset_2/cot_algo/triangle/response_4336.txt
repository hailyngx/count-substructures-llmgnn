Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's construct the graph using the given edges:

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes: {9, 4, 3, 8, 2}
- Node 1 is connected to nodes: {4, 3}
- Node 2 is connected to nodes: {4, 8, 0}
- Node 3 is connected to nodes: {5, 9, 6, 1, 0}
- Node 4 is connected to nodes: {5, 0, 1, 2}
- Node 5 is connected to nodes: {9, 6, 8, 4, 3}
- Node 6 is connected to nodes: {5, 9, 3}
- Node 7 is connected to nodes: {9, 8}
- Node 8 is connected to nodes: {5, 9, 7, 2, 0}
- Node 9 is connected to nodes: {5, 6, 8, 3, 7, 0}

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes by degree: {1, 2, 7, 4, 6, 8, 0, 3, 5, 9}

Next, we will list the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: 
[4, 0, 2]
[4, 0, 3]
[4, 1, 3]
[4, 2, 8]
[5, 3, 9]
[0, 3, 8]
[0, 4, 5]
[0, 4, 8]
[0, 8, 5]
[3, 5, 9]
[3, 6, 9]
[3, 9, 5]
[8, 5, 9]
[8, 7, 9]

Total number of triangles: [14]
