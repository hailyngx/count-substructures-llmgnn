Considering Degree-Based Ordering, the sorted nodes are: 

Degree 0: {21, 27}
Degree 1: {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17, 18, 22}
Degree 2: {1, 25}
Degree 3: {24, 29}
Degree 4: {4, 26}
Degree 5: {15}
Degree 6: {20}
Degree 7: {3, 19, 28}
Degree 8: {2, 13, 16, 23}
Degree 9: {11}
Degree 10: {9}

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Triangles:
