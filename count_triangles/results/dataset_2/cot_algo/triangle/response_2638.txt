Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (0, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 9) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (12)
- 1: (4, 3, 5, 9, 10)
- 2: (8, 12, 5, 9, 11)
- 3: (7, 1, 5, 6)
- 4: (7, 12, 14, 1, 11)
- 5: (1, 3, 2)
- 6: (7, 3, 8)
- 7: (4, 3, 6, 10, 13)
- 8: (13, 2, 11, 6)
- 9: (1, 2, 14, 10)
- 10: (7, 1, 13, 14, 9)
- 11: (4, 8, 13, 2, 14)
- 12: (4, 2, 0)
- 13: (8, 11, 7, 10)
- 14: (4, 11, 9, 10)

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:
The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are: 0 < 5 < 6 < 9 < 12 < 8 < 10 < 2 < 14 < 1 < 3 < 13 < 11 < 7 < 4

The triangles found are:
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <1, 4, 11>
- <1, 9, 10>
- <2, 8, 11>
- <3, 5, 1>
- <4, 11, 14>
- <7, 3, 6>
- <7, 4, 12>
- <9, 10, 14>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
