Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 18) (22, 4) (22, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 10) (9, 16) (9, 7) (3, 22) (3, 15) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 25) (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 17) (1, 19) (21, 1) (21, 6) (21, 11) (21, 25) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 2) (6, 16) (26, 1) (26, 14) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 0) (18, 13) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 20) (17, 1) (17, 8) (17, 11) (20, 18) (14, 26) (14, 24) (14, 25) (12, 4) (12, 28) (2, 6) (2, 11) (16, 5) (16, 9) (16, 6) (16, 24) (16, 8) (24, 14) (24, 16) (24, 27) (24, 29) (7, 9) (7, 29) (7, 10) (29, 24) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 25) (23, 4) (23, 28) (23, 27) (28, 12) (28, 23) (27, 24) (27, 23) (27, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (19, 1) (25, 15) (25, 21) (25, 14) (25, 29) (0, 4) (0, 29) (11, 5) (11, 21) (11, 17) (11, 2) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 16) (8, 27) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the 30 nodes and 90 edges provided. Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most are:
Nodes: 13, 22, 5, 9, 3, 15, 1, 21, 6, 26, 4, 18, 17, 20, 14, 12, 2, 16, 24, 7, 29, 23, 28, 27, 10, 19, 25, 0, 11, 8

Now, let's count the triangles based on the shared connections between vertices of each edge:

Total number of triangles: [13]

Unique triangles found:
