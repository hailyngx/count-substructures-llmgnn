Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 24) (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 4) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 16) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 22) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 21) (8, 26) (22, 17) (22, 6) (26, 8) (26, 28) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 27) (28, 26) (6, 22) (6, 21) (6, 4) (6, 20) (21, 14) (21, 8) (21, 6) (21, 0) (21, 4) (5, 1) (19, 3) (13, 17) (13, 29) (13, 20) (0, 2) (0, 21) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 16) (7, 2) (7, 11) (1, 5) (1, 20) (1, 12) (20, 6) (20, 13) (20, 1) (20, 18) (20, 9) (24, 3) (24, 27) (24, 9) (18, 0) (18, 20) (18, 12) (23, 16) (23, 9) (23, 27) (27, 11) (27, 24) (27, 23) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 18) (29, 13) (9, 14) (9, 20) (9, 24) (9, 23) (4, 15) (4, 6) (4, 21) (4, 10) (16, 14) (16, 10) (16, 23) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges based on the given information first.

The nodes are numbered from 0 to 29.

The edges are:
(3, 15) (3, 24) (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 4) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 9) 
(14, 16) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 22) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 2)
(8, 21) (8, 26) (22, 17) (22, 6) (26, 8) (26, 28) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 27) (28, 26) 
(6, 22) (6, 21) (6, 4) (6, 20) (21, 14) (21, 8) (21, 6) (21, 0) (21, 4) (5, 1) (19, 3) 
(13, 17) (13, 29) (13, 20) (0, 2) (0, 21) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) 
(10, 4) (10, 16) (7, 2) (7, 11) (1, 5) (1, 20) (1, 12) (20, 6) (20, 13) (20, 1) 
(20, 18) (20, 9) (24, 3) (24, 27) (24, 9) (18, 0) (18, 20) (18, 12) (23, 16) (23, 9) 
(23, 27) (27, 11) (27, 24) (27, 23) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 18) (29, 13) (9, 14) 
(9, 20) (9, 24) (9, 23) (4, 15) (4, 6) (4, 21) (4, 10) (16, 14) (16, 10) (16, 23)

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
