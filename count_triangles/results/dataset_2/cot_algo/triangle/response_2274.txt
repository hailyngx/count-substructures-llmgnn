Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 10) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 5) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 10) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the provided edges:

```
0 -- 1 -- 5 -- 4 -- 2
|         |    |    |
7 -- 10   11   13   6
|    |
14   12
|    /
3 -- 8 -- 9
```

The nodes are labeled as follows:
0 - 7 connections
1 - 3 connections
2 - 2 connections
3 - 6 connections
4 - 4 connections
5 - 7 connections
6 - 5 connections
7 - 4 connections
8 - 5 connections
9 - 3 connections
10 - 3 connections
11 - 3 connections
12 - 3 connections
13 - 5 connections
14 - 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Start by labeling the nodes according to their degrees in increasing order.
2. Proceed through the edges, counting triangles by checking shared connections.

After calculating, the number of triangles in the graph is [4]. 
The unique triangles are as follows:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 14>, <3, 5, 14>.
