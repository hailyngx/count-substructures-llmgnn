Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 26) (16, 5) (15, 27) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 29) (15, 4) (27, 15) (27, 7) (27, 19) (3, 15) (3, 25) (3, 18) (25, 3) (25, 18) (18, 3) (18, 25) (18, 22) (18, 0) (22, 18) (22, 9) (22, 24) (22, 8) (28, 9) (28, 13) (28, 20) (29, 15) (29, 1) (29, 5) (2, 0) (8, 22) (8, 9) (8, 12) (0, 18) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 0) (14, 1) (9, 22) (9, 28) (9, 8) (9, 17) (6, 21) (21, 6) (21, 26) (21, 17) (7, 27) (7, 24) (7, 19) (7, 26) (26, 16) (26, 21) (26, 7) (26, 12) (1, 29) (1, 14) (1, 12) (10, 0) (10, 23) (10, 20) (24, 22) (24, 7) (24, 17) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 29) (23, 10) (23, 13) (23, 12) (12, 8) (12, 26) (12, 1) (12, 23) (20, 28) (20, 10) (20, 13) (4, 15) (4, 13) (19, 27) (19, 7) (17, 9) (17, 21) (17, 24) (13, 28) (13, 23) (13, 20) (13, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices by their degree (number of connections). 

Then, we will relabel the vertices accordingly and follow the method to count the triangles. 

Let's start by listing the nodes and their corresponding connections:

Node 0: 18, 2, 14, 10
Node 1: 14, 29, 12
Node 2: 0
Node 3: 25, 18, 15
Node 4: 13, 15
Node 5: 15, 16, 29
Node 6: 21
Node 7: 19, 24, 26, 27
Node 8: 12, 9, 22
Node 9: 8, 22, 17, 28
Node 10: 0, 23, 20
Node 11: 16
Node 12: 8, 26, 1, 23
Node 13: 4, 20, 23, 28
Node 14: 0, 1
Node 15: 5, 29, 3, 4, 27
Node 16: 5, 11, 26
Node 17: 9, 21, 24
Node 18: 22, 3, 25
Node 19: 7, 27
Node 20: 10, 28, 13
Node 21: 17, 6, 26
Node 22: 18, 8, 9, 24
Node 23: 10, 13, 12
Node 24: 22, 7, 17
Node 25: 18, 3
Node 26: 12, 16, 21, 7
Node 27: 19, 15, 7
Node 28: 20, 13, 9
Node 29: 5, 15, 1

Now, let's count the triangles based on the given edges and output the total number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [14]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 2, 18>
<0, 2, 10>
<0, 2, 12>
<2, 10, 12>
<3, 4, 15>
<3, 15, 27>
<3, 15, 29>
<4, 13, 15>
<8, 9, 22>
<8, 12, 26>
<8, 9, 28>
<9, 17, 22>
<12, 13, 23>
