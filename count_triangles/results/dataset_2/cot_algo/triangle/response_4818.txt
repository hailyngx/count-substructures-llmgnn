Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) from least to most. The sorted list of vertices with their degrees is as follows:

Node 12: degree 1
Node 5: degree 2
Node 10: degree 2
Node 11: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 6
Node 14: degree 6

Now, we will look at the edges starting from the vertices with lower degrees to count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (5, 9): Both nodes 5 and 9 have lower degrees (2 and 3), and they share a common neighbor 8, forming a triangle <5, 9, 8>.
2. Edge (5, 13): Both nodes 5 and 13 have lower degrees (2 and 4), and they share a common neighbor 1, forming a triangle <5, 13, 1>.
3. Edge (5, 8): Both nodes 5 and 8 have lower degrees (2 and 6), and they share a common neighbor 0, forming a triangle <5, 8, 0>.
4. Edge (9, 5): Skipped as per the method.
5. Edge (9, 8): Both nodes 9 and 8 have lower degrees (3 and 6), and they share a common neighbor 4, forming a triangle <9, 8, 4>.
6. Edge (9, 14): Both nodes 9 and 14 have lower degrees (3 and 6), and they share a common neighbor 7, forming a triangle <9, 14, 7>.

Based on the shared connections in these edges, the total number of triangles is [3]. The unique triangles found are <5, 9, 8>, <5, 13, 1>, and <5, 8, 0>.
