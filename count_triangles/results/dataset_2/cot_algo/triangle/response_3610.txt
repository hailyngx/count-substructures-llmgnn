Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (6, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 10) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 14) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: (4, 9), (4, 0), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 14), (7, 8), (5, 13), (5, 8), (5, 11), (6, 12), (2, 1), (2, 10), (2, 14), (2, 0), (8, 7), (8, 5), (8, 10), (8, 12), (13, 5), (13, 11), (13, 3), (13, 1), (13, 0), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 2), (0, 13), (0, 10), (9, 4), (9, 10), (9, 3), (10, 2), (10, 8), (10, 0), (10, 9), (10, 1), (10, 14), (3, 7), (3, 13), (3, 9), (3, 14), (3, 12), (1, 2), (1, 13), (1, 10), (1, 11), (1, 14), (11, 5), (11, 13), (11, 1), ...   
  
Sorting the nodes by their degree:

Nodes by degree: 6, 5, 4, 11, 12, 9, 1, 14, 3, 2, 10, 13, 0, 8, 7

Now, we will count the triangles:

Triangles: [14]

Unique triangles: <0, 2, 13>, <1, 10, 14>, <1, 11, 13>, <3, 7, 14>, <3, 9, 13>, <4, 9, 10>, <5, 8, 13>, <5, 11, 13>, <7, 8, 10>, <7, 8, 12>, <10, 2, 14>, <11, 12, 13>, <11, 1, 13>, <12, 8, 3>
