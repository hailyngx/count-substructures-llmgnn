Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges.

Response:
The graph has been constructed and the vertices have been relabeled based on the Degree-Based Ordering method. The edges are as follows:
(0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 18) (3, 0) (3, 20) (3, 21) (3, 23) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 17) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 21) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 20) (9, 21) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 19) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 16) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 16) (12, 21) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 21) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 18) (15, 18) (15, 20) (15, 23) (15, 26) (16, 10) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 22) (17, 4) (17, 20) (17, 22) (17, 26) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 26) (19, 10) (19, 16) (19, 21) (19, 26) (20, 3) (20, 9) (20, 15) (20, 17) (21, 3) (21, 6) (21, 9) (21, 12) (22, 16) (22, 17) (22, 23) (22, 28) (23, 3) (23, 15) (23, 22) (23, 29) (24, 25) (24, 26) (24, 27) (24, 29) (25, 24) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 29) (26, 15) (26, 18) (26, 19) (26, 24) (27, 24) (27, 25) (27, 28) (27, 29) (28, 22) (28, 27) (28, 29) (29, 23) (29, 24) (29, 25) (29, 27)

Based on this relabeling, the total number of triangles is [12].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <3, 9, 21>, <3, 15, 20>, <9, 11, 12>, <10, 16, 19>, <13, 14, 18>, <15, 18, 26>, <24, 25, 29>, <24, 26, 27>.
