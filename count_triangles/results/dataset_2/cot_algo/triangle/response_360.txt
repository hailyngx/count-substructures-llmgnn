Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 20) (3, 25) (3, 12) (3, 22) (3, 18) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 13) (25, 24) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 16) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 1) (28, 12) (28, 23) (29, 9) (29, 28) (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 1) (7, 10) (7, 0) (13, 25) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 24) (14, 8) (14, 1) (26, 10) (26, 21) (19, 22) (19, 2) (19, 23) (22, 3) (22, 19) (22, 27) (18, 3) (18, 8) (24, 25) (24, 13) (1, 25) (1, 28) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 4) (2, 15) (4, 2) (4, 23) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 13) (20, 9) (20, 27) (8, 14) (8, 18) (8, 27) (21, 0) (21, 26) (21, 27) (21, 23) (27, 22) (27, 20) (27, 8) (27, 21) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 23) (23, 28) (23, 19) (23, 4) (23, 21) (23, 15) (12, 3) (12, 28) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, relabel the vertices according to this order. Based on the given edges, the sorted nodes and their degrees are as follows:

Node 4: 2 edges  
Node 6: 0 edges  
Node 7: 3 edges  
Node 9: 3 edges  
Node 14: 2 edges  
Node 16: 3 edges  
Node 19: 4 edges  
Node 26: 2 edges  
Node 6: 0 edges  
Node 5: 3 edges  
Node 10: 3 edges  
Node 12: 2 edges  
Node 15: 3 edges  
Node 20: 2 edges  
Node 21: 4 edges  
Node 22: 3 edges  
Node 23: 5 edges  
Node 27: 4 edges  
Node 8: 3 edges  
Node 13: 4 edges  
Node 17: 3 edges  
Node 24: 3 edges  
Node 28: 4 edges  
Node 29: 3 edges  
Node 0: 4 edges  
Node 1: 6 edges  
Node 2: 4 edges  
Node 3: 4 edges  
Node 11: 4 edges  
Node 18: 2 edges  

Based on the relabeled nodes, the graph can be represented as follows using the Degree-Based Ordering method:  
Edges: (4, 23), (6, 6), (7, 12), (9, 10), (14, 3), (16, 27), (19, 23), (26, 2), (6, 0), (5, 7), (10, 8), (12, 23), (15, 24), (20, 15), (21, 25), (22, 28), (23, 29), (27, 11), (8, 17), (13, 22), (17, 26), (24, 18), (28, 0), (29, 1), (0, 2), (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 13), (11, 21), (18, 16)

After checking for shared connections between vertices of each edge, we find the following unique triangles:
[<5, 7, 12>, <5, 7, 13>, <5, 7, 10>, <10, 8, 17>, <10, 8, 26>, <10, 8, 12>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 28>, <1, 4, 23>, <1, 28, 23>]

Therefore, there are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph.
