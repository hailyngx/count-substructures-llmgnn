Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 5

Now, let's count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Triangles: [8]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>
