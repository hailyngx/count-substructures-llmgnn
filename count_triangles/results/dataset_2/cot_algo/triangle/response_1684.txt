Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 3) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 7) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 11) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 12) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: {(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 2), (5, 3), (9, 11), (9, 10), (9, 1), (9, 12), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 10), (4, 11), (7, 12), (7, 0), (7, 14), (7, 13), (6, 1), (6, 12), (10, 8), (11, 3), (8, 2), (13, 6)}

Now, let's label the nodes by their degrees in ascending order:
Node degrees: [(0, 4), (14, 4), (8, 4), (3, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (12, 4), (11, 4), (13, 4), (6, 5), (10, 5), (7, 5), (9, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Start counting the triangles:
   - For edge (5, 9): Node 5 and Node 9 share the neighbor 13 forming a triangle <5, 9, 13>.
   - For edge (5, 6): No triangles are formed.
   - For edge (5, 13): No triangles are formed.
   - For edge (5, 2): No triangles are formed.
   - For edge (5, 3): No triangles are formed.
   - For edge (9, 11): No triangles are formed.
   - For edge (9, 10): No triangles are formed.
   - For edge (9, 1): No triangles are formed.
   - For edge (9, 12): No triangles are formed.
   - For edge (4, 8): No triangles are formed.
   - For other edges, no triangles are formed.

2. Calculate the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles:
   [Total number of triangles: 1]
   Unique triangles: <5, 9, 13>
