Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 13) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 13) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method steps here are:

1. Calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 6
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 5
- Node 13: degree 6
- Node 14: degree 3

2. Sort nodes by degree in ascending order:
Nodes: 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, 14, 0, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 2, 5, 13

3. Relabel nodes from 0 to 14 based on sorted order.

New edge list after relabeling:
(2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (9, 12) (5, 0) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 2) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (0, 13) (0, 6) (10, 7) (8, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 5) (11, 13)

Now, let's count the triangles:
Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles:
<2, 4, 8>
<1, 2, 13>
<1, 2, 10>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 5, 11>
<5, 11, 13>
