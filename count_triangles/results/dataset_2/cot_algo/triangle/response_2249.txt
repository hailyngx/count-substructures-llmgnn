Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Node 5 with degree 4
Node 9 with degree 3
Node 4 with degree 3
Node 8 with degree 3
Node 6 with degree 6
Node 2 with degree 5
Node 0 with degree 4
Node 7 with degree 3
Node 1 with degree 5
Node 3 with degree 4

Calculating the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge between nodes (5, 8):
   Node 5 (degree 4) < Node 8 (degree 3) => Proceed
   Shared connections: 1, 4
   Triangle <1, 4, 5>

2. Edge between nodes (5, 1):
   Node 5 (degree 4) < Node 1 (degree 5) => Proceed
   Shared connections: 6
   Triangle <5, 6, 1>

3. Edge between nodes (5, 4):
   Node 5 (degree 4) < Node 4 (degree 3) => Proceed
   Shared connections: 0
   Triangle <0, 4, 5>

4. Edge between nodes (5, 0):
   Node 0 (degree 4) < Node 5 (degree 4) => Proceed
   Shared connections: 4
   Triangle <4, 5, 0>

5. Edge between nodes (9, 6):
   Node 6 (degree 6) < Node 9 (degree 3) => Proceed
   Shared connections: 0
   Triangle <0, 6, 9>

6. Edge between nodes (9, 2):
   Node 9 (degree 3) < Node 2 (degree 5) => Proceed
   Shared connections: 1
   Triangle <1, 2, 9>

7. Edge between nodes (9, 0):
   Node 0 (degree 4) < Node 9 (degree 3) => Proceed
   Shared connections: No shared connections, no triangle formed.

8. Edge between nodes (6, 9):
   Node 6 (degree 6) > Node 9 (degree 3) => No need to proceed.

9. Edge between nodes (6, 1):
   Node 6 (degree 6) < Node 1 (degree 5) => Proceed
   Shared connections: 5
   Triangle <5, 6, 1>

10. Continuing with the remaining edges...

There are multiple triangles in the graph, and the total number of triangles is [6].
