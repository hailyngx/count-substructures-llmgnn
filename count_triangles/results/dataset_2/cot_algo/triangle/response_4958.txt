Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be visually represented as follows:
```
   1 --- 2
   |  /  | \
   | /   |  \
   4 --- 3   8
   |  \  |  /|
   |   \ | / |
   7 --- 0 --- 9
        / \   
       6  5
```

Now, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices: 2, 5, 6, 4, 1, 9, 7, 3, 8, 0

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:
1. (5, 9): No triangle formed
2. (5, 6): No triangle formed
3. (5, 3): No triangle formed
4. (5, 7): Triangle <5, 0, 7> formed
5. (9, 5): No triangle formed
6. (9, 6): Triangle <9, 5, 6> formed
7. (9, 7): No triangle formed
8. (6, 5): No triangle formed
9. (6, 9): No triangle formed
10. (6, 0): Triangle <6, 0, 7> formed
11. (4, 8): No triangle formed
12. (4, 1): No triangle formed
13. (4, 3): Triangle <4, 0, 3> formed
14. (7, 5): Triangle <7, 0, 5> formed
15. (7, 9): Triangle <7, 0, 9> formed
16. (7, 0): No triangle formed
17. (7, 3): Triangle <7, 0, 3> formed
18. (7, 1): No triangle formed
19. (8, 4): No triangle formed
20. (8, 2): No triangle formed
21. (8, 0): No triangle formed
22. (8, 3): Triangle <8, 0, 3> formed
23. (8, 1): No triangle formed
24. (2, 8): No triangle formed
25. (2, 1): No triangle formed
26. (2, 3): Triangle <2, 0, 3> formed
27. (2, 0): Triangle <2, 0, 8> formed
28. (0, 6): Triangle <0, 5, 6> formed
29. (0, 7): Triangle <0, 5, 7>, <0, 7, 9> formed
30. (0, 8): Triangle <0, 8, 3> formed
31. (0, 2): Triangle <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 8> formed
32. (1, 4): No triangle formed
33. (1, 7): No triangle formed
34. (1, 8): No triangle formed
35. (1, 2): No triangle formed
36. (3, 5): No triangle formed
37. (3, 4): Triangle <3, 0, 4> formed
38. (3, 7): Triangle <3, 0, 7> formed
39. (3, 8): Triangle <3, 0, 8> formed
40. (3, 2): Triangle <3, 0, 2> formed
