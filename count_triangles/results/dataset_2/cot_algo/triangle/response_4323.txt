Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 0), (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 0), (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 2), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 6), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 8), (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 8), (6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 7), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 2), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 0), (2, 8), (8, 5), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 2)

Now, let's list the nodes according to their degrees from lowest to highest:
Nodes: 3, 6, 9, 1, 8, 7, 5, 0, 4, 2

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

Triangles:
[12]
<5, 2, 4>, <2, 0, 4>, <3, 1, 4>, <1, 8, 2>, <4, 2, 0>, <8, 2, 5>, <6, 9, 0>, <7, 5, 4>, <6, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 0>, <7, 6, 3>, <1, 3, 2>
