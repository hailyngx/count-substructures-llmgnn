Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 10
Edges: 40

```
0 -- 9, 4, 7, 3, 2
1 -- 5, 7, 3, 2, 8
2 -- 5, 1, 8, 0
3 -- 4, 7, 1, 6, 0
4 -- 7, 0, 6, 3
5 -- 9, 6, 2, 1
6 -- 5, 4, 3
7 -- 4, 0, 3, 1
8 -- 9, 1, 2
9 -- 5, 8, 0
```

Next, using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Relabeling the vertices in ascending order of their degree: 0, 9, 8, 4, 1, 3, 7, 5, 6, 2

Now we will count the triangles by checking shared neighbors between vertices connected by an edge:

For each edge, check if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
