Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 12) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 19) (10, 9) (17, 18) (17, 4) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 17) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 19) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (5, 1) (5, 19) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 4) (19, 1) (19, 0) (19, 5) (8, 15) (8, 12) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 4) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (7, 6) (7, 11) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 8) (4, 17) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method goes as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by the number of connections:
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 15 has 5 connections.
Node 1 has 5 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 3 connections.
Node 17 has 2 connections.
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 18 has 2 connections.
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 14 has 5 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 13 has 3 connections.
Node 19 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 10 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 12 has 4 connections.
Node 16 has 4 connections.
Node 11 has 5 connections.

2. Relabel the nodes based on their sorted order (from least to most connections):
0 → 17, 2, 8, 10
1 → 3, 14, 5, 13, 19
2 → 6, 7, 18, 16, 12
3 → 15, 1, 9, 11, 4

3. Proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (3, 1): Node 3 > Node 1
- Edge (15, 3): Node 15 > Node 3
- Edge (15, 6): Node 15 > Node 6
- Edge (6, 9): Node 6 < Node 9 -> Shared connection: Node 14
- Edge (6, 7): Node 6 < Node 7 -> Shared connection: Node 11
- Edge (1, 14): Node 1 < Node 14 -> Shared connection: Node 9
- Edge (10, 9): Node 10 < Node 9 -> Shared connection: Node 14
- Edge (17, 18): Node 17 < Node 18 -> Shared connection: None
- Edge (2, 16): Node 2 < Node 16 -> Shared connection: None
- Edge (0, 14): Node 0 < Node 14 -> Shared connection: Node 1
- Edge (5, 1): Node 5 < Node 1 -> Shared connection: Node 19
- Edge (13, 12): Node 13 < Node 12 -> Shared connection: Node 16
- Edge (19, 0): Node 19 > Node 0
- Edge (8, 15): Node 8 < Node 15 -> Shared connection: None
- Edge (16, 2): Node 16 > Node 2
- Edge (11, 1): Node 11 < Node 1 -> Shared connection: Node 14
- Edge (7, 6): Node 7 < Node 6 -> Shared connection: Node 11
- Edge (4, 13): Node 4 < Node 13 -> Shared connection: None

The total number of triangles is [5].
The unique triangles found are: <1, 14, 9>, <1, 5, 19>, <1, 11, 14>, <6, 9, 14>, <6, 7, 11>.
