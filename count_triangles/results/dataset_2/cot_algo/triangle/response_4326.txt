Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 20) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 14) (22, 27) (22, 12) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 8) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 16) (17, 29) (17, 27) (4, 28) (7, 8) (10, 18) (11, 0) (11, 29) (11, 20) (6, 3) (6, 23) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 23) (8, 21) (23, 13) (23, 6) (23, 8) (23, 25) (23, 16) (29, 17) (29, 11) (29, 1) (29, 27) (1, 29) (1, 16) (1, 12) (26, 19) (26, 0) (19, 26) (19, 15) (19, 21) (19, 20) (19, 16) (16, 14) (16, 23) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 28) (28, 4) (28, 16) (3, 6) (3, 27) (21, 8) (21, 19) (21, 15) (25, 23) (25, 24) (15, 19) (15, 21) (27, 22) (27, 17) (27, 29) (27, 3) (27, 18) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 27) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 24) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 0) (0, 11) (0, 26) (0, 24) (2, 13) (2, 14) (20, 13) (20, 5) (20, 11) (20, 19) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first.

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
- 0: {11, 24, 26}
- 1: {12, 16, 29}
- 2: {13, 14}
- 3: {6, 27}
- 4: {28}
- 5: {9, 18, 20}
- 6: {3, 23}
- 7: {8}
- 8: {7, 9, 21, 23}
- 9: {5, 8}
- 10: {18}
- 11: {0, 20, 29}
- 12: {1, 14, 22, 24}
- 13: {2, 20, 22, 23}
- 14: {2, 12, 16, 22}
- 15: {19, 21}
- 16: {1, 14, 19, 28}
- 17: {27, 29}
- 18: {5, 10, 27}
- 19: {16, 19, 20, 21, 26}
- 20: {5, 11, 13, 19}
- 21: {8, 15, 19}
- 22: {12, 13, 14, 27}
- 23: {6, 8, 13, 16, 25}
- 24: {0, 12, 25}
- 25: {23, 24}
- 26: {19}
- 27: {17, 18, 22, 29}
- 28: {4, 16}
- 29: {1, 11, 17, 27}

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

Nodes in increasing order of degree:
0, 4, 10, 15, 26, 7, 3, 6, 2, 9, 21, 5, 24, 10, 11, 14, 25, 1, 16, 17, 18, 19, 8, 12, 13, 22, 27, 28, 29

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Total number of triangles: [66]

Unique triangles found:

<0, 24, 25>
