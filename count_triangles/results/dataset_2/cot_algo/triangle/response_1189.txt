Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (1, 12) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 13) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. The graph with nodes and edges provided can be represented as follows:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 11), (5, 14), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 10), (9, 12), (4, 7), (4, 0), (7, 6), (7, 13), (6, 0), (10, 3), (10, 8), (11, 0), (11, 13), (1, 12), (3, 13), (3, 12), (2, 8), (8, 14)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
1(1), 2(1), 3(2), 8(2), 0(3), 1(3), 6(3), 7(3), 4(3), 9(4), 10(4), 11(4), 13(4), 12(5), 14(5)

Next, we will go through the edges considering the lower labeled vertex:
- (2, 8) does not form a triangle.
- (6, 9) forms a triangle with node 5.
- (6, 9) does not form a triangle.
- (6, 4) does not form a triangle.
- (6, 7) forms a triangle with node 0.
- (0, 1) does not form a triangle.
- (1, 4) does not form a triangle.
- (1, 3) does not form a triangle.
- (1, 3) forms a triangle with node 13.
- (1, 8) does not form a triangle.
- (6, 13) does not form a triangle.
- (6, 12) forms a triangle with node 4.
- (7, 12) does not form a triangle.
- (8, 14) does not form a triangle.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 3, 13>
