Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:
Edges:
(6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) 
(9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) 
(1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) 
(3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) 
(4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
(7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) 
(8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) 
(2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) 
(5, 7) (5, 8) 
(0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4)

Next, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles. 

The vertices with their corresponding degrees are:
0: degree 5
1: degree 4
3: degree 3
4: degree 5
5: degree 2
6: degree 5
7: degree 4
8: degree 6
9: degree 4
So, we relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
5: 0
3: 1
7: 2
1: 3
9: 4
0: 5
4: 6
6: 7
8: 8
2: 9

Now, we will count the triangles:
[The total number of triangles is: 18]
Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 7, 2>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 7, 5>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 8, 5>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 8, 6>
