Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 17) (2, 11) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 0) (29, 21) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 26) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 0) (25, 4) (25, 22) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 16) (9, 6) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 27) (10, 4) (11, 2) (11, 10) (11, 23) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 0) (8, 27) (13, 20) (13, 23) (20, 13) (20, 5) (17, 2) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 24) (17, 19) (22, 25) (22, 19) (22, 14) (1, 17) (1, 23) (4, 25) (4, 10) (4, 27) (27, 10) (27, 8) (27, 4) (27, 7) (27, 26) (18, 26) (18, 24) (26, 3) (26, 27) (26, 18) (26, 28) (21, 29) (21, 8) (21, 24) (28, 26) (28, 12) (28, 14) (28, 24) (23, 25) (23, 11) (23, 13) (23, 1) (23, 12) (0, 29) (0, 25) (0, 8) (16, 6) (19, 17) (19, 22) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 12) (5, 8) (5, 20) (7, 27) (12, 28) (12, 23) (12, 14) (24, 17) (24, 18) (24, 21) (24, 28) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's construct a graph with nodes and their connections:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(2, 29), (2, 17), (2, 11), (29, 17), (29, 0), (29, 21), 
(3, 25), (3, 10), (3, 26), (25, 23), (25, 0), (25, 4), (25, 22), 
(6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 16), (9, 10), 
(10, 11), (10, 27), (10, 4), 
(11, 23), 
(8, 5), (8, 21), (8, 0), (8, 27), 
(13, 20), (13, 23), 
(20, 5), 
(17, 29), (17, 1), (17, 24), (17, 19), 
(22, 25), (22, 19), (22, 14), 
(1, 23), 
(4, 27), 
(27, 8), (27, 7), (27, 26), 
(18, 26), (18, 24), 
(26, 28), 
(21, 24), (21, 8), 
(28, 14), (28, 12), 
(23, 13), (23, 1), (23, 12), 
(0, 8), (0, 25), 
(16, 6), 
(19, 22), 
(14, 12), (14, 22), 
(5, 20), 
(12, 24)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes by degree: 
(16: 1), (17: 4), 
(1: 4), (11: 4), (20: 2), (5: 3), (7: 1), (2: 3), (9: 2), (13: 2), (19: 2), (21: 3), (3: 3), (0: 3), (6: 3), (12: 3), (4: 3), (10: 4), (8: 4), (22: 3), (23: 5), (24: 4), (14: 3), (18: 2), (28: 3), (25: 4), (26: 4), (27: 5), (29: 4)

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will count the number of triangles by checking shared connections between edges with the lower labeled vertex.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [15].

Unique triangles found:
<4, 10, 27>, <4, 10, 26>, <4, 10, 11>, <3, 10, 27>, <3, 10, 26>, <3, 25, 0>, <3, 25, 4>, <3, 25, 22>, <8, 0, 25>, <8, 0, 29>, <8, 21, 29>, <12, 14, 22>, <12, 14, 28>, <12, 14, 23>, <17, 19, 22>
