Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 7) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 5) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 7) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. Then, we relabel the vertices based on their sorted order. 

Sorted vertices with their respective connections:
```
6: 3
9: 3
10: 4
11: 4
8: 5
13: 6
4: 2
0: 4
14: 5
3: 4
12: 4
1: 4
5: 4
2: 5
7: 4
```

Following the method, we will look at each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. We will then count the number of triangles by finding shared connections.

Proceeding with the given edges, we identify the triangles:

Triangles:
- <1, 2, 10>
- <1, 2, 11>
- <1, 5, 11>
- <1, 5, 2>
- <2, 3, 13>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <2, 3, 12>
- <2, 3, 0>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <3, 7, 13>
- <3, 7, 12>
- <5, 1, 11>
- <5, 1, 6>
- <8, 4, 14>
- <8, 4, 7>
- <8, 4, 13>
- <8, 4, 12>
- <8, 7, 14>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <10, 1, 11>
- <10, 1, 6>
- <10, 1, 5>
- <10, 12, 13>
- <11, 1, 6>
- <11, 1, 5>
- <12, 3, 7>
- <12, 3, 13>
- <13, 2, 7>
- <13, 2, 8>
- <14, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [29].
