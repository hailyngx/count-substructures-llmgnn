Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 1) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 11) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 1) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 12) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on the number of connections they have in ascending order is: (3, 2, 8, 9, 10, 13, 7, 11, 12, 1, 5, 14, 0, 6, 4).

Next, we will go through the edges in the order provided and count the triangles:

1. (4, 7): No triangles formed.
2. (4, 12): No triangles formed.
3. (4, 1): No triangles formed.
4. (4, 6): Triangle <1, 6, 4>.
5. (4, 3): Triangle <3, 4, 5>.
6. (7, 4): No triangles formed.

8. (7, 3): No triangles formed.
9. (7, 1): No triangles formed.
10. (6, 4): Triangle <1, 6, 4>.
11. (6, 9): No triangles formed.
12. (6, 14): No triangles formed.
13. (6, 10): No triangles formed.
