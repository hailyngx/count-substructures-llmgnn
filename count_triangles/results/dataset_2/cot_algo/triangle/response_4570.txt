Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 15) (16, 6) (4, 18) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 17) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 1) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 14) (8, 10) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (5, 17) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 17) (19, 3) (19, 12) (15, 16) (15, 18) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 19) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 0) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 5) (17, 18) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 1) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method is as follows:

Node 5 has degree 1,
Node 11 has degree 1,
Node 4 has degree 2,
Node 10 has degree 2,
Node 7 has degree 2,
Node 19 has degree 2,
Node 5 has degree 1,
Node 8 has degree 2,
Node 9 has degree 3,
Node 12 has degree 3,
Node 18 has degree 4,
Node 0 has degree 4,
Node 1 has degree 4,
Node 15 has degree 3,
Node 16 has degree 5,
Node 6 has degree 4,
Node 14 has degree 3,
Node 17 has degree 5,
Node 13 has degree 4,
Node 3 has degree 6,
Node 2 has degree 4.

Since the lower-label vertex of an edge needs to have fewer connections, we will only consider the following edges:
(11, 16) (16, 3) (4, 18) (7, 3) (6, 16) (2, 12) (9, 18) (10, 0) (8, 10) (13, 8) (12, 13) (5, 17) (2, 6) (18, 17) (19, 3) (15, 18) (0, 4) (3, 0) (17, 11) (1, 9) (14, 2).

The shared connections that form triangles are as follows:
<6, 16, 3>
<12, 13, 2>
<18, 17, 3>
<18, 4, 0>
<18, 4, 10>
<10, 0, 3>
<17, 18, 3>
<2, 12, 13>
<2, 1, 9>
<2, 1, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9]. 
The unique triangles found are <6, 16, 3>, <12, 13, 2>, <18, 17, 3>, <18, 4, 0>, <18, 4, 10>, <10, 0, 3>, <17, 18, 3>, <2, 12, 13>, and <2, 1, 9>.
