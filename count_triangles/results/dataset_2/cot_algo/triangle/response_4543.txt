Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. Then we relabel the vertices accordingly:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 16: degree 0
Nodes 6, 10, 21: degree 1
Nodes 12, 13, 18, 20, 22, 29: degree 2
Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 14, 15, 19, 24, 26: degree 3
Nodes 4, 5, 11, 17, 27: degree 4
Nodes 8, 23, 25, 28: degree 5
