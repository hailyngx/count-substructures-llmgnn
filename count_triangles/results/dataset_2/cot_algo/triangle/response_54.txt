Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 9) (3, 11) (3, 10) (15, 1) (15, 17) (14, 0) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 5) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (9, 16) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 19) (9, 12) (18, 19) (19, 2) (19, 9) (19, 18) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 5) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 13) (7, 17) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (6, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (4, 16) (4, 2) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: 
- 0: {14, 5, 13}
- 1: {15, 5, 10, 13}
- 2: {16, 17, 19, 4}
- 3: {11, 10}
- 4: {16, 2}
- 5: {0, 8, 1, 10}
- 6: {7}
- 7: {17, 9, 13, 6}
- 8: {11, 9, 5}
- 9: {16, 8, 7, 19, 12}
- 10: {3, 1, 5}
- 11: {16, 3, 8}
- 12: {16, 9, 13}
- 13: {0, 1, 12, 7}
- 14: {0}
- 15: {1, 17}
- 16: {11, 12, 2, 4, 9}
- 17: {15, 2, 7}
- 18: {19}
- 19: {2, 9, 18}

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph.

Sorted Nodes by Degree:
{18, 14, 6, 15, 3, 4, 12, 0, 10, 7, 17, 13, 1, 5, 8, 11, 16, 19, 9, 2}

Triangles:
[41]
<0, 13, 7> <0, 13, 12> <0, 13, 1> <0, 13, 5> <1, 13, 12> <1, 13, 7> <1, 13, 5> <1, 13, 10> <2, 16, 12> <2, 16, 9> <2, 16, 4> <2, 16, 17> <2, 16, 11> <2, 16, 14> <2, 16, 5> <2, 16, 19> <3, 11, 8> <3, 11, 16> <3, 11, 10> <4, 2, 16> <4, 2, 19> <4, ...
