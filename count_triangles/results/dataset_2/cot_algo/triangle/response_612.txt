Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 5) (16, 15) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 19) (4, 2) (4, 10) (0, 18) (0, 5) (10, 4) (10, 18) (18, 0) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 1) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 18) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 6) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 15) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 19) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has:

Node 16: degree 1
Node 12: degree 1
Node 17: degree 1
Node 0: degree 2
Node 10: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 18: degree 3
Node 15: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 13: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 19: degree 5
Node 11: degree 5
Node 14: degree 6

Now, we will check the edges while ensuring that we only count triangles once:

Total number of triangles: [22]
Unique triangles:
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 19>
<1, 7, 14>
<1, 7, 19>
<2, 4, 10>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 13>
<2, 8, 13>
<3, 11, 14>
<3, 14, 19>
<5, 0, 18>
<5, 11, 14>
<6, 8, 13>
<6, 15, 19>
<8, 13, 14>
<9, 11, 18>
<9, 12, 18>
<10, 4, 18>
<13, 7, 14>
<16, 15, 19>
<17, 14, 13>
