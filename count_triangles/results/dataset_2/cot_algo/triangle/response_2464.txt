Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given edges and nodes and sort the vertices by their degree:

Vertices sorted by degree:
0: degree 5
1: degree 5
2: degree 5
3: degree 5
4: degree 5
7: degree 5
6: degree 3
8: degree 3
9: degree 4
5: degree 2

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [19]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 1>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 2>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 2>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 2, 7>, <2, 4, 8>
