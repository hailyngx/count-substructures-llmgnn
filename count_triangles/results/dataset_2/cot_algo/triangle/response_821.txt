Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (5), (3)
- 1: (7), (3), (6)
- 2: (5), (8), (6)
- 3: (5), (4), (1), (0), (8)
- 4: (9), (3), (6)
- 5: (9), (2), (8), (0), (3), (7)
- 6: (4), (7), (1), (2), (8)
- 7: (5), (9), (6), (1)
- 8: (5), (9), (3), (2), (6)
- 9: (5), (9), (4), (7), (8)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on the least to most number of connections:
Nodes by degree: 0(2), 1(3), 2(3), 4(3), 7(4), 8(5), 6(5), 3(5), 5(6), 9(5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (0, 3):
- Node 0 is lower in label and has 2 connections.
- Check for shared connections: (3, 5), (3, 8)
- Triangle formed: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>

2. Edge (1, 3):
- Node 1 is lower in label and has 3 connections.
- Check for shared connections: (3, 5), (3, 7)
- Triangle formed: <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 7>

3. Edge (2, 5):
- Node 2 is lower in label and has 3 connections.
- Check for shared connections: (5, 8)
- Triangle formed: <2, 5, 8>

4. Edge (3, 5):
- Node 3 is lower in label and has 5 connections.
- Check for shared connections: (5, 8)
- Triangle formed: <3, 5, 8>

5. Edge (4, 6):
- Node 4 is lower in label and has 3 connections.
- Check for shared connections: (6, 7)
- Triangle formed: <4, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [5]
Triangles: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 8>
