Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (4, 8), (4, 3), (4, 1), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 7), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 0), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 0), (2, 9), (2, 7), (1, 9), (3, 9), (7, 9), (0, 9)

Next, we need to sort the vertices based on their connections:

0 - 4 connections
1 - 4 connections
3 - 4 connections
6 - 4 connections
7 - 4 connections
5 - 5 connections
8 - 5 connections
4 - 6 connections
2 - 7 connections
9 - 7 connections

Now, let's count the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (4, 8):
   - Shared connections: 2
   - Triangle: <4, 8, 2>

2. Edge (4, 3):
   - No shared connections

3. Edge (4, 1):
   - No shared connections

4. Edge (8, 2):
   - No shared connections

5. Edge (8, 1):
   - Shared connections: 2
   - Triangle: <8, 1, 2>

6. Edge (8, 7):
   - No shared connections

7. Edge (5, 6):
   - No shared connections

8. Edge (5, 2):
   - Shared connections: 0
   - Triangle: <5, 2, 0>

9. Edge (5, 0):
   - No shared connections

10. Edge (5, 3):
   - No shared connections

11. Edge (6, 2):
   - Shared connections: 0
   - Triangle: <6, 2, 0>

12. Edge (6, 0):
   - No shared connections

13. Edge (2, 9):
   - Shared connections: 1
   - Triangle: <2, 9, 1>

14. Edge (2, 7):
   - No shared connections

15. Edge (1, 9):
   - No shared connections

16. Edge (3, 9):
   - No shared connections

17. Edge (7, 9):
   - No shared connections

18. Edge (0, 9):
   - No shared connections

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: <4, 8, 2>, <8, 1, 2>, <5, 2, 0>, <6, 2, 0>, <2, 9, 1>
