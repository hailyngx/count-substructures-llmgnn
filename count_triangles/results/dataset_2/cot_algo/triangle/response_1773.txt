Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 14) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 5) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (10, 19) (10, 14) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 18) (17, 11) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 11) (6, 13) (2, 16) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 12) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 5) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 6) (13, 16) (0, 2) (0, 18) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 13) (16, 9) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (9, 16) (9, 14) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 12) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 18) 

Response:
The given graph has the following edges:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 16
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 13, and 15
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 16
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 11, and 19
- Node 6 is connected to node 13
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 17, and 19
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 12
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 14 and 16
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 14 and 19
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 11, 14, and 17
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 8, 14, and 18
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 16, and 17
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 10, 11, 12, and 15
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 3 and 14
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 9, and 13
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 7, 11, 13, and 18
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 0, 12, and 17
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 10

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, sorting the nodes by the number of connections from least to most, we get the following order:
0 < 6 < 2 < 9 < 18 < 10 < 12 < 15 < 16 < 19 < 8 < 13 < 0 < 6 < 2 < 9 < 18 < 10 < 12 < 15 < 16 < 19 < 8 < 13 < 1 < 4 < 11 < 5 < 7 < 3 < 17 < 14

Considering each edge with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections, we can find the triangles in the graph:

[The total number of triangles in the graph is 8]

<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 16>
<3, 8, 12>
<3, 13, 16>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 11, 17>
<10, 14, 19>
