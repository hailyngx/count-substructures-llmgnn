Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
The given graph with nodes and edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (5, 2), (5, 7), (6, 0), (8, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 7)
- 1: (6, 1), (2, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 4)
- 2: (5, 2), (2, 8), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (8, 2), (8, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2)
- 3: (5, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3), (3, 5), (3, 2)
- 4: (6, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (4, 6)
- 5: (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7), (0, 5), (7, 5)
- 6: (6, 1), (6, 4), (0, 6), (1, 6), (4, 6)
- 7: (5, 7), (8, 7), (0, 7), (7, 5), (7, 8), (7, 0), (7, 9), (9, 7)
- 8: (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 7), (8, 3), (8, 1), (0, 8), (7, 8), (3, 8), (1, 8)
- 9: (7, 9), (9, 3), (9, 1), (1, 9), (3, 9)

Now, we will perform the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph.

Degree-Based Ordering:
Node 4: Degree = 1
Node 9: Degree = 2
Node 6: Degree = 2
Node 0: Degree = 4
Node 7: Degree = 5
Node 1: Degree = 5
Node 3: Degree = 5
Node 2: Degree = 6
Node 8: Degree = 6
Node 5: Degree = 6

Now, we iterate through the edges and count the triangles:
- Node 4: No triangles possible with degree 1.
- Node 9: No triangles possible with degree 2.
- Node 6: No triangles possible with degree 2.
- Node 0: No triangles possible with degree 4.
- Node 7: No triangles possible with degree 5.
- Node 1: Triangles found: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 8, 9>
- Node 3: Triangles found: <3, 5, 7>, <3, 2, 8>
- Node 2: Triangles found: <2, 1, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 6>
- Node 8: Triangles found: <8, 1, 9>, <8, 2, 3>
- Node 5: Triangles found: <5, 0, 7>, <5, 2, 3>

Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles found: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 2, 8>, <2, 1, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 6>
