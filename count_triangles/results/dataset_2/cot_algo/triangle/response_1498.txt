Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. After relabeling the vertices, we can then count the triangles in the graph. 

The vertices with their connections are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 4

Following the degree-based ordering and relabeling:
- Node 6: 0
- Node 0: 1
- Node 3: 2
- Node 5: 3
- Node 4: 4
- Node 7: 5
- Node 9: 6
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 8
- Node 8: 9

Now we will count the triangles:
1. (6, 0, 3)
2. (0, 3, 2)

There are 2 triangles in total [].
The unique triangles found are:
- <6, 0, 3>
- <0, 3, 2>
