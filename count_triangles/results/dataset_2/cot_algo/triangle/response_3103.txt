Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 13) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 19) (1, 3) (1, 18) (12, 14) (18, 4) (18, 1) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 17) (2, 16) (2, 5) (2, 14) (8, 9) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 6) (9, 15) (9, 18) (9, 8) (9, 0) (13, 15) (13, 17) (0, 11) (0, 17) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 18) (10, 5) (10, 0) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 19) (14, 16) (14, 12) (14, 2) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degrees is as follows: 
Nodes: [8, 12, 13, 11, 1, 3, 12, 18, 5, 10, 2, 6, 7, 14, 16, 19, 4, 0, 15, 9]
  
Based on the provided edges and the sorted list of nodes, the triangles found in the graph are as follows:
[<7, 4, 18>, <11, 0, 17>, <3, 1, 18>, <15, 9, 0>, <16, 7, 4>, <16, 2, 5>, <6, 15, 17>, <6, 19, 5>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
