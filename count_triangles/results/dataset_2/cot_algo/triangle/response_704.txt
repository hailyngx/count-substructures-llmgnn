Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 18) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 16) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 17) (0, 5) (0, 16) (14, 4) (14, 16) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 11) (4, 14) (4, 16) (4, 17) (18, 13) (18, 6) (18, 15) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 10) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 4) (17, 1) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 1) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 14) (16, 4) (11, 5) (11, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 19) (19, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Let's write down the nodes and their degrees first:

Node 0: 2
Node 1: 4
Node 2: 4
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 4
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 2
Node 8: 3
Node 9: 2
Node 10: 3
Node 11: 2
Node 12: 2
Node 13: 4
Node 14: 2
Node 15: 3
Node 16: 4
Node 17: 4
Node 18: 4
Node 19: 1

With the nodes sorted by their degrees in ascending order, we can start counting the triangles based on the connections. Since the node with the lower label should have fewer connections, we will only consider edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections.

After examining the edges with this rule in mind, we find that the total number of triangles inside brackets [] is 16.

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 4, 17>
<1, 12, 17>
<1, 15, 17>
<2, 8, 13>
<2, 13, 17>
<2, 4, 17>
<3, 9, 19>
<4, 14, 16>
<6, 1, 17>
<6, 4, 17>
<6, 15, 17>
<7, 10, 1>
<8, 3, 10>
<8, 13, 2>
<10, 1, 17>
<15, 1, 17>
