Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 3) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 1) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 1) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 0) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 4) 

Response:
Let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 6

Now, we will consider the edges in the order specified in the input, but only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Then, we will search for shared connections to form triangles.

We count the total number of triangles and list them:
Total number of triangles: [10]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 11>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 13>, <1, 13, 0>, <2, 6, 3>, <2, 6, 14>, <3, 8, 11>, <4, 10, 12>, <6, 14, 8>
