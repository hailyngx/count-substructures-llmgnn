Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 7) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 0) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 14) (15, 19) (15, 2) (7, 18) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 8) (16, 17) (16, 7) (16, 12) (12, 16) (9, 14) (9, 19) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 0) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 3) (13, 0) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 2) (11, 4) (11, 6) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in efficiently counting the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, let's label the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 2
Node 12: degree 1
Node 13: degree 1
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 2
Node 16: degree 3
Node 17: degree 3
Node 18: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle <4, 11, 6>
- Triangle <4, 6, 8>
- Triangle <4, 5, 1>
- Triangle <4, 18, 7>
- Triangle <18, 4, 3>
- Triangle <18, 7, 16>
- Triangle <18, 5, 1>
- Triangle <5, 1, 7>
- Triangle <1, 7, 16>
- Triangle <7, 16, 12>
- Triangle <10, 1, 5>
- Triangle <10, 1, 7>
- Triangle <10, 19, 15>
- Triangle <14, 10, 1>
- Triangle <14, 10, 19>
- Triangle <14, 3, 9>
- Triangle <19, 10, 14>
- Triangle <19, 10, 1>
- Triangle <19, 9, 14>
- Triangle <6, 17, 16>
- Triangle <6, 17, 0>
- Triangle <17, 0, 2>
- Triangle <16, 7, 18>
- Triangle <16, 7, 8>
- Triangle <16, 12, 7>
- Triangle <17, 0, 13>
- Triangle <2, 6, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [26].
