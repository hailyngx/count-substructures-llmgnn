Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 14) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 9) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 13) (6, 2) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 12) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 9) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 
```
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 0 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 3
Node 11 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 4
Node 12 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 5
Node 13 has degree 5
Node 8 has degree 5
Node 10 has degree 5
Node 4 has degree 6
Node 14 has degree 6
```

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. 

Looking at the provided edges, the triangles formed based on shared connections are: 
1. <2, 13, 5>
2. <2, 13, 3>
3. <2, 13, 14>
4. <4, 10, 2>
5. <4, 10, 6>
6. <4, 10, 9>
7. <4, 10, 0>
8. <4, 10, 6>
9. <4, 1, 14>
10. <5, 14, 1>
11. <5, 14, 13>
12. <6, 10, 2>
13. <6, 10, 14>
14. <6, 10, 12>
15. <8, 11, 13>
16. <8, 11, 13>
17. <11, 13, 3>
18. <12, 14, 8>
19. <12, 14, 6>
20. <12, 14, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
