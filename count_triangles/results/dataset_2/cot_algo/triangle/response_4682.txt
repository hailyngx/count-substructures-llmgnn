Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 9) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 12) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 10) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 0)
