Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7)
(1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 7)
(2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6)
(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 9)
(4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9)
(5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 8)
(6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 8)
(7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 9)
(8, 5), (8, 6)
(9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 7)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
0 (degree 4), 8 (degree 2), 2 (degree 4), 5 (degree 4), 7 (degree 4), 1 (degree 4), 9 (degree 3), 3 (degree 5), 6 (degree 4), 4 (degree 5)

Now, we will count the triangles using the provided method. 

The number of triangles in the graph is [7].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
