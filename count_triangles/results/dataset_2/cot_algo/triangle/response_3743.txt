Edges: 
(0, 25), (0, 23), (1, 14), (1, 10), (1, 3), (1, 13), (2, 23), (2, 13), (3, 1), (3, 23), (3, 22), (3, 4), (4, 9), (4, 17), (4, 3), (4, 27), (5, 13), (5, 8), (5, 10), (8, 5), (8, 27), (8, 15), (9, 4), (9, 24), (9, 10), (9, 16), (10, 5), (10, 9), (10, 11), (10, 1), (10, 25), (11, 10), (11, 29), (12, 7), (12, 21), (12, 18), (13, 5), (13, 1), (13, 2), (14, 18), (14, 1), (15, 17), (15, 8), (15, 25), (16, 9), (16, 6), (16, 23), (17, 20), (17, 15), (17, 4), (18, 14), (18, 12), (19, 21), (20, 17), (20, 24), (21, 7), (21, 12), (21, 24), (21, 28), (21, 19), (22, 3), (22, 6), (22, 28), (23, 3), (23, 0), (23, 2), (24, 9), (24, 7), (24, 20), (24, 25), (25, 10), (25, 0), (25, 15), (25, 24), (26, 28), (27, 4), (27, 8), (28, 21), (28, 6), (28, 26), (28, 22), (29, 11), (29, 6)


Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Sorted vertices by degree:
Vertices with degree 2: {0, 2, 11, 19, 26, 29}
Vertices with degree 3: {5, 8, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20, 22}
Vertices with degree 4: {1, 7, 12, 16}
Vertices with degree 5: {3, 10, 17}
Vertices with degree 6: {6, 9, 24, 25, 27, 28}
Vertices with degree 7: {4, 21, 23}

Triangles found:
