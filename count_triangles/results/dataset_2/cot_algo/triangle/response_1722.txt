Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 0, 4, 2, 8, 7, 5, 9, 6, 3, 1. 

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

There are 25 triangles in total. 

Output: [25]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 7, 6>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 8, 3>, <3, 7, 6>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 8, 5>, <4, 8, 3>, <5, 8, 6>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 2, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 9, 5>, <7, 9, 1>
