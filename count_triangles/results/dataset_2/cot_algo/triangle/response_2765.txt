Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 23) (18, 22) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 17) (22, 29) (22, 8) (7, 18) (5, 18) (5, 24) (5, 28) (24, 5) (24, 10) (24, 25) (21, 27) (21, 29) (26, 22) (26, 2) (26, 11) (26, 16) (26, 27) (4, 13) (4, 6) (17, 22) (17, 0) (25, 24) (25, 9) (0, 3) (0, 17) (10, 24) (10, 13) (10, 23) (8, 18) (8, 22) (8, 28) (28, 5) (28, 8) (19, 15) (19, 2) (9, 25) (9, 1) (9, 27) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 11) (2, 20) (23, 15) (23, 10) (23, 29) (23, 16) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 29) (6, 16) (29, 3) (29, 22) (29, 21) (29, 23) (29, 6) (27, 21) (27, 26) (27, 9) (27, 1) (13, 4) (13, 10) (1, 9) (1, 27) (16, 3) (16, 26) (16, 23) (16, 6) (16, 20) (20, 2) (20, 16) (20, 14) (20, 11) (14, 20) (11, 26) (11, 2) (11, 20) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. 

After relabeling the vertices accordingly and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections than the other, the triangles and their counts are as follows:

\[
[\text{Total number of triangles}: 13]
\]

Unique triangles found:
\[
<0, 3, 17>, <0, 17, 22>, <2, 19, 26>, <4, 6, 16>, <5, 8, 18>, <5, 8, 28>, <6, 16, 29>, <9, 25, 27>, <10, 13, 24>, <10, 13, 23>, <16, 20, 26>, <16, 20, 11>, <20, 14, 11>
