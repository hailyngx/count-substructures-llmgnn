Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (2, 18) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 13) (18, 8) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 9) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 16) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 8) (8, 18) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 15) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 13) (16, 2) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 1) (19, 17) (19, 15) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 8) (13, 14) (13, 18) (13, 10) (13, 15) (11, 5) 

Response:
The nodes and edges in the graph are as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (14, 17), (14, 0), (14, 9), (14, 13), (17, 14), (17, 1), (17, 19), (17, 5), (2, 18), (2, 16), (18, 2), (18, 4), (18, 13), (18, 8), (7, 12), (12, 7), (12, 16), (12, 3), (12, 9), (4, 18), (4, 0), (4, 16), (5, 17), (5, 6), (5, 11), (6, 5), (6, 3), (0, 14), (0, 4), (0, 10), (1, 17), (1, 16), (1, 10), (1, 8), (8, 18), (8, 1), (8, 3), (9, 14), (9, 12), (9, 15), (10, 0), (10, 1), (10, 13), (15, 9), (15, 19), (15, 13), (16, 2), (16, 12), (16, 4), (16, 1), (19, 17), (19, 15), (3, 12), (3, 6), (3, 8), (13, 14), (13, 18), (13, 10), (13, 15), (11, 5).

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes by degree: 7, 11, 2, 7, 5, 6, 9, 5, 6, 4, 5, 5, 6, 8, 7, 5, 7, 7, 8, 6

After relabeling the nodes in ascending order of degrees:
New node labels: 11, 13, 2, 11, 4, 5, 8, 4, 5, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 11, 4, 11, 11, 6, 5

Let's count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Total number of triangles: [17]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 18>
<2, 13, 18>
<1, 8, 17>
<3, 8, 12>
<3, 6, 12>
<3, 8, 16>
<4, 10, 13>
<5, 6, 11>
<5, 9, 12>
<13, 14, 15>
<13, 15, 19>
<17, 19, 15>
<0, 10, 4>
<1, 10, 4>
<1, 16, 2>
<8, 16, 1>
<14, 15, 19>
