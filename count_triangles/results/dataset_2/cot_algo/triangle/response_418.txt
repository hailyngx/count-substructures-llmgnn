Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 8), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 1), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 5), (4, 2), (7, 6), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 5), (8, 6), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 1), (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 1), (2, 6), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 5), (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 0), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 2), (5, 3), (3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 0), (3, 5)

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order:
Nodes: 0, 8, 5, 7, 3, 4, 1, 9, 2, 6

Next, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.  

Now, counting the triangles:  
Total number of triangles: [20]
