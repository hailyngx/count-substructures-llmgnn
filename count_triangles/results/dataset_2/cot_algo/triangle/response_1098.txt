Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 9) (3, 11) (3, 6) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 10) (7, 8) (7, 19) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 9) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 15) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 0) (0, 18) (2, 4) (2, 6) (5, 14) (5, 12) (16, 10) (16, 9) (16, 6) (19, 17) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 6) (9, 1) (9, 12) (9, 16) (9, 15) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (6, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles follows these steps:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
   - Node 0: 1 connection
   - Node 2: 2 connections
   - Node 5: 2 connections
   - Node 7: 2 connections
   - Node 4: 3 connections
   - Node 3: 3 connections
   - Node 12: 3 connections
   - Node 15: 3 connections
   - Node 16: 3 connections
   - Node 6: 4 connections
   - Node 10: 4 connections
   - Node 19: 4 connections
   - Node 9: 4 connections
   - Node 18: 4 connections
   - Node 1: 4 connections
   - Node 8: 5 connections
   - Node 11: 5 connections
   - Node 13: 5 connections
   - Node 14: 5 connections
   - Node 17: 5 connections

2. Relabel the vertices according to their degree order:
   - Node 0: A
   - Node 2: B
   - Node 5: C
   - Node 7: D
   - Node 4: E
   - Node 3: F
   - Node 12: G
   - Node 15: H
   - Node 16: I
   - Node 6: J
   - Node 10: K
   - Node 19: L
   - Node 9: M
   - Node 18: N
   - Node 1: O
   - Node 8: P
   - Node 11: Q
   - Node 13: R
   - Node 14: S
   - Node 17: T

3. Count the triangles by checking shared connections:
   - Triangles <A, B, C>, <A, D, C>, <E, F, J>, <P, N, L>

The total number of triangles is [4].
