Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2)
