Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 1) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 19) (7, 17) (7, 9) (1, 10) (1, 2) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 4) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 13) (19, 0) (19, 6) (19, 12) (14, 15) (12, 6) (12, 19) (12, 13) (12, 8) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 5) (16, 15) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 8) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 5) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (9, 17) (9, 7) (9, 2) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 16) (15, 13) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 15) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the nodes based on their degree and then counting triangles accordingly. Let's label the vertices based on their degree:

Node 0 : 2 connections 
Node 1 : 2 connections 
Node 2 : 4 connections 
Node 4 : 2 connections 
Node 5 : 3 connections 
Node 6 : 4 connections 
Node 7 : 3 connections 
Node 8 : 4 connections 
Node 9 : 3 connections 
Node 10 : 4 connections 
Node 11 : 3 connections 
Node 12 : 4 connections 
Node 13 : 5 connections 
Node 15 : 4 connections 
Node 16 : 4 connections 
Node 17 : 5 connections 
Node 18 : 3 connections 
Node 19 : 3 connections 
Node 14 : 1 connection 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering the given edges, we can count the total number of triangles and identify unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [9]

Unique triangles: 
<10, 17, 18>
<10, 17, 7>
<10, 17, 16>
<10, 17, 13>
<10, 6, 19>
<1, 10, 17>
<6, 12, 19>
<8, 12, 13>
<2, 9, 13>
