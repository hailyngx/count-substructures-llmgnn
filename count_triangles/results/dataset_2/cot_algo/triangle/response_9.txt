Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:  
Node 2 has 2 connections.  
Node 3 has 3 connections.  
Node 8 has 3 connections.  
Node 1 has 4 connections.  
Node 4 has 4 connections.  
Node 7 has 4 connections.  
Node 0 has 5 connections.  
Node 6 has 5 connections.  
Node 9 has 5 connections.  
Node 5 has 5 connections.  

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the edges provided, we find the following triangles:  
- Triangle <0, 5, 7>  
- Triangle <0, 5, 9>  
- Triangle <0, 7, 9>  
- Triangle <1, 4, 6>  
- Triangle <1, 4, 9>  
- Triangle <2, 4, 9>  
- Triangle <2, 4, 5>  
- Triangle <4, 6, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
