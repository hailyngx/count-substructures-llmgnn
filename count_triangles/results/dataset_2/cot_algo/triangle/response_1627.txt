Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 11) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 17) (9, 6) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 18) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 15) (11, 17) (7, 15) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 18) (0, 3) (0, 7) (19, 7) (19, 18) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 17) (18, 1) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 14) (17, 6) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 4) (14, 16) (4, 14) (16, 10) (16, 13) (16, 14) (2, 3) (2, 17) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
- Edges:
  - 0: 3, 2, 7
  - 1: 6, 5, 18
  - 2: 3, 17
  - 3: 15, 0, 2
  - 4: 14
  - 5: 1, 10, 13
  - 6: 9, 1, 17
  - 7: 15, 9, 12, 0, 19
  - 8: 12, 14, 17
  - 9: 6, 7
  - 10: 15, 5, 16
  - 11: 15, 17
  - 12: 7, 17, 8
  - 13: 5, 16, 18
  - 14: 8, 18, 4, 16
  - 15: 3, 10, 7, 11
  - 16: 10, 13, 14
  - 17: 6, 11, 12, 8, 2
  - 18: 1, 13, 19, 14
  - 19: 7, 18

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels are:
- Nodes: 4, 0, 2, 5, 3, 8, 11, 6, 9, 10, 12, 16, 1, 13, 17, 7, 14, 18, 19, 15

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

- Triangles: [9]
- Unique triangles: <0, 2, 3>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 12>, <6, 9, 17>, <10, 13, 16>, <10, 14, 16>, <13, 14, 18>, <14, 16, 18>, <7, 18, 19>
