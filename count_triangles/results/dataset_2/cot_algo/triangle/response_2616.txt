Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) 

Response:
Let's sort the vertices by their degrees from least to most:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 6
- Node 4 has degree 5
- Node 5 has degree 6
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 6
- Node 9 has degree 5

Based on the sorting, the new labels for the nodes will be:
- Node 1 -> 0
- Node 2 -> 1
- Node 0 -> 2
- Node 6 -> 3
- Node 7 -> 4
- Node 4 -> 5
- Node 9 -> 6
- Node 8 -> 7
- Node 3 -> 8
- Node 5 -> 9

Now, let's list the edges in the correct order based on the new labels:
(0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4)

Now, we will count the triangles by looking for shared connections between the endpoints of each edge:
- Triangle <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle <1, 5, 0>
- Triangle <1, 6, 2>
- Triangle <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle <2, 5, 3>
- Triangle <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle <3, 5, 8>
- Triangle <4, 5, 9>
- Triangle <4, 7, 8>
- Triangle <6, 7, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
