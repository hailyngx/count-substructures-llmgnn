Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 0), (9, 8), (9, 7), (4, 7), (4, 13), (4, 14), 
(4, 6), (4, 2), (7, 12), (7, 0), (7, 14), (1, 3), (1, 0), (1, 8), (3, 11), 
(3, 10), (3, 12), (10, 6), (10, 13), (11, 6), (11, 0), (12, 13), (12, 14)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in this graph.

Vertices sorted by degree (lowest to highest):
Nodes with degree 2: 1, 2, 9
Nodes with degree 3: 0, 8
Nodes with degree 4: 3, 7, 11, 12
Nodes with degree 5: 4, 6, 10, 13, 14
Nodes with degree 6: 5

Now, we will check for triangles by examining the edges starting from the nodes with lower degree:
- (5, 9): No triangles
- (5, 6): No triangles
- (5, 2): No triangles
- (5, 8): No triangles
- (5, 0): No triangles
- (9, 8): No triangles
- (9, 7): No triangles
- (4, 7): No triangles
- (4, 13): No triangles
- (4, 14): No triangles
- (4, 6): No triangles
- (4, 2): No triangles
- (7, 12): Triangle formed: <7, 12, 13>
- (7, 0): Triangle formed: <7, 14, 0>
- (7, 14): Triangle formed: <7, 12, 14>
- (1, 3): No triangles
- (1, 0): No triangles
- (1, 8): No triangles
- (3, 11): No triangles
- (3, 10): No triangles
- (3, 12): No triangles
- (10, 6): No triangles
- (10, 13): No triangles
- (11, 6): No triangles
- (11, 0): No triangles
- (12, 13): No triangles

Count of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles found: <7, 12, 13>, <7, 14, 0>, <7, 12, 14>
