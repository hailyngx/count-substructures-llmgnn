Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 14) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 3) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 23) (25, 10) (4, 22) (8, 9) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 11) (15, 20) (15, 7) (15, 13) (18, 6) (1, 20) (1, 26) (1, 13) (1, 22) (26, 1) (3, 20) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 3) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 17) (5, 25) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 29) (19, 25) (19, 5) (19, 21) (19, 16) (29, 9) (29, 5) (29, 13) (29, 23) (28, 8) (28, 12) (22, 4) (22, 1) (22, 16) (22, 24) (22, 21) (10, 25) (12, 0) (12, 28) (12, 16) (16, 19) (16, 22) (16, 12) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 17) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 29) (13, 21) (21, 0) (21, 19) (21, 22) (21, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 3) (24, 22) (24, 23) (23, 25) (23, 29) (23, 24) (17, 7) (17, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree of connections. 

Here is the list of nodes sorted by degree:
Node 20: 4 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 16: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 11: 2 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 17: 2 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 21: 4 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 22: 4 connections
Node 25: 5 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 18: 2 connections
Node 23: 3 connections
Node 24: 2 connections
Node 26: 1 connection
Node 28: 2 connections
Node 29: 4 connections
Node 10: 1 connection

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method by checking the shared connections between the vertices of each edge.

The total number of triangles is [19].
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 12, 28>
<0, 15, 21>
<0, 15, 7>
<0, 15, 13>
<2, 5, 29>
<3, 11, 8>
<3, 14, 8>
<3, 14, 9>
<5, 19, 25>
<5, 19, 29>
<5, 25, 20>
<6, 14, 9>
<6, 9, 8>
<7, 15, 13>
<8, 14, 9>
<8, 14, 11>
<16, 19, 25>
<16, 19, 5>
<21, 22, 16>
<22, 16, 12>
