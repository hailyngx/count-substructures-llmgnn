Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) 

Response:
Based on the provided edges, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
0: 6, 3
1: 6, 4, 3
2: 9, 6, 4, 7, 8
3: 5, 9, 4, 1, 0
4: 5, 7, 8, 1, 3, 2
5: 9, 4, 3
6: 9, 1, 2, 8, 0
7: 9, 4, 2
8: 6, 4, 2
9: 5, 6, 2, 3, 7

Now, we will proceed to count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

After sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are:
Nodes: 0, 5, 7, 1, 8, 3, 2, 4, 6, 9

Now, we will count the triangles:
There is one triangle: <2, 4, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
