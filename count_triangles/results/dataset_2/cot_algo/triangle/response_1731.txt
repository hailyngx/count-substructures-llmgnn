Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
        
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 5), (2, 8), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 6
Node 4: Degree 6
Node 7: Degree 6
Node 6: Degree 7

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed:
- (0, 6): No triangles
- (0, 8): No triangles
- (1, 2): No triangles
- (1, 4): No triangles
- (1, 5): No triangles
- (1, 6): <1, 6, 4>
- (1, 7): <1, 7, 4>
- (2, 5): No triangles
- (2, 8): No triangles
- (3, 6): No triangles
- (3, 7): No triangles
- (4, 6): <4, 6, 1>
- (4, 7): <4, 7, 1>
- (4, 9): No triangles
- (5, 1): No triangles
- (5, 2): No triangles
- (5, 9): No triangles
- (6, 0): No triangles
- (6, 1): <6, 1, 4>
- (6, 3): No triangles
- (6, 4): <6, 4, 1>, <6, 4, 7>
- (6, 7): <6, 7, 1>
- (6, 8): <6, 8, 7>
- (7, 1): <7, 1, 4>
- (7, 3): No triangles
- (7, 4): <7, 4, 1>
- (7, 6): <7, 6, 1>, <7, 6, 4>
- (7, 8): <7, 8, 6>
- (7, 9): No triangles
- (8, 0): No triangles
- (8, 2): No triangles
- (8, 6): <8, 6, 7>
- (8, 7): <8, 7, 6>
- (8, 9): No triangles
- (9, 4): No triangles
- (9, 5): No triangles
- (9, 7): No triangles
- (9, 8): No triangles

The total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
