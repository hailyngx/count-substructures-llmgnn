Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 6) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (1, 12) (1, 2) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 14) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 6) 

Response:
The graph with nodes labeled from 0 to 14 based on their degree of connections is as follows:
```
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 10: 5 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 12: 5 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
```

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we observe the following triangles and count them:
- Triangle <0, 4, 8>
- Triangle <2, 3, 4>
- Triangle <2, 3, 6>
- Triangle <2, 7, 10>
- Triangle <2, 7, 12>
- Triangle <2, 11, 13>
- Triangle <3, 4, 6>
- Triangle <3, 5, 12>
- Triangle <4, 7, 8>
- Triangle <4, 10, 12>
- Triangle <6, 13, 14>
- Triangle <7, 10, 12>

Therefore, there are a total of [12] triangles in the given graph.
