Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (4, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (5, 2, 8, 3)
- 1: (6, 2, 4, 7)
- 2: (0, 1, 3, 5)
- 3: (5, 0, 2, 8, 7)
- 4: (6, 5, 1)
- 5: (6, 4, 0, 3, 7)
- 6: (5, 1, 7, 4)
- 7: (6, 9, 5, 8, 1, 3)
- 8: (9, 0, 3, 7)
- 9: (8, 7)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sorting nodes by degree (number of connections):
   Nodes sorted by degree: 9, 4, 0, 1, 2, 8, 6, 3, 5, 7

2. Counting triangles:
   - For edge (9, 8):
     Shared connections: 7
     Triangles: <7, 9, 8>
   
   - For edge (4, 6):
     Shared connections: 5, 1
     Triangles: <1, 4, 6>, <5, 4, 6>
   
   - For edge (0, 5):
     Shared connections: 2, 3
     Triangles: <2, 0, 5>, <3, 0, 5>
   
   - For edge (1, 6):
     Shared connections: 2
     Triangles: <2, 1, 6>
   
   - For edge (2, 3):
     No triangle formed
   
   - For edge (8, 9):
     No triangle formed
   
   - For edge (6, 5):
     No triangle formed
   
   - For edge (3, 5):
     Shared connections: 0, 7
     Triangles: <0, 3, 5>, <7, 3, 5>
   
   - For edge (7, 9):
     Shared connections: 8
     Triangles: <8, 7, 9>
   
   - For edge (7, 8):
     No triangle formed

3. Total number of triangles: [10]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 10.
