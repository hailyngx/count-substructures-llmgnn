Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (9, 11) (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 3) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 22) (17, 8) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 24) (15, 4) (22, 17) (22, 23) (22, 27) (22, 7) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 16) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 11) (27, 22) (27, 29) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 23) (8, 26) (7, 22) (7, 12) (7, 20) (29, 27) (29, 1) (29, 6) (21, 28) (21, 20) (28, 21) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 25) (6, 12) (6, 29) (6, 20) (16, 3) (16, 23) (16, 28) (16, 13) (18, 10) (26, 14) (26, 8) (25, 28) (25, 0) (25, 2) (2, 12) (2, 25) (2, 4) (4, 15) (4, 2) (4, 20) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 19) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 24) (24, 15) (24, 11) (24, 0) (1, 29) (1, 28) (1, 13) (1, 0) (20, 7) (20, 21) (20, 6) (20, 4) (19, 10) (19, 0) (0, 25) (0, 24) (0, 1) (0, 19) (13, 16) (13, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) from least to most. After relabeling the nodes accordingly, the graph with nodes and their degrees becomes:

1 -> 1  
9 -> 1  
27 -> 2  
5 -> 2  
2 -> 3  
29 -> 3  
4 -> 3  
11 -> 3  
12 -> 3  
18 -> 3  
19 -> 3  
26 -> 3  
7 -> 3  
17 -> 4  
23 -> 4  
24 -> 4  
28 -> 4  
6 -> 4  
15 -> 4  
8 -> 4  
13 -> 4  
20 -> 4  
3 -> 5  
16 -> 5  
22 -> 5  
10 -> 5  
21 -> 2  
0 -> 5  

Following the approach mentioned, we will count the number of triangles in the graph.

The total number of triangles is [24].

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 4, 20>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 0, 25>
<0, 1, 28>
<3, 7, 21>
<2, 4, 26>
<1, 13, 29>
<3, 8, 23>
<7, 12, 29>
<1, 13, 16>
<1, 13, 28>
<4, 6, 20>
<11, 12, 24>
<11, 12, 6>
<10, 3, 24>
<12, 6, 29>
<12, 27, 29>
<3, 15, 24>
<3, 15, 4>
<16, 23, 28>
<16, 28, 1>
<15, 24, 11>
<15, 4, 20>
<19, 0, 25>
