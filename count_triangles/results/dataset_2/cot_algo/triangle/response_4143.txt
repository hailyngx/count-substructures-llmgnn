Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 13) (15, 2) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 8) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 10) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 19) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 1) (7, 13) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 17) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 13) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 19) (14, 18) (14, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 10) (10, 18) (10, 1) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 6) (19, 12) (19, 17) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method proceeds as follows:

1. Count the number of connections for each node:
   - Node 0: 3 connections
   - Node 1: 4 connections
   - Node 2: 4 connections
   - Node 3: 3 connections
   - Node 4: 3 connections
   - Node 5: 3 connections
   - Node 6: 4 connections
   - Node 7: 2 connections
   - Node 8: 4 connections
   - Node 9: 4 connections
   - Node 10: 2 connections
   - Node 11: 4 connections
   - Node 12: 3 connections
   - Node 13: 5 connections
   - Node 14: 2 connections
   - Node 15: 2 connections
   - Node 17: 3 connections
   - Node 18: 5 connections
   - Node 19: 2 connections

2. Sort the nodes based on the number of connections in ascending order:
   - Node 7, Node 10, Node 14, Node 15, Node 19, Node 0, Node 4, Node 5, Node 3, Node 6, Node 17, Node 12, Node 2, Node 8, Node 1, Node 9, Node 11, Node 18, Node 13

3. Relabel the nodes from 0 to 19 based on the sorted order above.

4. Count the triangles:
   - Triangles: [<0, 1, 8>, <0, 8, 2>, <1, 7, 13>, <1, 10, 18>, <2, 8, 11>, <2, 8, 6>, <2, 8, 18>, <3, 0, 1>, <3, 0, 8>, <3, 6, 13>, <4, 9, 11>, <4, 9, 12>, <6, 8, 11>, <6, 8, 13>, <7, 13, 15>, <11, 12, 19>]

5. Total number of triangles: [16]
