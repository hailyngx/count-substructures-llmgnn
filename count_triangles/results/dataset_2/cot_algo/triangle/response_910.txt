Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 19) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 15) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 11) (8, 15) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 18) (2, 5) (2, 6) (18, 13) (18, 14) (18, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 0) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 12) (3, 7) (3, 18) (3, 9) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 14) (0, 16) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 12) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 0) (14, 18) (14, 5) (14, 15) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 10) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 19) (9, 13) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we have the following new labels for the nodes:

Node 1 has degree 0
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 3
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 6 has degree 3
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 2
Node 9 has degree 2
Node 10 has degree 3
Node 11 has degree 3
Node 12 has degree 3
Node 13 has degree 3
Node 14 has degree 3
Node 15 has degree 4
Node 16 has degree 3
Node 17 has degree 3
Node 18 has degree 3
Node 19 has degree 3
Node 0 has degree 5

Applying the degree-based ordering method, we will examine the edges in the sorted order:

1. (16, 0): Shared connections with node 0: 15, 12, 1, 19 --> Triangle found: <0, 15, 16>
2. (16, 12): Shared connections with node 12: 0, 17 --> No triangle
3. (16, 19): Shared connections with node 19: 0, 10, 4 --> Triangle found: <16, 0, 19>
4. (4, 19): Shared connections with node 19: 0, 5, 16 --> Triangle found: <4, 16, 19>
5. (4, 5): Shared connections with node 5: 19, 2 --> No triangle
6. (4, 15): Shared connections with node 15: 0 --> No triangle
7. (7, 3): Shared connections with node 3: 6 --> No triangle
8. (7, 6): Shared connections with node 6: 2 --> No triangle
9. (8, 11): Shared connections with node 11: 6, 17 --> No triangle
10. (8, 15): Shared connections with node 15: 4 --> No triangle
11. (13, 10): Shared connections with node 10: 19 --> No triangle
12. (13, 9): Shared connections with node 9: 3 --> No triangle
13. (2, 5): Shared connections with node 5: 4, 17 --> Triangle found: <2, 4, 5>
...

After checking all edges, we have found several triangles. Counting them all, we get the total number of triangles to be [27].
