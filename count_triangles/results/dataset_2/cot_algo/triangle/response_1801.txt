Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 4: 6 connections

Using the degree-based ordering, we consider the edges in the following order:
(2, 0), (1, 3), (2, 3), (0, 3), (6, 8), (1, 8), (7, 8), (1, 9), (5, 6), (6, 9), (4, 7), (7, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (4, 5), (5, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (7, 8), (6, 7), (7, 8), (5, 6), (3, 5), (0, 4), (4, 8), (3, 8), (0, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8), (4, 7), (3, 5), (1, 9), (4, 9), (3, 5), (1, 5), (3, 8), (4, 5), (1, 9), (5, 6), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 9)
  
After considering the edges in the given order, we find the following triangles:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 4>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 8, 4>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
