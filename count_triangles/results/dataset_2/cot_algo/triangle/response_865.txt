Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order. Let's assign labels to the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 5: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 1: degree 7
Node 3: degree 7
Node 7: degree 8
Node 8: degree 5

Now, we will consider each edge in the graph based on the labels assigned to the nodes. Only edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections will be considered:

1. (5, 2): Node 2 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 5 (degree 3). Shared connections: None.
2. (5, 3): Node 3 (degree 7) has more connections than Node 5 (degree 3). Not considered.
3. (5, 7): Node 5 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Node 7 (degree 8). Shared connections: Node 0. Triangle: <0, 5, 7>.
4. (9, 6): Node 6 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Node 9 (degree 3). Shared connections: None.
