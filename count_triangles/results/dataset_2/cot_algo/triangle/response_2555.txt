Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 22) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (20, 25) (20, 12) (20, 22) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 19) (25, 21) (25, 14) (10, 7) (10, 21) (10, 5) (17, 29) (17, 3) (17, 11) (8, 28) (8, 15) (29, 17) (29, 11) (29, 18) (19, 25) (19, 5) (19, 18) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 28) (9, 21) (9, 24) (9, 0) (22, 4) (22, 20) (22, 28) (22, 0) (1, 4) (1, 15) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 22) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 13) (18, 29) (18, 19) (18, 24) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 14) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 21) (3, 13) (21, 25) (21, 10) (21, 9) (21, 3) (21, 24) (12, 20) (12, 16) (16, 2) (16, 12) (16, 23) (28, 8) (28, 2) (28, 22) (11, 17) (11, 29) (11, 5) (23, 16) (14, 20) (14, 25) (14, 5) (27, 6) (6, 25) (6, 27) (24, 9) (24, 18) (24, 21) (24, 13) (13, 15) (13, 3) (13, 24) 

Response:
The graph with nodes and edges is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(4, 7), (4, 22), (4, 1), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 10), (20, 25), (20, 12), (20, 22), (20, 14), (25, 6), (25, 19), (25, 21), (25, 14), (10, 21), (17, 29), (17, 11), (8, 28), (19, 5), (19, 18), (2, 16), (2, 3), (2, 28), (9, 24), (22, 28), (1, 15), (0, 9), (15, 13), (18, 24), (5, 14), (3, 13), (21, 24), (12, 16), (16, 23), (11, 29), (23, 16), (27, 6), (24, 13)

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections):
Degrees: 
Node 26: 0
Node 1: 1
Node 22: 2
Node 13: 2
Node 23: 2
Node 14: 2
Node 6: 2
Node 8: 2
Node 0: 3
Node 12: 3
Node 16: 3
Node 15: 3
Node 3: 4
Node 9: 4
Node 10: 4
Node 2: 4
Node 20: 4
Node 27: 4
Node 21: 5
Node 5: 5
Node 18: 5
Node 19: 6
Node 29: 6
Node 17: 6
Node 4: 6
Node 7: 6
Node 24: 6
Node 25: 6
Node 11: 6
Node 28: 6

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles. 

Total number of triangles: [18]
Unique triangles:
