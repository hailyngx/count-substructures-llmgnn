Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 19) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 4) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 1) (13, 17) (13, 4) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 7) (18, 19) (18, 7) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 1) (0, 15) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 5) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 12) (1, 8) (1, 19) (11, 7) (11, 9) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 6) (7, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 4) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 14) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 5) (16, 8) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 12) 

Response:
Let's sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:

Vertices: 
0(4), 1(2), 2(3), 3(3), 4(3), 5(4), 6(4), 7(4), 8(3), 9(2), 10(2), 11(2), 12(4), 13(2), 14(2), 15(4), 16(1), 17(5), 18(2), 19(4)

Now, let's analyze the edges based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- (1, 19): Does not form a triangle.
- (1, 9): Does not form a triangle.
- (3, 14): Does not form a triangle.
- (3, 6): Forms a triangle <3, 6, 17>.
- (3, 19): Forms a triangle <3, 19, 15>.
- (15, 19): Forms a triangle <15, 19, 18>.
- (15, 0): Forms a triangle <15, 0, 2>.
- (15, 5): Forms a triangle <15, 5, 10>.
- (15, 4): Forms a triangle <15, 4, 13>.
- (2, 8): Does not form a triangle.
- (2, 17): Forms a triangle <2, 17, 13>.
- (2, 0): Does not form a triangle.
- (8, 16): Does not form a triangle.
- (8, 1): Does not form a triangle.
- (13, 17): Does not form a triangle.
- (17, 6): Forms a triangle <17, 6, 12>.
- (17, 7): Forms a triangle <17, 7, 11>.
- (17, 18): Does not form a triangle.
- (18, 19): Does not form a triangle.
- (19, 1): Does not form a triangle.
- (0, 10): Forms a triangle <0, 10, 5>.
- (10, 5): Forms a triangle <10, 5, 15>.
- (6, 12): Forms a triangle <6, 12, 14>.
- (1, 8): Does not form a triangle.
- (11, 7): Forms a triangle <11, 7, 17>.
- (7, 18): Does not form a triangle.
- (14, 12): Forms a triangle <14, 12, 6>.
- (4, 13): Does not form a triangle.
- (9, 12): Does not form a triangle.
- (16, 8): Does not form a triangle.
