Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 17) (7, 10) (7, 17) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 10) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 18) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 2) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 0) (15, 13) (15, 12) (15, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (9, 3) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 16) (6, 1) (6, 2) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 14) (16, 5) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 12) (17, 4) (17, 7) (2, 19) (2, 15) (2, 6) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count triangles efficiently. First, we sort the nodes by their degrees:

Nodes by degree:
0: 2
1: 4
2: 3
3: 3
4: 2
5: 4
6: 3
7: 2
8: 2
9: 1
10: 4
11: 4
12: 3
13: 4
14: 4
15: 3
16: 4
17: 2
18: 3
19: 4

Now, let's list the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering:
[Total number of triangles: 15]
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 10>
<1, 11, 14>
<1, 11, 16>
<1, 14, 16>
<2, 6, 12>
<2, 6, 15>
<4, 5, 10>
<5, 13, 19>
<13, 14, 18>
<13, 15, 18>
<13, 15, 12>
<14, 16, 12>
<16, 8, 19>
<16, 12, 14>
