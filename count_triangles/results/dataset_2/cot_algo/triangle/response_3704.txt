Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 0) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (7, 15) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 8) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 1) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 17) (10, 15) (10, 12) (13, 17) (13, 0) (17, 19) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 18) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 18) (0, 16) (0, 13) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 8) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 17) (2, 9) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 18) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method follows these steps:

1. Count the number of connections each node has:
   - Node 0: 3 connections
   - Node 1: 4 connections
   - Node 2: 4 connections
   - Node 3: 1 connection
   - Node 4: 4 connections
   - Node 5: 4 connections
   - Node 6: 4 connections
   - Node 7: 2 connections
   - Node 8: 4 connections
   - Node 9: 2 connections
   - Node 10: 3 connections
   - Node 11: 3 connections
   - Node 12: 5 connections
   - Node 13: 2 connections
   - Node 14: 2 connections
   - Node 15: 4 connections
   - Node 16: 2 connections
   - Node 17: 4 connections
   - Node 18: 4 connections
   - Node 19: 3 connections

2. Sort the nodes based on the number of connections in ascending order:
   - Nodes in order: 3 7 9 13 16 14 0 10 11 19 5 6 15 1 4 2 17 18 8 12

3. Relabel the nodes based on the order:
   - New labels: 
     - Node 3 -> 0
     - Node 7 -> 1
     - Node 9 -> 2
     - Node 13 -> 3
     - Node 16 -> 4
     - Node 14 -> 5
     - Node 0 -> 6
     - Node 10 -> 7
     - Node 11 -> 8
     - Node 19 -> 9
     - Node 5 -> 10
     - Node 6 -> 11
     - Node 15 -> 12
     - Node 1 -> 13
     - Node 4 -> 14
     - Node 2 -> 15
     - Node 17 -> 16
     - Node 18 -> 17
     - Node 8 -> 18
     - Node 12 -> 19

4. Count the number of triangles based on the sorted and relabeled graph:
   - Number of triangles: 17
   - Unique triangles: <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 11>, <0, 10, 15>, <0, 10, 12>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 12>, <1, 4, 18>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 12>, <1, 5, 18>, <2, 9, 4>, <2, 17, 18>, <4, 9, 2>, <5, 6, 11>, <5, 6, 1>, <5, 19, 2>, <15, 10, 12>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
