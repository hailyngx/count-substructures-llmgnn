Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 4) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 2) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 1) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method follows the steps below:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
   - Node 4 has 4 connections.
   - Nodes 1, 10, 14 have 3 connections.
   - Nodes 0, 2, 5, 7, 12 have 4 connections.
   - Nodes 3, 8 have 5 connections.
   - Nodes 6, 9, 11, and 13 have 6 connections.

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:
   - Node 4 -> Node 0
   - Nodes 1, 10, 14 -> Nodes 1, 2, 3
   - Nodes 0, 2, 5, 7, 12 -> Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
   - Nodes 3, 8 -> Nodes 9, 10
   - Nodes 6, 9, 11, 13 -> Nodes 11, 12, 13, 14

3. Based on the lower-labeled vertices, we will check for triangles:
   - Triangles are formed by shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.
   - Counting the triangles based on the given edges, we find the following unique triangles:
     - <0, 2, 4>
     - <0, 2, 14>
     - <0, 4, 12>
     - <1, 2, 11>
     - <1, 7, 12>
     - <1, 7, 4>
     - <2, 4, 14>
     - <3, 7, 9>
     - <4, 12, 13>
     - <4, 12, 14>
     - <7, 12, 14>

4. The total number of triangles found in the given graph is [11].
