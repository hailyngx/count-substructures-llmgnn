Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 8) (15, 12) (15, 2) (15, 11) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (12, 15) (12, 7) (12, 14) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 10) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 16) (0, 4) (0, 17) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 8) (2, 15) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 11) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 13) (13, 16) (13, 11) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 13) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
(3, 7), (3, 16), (3, 8), 
(15, 12), (15, 2), (15, 11), 
(6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 11), 
(9, 17), (9, 1), 
(4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 10), (4, 14),
(7, 12), (7, 1), 
(14, 12), 
(17, 16), (17, 0),
(1, 5),
(5, 2),
(19, 8), (19, 2), (19, 10),
(8, 10), (8, 16), 
(0, 17), 
(10, 19),

(13, 11)

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles and list the unique triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 6]
<1, 5, 2>
<2, 11, 15>
<3, 8, 16>
<4, 7, 12>
<6, 9, 1>
<11, 13, 16>
