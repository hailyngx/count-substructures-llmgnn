Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Let us construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0)
(9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3)
(4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6)
(7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1)
(6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2)
(8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3)
(2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0)
(1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0)
(3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0)
(0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
0 (degree 4)
3 (degree 3)
7 (degree 3)
6 (degree 3)
9 (degree 3)
1 (degree 3)
4 (degree 4)
8 (degree 5)
2 (degree 5)
5 (degree 6)

Now, we will count the triangles:

<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [10]
