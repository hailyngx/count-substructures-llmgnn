Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 12) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 6) (12, 7) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 13) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Nodes and edges in the given graph are:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: {(1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 14), (1, 5), (1, 13), (1, 7), (3, 1), (3, 11), (3, 14), (3, 9), (10, 11), (10, 8), (10, 2), (10, 14), (11, 3), (11, 10), (11, 5), (4, 9), (4, 13), (4, 14), (8, 10), (8, 0), (8, 6), (8, 7), (5, 1), (5, 11), (5, 13), (5, 2), (5, 0), (6, 8), (6, 12), (0, 8), (0, 5), (0, 14), (0, 7), (0, 2), (14, 1), (14, 3), (14, 10), (14, 4), (14, 0), (7, 1), (7, 8), (7, 0), (7, 12), (7, 9), (12, 6), (12, 7), (13, 1), (13, 4), (13, 5), (13, 2), (2, 1), (2, 10), (2, 5), (2, 0), (2, 13), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 7)}

The Degree-Based Ordering is as follows:
Node: [Connections] -> Label
0: [6] -> 0
4: [3] -> 1
6: [2] -> 2
12: [2] -> 3
9: [3] -> 4
2: [4] -> 5
13: [4] -> 6
10: [4] -> 7
8: [4] -> 8
11: [4] -> 9
7: [5] -> 10
5: [5] -> 11
3: [5] -> 12
1: [6] -> 13
14: [6] -> 14
