Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (9, 4, 8, 3, 1)
- 1: (5, 9, 4, 0)
- 2: (7)
- 3: (5, 6, 4, 8, 0)
- 4: (7, 0, 3, 1)
- 5: (6, 8, 1, 3, 7)
- 6: (5, 9, 7, 3)
- 7: (2, 5, 6, 4)
- 8: (5, 9, 0, 3)
- 9: (6, 8, 1, 0)

Next, let's find the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted by degree: 2, 1, 9, 4, 7, 8, 0, 6, 3, 5

Triangles found: 

[6, 5, 8]
[9, 8, 5]
[9, 6, 5]
[3, 5, 8]

Total number of triangles: [4]
