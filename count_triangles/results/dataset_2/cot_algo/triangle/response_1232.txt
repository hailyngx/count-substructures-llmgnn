Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 5) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 6) (12, 14) (12, 10) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 11) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method works as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree:
   - Vertex 3 and 12 have degree 3
   - Vertex 1, 2, 10, and 14 have degree 4
   - Vertex 0, 6, and 13 have degree 5
   - Vertex 5, 7, 11, and 9 have degree 6
   - Vertex 4 and 8 have degree 7

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degree in increasing order:
   - Vertex 3 (degree 3) becomes vertex 0
   - Vertex 12 (degree 3) becomes vertex 1
   - Vertex 1 (degree 4) becomes vertex 2
   - Vertex 2 (degree 4) becomes vertex 3
   - Vertex 10 (degree 4) becomes vertex 4
   - Vertex 14 (degree 4) becomes vertex 5
   - Vertex 0 (degree 5) becomes vertex 6
   - Vertex 6 (degree 5) becomes vertex 7
   - Vertex 13 (degree 5) becomes vertex 8
   - Vertex 5 (degree 6) becomes vertex 9
   - Vertex 7 (degree 6) becomes vertex 10
   - Vertex 11 (degree 6) becomes vertex 11
   - Vertex 9 (degree 6) becomes vertex 12
   - Vertex 4 (degree 7) becomes vertex 13
   - Vertex 8 (degree 7) becomes vertex 14

3. Check the edges according to the relabeled vertices:
   - Triangle <0, 3, 4> formed by vertices (3, 4) and their shared connections (4, 8, 6)
   - Triangle <1, 2, 5> formed by vertices (12, 10) and their shared connections (14, 9, 0)
   - Triangle <6, 7, 8> formed by vertices (0, 6) and their shared connections (4, 13, 9)
   - Triangle <9, 10, 11> formed by vertices (5, 7) and their shared connections (13, 1, 6)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
