Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 15) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 15) (16, 7) (16, 6) (1, 19) (6, 12) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 19) (5, 2) (5, 10) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 19) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 4) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 4) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 4) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 18) (4, 17) (4, 11) (4, 19) (15, 2) (15, 9) (15, 13) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 15) (13, 10) (18, 11) (18, 14) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 13)

Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 11: 3 connections
Vertex 15: 3 connections
Vertex 18: 3 connections
Vertex 19: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 10: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 16: 4 connections
Vertex 12: 5 connections
Vertex 13: 5 connections
Vertex 14: 5 connections
Vertex 17: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections
```

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will count the number of triangles:
  
Triangles:
- Triangles involving vertex 0: <0, 2, 3>
- Triangles involving vertex 3: <3, 0, 17>
- Triangles involving vertex 4: <4, 11, 17>
- Triangles involving vertex 5: <5, 2, 10>
- Triangles involving vertex 6: <6, 14, 19>
- Triangles involving vertex 7: <7, 10, 16>
- Triangles involving vertex 8: <8, 12, 13>
- Triangles involving vertex 9: <9, 13, 15>
- Triangles involving vertex 10: <10, 5, 13>
- Triangles involving vertex 11: <11, 13, 18>
- Triangles involving vertex 12: <12, 7, 13>
- Triangles involving vertex 13: <13, 12, 15>
- Triangles involving vertex 14: <14, 6, 18>
- Triangles involving vertex 15: <15, 2, 9>
- Triangles involving vertex 16: <16, 6, 7>
- Triangles involving vertex 17: <17, 3, 4>
- Triangles involving vertex 18: <18, 11, 14>
- Triangles involving vertex 19: <19, 6, 4>
