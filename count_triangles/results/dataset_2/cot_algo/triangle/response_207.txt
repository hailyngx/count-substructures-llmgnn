Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 10) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 2) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 

Vertex 7: degree 3
Vertex 10: degree 3
Vertex 0: degree 4
Vertex 5: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 5
Vertex 1: degree 5
Vertex 11: degree 3
Vertex 13: degree 4
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 12: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 7
Vertex 8: degree 5
Vertex 14: degree 4
Vertex 9: degree 5
Vertex 3: degree 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles formed by nodes with lower labels having fewer connections.

The total number of triangles is: [27]

Unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 11>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 14>
