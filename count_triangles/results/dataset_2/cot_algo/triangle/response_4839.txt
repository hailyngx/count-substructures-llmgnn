Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 23) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 14) (3, 15) (3, 29) (15, 13) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 26) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 20) (7, 4) (7, 23) (7, 1) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 20) (0, 27) (0, 8) (27, 0) (27, 10) (27, 16) (10, 27) (10, 25) (10, 14) (11, 24) (11, 2) (6, 9) (6, 29) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 21) (9, 14) (2, 22) (2, 18) (2, 11) (2, 5) (28, 29) (28, 19) (29, 3) (29, 6) (29, 9) (29, 28) (29, 21) (20, 4) (20, 18) (5, 13) (5, 2) (26, 15) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 23) (23, 13) (23, 7) (23, 18) (23, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 24) (8, 25) (19, 28) (19, 21) (12, 6) (12, 17) (17, 12) (17, 25) (17, 16) (25, 10) (25, 9) (25, 8) (25, 17) (24, 11) (24, 8) (14, 22) (14, 10) (14, 9) (16, 27) (16, 17) (21, 9) (21, 29) (21, 19) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the given nodes and edges. Now, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph.

Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
```
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 28: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 16: 2 connections
Node 17: 3 connections
Node 19: 2 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 20: 3 connections
Node 24: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 26: 1 connection
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 12: 2 connections
Node 21: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 25: 4 connections
Node 18: 4 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 29: 5 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 22: 4 connections
Node 23: 5 connections
Node 27: 3 connections
```

Now, we will count the triangles and provide the total count and the list of unique triangles.

Total number of triangles: [36]

Unique triangles:
