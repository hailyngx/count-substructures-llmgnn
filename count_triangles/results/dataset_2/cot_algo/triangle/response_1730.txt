Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will now sort the nodes by their degrees in ascending order. 

The sorted list of nodes with their corresponding degrees is as follows:
Node 9 - degree 2
Node 5 - degree 3
Node 3 - degree 3
Node 6 - degree 3
Node 7 - degree 3
Node 0 - degree 4
Node 2 - degree 4
Node 8 - degree 4
Node 1 - degree 5
Node 4 - degree 5

Now, we will count the number of triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method by considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

After counting the triangles, the total number of triangles is [11].

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<4, 8, 1>
<7, 8, 6>
