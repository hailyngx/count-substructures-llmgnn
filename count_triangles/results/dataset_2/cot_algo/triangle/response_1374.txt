Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 8) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 13) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, relabel the vertices accordingly and analyze the edges in increasing order of the lower-labelled vertex.

The degrees of the nodes are:
0: 5
1: 5
2: 5
3: 4
4: 3
5: 4
6: 3
7: 3
8: 5
9: 4
10: 4
11: 5
12: 4
13: 4
14: 4

Based on the degrees, we relabel the nodes as:
0: 0
4: 1
6: 2
7: 3
5: 4
13: 5
3: 6
8: 7
12: 8
9: 9
10: 10
11: 11
1: 12
2: 13
14: 14

Analyzing the edges in increasing order of the lower-labelled vertex:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 13>
<0, 5, 13>
<0, 5, 14>
<0, 7, 13>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 8, 14>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 9, 10>
<1, 9, 14>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 12>
<2, 8, 14>
<3, 5, 11>
<3, 5, 12>
<3, 6, 11>
<4, 7, 13>
<4, 8, 14>
<5, 8, 14>
<9, 10, 12>
<9, 10, 13>
<9, 12, 13>
<10, 11, 12>
<10, 11, 14>
<10, 12, 14>
<11, 12, 14>
<11, 7, 13>
