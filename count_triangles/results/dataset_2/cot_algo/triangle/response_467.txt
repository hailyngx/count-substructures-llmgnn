Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes can be represented as follows based on their degree:

0: 4 connections  
1: 4 connections  
2: 4 connections  
3: 5 connections  
4: 4 connections  
5: 4 connections  
6: 4 connections  
7: 5 connections  
8: 3 connections  
9: 3 connections  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now proceed to count the triangles.

Triangles found:  
[10]

Unique triangles:  
<0, 4, 7>  
<0, 2, 4>  
<0, 3, 6>  
<0, 6, 2>  
<1, 5, 9>  
<1, 6, 2>  
<2, 3, 6>  
<3, 4, 7>  
<3, 6, 0>  
<3, 8, 2>
