Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 6) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 3) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 4) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 3) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 14) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, let's construct the graph by listing the nodes and their connections:
0: [5, 6, 2, 7, 12, 3]
1: [7, 11, 4]
2: [8, 10, 7, 0]
3: [12, 11, 0, 10]
4: [6, 1, 14]
5: [6, 0, 14]
6: [13, 5, 10, 4, 0]
7: [2, 12, 10, 1, 0]
8: [13, 2, 9, 10, 12]
9: [8, 13, 14]
10: [8, 6, 2, 7, 12, 3]
11: [3, 1]
12: [8, 7, 10, 0, 3]
13: [8, 9, 6]
14: [5, 9, 4]

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes by degree: [1, 11, 4, 14, 5, 9, 3, 13, 7, 12, 0, 2, 6, 8, 10]

Now, we will count the triangles based on the connections between the vertices:
Triangles: [18]
Unique triangles: <7, 0, 3>, <7, 0, 12>, <7, 0, 10>, <7, 1, 4>, <4, 1, 14>, <1, 7, 0>, <5, 6, 0>, <5, 0, 14>, <9, 8, 13>, <5, 6, 4>, <4, 6, 0>, <2, 10, 7>, <2, 0, 7>, <2, 0, 10>, <12, 8, 10>, <12, 7, 10>, <12, 7, 0>, <12, 3, 0>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [18].
