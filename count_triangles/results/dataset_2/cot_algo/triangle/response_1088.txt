Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 13) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 1) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Count the degree of each node:
   Node 0: degree 3
   Node 1: degree 5
   Node 2: degree 5
   Node 3: degree 3
   Node 4: degree 5
   Node 5: degree 4
   Node 6: degree 3
   Node 7: degree 5
   Node 8: degree 3
   Node 9: degree 2
   Node 10: degree 5
   Node 11: degree 5
   Node 12: degree 3
   Node 13: degree 5
   Node 14: degree 5

2. Sort the nodes by degree in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:
   Nodes in order: 9, 3, 6, 0, 8, 12, 7, 4, 5, 1, 2, 10, 11, 13, 14

3. Now, we will look at each edge and count the triangles formed:
   - For each edge, if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, proceed to check for triangles.
   - Count triangles for which the two vertices of the edge share a connection.

After going through all edges, the total number of triangles is found to be [13].
The unique triangles found are <2, 4, 7>, <0, 2, 14>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 11, 14>, <2, 3, 11>, <0, 10, 14>, <1, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 6>, <5, 10, 13>, <1, 2, 7>, <6, 7, 14>, <4, 7, 13>.
