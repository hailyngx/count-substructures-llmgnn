Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 13) (14, 3) (14, 13) (17, 12) (17, 5) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 5) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 18) (12, 6) (0, 3) (0, 10) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 9) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 18) (8, 15) (8, 18) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 2) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 13) (18, 8) (18, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 2) (1, 18) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 3 with 4 connections is relabeled as node 0.
Node 1 with 1 connection is relabeled as node 1.
Node 8 with 2 connections is relabeled as node 2.
Node 17 with 2 connections is relabeled as node 3.
Node 16 with 2 connections is relabeled as node 4.
Node 10 with 3 connections is relabeled as node 5.
Node 13 with 3 connections is relabeled as node 6.
Node 18 with 4 connections is relabeled as node 7.
Node 14 with 4 connections is relabeled as node 8.
Node 19 with 4 connections is relabeled as node 9.
Node 7 with 4 connections is relabeled as node 10.
Node 4 with 4 connections is relabeled as node 11.
Node 12 with 5 connections is relabeled as node 12.
Node 6 with 5 connections is relabeled as node 13.
Node 15 with 5 connections is relabeled as node 14.
Node 5 with 6 connections is relabeled as node 15.
Node 2 with 3 connections is relabeled as node 16.
Node 9 with 4 connections is relabeled as node 17.
Node 0 with 3 connections is relabeled as node 18.
Node 11 with 4 connections is relabeled as node 19.

The sorted edges (in terms of vertex labels) are:
(0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 15) (0, 10) (1, 18) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 14) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 10) (5, 12) (5, 17) (5, 19) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 19) (7, 9) (8, 15) (8, 18) (9, 19) (10, 18) (11, 16) (12, 17) (13, 14) (13, 18) (14, 15) (15, 16) (16, 15) (17, 12) (18, 13) (18, 8) (19, 11)

By examining the shared connections between vertices connected by edges, we find the following triangles:
