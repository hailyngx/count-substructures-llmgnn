Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 19) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 24) (22, 12) (22, 25) (15, 27) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 6) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 16) (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 8) (9, 18) (26, 11) (20, 25) (20, 12) (25, 22) (25, 20) (25, 7) (0, 15) (0, 4) (8, 3) (8, 23) (8, 1) (23, 8) (23, 24) (28, 18) (29, 17) (29, 16) (29, 24) (29, 21) (17, 29) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 21) (4, 22) (4, 27) (4, 0) (4, 17) (6, 15) (6, 1) (21, 3) (21, 29) (21, 17) (21, 11) (7, 25) (7, 2) (7, 1) (5, 3) (5, 17) (19, 13) (19, 18) (14, 27) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 16) (18, 13) (18, 9) (18, 28) (18, 19) (10, 3) (10, 2) (16, 27) (16, 29) (16, 1) (16, 24) (24, 22) (24, 23) (24, 29) (24, 16) (11, 26) (11, 21) (11, 1) (11, 12) (2, 7) (2, 10) (12, 22) (12, 20) (12, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly. 

Here is the list of vertices and their degrees:
Vertex 0: 3
Vertex 1: 5
Vertex 2: 2
Vertex 3: 5
Vertex 4: 5
Vertex 5: 3
Vertex 6: 2
Vertex 7: 3
Vertex 8: 3
Vertex 9: 1
Vertex 10: 2
Vertex 11: 4
Vertex 12: 3
Vertex 13: 3
Vertex 14: 2
Vertex 15: 4
Vertex 16: 4
Vertex 17: 4
Vertex 18: 4
Vertex 19: 2
Vertex 20: 3
Vertex 21: 4
Vertex 22: 5
Vertex 23: 2
Vertex 24: 4
Vertex 25: 4
Vertex 26: 1
Vertex 27: 4
Vertex 28: 1
Vertex 29: 4

Next, we will process the edges according to the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Considering edge (9, 18), proceed with vertex 9 since it has a lower degree than vertex 18.
2. Considering edge (26, 11), proceed with vertex 26 since it has a lower degree than vertex 11.
3. Considering edge (20, 25), proceed with vertex 20 since it has a lower degree than vertex 25.
4. Considering edge (1, 8), proceed with vertex 1 since it has a lower degree than vertex 8.
5. Considering edge (2, 7), proceed with vertex 2 since it has a lower degree than vertex 7.
6. Considering edge (1, 6), proceed with vertex 1 since it has a lower degree than vertex 6.
7. Considering edge (7, 25), proceed with vertex 7 since it has a lower degree than vertex 25.
8. Considering edge (21, 29), proceed with vertex 21 since it has a lower degree than vertex 29.
9. Considering edge (17, 29), proceed with vertex 17 since it has a lower degree than vertex 29.
10. Considering edge (28, 18), proceed with vertex 28 since it has a lower degree than vertex 18.
11. Considering edge (3, 8), proceed with vertex 3 since it has a lower degree than vertex 8.
12. Considering edge (14, 27), proceed with vertex 14 since it has a lower degree than vertex 27.
13. Considering edge (0, 15), proceed with vertex 0 since it has a lower degree than vertex 15.
14. Considering edge (9, 18), proceed with vertex 18 since it has a lower degree than vertex 9.
15. Considering edge (10, 3), proceed with vertex 10 since it has a lower degree than vertex 3.
16. Considering edge (2, 7), proceed with vertex 7 since it has a lower degree than vertex 2.
17. Considering edge (21, 29), proceed with vertex 29 since it has a lower degree than vertex 21.
18. Considering edge (11, 26), proceed with vertex 26 since it has a lower degree than vertex 11.
19. Considering edge (12, 22), proceed with vertex 12 since it has a lower degree than vertex 22.
20. Considering edge (1, 8), proceed with vertex 8 since it has a lower degree than vertex 1.

After processing all the edges, we have found the total number of triangles to be [18].
The unique triangles found are as follows:
<17, 21, 29>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 11>
<1, 6, 16>
<0, 4, 27>
<10, 2, 7>
<10, 2, 21>
<11, 16, 27>
<11, 24, 29>
<11, 1, 8>
<2, 7, 25>
<2, 10, 21>
<2, 10, 3>
<21, 17, 29>
