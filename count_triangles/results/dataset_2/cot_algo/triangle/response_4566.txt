Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first to find the number of triangles and then apply the Degree-Based Ordering method as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- Node 0: {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6, 2}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 9, 1, 0, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 0}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {4, 0, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 4, 0, 2}

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, relabeling the nodes based on the number of connections:
Nodes in ascending order of connections:
1. Node 7
2. Node 3
3. Node 0, Node 8
4. Node 1, Node 5
5. Node 4
6. Node 2, Node 9
7. Node 6

Now, let's count the triangles:
1. (0, 3, 4) - <0, 3, 4>
2. (0, 4, 8) - <0, 4, 8>
3. (0, 4, 9) - <0, 4, 9>
4. (0, 8, 9) - <0, 8, 9>
Total Triangles: [4]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 4.
