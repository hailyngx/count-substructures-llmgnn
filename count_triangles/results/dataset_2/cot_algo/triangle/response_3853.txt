Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 10) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 5) (17, 4) (2, 19) (2, 10) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 4) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 15) (3, 7) (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 1) (10, 16) (10, 2) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 9) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 7) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 12) (1, 19) (1, 10) (1, 6) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 4) (18, 0) (12, 8) (12, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (4, 16) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph efficiently. Let's first rank the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes: 
0 (degree: 4), 1 (degree: 3), 2 (degree: 3), 3 (degree: 1), 4 (degree: 7), 
5 (degree: 4), 6 (degree: 3), 7 (degree: 2), 8 (degree: 2), 9 (degree: 3), 
10 (degree: 5), 11 (degree: 2), 12 (degree: 2), 13 (degree: 5), 14 (degree: 1), 
15 (degree: 4), 16 (degree: 4), 17 (degree: 4), 18 (degree: 1), 19 (degree: 4)

Based on the degrees, the ordering is: 3, 14, 18 > 7, 2, 8, 11, 12 > 4, 0, 5, 15, 16, 17, 19 > 5, 1, 6, 9, 10, 13 > 1

Now, we can start counting the triangles based on the edge connections:

- Triangle <4, 0, 6> (connections: 4-16-0-4, 4-2-6-4, 0-15-6-0)
- Triangle <4, 0, 15> (connections: 4-16-0-4, 4-2-6-4, 0-15-6-0)
- Triangle <4, 2, 6> (connections: 4-0-6-4, 4-6-2-4, 2-6-4-2)
- Triangle <4, 2, 16> (connections: 4-0-16-4, 4-16-2-4, 2-16-4-2)
- Triangle <6, 1, 10> (connections: 6-15-1-6, 6-1-10-6, 1-10-15-1)
- Triangle <6, 1, 15> (connections: 6-15-1-6, 6-1-10-6, 1-10-15-1)
- Triangle <6, 2, 4> (connections: 6-0-4-6, 6-4-2-6, 2-4-6-2)
- Triangle <6, 2, 10> (connections: 6-15-1-6, 6-1-10-6, 1-10-15-1)
- Triangle <10, 1, 15> (connections: 10-1-15-10, 10-15-0-10, 1-15-10-1)
- Triangle <10, 1, 6> (connections: 10-1-15-10, 10-15-0-10, 1-15-10-1)
- Triangle <10, 2, 4> (connections: 10-1-6-10, 10-6-4-10, 2-4-10-2)
- Triangle <10, 2, 16> (connections: 10-1-15-10, 10-15-0-10, 1-15-10-1)
- Triangle <13, 5, 17> (connections: 13-17-5-13, 13-5-4-13, 5-17-13-5)
- Triangle <13, 5, 4> (connections: 13-17-5-13, 13-5-4-13, 5-17-13-5)
- Triangle <13, 5, 15> (connections: 13-17-5-13, 13-5-4-13, 5-17-13-5)
- Triangle <13, 10, 0> (connections: 13-15-10-13, 13-10-16-13, 10-0-13-10)
- Triangle <13, 10, 15> (connections: 13-15-10-13, 13-10-16-13, 10-0-13-10)
- Triangle <15, 0, 16> (connections: 15-0-16-15, 15-16-2-15, 0-16-15-0)
- Triangle <15, 1, 6> (connections: 15-0-6-15, 15-6-1-15, 1-6-15-1)
