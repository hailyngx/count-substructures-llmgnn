Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 23) (13, 7) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 0) (22, 3) (15, 27) (15, 7) (15, 5) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 24) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 11) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 7) (23, 13) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 25) (1, 26) (1, 4) (1, 18) (26, 23) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 16) (20, 8) (20, 14) (7, 13) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 8) (17, 6) (17, 24) (29, 19) (29, 3) (24, 27) (24, 26) (24, 17) (24, 2) (10, 13) (21, 11) (3, 22) (3, 29) (3, 4) (28, 19) (28, 2) (0, 22) (0, 12) (11, 15) (11, 12) (11, 21) (11, 14) (14, 20) (14, 11) (9, 18) (9, 19) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 9) (18, 6) (2, 24) (2, 28) (2, 5) (2, 25) (5, 15) (5, 12) (5, 2) (6, 17) (6, 18) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 19) (19, 29) (19, 28) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 16) (16, 26) (16, 19) (25, 23) (25, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:

```
0: 2 connections
13: 5 connections
6: 2 connections
15: 4 connections
22: 3 connections
8: 3 connections
12: 4 connections
18: 4 connections
23: 4 connections
27: 3 connections
1: 2 connections
20: 2 connections
7: 4 connections
17: 3 connections
29: 2 connections
24: 4 connections
26: 4 connections
11: 4 connections
9: 2 connections
4: 3 connections
19: 5 connections
16: 2 connections
25: 2 connections
2: 3 connections
5: 3 connections
3: 3 connections
14: 2 connections
21: 1 connection
10: 1 connection
28: 2 connections
```

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. **(21, 11)** is valid since 21 has fewer connections than 11. Checking for shared connections, we find a triangle with node 14: **<21, 11, 14>**

2. **(10, 13)** is not valid as both nodes have the same number of connections.

3. **(12, 5)** is valid since 12 has fewer connections than 5. Checking for shared connections, we find a triangle with node 2: **<12, 5, 2>**

4. **(29, 3)** is valid since 29 has fewer connections than 3. Checking for shared connections, we find a triangle with node 4: **<29, 3, 4>**

5. **(28, 19)** is not valid as 28 has more connections than 19.

6. **(0, 12)** is valid since 0 has fewer connections than 12. Checking shared connections, we find a triangle with node 2: **<0, 12, 2>**

7. **(11, 14)** is not valid as 14 has fewer connections than 11.

8. **(1, 26)** is valid since 1 has fewer connections than 26. Checking shared connections, we find a triangle with node 4: **<1, 26, 4>**

9. **(21, 11)** is already counted.

The total number of triangles found is **[4]**, and the unique triangles are **<21, 11, 14>, <12, 5, 2>, <29, 3, 4>, <1, 26, 4>**.
