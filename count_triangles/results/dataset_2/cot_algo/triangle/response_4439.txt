Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 6) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 6) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 12) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 6) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 8) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to efficiently count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
   - Node 5: 4 edges
   - Node 9: 4 edges
   - Node 10: 3 edges
   - Node 11: 4 edges
   - Node 8: 4 edges
   - Node 13: 5 edges
   - Node 4: 3 edges
   - Node 0: 4 edges
   - Node 14: 5 edges
   - Node 3: 6 edges
   - Node 12: 4 edges
   - Node 1: 4 edges
   - Node 6: 4 edges
   - Node 2: 3 edges
   - Node 7: 4 edges

2. Start counting triangles by following the rules: For each edge, proceed only if the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

3. Counting triangles:
   - Triangle <5, 9, 2>
   - Triangle <5, 9, 14>
   - Triangle <5, 9, 1>
   - Triangle <5, 7, 10>
   - Triangle <10, 13, 8>
   - Triangle <11, 8, 1>
   - Triangle <11, 1, 5>
   - Triangle <13, 4, 8>
   - Triangle <13, 10, 0>
   - Triangle <13, 3, 9>
   - Triangle <13, 7, 10>
   - Triangle <4, 6, 11>
   - Triangle <0, 14, 9>
   - Triangle <0, 10, 7>
   - Triangle <0, 14, 3>
   - Triangle <14, 2, 9>
   - Triangle <14, 3, 12>
   - Triangle <3, 14, 9>
   - Triangle <3, 13, 10>
   - Triangle <3, 12, 4>
   - Triangle <3, 7, 10>
   - Triangle <12, 14, 9>
   - Triangle <12, 4, 6>
   - Triangle <1, 8, 11>
   - Triangle <1, 5, 7>
   - Triangle <6, 4, 12>
   - Triangle <6, 0, 10>
   - Triangle <2, 9, 14>
   - Triangle <7, 3, 13>
