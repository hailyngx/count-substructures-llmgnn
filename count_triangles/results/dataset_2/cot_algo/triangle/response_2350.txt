Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 9) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 10) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 10) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:
   - Node 5 (Degree 2) becomes node 0.
   - Node 1 (Degree 3) becomes node 1.
   - Node 2 (Degree 4) becomes node 2.
   - Node 3 (Degree 3) becomes node 3.
   - Node 4 (Degree 4) becomes node 4.
   - Node 6 (Degree 4) becomes node 5.
   - Node 7 (Degree 4) becomes node 6.
   - Node 8 (Degree 4) becomes node 7.
   - Node 9 (Degree 5) becomes node 8.
   - Node 10 (Degree 3) becomes node 9.
   - Node 11 (Degree 5) becomes node 10.
   - Node 12 (Degree 5) becomes node 11.
   - Node 13 (Degree 4) becomes node 12.
   - Node 14 (Degree 4) becomes node 13.

2. List the unique triangles formed:
   - <0, 1, 4>
   - <0, 3, 9>
   - <0, 4, 10>
   - <1, 10, 4>
   - <2, 8, 9>
   - <3, 1, 10>
   - <3, 9, 10>
   - <4, 9, 10>
   - <6, 7, 12>
   - <6, 8, 2>
   - <7, 12, 0>
   - <7, 12, 14>
   - <8, 6, 12>
   - <9, 0, 3>
   - <9, 0, 4>
   - <9, 3, 10>
   - <9, 4, 10>
   - <11, 13, 4>
   - <11, 13, 9>
   - <12, 6, 7>
   - <12, 7, 14>
   - <13, 6, 11>
   - <13, 11, 10>
   - <14, 7, 12>

3. Count the total number of triangles: In this case, there are [24] triangles.
