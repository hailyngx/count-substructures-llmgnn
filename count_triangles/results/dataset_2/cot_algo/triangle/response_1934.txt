Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 13) (6, 16) (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 11) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 8) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 7) (1, 17) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 12) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 14) (7, 13) (7, 11) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 0) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 19) (8, 18) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 16) (19, 2) (19, 3) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their connections are as follows:

0: 13, 11, 3
1: 17, 15
2: 18, 19, 13
3: 17, 0, 19
4: 9, 17, 18, 14
5: 9, 13, 12
6: 9, 13, 16
7: 13, 11
8: 18
9: 5, 6, 4
10: 17, 16
11: 17, 7, 0
12: 5, 15, 14
13: 5, 6, 2, 0, 7
14: 4, 12, 16
15: 1, 12
16: 10, 18, 14, 6
17: 10, 1, 3, 11, 4
18: 2, 4, 16, 8
19: 2, 3

Following the degree-based ordering, the sorted list of nodes is:
8, 10, 7, 0, 1, 15, 11, 12, 19, 5, 6, 14, 3, 18, 2, 16, 13, 4, 17, 9
