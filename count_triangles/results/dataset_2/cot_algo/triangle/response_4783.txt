Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (3, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort the vertices based on their degrees. Here, I will list the vertices with their corresponding degrees:

(0: 5)
(1: 4)
(3: 1)
(2: 5)
(5: 2)
(4: 6)
(7: 4)
(6: 4)
(9: 4)
(8: 6)

Now, let's go through the edges while following the method:

(0, 1) - Proceed
(0, 2) - Proceed
(0, 4) - Proceed, forming triangle <0, 2, 4>
(0, 5) - Proceed
(0, 8) - Proceed, forming triangle <0, 2, 8>
(1, 2) - Proceed
(1, 4) - Proceed
(1, 6) - Proceed, forming triangle <1, 0, 6>
(1, 8) - Proceed, forming triangle <1, 2, 8>
(2, 3) - Proceed
(2, 8) - Proceed, forming triangle <2, 0, 8>
(2, 9) - Proceed
(3, 2) - Proceed
(4, 6) - Proceed, forming triangle <4, 0, 6>
(4, 7) - Proceed
(4, 8) - Proceed, forming triangle <4, 0, 8>
(4, 1) - Proceed
(4, 6) - Proceed, forming triangle <4, 0, 6>
(4, 7) - Proceed
(4, 8) - Proceed, forming triangle <4, 0, 8>
(5, 6) - Proceed
(6, 7) - Proceed
(6, 8) - Proceed, forming triangle <6, 0, 8>
(7, 8) - Proceed, forming triangle <7, 4, 8>
(7, 9) - Proceed
(8, 9) - Proceed
(9, 2) - Proceed
(9, 7) - Proceed

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10] and the unique triangles found are:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 0, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 0, 8>
<4, 0, 6>
<4, 0, 8>
<6, 0, 8>
<7, 4, 8>
