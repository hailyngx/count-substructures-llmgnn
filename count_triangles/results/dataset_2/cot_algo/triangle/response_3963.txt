Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 6) (8, 18) (13, 2) (13, 0) (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 14) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 17) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 1) (15, 10) (15, 14) (7, 16) (7, 1) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 2) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 12) (6, 4) (17, 19) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 9) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 19) (11, 1) (11, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 2) (9, 17) (9, 0) (9, 3) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 3) (14, 5) (14, 15) (14, 1) (18, 8) (18, 6) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 3
- Node 12 has degree 3
- Node 13 has degree 2
- Node 18 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 11 has degree 3
- Node 15 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 16 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 5
- Node 17 has degree 5
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 10 has degree 4
- Node 19 has degree 4
- Node 14 has degree 4

After examining the edges using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the total number of triangles to be [16].

The unique triangles found are:
<13, 0, 9>
<13, 2, 16>
<18, 8, 6>
<5, 19, 11>
<5, 19, 17>
<5, 14, 1>
<5, 14, 15>
<5, 14, 10>
<19, 17, 6>
<19, 17, 16>
<19, 11, 1>
<17, 6, 4>
<17, 16, 3>
<17, 16, 2>
<1, 11, 4>
<16, 3, 12>
