Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 11) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 12) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. 
Here is the sorted list of vertices: 
Vertices: 13, 14, 0, 10, 9, 8, 12, 7, 11, 6, 5, 3, 2, 1, 4

Now, let's count the triangles:
Triangles: [24]
Unique triangles: <5, 11, 13>, <2, 5, 11>, <1, 4, 14>, <6, 12, 11>, <0, 2, 5>, <6, 7, 11>, <5, 7, 13>, <3, 4, 9>, <1, 10, 12>, <3, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 4>, <7, 9, 13>, <6, 7, 13>, <1, 2, 11>, <2, 5, 13>, <0, 4, 14>, <6, 11, 12>, <10, 12, 1>, <2, 11, 13>, <4, 9, 11>, <4, 5, 13>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 7, 13>, <4, 7, 9>
