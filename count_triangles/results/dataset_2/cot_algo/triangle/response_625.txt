Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 18) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (12, 17) (12, 14) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 18) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 18) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 4) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 15) (4, 9) (4, 15) (4, 19) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (17, 16) (17, 12) (19, 4) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 15) (0, 2) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 5) (18, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly.

Here is the list of vertices with their degrees:
Node 13: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 12: degree 2
Node 14: degree 2
Node 19: degree 2
Node 17: degree 4
Node 15: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 0: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 9: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5
Node 18: degree 5
Node 5: degree 5
Node 11: degree 5
Node 16: degree 5

Now, we can check each edge based on the ordering of the vertices. Only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
