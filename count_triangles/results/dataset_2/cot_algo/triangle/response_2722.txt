Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 21) (17, 25) (17, 0) (17, 4) (22, 9) (22, 11) (23, 27) (23, 3) (23, 16) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 8) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 4) (20, 24) (25, 17) (25, 20) (25, 28) (0, 17) (0, 20) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 12) (15, 20) (15, 11) (15, 16) (2, 7) (21, 14) (21, 29) (21, 24) (28, 25) (28, 16) (28, 9) (28, 5) (9, 22) (9, 28) (9, 1) (9, 7) (3, 23) (3, 11) (11, 22) (11, 15) (11, 3) (24, 20) (24, 21) (24, 10) (26, 5) (26, 7) (16, 23) (16, 15) (16, 28) (16, 7) (16, 29) (5, 28) (5, 26) (5, 18) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 26) (7, 16) (4, 17) (4, 20) (4, 0) (19, 1) (19, 27) (19, 12) (29, 21) (29, 16) (29, 12) (27, 23) (27, 19) (6, 14) (6, 12) (18, 0) (18, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 19) (1, 10) (10, 24) (10, 1) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 29) (12, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method works as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Node 2, 13, 26 have 1 connection each.  
Node 6, 7, 10, 13, 26 have 2 connections each.  
Node 15, 18, 19, 27, 29 have 3 connections each.  
Node 1, 3, 5, 11, 24, 9 have 4 connections each.  
Node 4, 8, 10, 16, 22, 28 have 5 connections each.  
Node 0, 20, 21, 23, 25 have 6 connections each.  
Node 12, 14 have 7 connections each.  
Node 17 have 8 connections.  

2. Relabel the nodes based on their sorted order:

Node 2(1), 13(2), 26(3), 6(4), 7(5), 10(6), 13(7), 26(8), 15(9), 18(10), 19(11), 27(12), 29(13), 1(14), 3(15), 5(16), 11(17), 24(18), 9(19), 4(20), 8(21), 10(22), 16(23), 22(24), 28(25), 0(26), 20(27), 21(28), 23(29), 25(30), 12(31), 14(32), 17(33).

3. Counting Triangles:

Now, we'll go through each edge and count the triangles formed by the lower labeled vertex with fewer connections.

- Looking at the given edges, we find the following triangles:
<4, 7, 16>, <0, 20, 25>, <0, 17, 25>, <0, 4, 20>, <0, 4, 17>, <1, 9, 19>, <5, 7, 26>, <5, 7, 16>, <5, 7, 28>, <9, 22, 28>, <9, 22, 11>, <10, 12, 29>, <10, 1, 19>, <10, 1, 24>, <11, 15, 16>, <12, 14, 6>, <12, 14, 19>, <16, 21, 24>, <16, 23, 28>, <18, 20, 0>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [19].
