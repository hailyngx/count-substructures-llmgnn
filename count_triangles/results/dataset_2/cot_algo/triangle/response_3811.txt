Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 29) (7, 1) (21, 3) (21, 10) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 27) (10, 21) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 2) (20, 5) (28, 29) (28, 22) (28, 14) (28, 24) (29, 7) (29, 28) (29, 16) (22, 28) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 6) (22, 24) (26, 22) (26, 2) (26, 3) (3, 21) (3, 13) (3, 26) (3, 12) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 27) (19, 12) (4, 22) (4, 12) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 4) (12, 25) (16, 29) (16, 2) (16, 6) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 18) (9, 14) (25, 12) (25, 6) (25, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 5) (2, 17) (2, 26) (2, 16) (2, 25) (24, 28) (24, 22) (24, 0) (24, 5) (0, 13) (0, 24) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 6) (14, 28) (14, 9) (27, 13) (27, 19) (5, 10) (5, 20) (5, 1) (5, 24) (6, 22) (6, 16) (6, 25) (6, 18) (6, 23) (23, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) from least to most and then checking for triangles based on the edges between the nodes. 

The sorted list of nodes based on their degrees is as follows:  
Node 9: degree 1  
Nodes 7, 17, 20, 9, 24, 18, 5, 4, 0, 27, 23, 14, 29: degree 2  
Nodes 1, 3, 11, 25, 21, 26: degree 3  
Nodes 8, 16, 6, 10: degree 4  
Nodes 13, 19, 22: degree 5  
Node 12: degree 6  

Based on this ordering, we can start counting the triangles by checking the edges in a way that the lower degree nodes are first in each edge. The total number of triangles is [7].  

The unique triangles found are:  
<1, 8, 13>  
<1, 8, 19>  
<1, 8, 11>  
<1, 7, 29>  
<1, 13, 3>  
<1, 13, 0>  
<1, 13, 27>
