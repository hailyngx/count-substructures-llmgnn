Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 2: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 9: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 5: degree 6
Node 3: degree 6
Node 6: degree 6
Node 7: degree 6
Node 0: degree 6

Now, we will relabel the nodes as follows based on their degrees:
Node 2 -> Node 0
Node 4 -> Node 1
Node 9 -> Node 2
Node 1 -> Node 3
Node 8 -> Node 4
Node 5 -> Node 5
Node 3 -> Node 6
Node 6 -> Node 7
Node 7 -> Node 8
Node 0 -> Node 9

Revising the edges based on the relabeling:
(5, 9) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 8) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 2)

Now, counting the triangles:
Total number of triangles: [15]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 9>, <7, 9, 0>
