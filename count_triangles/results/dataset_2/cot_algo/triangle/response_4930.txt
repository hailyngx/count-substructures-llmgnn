Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 11) (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 16) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 19) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 17) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 15) (18, 19) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 12) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 4) (0, 6) (0, 16) (0, 11) (16, 9) (16, 0) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 11) (1, 13) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 19) (14, 8) (14, 12) 

Response:
The graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. Here is the list of edges:
(3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 11) (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 16) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 19) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 17) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 15) (18, 19) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 12) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 4) (0, 6) (0, 16) (0, 11) (16, 9) (16, 0) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 11) (1, 13) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 19) (14, 8) (14, 12)

After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following order: <1, 5, 16, 18, 14, 20, 2, 4, 17, 6, 3, 13, 12, 11, 7, 9, 19, 8, 15, 10>

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in this graph. The total number of triangles found is [24].

These triangles are:
<2, 3, 17>
<2, 4, 17>
<3, 4, 17>
<2, 8, 13>
<10, 12, 19>
<6, 17, 13>
<0, 6, 16>
<0, 11, 19>
<1, 7, 13>
<6, 7, 17>
<4, 5, 9>
<12, 14, 19>
<3, 9, 15>
<7, 10, 12>
<3, 15, 18>
<3, 6, 17>
<2, 3, 8>
<10, 12, 14>
<0, 11, 15>
<11, 15, 19>
<4, 9, 16>
<3, 6, 15>
<9, 13, 17>
<8, 13, 17>
