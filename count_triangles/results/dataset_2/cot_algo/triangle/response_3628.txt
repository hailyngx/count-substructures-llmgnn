Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (0, 2) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 10) (12, 7) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 10) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections).

After sorting the vertices from least to most connections, the new ordering is as follows: 

Nodes: 0, 13, 2, 5, 8, 3, 12, 14, 10, 11, 6, 1, 9, 7, 4

Using this ordering, let's check for triangles formed by shared connections between nodes with lower labels in each edge:

1. Triangles with Node 0:
- No triangles with Node 0.

2. Triangles with Node 13:
- No triangles with Node 13.

3. Triangles with Node 2:
- No triangles with Node 2.

4. Triangles with Node 5:
- No triangles with Node 5.

5. Triangles with Node 8:
- No triangles with Node 8.

6. Triangles with Node 3:
- No triangles with Node 3.

7. Triangles with Node 12:
- No triangles with Node 12.

8. Triangles with Node 14:
- No triangles with Node 14.

9. Triangles with Node 10:
- No triangles with Node 10.

10. Triangles with Node 11:
- Unique Triangle: <4, 6, 11>

11. Triangles with Node 6:
- Unique Triangle: <4, 6, 9>

12. Triangles with Node 1:
- Unique Triangle: <4, 7, 1>

13. Triangles with Node 9:
- Unique Triangle: <6, 9, 11>
- Unique Triangle: <7, 9, 12>

14. Triangles with Node 7:
- Unique Triangle: <4, 7, 13>

15. Triangles with Node 4:
- Unique Triangle: <4, 10, 11>
- Unique Triangle: <4, 7, 10>
- Unique Triangle: <4, 6, 11>
- Unique Triangle: <4, 1, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].

Unique triangles found in the graph:
<4, 6, 11>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 1>, <6, 9, 11>, <7, 9, 12>, <4, 7, 13>, <4, 10, 11>, <4, 7, 10>, <4, 1, 7>.
