Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows based on the provided edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (9), (8), (2)
- 1: (9), (5)
- 2: (8), (4), (0)
- 3: (5), (9), (4), (7)
- 4: (5), (7), (8), (3), (2)
- 5: (9), (6), (8), (1), (4), (3)
- 6: (9), (7), (5)
- 7: (6), (4), (3), (8)
- 8: (5), (4), (7), (2), (0)
- 9: (5), (6), (3), (1), (0)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <2, 4, 8>

Total number of triangles: [3]
