Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 11) (7, 9) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 1) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 3) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 16) (0, 6) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 19) (1, 10) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 19) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (18, 14) (18, 15) (19, 16) (19, 1) (12, 6) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 11) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 8) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 15) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 11) (15, 13) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree. Here is the sorted list of nodes with their degrees:
Node 5: degree 3
Node 7: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 4: degree 1
Node 10: degree 4
Node 17: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 16: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 18: degree 2
Node 19: degree 2
Node 12: degree 1
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 14: degree 4
Node 8: degree 3
Node 11: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 15: degree 4

Now, we will go through each edge, and if the node with the lower label has fewer connections, we will count the triangles formed by shared connections.

The total number of triangles found inside brackets [] is [11].
The unique triangles found are:
<2, 5, 16>
<2, 5, 17>
<2, 11, 15>
<2, 11, 4>
<3, 8, 10>
<3, 8, 15>
<3, 8, 17>
<3, 13, 14>
<3, 13, 15>
<6, 0, 1>
<6, 1, 14>
