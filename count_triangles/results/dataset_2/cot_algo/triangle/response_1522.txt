Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 2) (4, 8) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 18) (10, 7) (10, 5) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 11) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 9) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 18) (9, 12) (15, 0) (2, 17) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 3) (16, 12) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 0) (0, 15) (0, 2) (0, 3) (13, 14) (13, 12) (6, 19) (6, 11) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 6)
