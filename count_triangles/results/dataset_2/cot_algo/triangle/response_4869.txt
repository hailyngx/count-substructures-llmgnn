Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 4) (7, 5) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 0) (14, 11) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges.

First, let's construct the graph by listing the nodes with their connections:

Node 0: 6, 1, 11, 2, 9  
Node 1: 5, 0, 8, 7  
Node 2: 3, 13, 4, 12, 0, 11  
Node 3: 5, 8, 2  
Node 4: 9, 11, 7, 2  
Node 5: 1, 3, 7, 12  
Node 6: 9, 8, 0, 13  
Node 7: 1, 10, 4, 5, 9  
Node 8: 6, 1, 3  
Node 9: 6, 4, 10, 7, 13, 0  
Node 10: 9, 11, 12, 7  
Node 11: 10, 0, 4, 2, 14  
Node 12: 10, 5, 2  
Node 13: 6, 9, 2  
Node 14: 11

Next, we will assign labels to the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 14 (degree 1) : Labeled as 0  
Node 3 (degree 2) : Labeled as 1  
Node 5 (degree 2) : Labeled as 2  
Node 12 (degree 2) : Labeled as 3  
Node 8 (degree 3) : Labeled as 4  
Node 4 (degree 4) : Labeled as 5  
Node 1 (degree 4) : Labeled as 6  
Node 13 (degree 4) : Labeled as 7  
Node 2 (degree 6) : Labeled as 8  
Node 7 (degree 5) : Labeled as 9  
Node 6 (degree 4) : Labeled as 10  
Node 10 (degree 5) : Labeled as 11  
Node 0 (degree 5) : Labeled as 12  
Node 9 (degree 6) : Labeled as 13  
Node 11 (degree 5) : Labeled as 14  

Now, we will list out the triangles by checking shared connections between edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

Triangles in the graph:  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 2, 9>  
<0, 4, 7>  
<0, 4, 9>  
<1, 5, 7>  
<1, 7, 9>  
<2, 5, 12>  
<2, 8, 13>  
<4, 7, 9>  
<7, 9, 10>  

Total number of triangles: [10]
