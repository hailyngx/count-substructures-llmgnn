Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (1, 17) (1, 8) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 6) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 18) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 3) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 12) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (15, 19) (15, 0) (6, 10) (6, 17) (6, 2) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 2) (4, 9) (4, 16) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 5) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 4) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 12) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 14) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Vertex 0 has degree 2
Vertex 1 has degree 2
Vertex 2 has degree 3
Vertex 3 has degree 2
Vertex 4 has degree 2
Vertex 5 has degree 3
Vertex 6 has degree 3
Vertex 7 has degree 4
Vertex 8 has degree 4
Vertex 9 has degree 3
Vertex 10 has degree 3
Vertex 11 has degree 3
Vertex 12 has degree 4
Vertex 13 has degree 3
Vertex 14 has degree 3
Vertex 15 has degree 2
Vertex 16 has degree 3
Vertex 17 has degree 3
Vertex 18 has degree 4
Vertex 19 has degree 4

Based on the degree-based ordering, the edges that form triangles are:
<10, 11, 7>
<8, 1, 17>
<18, 19, 14>
<6, 17, 10>
<7, 19, 14>
<3, 8, 18>
<4, 9, 16>
<12, 13, 18>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
