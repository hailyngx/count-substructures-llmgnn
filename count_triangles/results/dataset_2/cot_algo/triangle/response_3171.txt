Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (15, 3) (15, 2) (15, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 17) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 6) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 17) (1, 9) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (7, 0) (7, 17) (7, 6) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 11) (9, 1) (9, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 4) (11, 15) (11, 12) (11, 9) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 13) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 16) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 4) (16, 13) (16, 4) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: (3, 15), (3, 0), (3, 10), (15, 2), (15, 11), (8, 19), (8, 5), (8, 17), (13, 16), (13, 4), (13, 6), (2, 18), (2, 12), (2, 5), (0, 7), (1, 17), (1, 9), (17, 19), (17, 7), (7, 6), (19, 4), (12, 11), (9, 1), (5, 18), (5, 4), (11, 9), (6, 12), (16, 4)

Now, we will list the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:
Nodes by degree: 1, 0, 9, 16, 6, 18, 7, 10, 8, 5, 19, 11, 12, 13, 17, 2, 3, 15, 4

Now, we will count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 5]

<3, 0, 7>
<4, 5, 18>
<4, 5, 17>
<4, 5, 13>
<4, 16, 13>
