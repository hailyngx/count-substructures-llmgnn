Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (6, 5), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 7), (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 9), (4, 8), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 0), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 8), (5, 2), (5, 7), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 5), (2, 0), (2, 7), (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 2), (0, 7), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 2), (7, 0)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Degree of each node:     
0: 4
1: 4
2: 4
3: 5
4: 3
5: 6
6: 1
7: 4
8: 4
9: 5

Sorted nodes based on degrees:
6, 4, 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 3, 5

Now, let's count the number of triangles and list them:

Triangles: 
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 0, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 1>
<3, 0, 7>
<4, 8, 5>
<8, 0, 7>

Total number of triangles: [10]
