Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 
Vertices: 9, 3, 8, 7, 5, 6, 4, 1, 0, 2

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method considering the given edges:

Triangles: 
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 0>
<2, 5, 1>
<2, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [11]
