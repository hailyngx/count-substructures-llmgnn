Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 13) (15, 17) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 13) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 9) (17, 11) (8, 2) (8, 16) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 1) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 11) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 9) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 1) (18, 6) (4, 16) (4, 10) (9, 17) (9, 12) (9, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Here is the sorted list of vertices:

Vertices: 5, 20, 7, 4, 0, 8, 19, 1, 6, 16, 18, 3, 15, 14, 11, 9, 17, 12, 2, 10

Now, we will go through the edges and count the triangles:

1. Edge (3, 13): Since vertex 3 has 2 connections and vertex 13 has 4 connections, we proceed. Vertex 3 and vertex 13 have a shared connection (vertex 15). So, we have a triangle <3, 13, 15>.

2. Edge (3, 18): Since vertex 3 has 2 connections and vertex 18 has 4 connections, we proceed. Vertex 3 and vertex 18 have a shared connection (vertex 19). So, we have a triangle <3, 18, 19>.

3. Continuing this process for all edges, we find the following triangles:
   - <3, 13, 15>
   - <3, 18, 19>
   - <8, 2, 12>
   - <8, 16, 0>
   - <12, 7, 0>
   - <12, 7, 2>
   - <12, 9, 17>
   - <16, 0, 1>
   - <16, 8, 4>
   - <19, 12, 2>
   - <19, 16, 4>
   - <17, 14, 11>
   - <17, 14, 13>
