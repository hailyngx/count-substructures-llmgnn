Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 8) (5, 14) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 12) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 12) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. 

Sorting nodes by their degrees in ascending order:
```
Node 4 has degree 6
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 3
Node 9 has degree 2
Node 10 has degree 6
Node 11 has degree 4
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 0 has degree 3
Node 14 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 13 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 5
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 12 has degree 6
```

Based on degree-based ordering, the sorting of nodes is:
```
7, 9, 6, 0, 14, 5, 3, 11, 13, 8, 1, 2, 10, 4, 12
```

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Starting with edge (7, 4): Node 7 < Node 4, check shared neighbors {9}. One triangle found: <7, 4, 9>.
- Moving to the next edge, (9, 7): Node 7 > Node 9, continue.
- Edge (6, 1): Node 6 < Node 1, shared neighbors {}, no triangle.
- Edge (6, 2): Node 6 < Node 2, shared neighbors {}, no triangle.
- Edge (6, 12): Node 6 < Node 12, shared neighbors {}, no triangle.
- Edge (9, 13): Node 9 < Node 13, shared neighbors {7}, one triangle found: <9, 13, 7>.
- Edge (10, 4): Node 4 < Node 10, shared neighbors {11}, one triangle found: <10, 4, 11>.
- Edge (10, 11): Node 10 > Node 11, continue.
- Edge (10, 0): Node 10 < Node 0, shared neighbors {3, 1}, two triangles found: <10, 0, 3> and <10, 0, 1>.
- Edge (10, 3): Node 10 < Node 3, shared neighbors {0, 12}, one triangle found: <10, 3, 12>.
- Edge (10, 8): Node 8 < Node 10, shared neighbors {4, 1}, one triangle found: <8, 10, 4>.
- Edge (10, 12): Node 10 < Node 12, shared neighbors {11, 3}, two triangles found: <10, 12, 11> and <10, 12, 3>.
- Edge (11, 4): Node 4 < Node 11, shared neighbors {10}, one triangle found: <11, 4, 10>.
- Edge (11, 13): Node 11 < Node 13, shared neighbors {12}, one triangle found: <11, 13, 12>.
- Edge (11, 12): Node 11 < Node 12, shared neighbors {10, 13}, two triangles found: <11, 12, 10> and <11, 12, 13>.
- Edge (8, 4): Node 4 < Node 8, shared neighbors {10}, one triangle found: <8, 4, 10>.
- Edge (8, 10): Node 8 < Node 10, shared neighbors {4, 1}, one triangle found: <8, 10, 4>.
- Remaining edges do not form triangles based on the degree-based ordering. 

Total number of triangles: [12]
Triangles: <7, 4, 9>, <9, 13, 7>, <10, 4, 11>, <10, 0, 3>, <10, 0, 1>, <10, 3, 12>, <8, 10, 4>, <10, 12, 11>, <10, 12, 3>, <11, 4, 10>, <11, 13, 12>, <11, 12, 10>
