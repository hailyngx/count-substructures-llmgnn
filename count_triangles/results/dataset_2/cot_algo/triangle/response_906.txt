The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 1) (0, 27) (0, 23) (0, 1) (27, 0) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 29) (3, 25) (3, 26) (3, 22) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 26) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 15) (6, 16) (9, 10) (9, 25) (9, 18) (22, 3) (23, 0) (23, 16) (23, 28) (23, 19) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 28) (21, 20) (21, 29) (28, 23) (28, 13) (28, 12) (28, 2) (15, 10) (15, 17) (15, 5) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 1) (26, 3) (26, 25) (26, 2) (2, 28) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 20) (24, 8) (24, 5) (24, 29) (29, 11) (29, 21) (29, 24) (12, 8) (12, 28) (12, 20) (12, 5) (12, 14) (20, 21) (20, 2) (20, 12) (20, 5) (19, 4) (19, 23) (19, 2) (5, 15) (5, 24) (5, 12) (5, 20) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 12) (16, 6) (16, 23) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 18) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: 
- 0: {27, 23, 1}
- 1: {4, 7, 0, 18}
- 2: {28, 26, 19, 20}
- 3: {25, 26, 22}
- 4: {7, 19, 1, 17}
- 5: {15, 24, 12, 20}
- 6: {16}
- 7: {4, 14, 1}
- 8: {13, 24, 12}
- 9: {10, 25, 18}
- 10: {11, 17, 15, 9}
- 11: {10, 29}
- 12: {8, 28, 20, 5, 14}
- 13: {8, 28}
- 14: {7, 18, 12}
- 15: {10, 17, 5}
- 16: {6, 23}
- 17: {4, 10, 15}
- 18: {9, 14, 1}
- 19: {4, 23, 2}
- 20: {21, 2, 12, 5}
- 21: {20, 29}
- 22: {3}
- 23: {0, 16, 28, 19}
- 24: {8, 5, 29}
- 25: {3, 9, 26}
- 26: {3, 25, 2}
- 27: {0}
- 28: {23, 13, 12, 2}
- 29: {11, 21, 24}

Now, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabel them:

Sorted nodes: 27, 6, 22, 21, 0, 18, 13, 16, 11, 7, 8, 3, 5, 14, 19, 2, 25, 10, 9, 26, 4, 1, 15, 12, 20, 24, 23, 17, 28, 29

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Number of triangles: [63]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 18>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 19>
<0, 5, 15>
<0, 5, 20>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 8, 12>
