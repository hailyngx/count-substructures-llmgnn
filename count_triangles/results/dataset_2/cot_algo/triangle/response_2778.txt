Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 23) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 25) (15, 24) (15, 11) (14, 17) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 9) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 27) (10, 20) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 27) (2, 3) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 9) (29, 17) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 18) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 22) (27, 10) (27, 11) (27, 12) (27, 1) (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 26) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 26) (19, 21) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 20) (6, 12) (6, 20) (6, 13) (28, 9) (28, 23) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 24) (5, 21) (13, 6) (13, 5) (1, 17) (1, 27) (1, 0) (18, 29) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 25) (16, 8) (16, 0) (22, 12) (9, 17) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 28) (9, 25) (25, 15) (25, 14) (25, 0) (25, 9) (21, 19) (21, 5) (24, 15) (24, 7) (24, 5) (20, 10) (20, 26) (20, 6) (23, 3) (23, 28) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0: [1, 16, 25]
1: [0, 9, 17, 27]
2: [3, 9, 19, 29]
3: [2, 15, 23]
4: [7]
5: [12, 13, 21, 24]
6: [12, 13, 20]
7: [4, 8, 24]
8: [7, 16, 26]
9: [1, 2, 11, 17, 25, 28]
10: [11, 20, 27]
11: [9, 10, 15, 27]
12: [5, 6, 22, 27]
13: [5, 6]
14: [17, 25]
15: [3, 11, 24, 25]
16: [0, 8]
17: [1, 9, 14, 29]
18: [29]
19: [2, 19, 21, 26]
20: [6, 10, 20, 26]
21: [5, 19]
22: [12]
23: [3, 28]
24: [5, 7, 15]
25: [0, 9, 14, 15]
26: [8, 19, 20]
27: [1, 10, 11, 12]
28: [9, 23]
29: [2, 17, 18]
```

Now, we will calculate the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:

<1, 17, 9>
<3, 15, 24>
<9, 17, 25>
<10, 11, 27>
<1, 9, 25>
<2, 3, 15>
<9, 11, 27>
<5, 12, 24>
<0, 1, 25>
<1, 9, 27>
<2, 9, 29>
<5, 7, 24>
<5, 21, 19>
<5, 24, 15>
<8, 16, 0>
<9, 25, 14>
<12, 5, 24>
<2, 19, 26>
<9, 28, 23>
<0, 25, 15>
<1, 27, 11>
<2, 29, 17>
<9, 17, 14>
<11, 27, 10>
<15, 24, 3>
<5, 13, 6>
<5, 21, 19>
<9, 25, 15>
<14, 17, 25>
<20, 26, 19>

[30] triangles.
