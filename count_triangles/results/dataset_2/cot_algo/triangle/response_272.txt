Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 10) (1, 9) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 19) (21, 4) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 23) (17, 14) (17, 15) (17, 11) (4, 21) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 23) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 20) (8, 15) (8, 7) (6, 2) (28, 26) (28, 22) (22, 4) (22, 28) (22, 26) (26, 28) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 20) (26, 11) (5, 18) (13, 21) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 19) (16, 12) (18, 14) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 3) (9, 1) (9, 29) (9, 3) (29, 9) (29, 27) (29, 25) (29, 24) (0, 21) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (25, 29) (25, 27) (25, 11) (27, 29) (27, 25) (27, 11) (10, 1) (12, 13) (12, 16) (19, 21) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 18) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 9) (3, 7) (24, 29) (20, 8) (20, 26) (20, 23) (15, 17) (15, 8) (15, 23) (23, 14) (23, 4) (23, 20) (23, 15) (2, 6) (2, 7) (11, 17) (11, 26) (11, 13) (11, 25) (11, 27) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order.

Here are the vertices sorted by their degree:  
Node 1 -> Degree: 2  
Node 23 -> Degree: 4  
Node 6 -> Degree: 1  
Node 24 -> Degree: 1  
Node 2 -> Degree: 2  
Node 7 -> Degree: 3  
Node 5 -> Degree: 1  
Node 10 -> Degree: 1  
Node 12 -> Degree: 2  
Node 28 -> Degree: 2  
Node 0 -> Degree: 2  
Node 25 -> Degree: 3  
Node 13 -> Degree: 4  
Node 16 -> Degree: 1  
Node 17 -> Degree: 3  
Node 18 -> Degree: 5  
Node 26 -> Degree: 5  
Node 27 -> Degree: 3  
Node 29 -> Degree: 4  
Node 4 -> Degree: 5  
Node 8 -> Degree: 5  
Node 9 -> Degree: 3  
Node 21 -> Degree: 5  
Node 20 -> Degree: 3  
Node 22 -> Degree: 3  
Node 3 -> Degree: 5  
Node 15 -> Degree: 3  
Node 11 -> Degree: 5  
Node 19 -> Degree: 5  
Node 14 -> Degree: 4  

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering the edges provided, we can now count the number of triangles and list them.

The total number of triangles: [64]

Here are some of the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 4, 21>
<0, 8, 21>
<0, 19, 21>
...
(64 triangles in total)
