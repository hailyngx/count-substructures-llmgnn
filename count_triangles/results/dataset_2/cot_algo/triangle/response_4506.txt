Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 5) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 0) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 4) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 13) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in efficiently counting the number of triangles in a graph. 

The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:  
Nodes: 3, 14, 4, 5, 12, 0, 8, 2, 13, 10, 11, 7, 9, 1, 6

Using this order, let's count the triangles:
- Looking at the edge (3, 8), there are no triangles.
- Looking at the edge (14, 0), there are no triangles.
- Looking at the edge (4, 12), there are no triangles.
- Looking at the edge (5, 11), there are no triangles.
- Looking at the edge (12, 7), there are no triangles.
- Looking at the edge (0, 7), there are no triangles.
- Looking at the edge (8, 9), there are no triangles.
- Looking at the edge (2, 10), there are no triangles.
- Looking at the edge (13, 4), there are no triangles.
- Looking at the edge (10, 11), there are no triangles.
- Looking at the edge (11, 7), there are no triangles.
- Looking at the edge (7, 6), there are no triangles.
- Looking at the edge (9, 6), there are no triangles.
- Looking at the edge (1, 9), there are no triangles.
- Looking at the edge (6, 1), there are no triangles.
- Looking at the edge (1, 5), there are no triangles.
- Looking at the edge (13, 5), there are no triangles.
