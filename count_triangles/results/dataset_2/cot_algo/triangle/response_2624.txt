Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 0) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 11) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 18) (19, 11) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (7, 10) (16, 17) (16, 14) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 5) (14, 6) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 16) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 0) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 11) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 18) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is a step-by-step process. Let's first sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0: 5 connections
1: 3 connections
4: 2 connections
7: 1 connection
8: 3 connections
19: 1 connection
18: 3 connections
17: 3 connections
16: 2 connections
6: 4 connections
9: 2 connections
13: 3 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
10: 5 connections
5: 4 connections
11: 5 connections
12: 4 connections
14: 5 connections
15: 5 connections

Now, we will count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 8]
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 17>
<0, 1, 18>
<3, 1, 17>
<3, 1, 18>
<14, 6, 2>
<14, 6, 10>
<14, 15, 10>
