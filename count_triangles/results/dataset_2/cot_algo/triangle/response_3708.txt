Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 0) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 4) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 0) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 10) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 2) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and edges:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 11), (5, 3), (5, 14), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 13), (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 7), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 11), (3, 4), (8, 1), (8, 13), (8, 0), (13, 9), (13, 8), (13, 2), (13, 7), (13, 0), (11, 5), (11, 3), (11, 14), (11, 4), (4, 3), (4, 11), (4, 12), (4, 0), (4, 14), (12, 4), (12, 2), (12, 10), (12, 0), (6, 1), (6, 10), (6, 2), (2, 9), (2, 13), (2, 12), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 0), (14, 5), (14, 11), (14, 4), (14, 10), (7, 1), (7, 13), (7, 2), (10, 12), (10, 6), (10, 14), (0, 8), (0, 13), (0, 4), (0, 12), (0, 2)

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degrees (number of connections):
Nodes sorted by degrees: 10, 7, 6, 5, 8, 14, 12, 0, 11, 7, 6, 2, 13, 9, 13

Now, we will go through each edge to count the number of triangles.

[Total number of triangles: 36]
<1, 9, 13>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 8, 13>
<1, 6, 10>
<2, 9, 13>
<2, 6, 10>
<2, 6, 12>
<2, 0, 13>
<2, 0, 12>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 11>
<3, 4, 14>
<4, 11, 14>
<4, 3, 11>
<4, 0, 12>
