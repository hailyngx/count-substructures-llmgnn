Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 29) (15, 14) (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 16) (6, 0) (6, 29) (6, 13) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 28) (9, 12) (5, 9) (5, 23) (5, 7) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 7) (10, 20) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 4) (4, 27) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 20) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 16) (20, 10) (20, 4) (20, 23) (24, 8) (24, 26) (26, 24) (26, 23) (21, 0) (21, 10) (21, 29) (19, 29) (19, 23) (23, 5) (23, 20) (23, 26) (23, 19) (1, 25) (1, 28) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 28) (25, 1) (25, 12) (29, 15) (29, 6) (29, 21) (29, 19) (16, 27) (16, 8) (18, 12) (28, 9) (28, 1) (28, 2) (28, 13) (14, 15) (14, 27) (14, 4) (14, 13) (7, 5) (7, 10) (11, 12) (13, 0) (13, 6) (13, 28) (13, 14) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 25) (12, 18) (12, 11) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29
Edges: (3, 15), (3, 2), (3, 12), (15, 29), (15, 14), (0, 27), ..., (12, 11)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

0 - 5 connections
1 - 2 connections
2 - 3 connections
3 - 4 connections
4 - 5 connections
5 - 4 connections
6 - 3 connections
7 - 2 connections
8 - 3 connections
9 - 4 connections
10 - 4 connections
11 - 2 connections
12 - 5 connections
13 - 5 connections
14 - 4 connections
15 - 3 connections
16 - 2 connections
17 - 3 connections
18 - 1 connection
19 - 2 connections
20 - 3 connections
21 - 3 connections
23 - 5 connections
24 - 2 connections
25 - 2 connections
26 - 2 connections
27 - 4 connections
28 - 4 connections
29 - 4 connections

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 42]
