Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 3) (11, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 0) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 1) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 0) 

Response:
We start by sorting the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 5
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections. 

From the given edges, we can proceed with the following edges:
- (8, 4) (Node 8 and Node 4)
- (8, 13) (Node 8 and Node 13)
- (11, 3) (Node 11 and Node 3)
- (11, 7) (Node 11 and Node 7)
- (12, 0) (Node 12 and Node 0)
- (12, 5) (Node 12 and Node 5)
- (14, 7) (Node 14 and Node 7)
- (14, 1) (Node 14 and Node 1)
- (14, 2) (Node 14 and Node 2)
- (14, 3) (Node 14 and Node 3)

Now, we check for shared connections to find the triangles:
- Triangle <8, 4, 10>
- Triangle <8, 4, 13>
- Triangle <12, 0, 1>
- Triangle <12, 0, 13>
- Triangle <12, 5, 2>
- Triangle <12, 5, 3>
- Triangle <14, 7, 1>
- Triangle <14, 7, 5>
- Triangle <14, 2, 3>
- Triangle <14, 3, 5>

There are a total of 10 triangles in this given graph. Hence, the output is [10].
