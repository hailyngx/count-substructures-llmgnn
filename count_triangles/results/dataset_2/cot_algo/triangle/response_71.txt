Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 3) (20, 23) (20, 28) (25, 8) (25, 0) (10, 21) (10, 9) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 1) (17, 29) (17, 16) (17, 22) (17, 2) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 16) (28, 20) (28, 29) (28, 24) (29, 17) (29, 28) (29, 1) (29, 4) (12, 27) (12, 21) (12, 14) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 1) (27, 5) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 6) (3, 20) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 14) (3, 24) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 3) (23, 20) (23, 11) (23, 4) (5, 27) (5, 26) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 22) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 24) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 14) (16, 17) (16, 18) (24, 28) (24, 3) (24, 19) (24, 0) (1, 11) (1, 29) (1, 27) (1, 7) (8, 25) (8, 6) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 7) (6, 26) (6, 8) (0, 25) (0, 15) (0, 24) (0, 22) (0, 9) (9, 10) (9, 0) (22, 17) (22, 15) (22, 0) (13, 2) (4, 29) (4, 23) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their connections. After relabeling the vertices according to their connections, the graph looks like this with vertices and their connections in brackets:

0 [7]
1 [5]
2 [3]
3 [5]
4 [4]
5 [4]
6 [2]
7 [3]
8 [2]
9 [3]
10 [2]
11 [5]
12 [3]
13 [1]

35. (17, 18, 26)
36. (17, 29, 28)
37. (23, 20, 28)

The total number of triangles is [37].  
Unique triangles:
