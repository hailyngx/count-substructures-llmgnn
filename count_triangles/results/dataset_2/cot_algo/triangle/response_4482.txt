The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 24) (15, 3) (15, 5) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 19) (27, 22) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 16) (1, 27) (1, 26) (1, 7) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 29) (26, 11) (26, 4) (4, 26) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 8) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 25) (8, 18) (8, 2) (8, 28) (19, 0) (19, 26) (19, 23) (19, 9) (17, 27) (17, 4) (17, 13) (17, 9) (11, 0) (11, 26) (11, 23) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 29) (23, 19) (23, 11) (16, 0) (16, 27) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 5) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 6) (6, 12) (6, 29) (24, 3) (24, 25) (9, 19) (9, 17) (9, 20) (29, 26) (29, 13) (29, 6) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 10) (7, 1) (7, 14) (21, 13) (21, 5) (20, 9) (14, 16) (14, 7) (14, 25) (22, 0) (22, 27) (22, 10) (25, 2) (25, 24) (25, 14) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 21) (10, 2) (10, 28) (10, 22) 

Response:
The vertices and their degrees are as follows:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 2
Node 16: degree 5
Node 17: degree 4
Node 18: degree 3
Node 19: degree 4
Node 20: degree 2
Node 21: degree 2
Node 22: degree 3
Node 23: degree 2
Node 24: degree 2
Node 25: degree 3
Node 26: degree 5
Node 27: degree 4
Node 28: degree 3
Node 29: degree 3

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the edges to consider are:
(3, 15), (2, 8), (6, 12), (7, 14), (10, 28), (5, 21), (9, 20), (16, 27), (19, 23), (17, 13), (4, 18), (0, 11), (1, 26), (29, 6)

After checking the shared connections for each edge, the total number of triangles is [18].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 11, 26>, <0, 19, 23>, <0, 26, 1>, <0, 26, 11>, <1, 26, 11>, <2, 8, 18>, <4, 16, 27>, <5, 16, 27>, <5, 16, 14>, <5, 16, 21>, <9, 17, 13>, <9, 17, 29>, <9, 19, 17>, <9, 19, 26>, <12, 16, 6>, <12, 16, 14>, <14, 16, 25>, <19, 26, 23>
