Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 11) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 1) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 10) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the nodes (vertices) based on their degrees (number of connections). Then, the nodes are relabeled accordingly:

Node 5: degree 2
Node 7: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 14: degree 5
Node 9: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 11: degree 5
Node 13: degree 5
Node 10: degree 5
Node 12: degree 6
Node 0: degree 7

Now, starting from the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles formed:

- Triangle <9, 11, 2>
- Triangle <9, 11, 0>
- Triangle <9, 11, 1>
- Triangle <9, 11, 14>
- Triangle <7, 12, 4>
- Triangle <7, 12, 3>
- Triangle <7, 12, 13>
- Triangle <7, 6, 13>
- Triangle <1, 8, 0>
- Triangle <1, 8, 7>
- Triangle <1, 8, 14>
- Triangle <4, 12, 10>
- Triangle <4, 3, 10>
- Triangle <3, 14, 1>
- Triangle <14, 7, 8>
- Triangle <14, 6, 13>
- Triangle <6, 7, 8>
- Triangle <13, 12, 10>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [18].
