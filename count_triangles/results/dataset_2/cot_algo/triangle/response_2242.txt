Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 19) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 17) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (5, 19) (5, 14) (19, 9) (19, 5) (19, 3) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 18) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 2) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 15) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (3, 19) (3, 0) (3, 18) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 0) (16, 17) (16, 10) (1, 4) (1, 2) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 1) (15, 9) (15, 4) (14, 7) (14, 5) (18, 13) (18, 3) (10, 7) (10, 16) (10, 8) (8, 6) (8, 10) 

Response:
The vertices with their number of connections are:
- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 4
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 4
- Vertex 8: degree 2
- Vertex 9: degree 5
- Vertex 10: degree 3
- Vertex 11: degree 3
- Vertex 12: degree 3
- Vertex 13: degree 4
- Vertex 14: degree 2
- Vertex 15: degree 2
- Vertex 16: degree 2
- Vertex 17: degree 4
- Vertex 18: degree 2
- Vertex 19: degree 3

The sorted vertices are:
Vertices in order: 1, 2, 5, 8, 0, 10, 11, 3, 12, 19, 6, 7, 13, 17, 4, 15, 14, 16, 18, 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles in the graph are:
Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles: <0, 6, 9>, <0, 9, 11>, <3, 13, 17>, <3, 13, 18>, <7, 12, 4>, <7, 12, 6>, <4, 12, 6>, <10, 16, 17>
