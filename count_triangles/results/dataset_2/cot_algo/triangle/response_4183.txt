Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (3, 8) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 4) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 9),
(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9),
(2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 8),
(3, 7), (3, 8),
(4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 6), (4, 9),
(5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 6),
(6, 4), (6, 5),
(7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 9),
(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 7),
(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 7)

Next, let's reorder the nodes based on their degrees from lowest to highest:

Nodes: 3, 6, 7, 5, 9, 8, 4, 2, 0, 1

Now, we will count the triangles. 

Total number of triangles: [9]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<1, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<0, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
<1, 7, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<0, 8, 9>
