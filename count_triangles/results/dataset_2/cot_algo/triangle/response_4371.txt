Response:
The graph has the following nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 21), (5, 16), (9, 21), (9, 28), (1, 3), (1, 25), (3, 1), (3, 11), (3, 20), (3, 18), (7, 0), (7, 26), (7, 13), (7, 17), (21, 5), (21, 9), (21, 19), (21, 26), (10, 17), (10, 23), (17, 7), (17, 10), (8, 23), (8, 20), (8, 15), (23, 10), (23, 8), (23, 2), (23, 25), (2, 23), (2, 12), (2, 19), (18, 3), (18, 11), (18, 24), (18, 12), (29, 24), (0, 5), (0, 7), (22, 26), (22, 27), (26, 7), (26, 21), (26, 22), (26, 15), (11, 3), (11, 18), (11, 15), (25, 1), (25, 23), (25, 27), (27, 22), (27, 25), (27, 20), (27, 6), (4, 5), (4, 12), (4, 13), (12, 2), (12, 18), (12, 4), (19, 21), (19, 2), (6, 27), (6, 24), (6, 13), (6, 16), (24, 18), (24, 29), (24, 6), (24, 16), (16, 5), (16, 6), (16, 24), (15, 8), (15, 26), (15, 11), (13, 7), (13, 4), (13, 6), (20, 3), (20, 8), (20, 27), (20, 14), (20, 28), (28, 9), (28, 20), (14, 20)

Sorting the nodes based on the number of connections in ascending order, we get:

Nodes by degree: 19, 29, 14, 10, 5, 9, 1, 2, 4, 12, 22, 3, 8, 11, 13, 0, 6, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 27, 25, 17, 23, 26, 21, 18, 28

Calculating the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [28]

Unique triangles found:
<2, 18, 12>, <2, 18, 4>, <2, 19, 21>, <2, 19, 6>, <18, 3, 11>, <18, 3, 20>, <18, 12, 4>, <18, 12, 24>, <18, 12, 6>, <18, 12, 16>, <18, 24, 29>, <18, 24, 6>, <3, 1, 25>, <3, 11, 15>, <3, 11, 18>, <3, 11, 24>, <3, 11, 6>, <3, 20, 8>, <3, 20, 27>, <3, 18, 11>, <3, 18, 24>, <4, 5, 12>, <4, 5, 13>, <7, 0, 5>, <7, 0, 13>, <7, 13, 6>, <8, 15, 11>, <8, 15, 26>
