Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and the given 40 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: 4, 9, 3, 5
- 1: 4, 6, 9, 2, 8
- 2: 5, 1, 3
- 3: 4, 2, 8, 0, 5
- 4: 7, 0, 1, 6, 3
- 5: 2, 0, 3
- 6: 4, 9, 1, 8
- 7: 4, 9
- 8: 6, 9, 3, 1
- 9: 7, 6, 8, 1, 0

Next, we sort the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes sorted by degree: [7, 2, 5, 0, 8, 6, 3, 1, 9, 4]

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 4, 8>]

Total number of triangles: [10]
