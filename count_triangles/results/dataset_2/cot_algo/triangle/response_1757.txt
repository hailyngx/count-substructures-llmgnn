Response:
The graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: (15, 7), (15, 12), (15, 28), (27, 25), (27, 29), (27, 13), (4, 22), (4, 9), (7, 15), (7, 5), (7, 17), (1, 3), (1, 2), (3, 1), (3, 24), (3, 6), (3, 29), (17, 7), (17, 13), (17, 8), (29, 27), (29, 3), (29, 19), (6, 3), (6, 28), (6, 12), (6, 0), (6, 16), (28, 15), (28, 6), (28, 20), (13, 27), (13, 17), (13, 16), (13, 11), (25, 27), (25, 0), (14, 26), (14, 21), (26, 14), (26, 10), (26, 16), (22, 4), (22, 20), (10, 26), (10, 18), (10, 20), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 24), (5, 7), (5, 2), (24, 3), (24, 2), (24, 19), (24, 21), (18, 10), (18, 23), (18, 0), (18, 8), (23, 18), (23, 0), (9, 4), (19, 29), (19, 24), (19, 16), (16, 6), (16, 13), (16, 26), (16, 19), (0, 6), (0, 25), (0, 18), (0, 23), (8, 17), (8, 18), (8, 20), (20, 28), (20, 22), (20, 10), (20, 8), (11, 13), (11, 21), (11, 12), (12, 15), (12, 6), (12, 11), (21, 14), (21, 24), (21, 11)

After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order:  

Nodes: 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 27, 5, 9, 1, 8, 10, 14, 2, 4, 7, 17, 18, 20, 24, 26, 0, 6, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 28, 29, 3

Now, let's count the triangles and list them:

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 6, 16>
<2, 3, 24>
<8, 10, 18>
<13, 16, 26>
<15, 27, 28>
<11, 12, 21>
