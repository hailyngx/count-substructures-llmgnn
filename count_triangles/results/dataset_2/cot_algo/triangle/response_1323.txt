Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 7), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 2), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 3), (7, 6), (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 8), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 6), (8, 5), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 0), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2), (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 6), (0, 9), (0, 3), (0, 8)

Now, let's proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Nodes sorted by degree: 3, 0, 8, 1, 4, 9, 2, 7, 6, 5

Triangles found:
