Node 13 (degree 2)
Node 3 (degree 3)
Node 7 (degree 3)
Node 18 (degree 3)
Node 10 (degree 4)
Node 8 (degree 4)
Node 22 (degree 4)
Node 9 (degree 4)
Node 12 (degree 4)
Node 28 (degree 4)
Node 19 (degree 5)
Node 21 (degree 5)
Node 23 (degree 5)
Node 14 (degree 5)
Node 17 (degree 5)
Node 24 (degree 5)
Node 25 (degree 5)
Node 26 (degree 5)
Node 29 (degree 5)
Node 1 (degree 6)
Node 16 (degree 6)
Node 27 (degree 6)
Node 4 (degree 7)
Node 5 (degree 7)
Node 11 (degree 7)
Node 15 (degree 7)

Number of triangles = 47
