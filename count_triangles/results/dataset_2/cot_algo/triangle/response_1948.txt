Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 5) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 15) (9, 20) (9, 23) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 27) (3, 19) (15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 29) (10, 11) (10, 12) (20, 9) (20, 25) (20, 14) (20, 23) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 0) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 22) (6, 22) (6, 4) (6, 27) (28, 8) (28, 27) (28, 19) (8, 28) (8, 0) (19, 3) (19, 28) (14, 20) (14, 26) (14, 1) (26, 14) (26, 2) (27, 3) (27, 25) (27, 6) (27, 28) (2, 5) (2, 26) (2, 1) (2, 24) (2, 21) (24, 16) (24, 2) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 3) (17, 18) (13, 16) (13, 7) (13, 21) (21, 2) (21, 13) (21, 29) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 4) (0, 25) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 23) (4, 6) (4, 1) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 29) (22, 12) (22, 6) (23, 9) (23, 20) (23, 0) (23, 29) (29, 15) (29, 21) (29, 18) (29, 23) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges based on the node with the lower label to avoid duplicate counting:

Edges:
(0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 23) (0, 25)
(1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 14)
(2, 5) (2, 21) (2, 24) (2, 26)
(3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 27)
(4, 6)
(5, 16) (5, 17)
(6, 22) (6, 27)
(7, 13)
(8, 28)
(9, 15) (9, 20)
(10, 11) (10, 12)
(11, 16)
(12, 22)
(13, 16)
(14, 20) (14, 26)
(15, 29)
(16, 17) (16, 24) (16, 13)
(17, 18)
(18, 29)
(19, 28)
(20, 23)
(21, 29)
(22, 6)
(23, 29)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, relabel the nodes according to the number of connections:
Nodes sorted by degree:
0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17, 18, 5, 14, 19, 21, 22, 26, 27, 29, 2, 3, 6, 9, 11, 13, 16, 20, 23, 24, 25, 15, 28

Now, we count the triangles using the sorted list of edges:

Triangles:
<0, 8, 28>
<0, 8, 18>
<0, 8, 25>
<0, 18, 29>
<0, 18, 23>
<0, 18, 25>
<0, 23, 29>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 4, 14>
<2, 5, 16>
<2, 5, 17>
<2, 21, 29>
<2, 21, 13>
<2, 21, 2>
<2, 21, 1>
<2, 24, 16>
<2, 26, 14>
<2, 26, 2>
<2, 26, 1>
<3, 15, 9>
<3, 15, 29>
<3, 17, 5>
<3, 17, 16>
<3, 17, 18>
<3, 19, 28>
<3, 27, 6>
<3, 27, 28>
<3, 27, 25>
<4, 6, 22>
<5, 17, 16>
<9, 15, 29>
<14, 20, 23>
<16, 17, 5>
<16, 13, 7>
<18, 29, 23>
<29, 15, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles is [37] inside brackets.
