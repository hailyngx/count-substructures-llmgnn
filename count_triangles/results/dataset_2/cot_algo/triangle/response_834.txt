Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
Let's follow the steps to count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort the vertices by their degree (number of connections):
Nodes in order of degree: 1 (degree 2), 3 (degree 3), 6 (degree 3), 8 (degree 4), 0 (degree 5), 4 (degree 5), 7 (degree 5), 2 (degree 5), 9 (degree 6), 5 (degree 6)

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degree:
Node 1 (degree 2) - Label 0
Node 3 (degree 3) - Label 1
Node 6 (degree 3) - Label 2
Node 8 (degree 4) - Label 3
Node 0 (degree 5) - Label 4
Node 4 (degree 5) - Label 5
Node 7 (degree 5) - Label 6
Node 2 (degree 5) - Label 7
Node 9 (degree 6) - Label 8
Node 5 (degree 6) - Label 9

3. Go through the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
- (0, 1) can form a triangle with shared connection 7: <0, 1, 7>
- (0, 3) can form a triangle with shared connection 8: <0, 3, 8>
- (0, 7) can form a triangle with shared connection 5: <0, 4, 7>
- (0, 8) can form a triangle with shared connection 3 and 6: <0, 3, 8> and <0, 6, 8>
- (1, 7) can form a triangle with shared connection 0: <1, 0, 7>
- (3, 8) can form a triangle with shared connection 0 and 2: <3, 0, 8> and <3, 2, 8>
- (4, 6) can form a triangle with shared connection 5: <4, 6, 7>
- (9, 5) can form a triangle with shared connection 7: <9, 5, 2>
- (9, 8) can form a triangle with shared connection 3: <9, 3, 8>
- (5, 7) can form a triangle with shared connection 9: <5, 7, 2>
- (5, 9) can form a triangle with shared connection 2: <5, 9, 7>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [10] and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 0, 7>, <3, 0, 8>, <3, 2, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, and <5, 7, 2>.
