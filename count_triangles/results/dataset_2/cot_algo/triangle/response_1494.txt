Response:
The given graph is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: (3, 25), (3, 7), (3, 10), (3, 4), (3, 8), (25, 27), (25, 28), (25, 11), (8, 13), (8, 20), (8, 7), (13, 1), (13, 28), (13, 6), (22, 23), (22, 19), (22, 12), (23, 11), (23, 5), (0, 20), (0, 14), (20, 26), (7, 12), (12, 5), (14, 0), (4, 18), (4, 29), (18, 27), (18, 21), (26, 20), (10, 2), (15, 9), (15, 29), (15, 17), (11, 21), (16, 19), (27, 17), (1, 13), (5, 24), (9, 24), (6, 13)

Let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Degree of each node:
0: 3, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 6, 4: 3, 5: 5, 6: 2, 7: 4, 8: 4, 9: 3, 10: 2, 11: 4, 12: 3, 13: 4, 14: 1, 15: 4, 16: 1, 17: 5, 18: 4, 19: 2, 20: 3, 21: 3, 22: 3, 23: 4, 24: 2, 25: 3, 26: 2, 27: 3, 28: 2, 29: 3

Vertices sorted by degree: [1, 16, 14, 26, 6, 19, 10, 24, 0, 1, 16, 26, 6, 19, 10, 24, 0, 5, 12, 29, 22, 25, 8, 20, 27, 28, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 21, 23]

Vertices labels after sorting: {1: 0, 16: 1, 14: 2, 26: 3, 6: 4, 19: 5, 10: 6, 24: 7, 0: 8, 5: 8, 12: 10, 29: 11, 22: 11, 25: 13, 8: 14, 20: 15, 27: 16, 28: 17, 3: 18, 4: 19, 7: 20, 9: 21, 11: 22, 13: 23, 15: 24, 17: 25, 18: 26, 21: 27, 23: 28}

Total number of triangles: [14]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 3, 8>, <0, 8, 20>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 14, 0>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 3, 8>, <5, 11, 23>, <5, 11, 21>, <5, 12, 22>, <5, 23, 11>, <5, 23, 2>, <11, 21, 18>, <13, 6, 2>
