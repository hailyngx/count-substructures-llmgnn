Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 12) (15, 2) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 9) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 2) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 13) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 8) (18, 8) (18, 7) (12, 15) (12, 6) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 12) (19, 11) (7, 18) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 13) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first sort the vertices by their degree in increasing order and relabel them accordingly. Then, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed by shared connections.

Sorted vertices with their degrees:
(7, 3), (18, 3), (12, 3), (19, 3), (4, 3), (3, 4), (15, 4), (10, 4), (16, 4), (6, 4), (17, 4), (8, 4), (1, 4), (13, 4), (0, 5), (5, 5), (2, 5), (11, 5), (14, 5), (9, 5)

Now, let's count the triangles:

Triangles:
- <0, 5, 1>
- <0, 5, 16>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <0, 1, 13>
- <3, 6, 17>
- <3, 6, 12>
- <1, 5, 13>
- <0, 1, 13>
- <0, 13, 14>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <8, 5, 16>
- <17, 2, 15>
- <5, 8, 18>
- <9, 10, 11>
- <9, 11, 13>
- <11, 9, 13>
- <10, 11, 17>
- <10, 11, 9>
- <10, 16, 0>
- <10, 16, 5>
- <11, 17, 10>
- <11, 17, 2>
- <14, 13, 0>

Total number of triangles: [22]
