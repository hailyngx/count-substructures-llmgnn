Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 13) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 5) (10, 17) (10, 4) (11, 19) (11, 15) (17, 6) (17, 10) (17, 18) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 13) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 5) (7, 3) (7, 14) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 5) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 15) (15, 9) (15, 11) (15, 19) (14, 7) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 18) (13, 16) (13, 12) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 12) 

Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. 
Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 11 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 14 has 2 connections.
Node 16 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 12 has 3 connections.
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 10 has 4 connections.
Node 17 has 4 connections.
Node 15 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 18 has 5 connections.
Node 5 has 5 connections.
Node 6 has 5 connections.
Node 1 has 5 connections.
Node 2 has 5 connections.
Node 13 has 6 connections.
Node 4 has 6 connections.
Node 9 has 6 connections.
Node 19 has 6 connections.

Now, we will count the number of triangles:
Since we have sorted the nodes by their degrees, we will only consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

The triangles found are:
<4, 10, 17>
<1, 4, 10>
<1, 12, 13>
<0, 1, 12>
<0, 1, 13>
<3, 5, 12>
<3, 5, 16>
<3, 7, 14>
<3, 7, 19>
<3, 19, 15>
<5, 12, 16>
<13, 16, 0>
<13, 16, 5>
<5, 16, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
