Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 16) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 5) (1, 4) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 7) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 4) (2, 16) (18, 7) (18, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (16, 3) (16, 10) (16, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (14, 19) (14, 13) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 9) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 14) (5, 15) (5, 11) (5, 12) (9, 10) (9, 7) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 5) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 11) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The degree of each node is as follows:  
Node 0: 2  
Node 1: 2  
Node 2: 2  
Node 3: 3  
Node 4: 4  
Node 5: 4  
Node 6: 4  
Node 7: 4  
Node 8: 4  
Node 9: 2  
Node 10: 4  
Node 11: 3  
Node 12: 4  
Node 13: 3  
Node 14: 2  
Node 15: 4  
Node 16: 4  
Node 17: 4  
Node 18: 3  
Node 19: 4  

The vertices sorted by their degree are:  
0, 1, 2, 9, 14, 3, 11, 13, 18, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16, 17, 15, 19, 4  

Now, let's check the triangles:  
- Triangle <0, 13, 15>  
- Triangle <0, 13, 19>  
- Triangle <1, 4, 8>  
- Triangle <1, 4, 17>  
- Triangle <1, 4, 6>  
- Triangle <1, 4, 7>  
- Triangle <1, 8, 17>  
- Triangle <1, 6, 17>  
- Triangle <1, 7, 17>  
- Triangle <2, 3, 16>  
- Triangle <2, 16, 10>  
- Triangle <3, 6, 10>  
- Triangle <3, 6, 11>  
- Triangle <3, 7, 17>  
- Triangle <3, 16, 10>  
- Triangle <4, 6, 10>  
- Triangle <4, 6, 11>  
- Triangle <4, 7, 17>  
- Triangle <4, 8, 17>  
- Triangle <5, 6, 11>  
- Triangle <5, 6, 12>  
- Triangle <5, 11, 12>  
- Triangle <6, 7, 17>  
- Triangle <8, 12, 17>  
- Triangle <10, 12, 17>  
- Triangle <15, 19, 0>  
- Triangle <15, 19, 14>  
- Triangle <16, 10, 6>  
- Triangle <16, 10, 3>  
- Triangle <16, 2, 3>  
- Triangle <17, 18, 12>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [30].
