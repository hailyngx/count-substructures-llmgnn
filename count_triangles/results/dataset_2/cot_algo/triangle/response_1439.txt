Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 2) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 1) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 4) (4, 14) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 9) (4, 13) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 13) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Nodes:
Node 5: 5 edges
Node 6: 3 edges
Node 0: 5 edges
Node 14: 3 edges
Node 3: 3 edges
Node 11: 4 edges
Node 7: 3 edges
Node 10: 4 edges
Node 2: 5 edges
Node 12: 4 edges
Node 1: 6 edges
Node 4: 5 edges
Node 8: 1 edge
Node 9: 4 edges
Node 13: 5 edges

Based on this ordering, we will consider the edges accordingly. 

The total number of triangles found in the graph is [6].

Unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 10, 1>
<2, 14, 4>
<3, 11, 1>
<4, 13, 9>
