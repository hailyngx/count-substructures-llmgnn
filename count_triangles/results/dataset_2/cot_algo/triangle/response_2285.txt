Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 8) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 4) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 14) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then relabel the vertices accordingly. 

The sorted list of vertices with their degrees is:
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 6

Now, we iterate through each edge and check if the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. We then find the shared connections to count the triangles.

From the given edges, the triangles found are:
- <5, 2, 11>
- <3, 7, 11>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <10, 6, 8>
- <7, 0, 6>
- <3, 4, 14>
- <10, 1, 11>
- <3, 9, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
