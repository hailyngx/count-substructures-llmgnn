Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by degree are: 

Vertex 2 with degree 2   
Vertex 7 with degree 3   
Vertex 3 with degree 4   
Vertex 1 with degree 4   
Vertex 6 with degree 4   
Vertex 0 with degree 4   
Vertex 9 with degree 4   
Vertex 5 with degree 5   
Vertex 8 with degree 5   
Vertex 4 with degree 6   


Now, let's count the triangles: 

Triangles found:  
<0, 4, 5>  
<0, 4, 7>  
<0, 4, 8>  
<0, 5, 6>  
<0, 5, 8>  
<0, 6, 9>  
<1, 3, 5>  
<1, 5, 6>  
<1, 5, 8>  
<3, 5, 8>  

Total number of triangles: [10]
