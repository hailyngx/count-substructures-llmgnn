Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 18) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 0) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 16) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 2) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 3) (16, 18) (16, 13) (16, 12) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 19) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 0) (7, 10) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 17) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 14) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 12) (17, 2) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
- 0: {4, 18, 3}
- 1: {5, 6, 19}
- 2: {15, 9, 17}
- 3: {5, 12, 0}
- 4: {8, 12, 6, 0}
- 5: {13, 15, 1, 3}
- 6: {4, 1, 19}
- 7: {10}
- 8: {4, 18}
- 9: {11, 14, 2}
- 10: {11, 15, 7}
- 11: {10, 9}
- 12: {4, 15, 16, 17, 3}
- 13: {5, 16}
- 14: {18, 9, 19}
- 15: {10, 5, 12, 2}
- 16: {18, 13, 12}
- 17: {12, 2}
- 18: {8, 18, 14, 16, 0}
- 19: {1, 6, 14}

Now, we need to sort the vertices by their degree from least connected to most connected:

Vertices sorted by degree: [7, 0, 1, 2, 17, 8, 13, 16, 9, 19, 3, 6, 4, 5, 10, 15, 14, 12, 18, 11]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the total number of triangles is [14].

Unique triangles found: 
<4, 12, 15>
<4, 12, 17>
<4, 0, 18>
<4, 8, 18>
<1, 6, 19>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 13>
<5, 14, 19>
<2, 9, 14>
<2, 9, 17>
<2, 12, 17>
<9, 12, 17>
<14, 16, 18>
<12, 16, 18>
