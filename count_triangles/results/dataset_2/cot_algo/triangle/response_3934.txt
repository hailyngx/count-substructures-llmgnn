Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 28) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 15) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 20) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 24) (18, 0) (18, 29) (15, 8) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 24) (20, 13) (20, 15) (20, 1) (17, 27) (29, 18) (19, 15) (19, 26) (19, 10) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 11) (26, 16) (26, 7) (6, 10) (6, 22) (28, 5) (28, 10) (28, 23) (0, 8) (0, 18) (7, 26) (7, 25) (7, 16) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 16) (25, 22) (25, 10) (11, 2) (11, 26) (11, 23) (23, 26) (23, 28) (23, 11) (23, 16) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 26) (16, 7) (16, 25) (16, 23) (16, 12) (1, 2) (1, 20) (1, 25) (1, 4) (27, 17) (27, 24) (27, 14) (3, 24) (14, 4) (14, 27) (24, 8) (24, 18) (24, 15) (24, 27) (24, 3) (10, 5) (10, 19) (10, 6) (10, 28) (10, 25) (22, 6) (22, 25) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0: [8, 18]
1: [2, 4, 25]
2: [1, 11, 12, 18]
3: [24]
4: [1, 9, 14]
5: [9, 10, 28]
6: [10, 22]
7: [16, 25, 26]
8: [0, 13, 15, 24]
9: [4, 5]
10: [5, 6, 10, 19, 25, 28]
11: [2, 23, 26]
12: [2, 16]
13: [8, 20]
14: [4, 27]
15: [8, 15, 19, 20, 24]
16: [7, 12, 23, 25, 26]
17: [27]
18: [2, 18, 24, 29]
19: [15, 19, 26]
20: [13, 15, 1]
21: []
22: [6, 25]
23: [11, 16, 23, 26, 28]
24: [3, 8, 15, 18, 24, 27]
25: [7, 16, 22, 25, 10]
26: [7, 11, 16, 19, 23]
27: [14, 17, 24]
28: [5, 10, 23]
29: [18]
```

Now, we will list the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: 
- <2, 18, 24>
- <1, 4, 14>
- <1, 25, 10>
- <0, 8, 18>
- <2, 12, 16>
- <2, 18, 29>
- <2, 11, 26>
- <4, 9, 5>
- <5, 10, 28>
- <7, 25, 16>
- <10, 25, 22>
- <10, 19, 26>
- <11, 2, 12>
- <11, 26, 23>
- <16, 12, 2>
- <16, 25, 22>
- <18, 24, 15>
- <18, 24, 27>
- <23, 26, 11>

Total number of triangles: [19]
