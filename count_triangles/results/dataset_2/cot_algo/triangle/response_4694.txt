Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 22) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 18) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 24) (7, 26) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 26) (8, 25) (8, 0) (8, 26) (23, 6) (23, 20) (23, 27) (12, 25) (12, 15) (12, 9) (28, 11) (28, 19) (5, 21) (5, 27) (13, 21) (20, 23) (20, 22) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 19) (1, 17) (1, 19) (25, 8) (25, 12) (25, 27) (25, 29) (27, 23) (27, 5) (27, 25) (15, 12) (15, 2) (15, 24) (19, 14) (19, 28) (19, 0) (19, 1) (21, 5) (21, 13) (21, 9) (21, 18) (21, 2) (6, 23) (6, 29) (3, 4) (3, 24) (3, 22) (24, 7) (24, 15) (24, 3) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 21) (29, 14) (29, 25) (29, 6) (29, 26) (26, 7) (26, 17) (26, 8) (26, 29) (22, 11) (22, 20) (22, 3) (10, 18) (18, 16) (18, 21) (18, 10) (2, 15) (2, 21) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

We will first construct the graph with nodes and edges based on the provided information. The degrees of each node will be mentioned to facilitate the sorting process.

Nodes and their degrees:
0(5), 1(2), 2(2), 3(3), 4(3), 5(2), 6(2), 7(4), 8(3), 
9(4), 10(1), 11(3), 12(3), 13(1), 14(3), 15(3), 16(3), 
17(3), 18(4), 19(4), 20(2), 21(5), 22(3), 23(3), 24(3), 
25(4), 26(4), 27(3), 28(2), 29(4)

After sorting nodes by degree (in ascending order), we get the following relabeled nodes:
1, 2, 13, 10, 20, 5, 6, 3, 4, 28, 11, 23, 24, 7, 25, 15, 16, 17, 22, 8, 12, 0, 21, 14, 29, 18, 19, 27, 26, 9

Now, we will count the triangles by considering the edges in the following order:

(1,17), (1,19), (13,21), (10,18), (20,22), (5,21), (6,23), (3,22), (3,24), (4,7), (4,9), (4,3), (28,19), 
(11,16), (11,22), (23,27), (24,15), (25,27), (25,29), (15,2), (15,24), (16,0), (16,18), (17,14), (17,26), (22,20), 
(9,12), (9,21), (0,9), (0,19), (7,0), (7,24), (7,26), (8,0), (8,26), (25,8), (25,12), (26,29)

The total number of triangles found is: [15]

The unique triangles found are: 
<13, 21, 5>, <13, 21, 9>, <4, 9, 21>, <25, 27, 29>, <16, 18, 21>, <3, 22, 20>, <3, 22, 27>, <4, 3, 24>, 
<4, 9, 12>, <15, 2, 24>, <15, 24, 3>, <0, 19, 21>, <0, 9, 21>, <7, 0, 24>, <25, 12, 9>
