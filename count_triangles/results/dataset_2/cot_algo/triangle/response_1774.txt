Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 24) (11, 5) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 28) (16, 1) (2, 29) (2, 1) (29, 11) (29, 2) (29, 9) (29, 15) (12, 22) (12, 26) (27, 18) (27, 10) (10, 27) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 13) (17, 10) (17, 6) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 8) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 24) (20, 0) (20, 23) (22, 12) (22, 26) (22, 21) (26, 12) (26, 22) (26, 21) (24, 11) (24, 0) (24, 23) (24, 25) (28, 16) (28, 0) (9, 29) (9, 15) (9, 3) (21, 10) (21, 22) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 14) (23, 11) (23, 20) (23, 24) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 7) (14, 21) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 15) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 13) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 18) (19, 4) (15, 29) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 25) (18, 27) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 11) (5, 18) (25, 24) (25, 21) (25, 15) (13, 10) (13, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degrees. Let's label the nodes accordingly:

Node 0: degree 4
Node 3: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 2: degree 2
Node 6: degree 3
Node 13: degree 2
Node 19: degree 2
Node 8: degree 3
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 18: degree 4
Node 14: degree 5
Node 25: degree 3
Node 15: degree 4
Node 10: degree 5
Node 17: degree 2
Node 20: degree 2
Node 28: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 26: degree 3
Node 21: degree 5
Node 22: degree 3
Node 27: degree 3
Node 29: degree 5
Node 23: degree 4
Node 24: degree 4
Node 11: degree 5
Node 12: degree 2
Node 16: degree 3

Now, let's count the triangles following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [14]

Unique triangles:
<0, 8, 24>
<0, 24, 28>
<1, 2, 29>
<1, 13, 10>
<1, 16, 11>
<4, 8, 0>
<6, 7, 14>
<6, 14, 21>
<7, 14, 18>
<9, 29, 15>
<10, 21, 26>
<10, 21, 25>
<15, 21, 25>
<18, 27, 14>
