Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 14) (4, 16) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 9) (7, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (1, 7) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 18) (15, 1) (15, 14) (8, 17) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 3) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 0) (19, 18) (19, 14) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 1) (18, 19) (12, 16) (12, 6) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 0) (3, 9) (3, 13) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 15) (14, 19) (10, 6) (10, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 17) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). The sorted vertices are then relabeled accordingly.

Node degrees:
0: 5
1: 4
2: 3
3: 2
4: 5
5: 2
6: 3
7: 5
8: 1
9: 4
10: 2
11: 2
12: 2
13: 3
14: 5
15: 3
16: 5
17: 5
18: 5
19: 3

Vertices in degree-based order:
8, 3, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 1, 15, 19, 2, 6, 0, 14, 18, 7, 9, 16, 4, 17

Now, we consider the edges in the order specified:

1. Edge (11, 13): Do not form a triangle as both vertices have the same degree.
2. Edge (11, 2): Do not form a triangle as 2 has a lower degree than 11.
