Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 18) (27, 14) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 22) (3, 1) (3, 26) (8, 23) (8, 9) (8, 25) (8, 11) (23, 8) (23, 13) (23, 19) (9, 8) (9, 22) (22, 1) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 29) (22, 7) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 21) (26, 3) (26, 2) (26, 20) (26, 16) (17, 20) (17, 6) (17, 5) (20, 26) (20, 17) (20, 12) (20, 10) (4, 27) (4, 10) (11, 8) (11, 0) (28, 24) (28, 18) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 6) (16, 26) (16, 0) (16, 21) (21, 24) (21, 16) (21, 2) (2, 15) (2, 26) (2, 21) (2, 12) (12, 20) (12, 2) (12, 5) (6, 1) (6, 22) (6, 17) (6, 0) (10, 20) (10, 4) (10, 0) (7, 22) (13, 23) (13, 25) (13, 18) (25, 8) (25, 13) (25, 19) (5, 24) (5, 17) (5, 12) (14, 27) (14, 1) (18, 27) (18, 28) (18, 13) (18, 29) (19, 23) (19, 25) (29, 22) (29, 18) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 29}

Edges: 
- 0: {11, 16, 10, 6}
- 1: {3, 6, 14, 22}
- 2: {15, 26, 21, 12}
- 3: {1, 26}
- ...
- 29: {18, 22}

Next, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Sort the vertices based on their degrees in non-decreasing order:
Vertices and their corresponding sorted labels:
- 11 (degree 2) -> 0
- 22 (degree 3) -> 1
- 26 (degree 4) -> 2
- 6 (degree 4) -> 3
- 0 (degree 4) -> 4
- 1 (degree 4) -> 5
- 10 (degree 3) -> 6
- 21 (degree 3) -> 7
- 16 (degree 3) -> 8
- 12 (degree 3) -> 9
- 20 (degree 4) -> 10
- 4 (degree 2) -> 11
- ...

Now, we will count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found:

Total number of triangles: [20]

Unique triangles:
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 11, 6>
<0, 6, 10>
<0, 16, 6>
<0, 21, 16>
<1, 3, 26>
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 6, 22>
<1, 22, 29>
<2, 15, 21>
<2, 15, 26>
<2, 15, 12>
<2, 26, 12>
<3, 26, 16>
<6, 22, 29>
<8, 23, 13>
<8, 23, 19>
<8, 25, 13>
<8, 25, 19>
<13, 23, 19>
