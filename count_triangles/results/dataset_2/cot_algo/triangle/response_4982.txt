Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
The vertices in the graph can be represented as follows sorted by their degree:

Vertices: 0 (degree 3), 3 (degree 3), 8 (degree 1), 4 (degree 5), 1 (degree 4), 7 (degree 5), 2 (degree 6), 6 (degree 5), 9 (degree 4), 5 (degree 7)

With the vertices relabelled accordingly, the edges can be represented as follows based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

Edges: (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 9), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 7), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 7), (6, 9)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].

And the unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 9>.
