Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 16) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 18) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (17, 0) (17, 5) (5, 17) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 18) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 0) (15, 18) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 8) (12, 3) (16, 4) (16, 10) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 13) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) (14, 8) (14, 13) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 18) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 14) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections).
2. Relabel the nodes from 0 to 19 based on their degree in ascending order.
3. For each edge, check if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Count triangles based on shared connections.

The sorted nodes based on their degrees are: 
Node 17 with degree 2
Node 6 with degree 2
Node 12 with degree 2
Node 16 with degree 2
Node 15 with degree 3
Node 7 with degree 3
Node 1 with degree 3
Node 13 with degree 3
Node 5 with degree 4
Node 14 with degree 4
Node 3 with degree 5
Node 4 with degree 5
Node 10 with degree 5
Node 11 with degree 5
Node 18 with degree 6
Node 19 with degree 6
Node 2 with degree 6
Node 8 with degree 6
Node 9 with degree 6
Node 0 with degree 7

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<2, 3, 10>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 9, 11>
<2, 9, 8>
<2, 9, 13>
<2, 0, 5>
<2, 0, 15>
<3, 7, 11>
<4, 16, 10>
<8, 9, 14>
<9, 11, 10>
<13, 14, 19>
<18, 0, 15>
