Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 17) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 16) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 18) (7, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 11) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 0) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 19) (1, 0) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 0) (12, 8) (12, 19) (16, 9) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 6) (6, 15) (6, 14) (6, 19) (13, 15) (13, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, each node is assigned a label accordingly. Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph.

The sorted list of nodes based on their degrees:
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 12: 1 connection
Node 13: 2 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 16: 1 connection
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 19: 4 connections

Now, we will check the edges based on the degree-based ordering method. Considering only the cases where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

Triangles found:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 10>
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 1, 10>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 18>
<3, 11, 17>
<4, 8, 17>
<5, 9, 10>
<5, 9, 14>
<5, 10, 14>
<15, 17, 18>
<2, 13, 15>
<2, 13, 17>
<2, 13, 5>
<2, 13, 6>

Count of triangles: [15]
