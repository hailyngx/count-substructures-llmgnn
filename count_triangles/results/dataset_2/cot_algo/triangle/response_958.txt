Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are:
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 6
Node 8: Degree 6
Node 4: Degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles:
(2, 7) - No triangles
(3, 7) - No triangles
(2, 3) - No triangles
(0, 7) - No triangles
(5, 7) - No triangles
(1, 7) - No triangles
(9, 7) - No triangles
(2, 3) - Triangle <2, 3, 1>
(0, 3) - No triangles
(0, 2) - No triangles
(5, 0) - No triangles
(1, 0) - No triangles
(5, 2) - No triangles
(1, 2) - No triangles
(9, 2) - Triangle <9, 2, 3>
(9, 3) - Triangle <9, 3, 6>
(9, 0) - No triangles
(5, 3) - Triangle <5, 3, 1>
(1, 5) - Triangle <1, 5, 0>
(9, 5) - No triangles
(9, 1) - No triangles
(9, 6) - Triangle <9, 6, 3>
(9, 8) - Triangle <9, 8, 4>
(8, 6) - Triangle <8, 6, 4>
(8, 4) - No triangles

Total number of triangles = [6]
Unique triangles found: <2, 3, 1>, <9, 2, 3>, <9, 3, 6>, <5, 3, 1>, <1, 5, 0>, <9, 6, 3>.
