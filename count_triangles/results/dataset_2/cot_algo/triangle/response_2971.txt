Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (26, 14) (26, 16) (26, 12) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 25) (15, 28) (15, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 20) (8, 4) (8, 29) (8, 6) (8, 22) (8, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 29) (12, 26) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (17, 29) (17, 13) (17, 25) (29, 8) (29, 7) (29, 17) (29, 21) (21, 29) (21, 13) (21, 5) (21, 18) (28, 15) (28, 18) (0, 7) (0, 10) (20, 4) (20, 11) (20, 10) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 20) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 11) (13, 24) (13, 19) (19, 13) (19, 24) (19, 6) (23, 24) (23, 27) (16, 26) (16, 1) (14, 26) (14, 5) (25, 15) (25, 17) (25, 1) (11, 20) (11, 13) (11, 6) (24, 13) (24, 19) (24, 23) (1, 16) (1, 25) (1, 2) (1, 22) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 1) (18, 8) (18, 21) (18, 28) (22, 8) (22, 1) (5, 21) (5, 14) (27, 3) (27, 23) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, we relabel the nodes accordingly.

After sorting the nodes, the new labels based on their degree are as follows:
Node 3: 0 connections -> Label 0
Node 14: 0 connections -> Label 1
Node 16: 0 connections -> Label 2
Node 1: 1 connection -> Label 3
Node 5: 1 connection -> Label 4
Node 20: 1 connection -> Label 5
Node 23: 1 connection -> Label 6
Node 27: 1 connection -> Label 7
Node 29: 3 connections -> Label 8
Node 19: 2 connections -> Label 9
Node 11: 3 connections -> Label 10
Node 6: 2 connections -> Label 11
Node 2: 3 connections -> Label 12
Node 18: 3 connections -> Label 13
Node 22: 2 connections -> Label 14
Node 13: 4 connections -> Label 15
Node 7: 3 connections -> Label 16
Node 0: 2 connections -> Label 17
Node 10: 4 connections -> Label 18
Node 17: 4 connections -> Label 19
Node 4: 4 connections -> Label 20
Node 24: 3 connections -> Label 21
Node 8: 5 connections -> Label 22
Node 21: 4 connections -> Label 23
Node 25: 3 connections -> Label 24
Node 12: 4 connections -> Label 25
Node 26: 4 connections -> Label 26
Node 15: 5 connections -> Label 27
Node 9: 0 connections -> Label 28

Now, we will check for triangles by examining the edges based on the labels. Let's find the total number of triangles:

[66]

And the unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 15>
<2, 12, 15>
<2, 12, 26>
<2, 15, 27>
<4, 12, 20>
<4, 18, 22>
<6, 11, 19>
<7, 12, 29>
<7, 17, 29>
<8, 10, 20>
<12, 15, 25>
<13, 19, 24>
<15, 17, 25>
<18, 21, 28>
<19, 24, 27>
<19, 23, 24>
<21, 22, 28>
