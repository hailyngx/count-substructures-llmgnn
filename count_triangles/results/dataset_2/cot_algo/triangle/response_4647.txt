Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 12) (11, 4) (11, 13) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 0) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Sorted vertices by their degrees:  
Node 0: Degree 4  
Node 5: Degree 4  
Node 10: Degree 3  
Node 11: Degree 2  
Node 14: Degree 2  
Node 8: Degree 3  
Node 7: Degree 5  
Node 13: Degree 5  
Node 1: Degree 3  
Node 3: Degree 4  
Node 12: Degree 6  
Node 2: Degree 4  
Node 4: Degree 5  
Node 6: Degree 4  
Node 9: Degree 5

Considering edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

Triangles found:
<3, 4, 13>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 12>
<7, 12, 0>
<7, 12, 5>
<7, 12, 8>
<7, 0, 1>
<7, 0, 12>
<10, 1, 7>
<13, 10, 7>
<13, 10, 1>

Total number of triangles: [11]
