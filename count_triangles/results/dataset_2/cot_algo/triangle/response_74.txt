Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 14) (9, 3) (9, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) (13, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 10), (1, 4), (1, 8)
(3, 11), (3, 9), (3, 12)
(10, 1), (10, 11), (10, 7), (10, 5)
(11, 3), (11, 10), (11, 4)
(4, 1), (4, 11), (4, 13), (4, 5), (4, 2)
(8, 1), (8, 14), (8, 12), (8, 7)
(5, 10), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 0), (5, 7), (5, 14)
(6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 14), (6, 7), (6, 2)
(0, 5), (0, 14), (0, 2)
(14, 8), (14, 5), (14, 6), (14, 0), (14, 7), (14, 12)
(2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 0), (2, 9)
(7, 10), (7, 8), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 14)
(9, 3), (9, 2)
(12, 3), (12, 8), (12, 14)
(13, 4)

After relabeling based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the new ordering of vertices based on the number of connections is:
9, 13, 0, 7, 6, 12, 2, 3, 8, 11, 14, 10, 5, 1, 4

The total number of triangles in the graph is [12].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 14>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 14>, <2, 4, 1>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 11>, <2, 6, 14>, <2, 9, 3>, <5, 7, 10>, <5, 7, 14>, <6, 7, 14>
