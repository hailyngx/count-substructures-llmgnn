Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Let's calculate the total number of triangles in this graph.

Here are the nodes sorted by the number of connections:
- Node 0: Degree 1
- Node 3: Degree 2
- Node 17: Degree 2
- Node 27: Degree 2
- Node 28: Degree 2
- Node 2: Degree 2
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 13: Degree 3
- Node 15: Degree 3
- Node 22: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 6
- Node 12: Degree 6
- Node 14: Degree 6
- Node 1: Degree 6
- Node 11: Degree 6
- Node 19: Degree 6
- Node 6: Degree 6
- Node 8: Degree 6
- Node 25: Degree 6
- Node 10: Degree 6
- Node 21: Degree 6
- Node 20: Degree 6
- Node 4: Degree 8
- Node 29: Degree 8
- Node 9: Degree 8
- Node 26: Degree 8
- Node 18: Degree 8
- Node 16: Degree 8
- Node 24: Degree 8

Now, we will check the edges for shared connections to count the triangles.
After analyzing all 90 edges with the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find that there are 92 triangles in total.
