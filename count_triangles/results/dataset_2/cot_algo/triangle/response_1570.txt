Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 4) (14, 15) (17, 0) (17, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 7) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 10) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 18) (11, 0) (11, 15) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 2) (15, 14) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 12) (18, 3) (18, 19) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 12) (7, 13) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 4) (16, 9) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 9) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 16) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 19) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 9) (9, 3) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves ordering the nodes based on the degree of each node. The nodes with the least connections are given lower labels while the nodes with more connections are given higher labels.

Based on the given edges and nodes, the degree of each node is as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 6
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 5
- Node 17: degree 2
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 19: degree 4

Now, we will relabel the nodes in ascending order of their degrees:

- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 2
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 13: degree 6
- Node 16: degree 5

Now, let's count the number of triangles. 

The total number of triangles is [11]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 13>, <0, 3, 15>, <0, 13, 15>, <0, 9, 16>, <3, 10, 15>, <3, 12, 15>, <3, 13, 19>, <3, 15, 19>, <10, 15, 19>, <13, 15, 19>, <2, 8, 16>.
