Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 7) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 9) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 14) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 14) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Based on the provided graph and edges, let's construct the graph with the nodes and their connections:

Nodes: 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(10, 0), (10, 7), (11, 1), (11, 9), (11, 5), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 7), (2, 4), (2, 12), (2, 5), (2, 1), (2, 14), (5, 11), (5, 8), (5, 2), (5, 0), (13, 3), (13, 9), (13, 14), (13, 7), (12, 2), (12, 6), (12, 9), (0, 10), (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 5), (0, 9), (3, 13), (3, 6), (3, 9), (1, 11), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 2), (1, 7), (6, 12), (6, 3), (6, 14), (14, 2), (14, 13), (14, 6), (14, 7), (7, 10), (7, 8), (7, 13), (7, 1), (7, 14), (9, 11), (9, 13), (9, 12), (9, 0), (9, 3)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes with degree 1: 3, 6, 10
Nodes with degree 2: 7, 12, 14
Nodes with degree 3: 1, 13
Nodes with degree 4: 2, 4, 5, 11
Nodes with degree 5: 8, 9
Node with degree 6: 0

Next, we will count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method. We will iterate over the edges while considering the order of the nodes and shared connections. 

The total number of triangles is [4].

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
