Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 10) (26, 14) (5, 9) (5, 28) (5, 20) (14, 26) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 15) (17, 29) (17, 25) (17, 6) (17, 21) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 8) (21, 17) (21, 7) (21, 23) (7, 21) (7, 19) (7, 28) (7, 23) (7, 13) (29, 17) (29, 8) (29, 3) (19, 7) (19, 25) (10, 26) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 28) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 18) (25, 17) (25, 1) (25, 19) (27, 9) (3, 29) (3, 28) (28, 5) (28, 7) (28, 10) (28, 3) (28, 13) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 4) (2, 20) (12, 10) (12, 0) (6, 17) (6, 0) (16, 24) (16, 13) (16, 23) (24, 16) (24, 4) (13, 7) (13, 28) (13, 16) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 6) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 8) (8, 1) (8, 29) (8, 18) (4, 11) (4, 24) (4, 20) (23, 1) (23, 21) (23, 7) (23, 16) (20, 5) (20, 2) (20, 4) 

Response:
The graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges has been represented by the given edge list. 

Let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

The sorted vertices based on their degree are:
Vertices: 22 < 9 < 26 < 5 < 17 < 1 < 21 < 7 < 29 < 19 < 10 < 15 < 25 < 27 < 3 < 28 < 11 < 14 < 0 < 18 < 8 < 4 < 16 < 24 < 2 < 12 < 6 < 13 < 20 < 23

Considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
Triangles found by checking shared connections:
