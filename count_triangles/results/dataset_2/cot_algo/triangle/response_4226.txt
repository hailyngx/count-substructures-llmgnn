Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 1) (2, 27) (2, 21) (29, 2) (29, 25) (29, 14) (3, 27) (3, 5) (25, 29) (25, 5) (25, 8) (8, 25) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 8) (15, 10) (15, 26) (15, 22) (15, 24) (20, 26) (20, 1) (20, 5) (0, 8) (0, 28) (14, 29) (14, 18) (14, 21) (21, 2) (21, 14) (21, 11) (28, 0) (28, 12) (9, 22) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 1) (22, 15) (22, 9) (22, 5) (24, 15) (24, 26) (24, 17) (26, 15) (26, 20) (26, 24) (26, 7) (7, 8) (7, 26) (7, 11) (7, 19) (10, 15) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 23) (27, 2) (27, 3) (27, 23) (18, 14) (18, 5) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 12) (4, 23) (4, 6) (11, 21) (11, 7) (6, 4) (6, 17) (6, 16) (17, 9) (17, 24) (17, 6) (1, 2) (1, 20) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 19) (5, 3) (5, 25) (5, 20) (5, 22) (5, 18) (23, 10) (23, 27) (23, 4) (12, 28) (12, 19) (16, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be used to count the number of triangles in the graph based on the given edges.

The sorted list of vertices based on their connections (degree) is as follows:
0, 13, 16, 18, 4, 7, 11, 12, 24, 28, 3, 17, 6, 23, 9, 19, 14, 21, 22, 29, 15, 25, 26, 5, 8, 10, 1, 27, 2, 20.

Calculating the number of triangles based on the shared connections:
- Triangle <1, 10, 15>
- Triangle <0, 13, 8>
- Triangle <5, 18, 20>
- Triangle <19, 12, 28>
- Triangle <1, 19, 9>
- Triangle <1, 20, 5>
- Triangle <7, 26, 8>
- Triangle <6, 17, 24>
- Triangle <9, 22, 15>
- Triangle <2, 21, 14>
- Triangle <2, 27, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
