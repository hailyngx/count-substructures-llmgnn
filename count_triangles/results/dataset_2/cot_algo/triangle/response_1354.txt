Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 12) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 14) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles by sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. 

Here are the sorted nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):
- Node 5: Degree 2
- Node 9: Degree 2
- Node 7: Degree 3
- Node 1: Degree 3
- Node 10: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 3
- Node 14: Degree 3
- Node 2: Degree 4
- Node 12: Degree 4
- Node 0: Degree 4
- Node 13: Degree 5
- Node 8: Degree 5
- Node 3: Degree 6
- Node 4: Degree 6
- Node 11: Degree 6

Now, we will count the triangles based on the edges provided by checking the shared connections between the vertices of each edge. 

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found: 
- <0, 2, 12>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 2, 12>
- <1, 12, 6>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <4, 6, 12>
