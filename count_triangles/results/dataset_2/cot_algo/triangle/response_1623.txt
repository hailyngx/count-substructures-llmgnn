Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (12, 0) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 13) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) 

Response:
By constructing the graph based on the given edges, we have the following connections:

Nodes and their respective connections:
- Node 0: 9, 12, 6, 3, 10
- Node 1: 9, 2, 14
- Node 2: 8, 1, 13, 14
- Node 3: 5, 8, 12, 6, 11, 0
- Node 4: 5, 8, 14
- Node 5: 9, 4, 3, 10
- Node 6: 7, 10, 3, 11, 0
- Node 7: 11, 6, 14, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7, 2, 3
- Node 9: 5, 14, 1, 0
- Node 10: 5, 6, 0, 13
- Node 11: 7, 6, 3, 13
- Node 12: 0, 3
- Node 13: 2, 11, 10
- Node 14: 9, 4, 7, 2, 1

Sorting the nodes based on their degree from least to most connections, we get:
Nodes and their degrees:
- Node 2: 3
- Node 1: 3
- Node 12: 2
- Node 13: 3
- Node 7: 4
- Node 0: 5
- Node 10: 4
- Node 11: 4
- Node 4: 3
- Node 14: 5
- Node 8: 4
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 5
- Node 3: 6
- Node 9: 4

Now, we will check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Checking edges involving nodes with lower degree:
    - (2, 1): No triangles
    - (12, 0): No triangles
    - (13, 2): No triangles
    - (7, 11): No triangles
    - (0, 10): No triangles
    - (10, 13): No triangles
    - (4, 8): No triangles
    - (14, 1): No triangles
    - (8, 2): No triangles
    - (9, 5): No triangles
    - (6, 7): No triangles
    - (3, 12): No triangles
    - (5, 9): No triangles
    - (3, 8): No triangles
    - (9, 14): No triangles

The total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <3, 6, 11>
