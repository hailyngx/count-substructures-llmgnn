Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 16) (13, 2) (22, 26) (22, 6) (22, 1) (5, 9) (5, 23) (9, 5) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 0) (15, 27) (15, 25) (27, 15) (27, 29) (27, 21) (27, 7) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 1) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 17) (25, 28) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 24) (11, 10) (11, 6) (0, 9) (0, 20) (0, 21) (6, 22) (6, 11) (6, 28) (6, 3) (28, 25) (28, 6) (28, 1) (26, 22) (26, 29) (3, 6) (3, 24) (3, 16) (21, 27) (21, 0) (21, 19) (17, 25) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (19, 21) (19, 24) (1, 22) (1, 20) (1, 28) (1, 29) (1, 8) (29, 27) (29, 26) (29, 1) (29, 7) (29, 8) (7, 27) (7, 29) (7, 2) (23, 5) (24, 9) (24, 10) (24, 3) (24, 19) (18, 10) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 16) (16, 13) (16, 3) (16, 14) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 29) (8, 12) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 8) (4, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, below is the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles and find the unique triangles:

Sorted vertices by their degree:
Nodes: 7, 11, 18, 23, 10, 4, 5, 13, 19, 26, 14, 3, 12, 15, 24, 8, 20, 16, 17, 1, 21, 22, 27, 28, 29, 2, 0, 6, 9, 25

Calculated triangles:
1. Total number of triangles: [16]

Unique triangles:
<1, 28, 6>
<1, 29, 9>
<1, 29, 8>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 17>
<1, 2, 29>
<1, 28, 25>
<1, 20, 25>
<7, 29, 1>
<7, 29, 8>
<2, 17, 25>
<2, 17, 8>
<2, 1, 28>
<2, 1, 29>
<2, 7, 29>
<17, 25, 8>
