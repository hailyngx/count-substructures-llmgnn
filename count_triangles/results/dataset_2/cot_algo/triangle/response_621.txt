Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 22) (15, 26) (15, 17) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 20) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (0, 9) (0, 24) (0, 4) (27, 21) (27, 19) (8, 5) (23, 26) (23, 4) (23, 7) (23, 13) (4, 0) (4, 23) (4, 29) (2, 5) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 25) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 9) (17, 7) (25, 18) (25, 13) (25, 14) (25, 24) (11, 14) (19, 5) (19, 27) (19, 18) (19, 1) (16, 14) (10, 21) (10, 29) (10, 26) (21, 27) (21, 10) (21, 13) (21, 12) (21, 22) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 21) (12, 6) (26, 15) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 29) (1, 9) (1, 19) (29, 4) (29, 10) (29, 26) (29, 6) (7, 3) (7, 23) (7, 17) (7, 6) (13, 23) (13, 25) (13, 21) (6, 12) (6, 29) (6, 7) (14, 25) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 24) (24, 0) (24, 25) (24, 14) (20, 5) (20, 22) (22, 3) (22, 21) (22, 20) 

Response:
The vertices are sorted based on their degree:

Vertices: 27, 16, 10, 11, 15, 1, 18, 20, 5, 8, 17, 19, 7, 13, 25, 26, 29, 4, 0, 2, 12, 9, 6, 14, 21, 24, 3, 23, 22

Number of triangles: [20]

Unique triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 18>, <0, 4, 23>, <0, 5, 19>, <0, 9, 1>, <0, 9, 12>, <0, 9, 17>, <0, 9, 24>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 19>, <2, 5, 18>, <4, 23, 7>, <4, 23, 13>, <4, 23, 26>, <5, 8, 20>, <5, 19, 7>, <5, 19, 18>, <9, 12, 21>, <13, 23, 7>, <14, 24, 25>
