Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 15) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 14) (4, 13) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 1) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 0) (3, 17) (3, 19) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 7) (1, 2) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 2) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 14) (12, 16) (12, 15) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (18, 7) (18, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (14, 16) (14, 10) (14, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort nodes by their number of connections in ascending order:
Node 4: connections - 1
Node 13: connections - 2
Node 9: connections - 3
Node 6: connections - 3
Node 1: connections - 3
Node 12: connections - 3
Node 18: connections - 3
Node 5: connections - 3
Node 3: connections - 3
Node 11: connections - 3
Node 7: connections - 4
Node 17: connections - 4
Node 8: connections - 4
Node 19: connections - 5
Node 15: connections - 5
Node 2: connections - 5
Node 10: connections - 6
Node 0: connections - 6
Node 14: connections - 6
Node 16: connections - 6

2. Relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 4: 0
Node 13: 1
Node 9: 2
Node 6: 3
Node 1: 4
Node 12: 5
Node 18: 6
Node 5: 7
Node 3: 8
Node 11: 9
Node 7: 10
Node 17: 11
Node 8: 12
Node 19: 13
Node 15: 14
Node 2: 15
Node 10: 16
Node 0: 17
Node 14: 18
Node 16: 19

3. Using the sorted order, start counting triangles by considering edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:

Triangles found:
<2, 9, 11>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 2, 13>
<5, 14, 16>
<0, 6, 16>
<0, 6, 19>
<2, 9, 13>

Total number of triangles: [7]
