Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 19) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 17) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 15) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 16) (0, 10) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 11) (16, 0) (16, 15) (19, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 4) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 2) (11, 15) (11, 18) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 18) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 5) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 14) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 3) (17, 7) (17, 2) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is as follows: 
Vertex 16 (degree 2)
Vertex 19 (degree 2)
Vertex 6 (degree 2)
Vertex 5 (degree 3)
Vertex 8 (degree 3)
Vertex 3 (degree 3)
Vertex 18 (degree 3)
Vertex 4 (degree 4)
Vertex 10 (degree 4)
Vertex 17 (degree 4)
Vertex 0 (degree 4)
Vertex 11 (degree 4)
Vertex 12 (degree 4)
Vertex 7 (degree 4)
Vertex 2 (degree 4)
Vertex 14 (degree 5)
Vertex 1 (degree 5)
Vertex 13 (degree 5)
Vertex 9 (degree 6)
Vertex 15 (degree 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Checking the edges:

- Edge (6, 5):
Vertex 5 has fewer connections than vertex 6, so we proceed.
Shared connections: {1}
Triangle(s): <1, 5, 6>

- Edge (6, 19):
Vertex 6 has fewer connections than vertex 19, so we proceed.
Shared connections: {}
No triangle formed.

- Edge (9, 14):
Vertex 14 has fewer connections than vertex 9, so we proceed.
Shared connections: {15}
Triangle(s): <9, 14, 15>

... (all the other edges are checked similarly)

The total number of triangles in the graph is [29].  
The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 5, 6>, <9, 14, 15>, <12, 0, 7>, <3, 4, 10>, <3, 4, 13>, <3, 4, 10>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 13>, <1, 2, 13>, <11, 2, 15>, <11, 2, 15>, <11, 2, 18>, <11, 15, 18>, <2, 15, 18>, <7, 12, 0>, <7, 17, 2>, <7, 17, 2>, <0, 10, 3>, <0, 12, 7>, <0, 12, 13>, <0, 12, 13>, <12, 13, 4>, <12, 13, 4>, <5, 6, 1>, <5, 6, 15>, <5, 1, 15>, <10, 0, 3>, <10, 0, 4>, <10, 3, 4>
