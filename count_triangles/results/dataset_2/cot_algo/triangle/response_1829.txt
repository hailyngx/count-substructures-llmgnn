Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 6) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 0) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the provided information. 

The 15 nodes are labeled from 0 to 14. 

The edges are: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 13, 3, 9. 
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 10, 7, 6, 14.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 10, 4, 7, 13, 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 14, 3, 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 11, 8, 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 11, 12, 1, 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 11, 2, 13, 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 11, 5, 14, 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 10, 11, 0, 14.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 12, 1, 13, 9, 2.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 7, 9, 6, 8, 5.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 10, 6.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 10, 7, 2, 0.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 1, 9.

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method for counting the number of triangles.

The vertices sorted by their degrees are:
Node 5, 12, 4, 8, 3, 14, 0, 1, 6, 13, 9, 7, 2, 10, 11.

The triangles found are: 
- <2, 6, 7>
- <2, 6, 10>
- <2, 7, 13>
- <2, 6, 12>
- <2, 6, 1>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 0, 9>
- <4, 8, 14>
- <7, 11, 13>
- <8, 11, 5>
- <9, 10, 11>
- <9, 0, 5>
- <9, 0, 14>
- <10, 11, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [14].
