Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 10) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 9) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most. Here is the sorted list of nodes and their degrees (number of connections):

Node 11: degree 1
Node 13: degree 2
Node 14: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 10: degree 4
Node 12: degree 5
Node 0: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 5: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 9: degree 6
Node 7: degree 6

Now, we will go through each edge in the order of the sorted nodes and count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (1, 6): Nodes 1 and 6 share a connection with Node 2, forming triangle <1, 2, 6>.
2. Edge (1, 10): Nodes 1 and 10 share a connection with Node 14, forming triangle <1, 10, 14>.
3. Edge (1, 0): Nodes 1 and 0 share a connection with Node 3, forming triangle <1, 0, 3>.
4. Edge (1, 7): Nodes 1 and 7 do not form a triangle.
5. Edge (3, 0): Nodes 3 and 0 share a connection with Node 4, forming triangle <0, 3, 4>.

7. Edge (3, 12): Nodes 3 and 12 do not form a triangle.
8. Edge (3, 8): Nodes 3 and 8 share a connection with Node 5, forming triangle <3, 5, 8>.
