Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 8) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 12) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 17) (12, 3) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 17) (0, 17) (0, 19) (14, 13) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 5) (1, 15) (1, 13) (15, 4) (15, 1) (15, 17) (9, 17) (19, 11) (19, 0) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 9) (3, 16) (3, 18) (3, 12) (3, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. Here are the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 1
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 1
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 5
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 2

The sorted order of nodes based on their degrees is:
9, 14, 0, 19, 1, 5, 7, 8, 10, 16, 13, 18, 15, 6, 4, 2, 3, 12, 11, 17

Using the property that for each edge, we proceed only if the node with the lower label has fewer connections, and checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge, we can count the number of triangles.

Count of triangles = 10
Triangles found: <6, 3, 16>, <3, 18, 12>, <3, 18, 5>, <3, 12, 17>, <13, 4, 1>, <13, 4, 14>, <2, 7, 12>, <2, 7, 18>, <4, 7, 12>, <4, 7, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
