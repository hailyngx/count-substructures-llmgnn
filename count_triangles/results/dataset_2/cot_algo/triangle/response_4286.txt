Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 2) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 6) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows these steps:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections).
2. Relabel the vertices in increasing degree order.
3. For each edge, consider only the edge where the vertex with the lower label has a smaller degree.
4. Check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to identify triangles.

Here is the process of counting triangles in the given graph:

Vertices sorted by degree:
```
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 10: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 12: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertex 14: 5 connections
Vertex 11: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 6 connections
Vertex 13: 6 connections
Vertex 9: 6 connections
Vertex 8: 7 connections
Vertex 4: 8 connections
```

Triangles (in the format <vertex1, vertex2, vertex3>):
