Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (5, 12) (5, 7) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 1) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 1) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 14) (16, 15) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 18) (3, 8) (3, 9) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 18) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 7) (19, 17) (4, 1) (15, 13) (15, 0) (15, 16) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 4) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 17) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 17) (14, 16) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 7), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 12), (0, 15), 
(1, 4), (1, 10), (1, 12), (1, 16), 
(2, 7), (2, 8), 
(3, 8), (3, 9), 
(4, 1), 
(5, 7), (5, 12), 
(6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 13), 
(7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 6), 
(8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 13), 
(9, 3), (9, 11), (9, 17), 
(10, 0), (10, 1), (10, 18), 
(11, 0), (11, 9), (11, 18), 
(12, 0), (12, 1), (12, 5), (12, 16), 
(13, 6), (13, 8), (13, 15), 
(14, 16), 
(15, 0), (15, 13), (15, 16), 
(16, 1), (16, 12), (16, 14), (16, 15), (16, 17), 
(17, 9), (17, 16), (17, 18), (17, 19), 
(18, 10), (18, 11), (18, 17), 
(19, 17)

Next, we will perform the Degree-Based Ordering method and count the number of triangles in the graph.
