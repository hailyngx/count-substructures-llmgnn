Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 16) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (17, 1) (17, 4) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 18) (7, 5) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 19) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 14) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 4) (13, 9) (18, 6) (19, 12) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 1) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 16) (16, 15) (16, 4) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are as follows:
Node 19: Degree 1
Node 13: Degree 1
Node 18: Degree 2
Node 17: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 10: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 19: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 16: Degree 4
Node 14: Degree 5
Node 12: Degree 5
Node 11: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 7

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now proceed with counting the number of triangles.
