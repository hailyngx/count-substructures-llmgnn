Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- Node 0: 9, 1, 6, 2
- Node 1: 5, 7, 3, 6, 0, 8
- Node 2: 7, 3, 0
- Node 3: 9, 4, 1, 2, 8
- Node 4: 9, 7, 8, 3
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 7, 1, 8, 0
- Node 7: 4, 6, 2, 1
- Node 8: 9, 4, 1, 3, 6
- Node 9: 8, 4, 3, 0

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [12]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
