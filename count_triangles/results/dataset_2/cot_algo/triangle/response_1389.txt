Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
The vertices with their respective connections are:
- Node 0: 6 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 5 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 9: 5 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we relabel the nodes as follows:
- Node 4 -> A (3 connections)
- Node 5 -> B (3 connections)
- Node 1 -> C (4 connections)
- Node 2 -> D (4 connections)
- Node 3 -> E (4 connections)
- Node 0 -> F (6 connections)
- Node 6 -> G (4 connections)
- Node 8 -> H (4 connections)
- Node 7 -> I (5 connections)
- Node 9 -> J (5 connections)

Now, analyzing the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- Edge C-E: Shared connections with D (Node 2). Triangle formed: <C, E, D>
- Edge B-E: Shared connections with F (Node 0) and H (Node 8). Triangles formed: <B, E, F>, <B, E, H>
- Edge A-B: Shared connection with F (Node 0). Triangle formed: <A, B, F>
- Edge A-I: No shared connections.
- Edge G-I: Shared connections with J (Node 9), H (Node 8), D (Node 2). Triangles formed: <G, I, J>, <G, I, H>, <G, I, D>
- Edge G-J: Shared connections with I (Node 7), H (Node 8), D (Node 2). Triangles formed: <G, J, I>, <G, J, H>, <G, J, D>
- Edge C-J: Shared connections with I (Node 7). Triangle formed: <C, J, I>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7] and the unique triangles found are <C, E, D>, <B, E, F>, <B, E, H>, <A, B, F>, <G, I, J>, <G, I, H>, <G, I, D>, <G, J, I>, <G, J, H>, <G, J, D>.
