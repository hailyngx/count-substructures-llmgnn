Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 1) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 5) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (8, 4), (8, 10), (8, 6), (13, 1), (10, 8), (10, 11), (10, 6), (10, 9), (11, 10), (11, 9), (4, 8), (4, 12), (4, 9), (4, 0), (4, 14), (4, 1), (7, 12), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 1), (12, 4), (12, 7), (12, 6), (12, 1), (0, 4), (0, 14), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 1), (14, 4), (14, 0), (14, 3), (5, 7), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 1), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 14), (3, 9), (3, 2), (2, 7), (2, 5), (2, 3), (6, 8), (6, 10), (6, 7), (6, 12), (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 4), (9, 3), (1, 13), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 12), (1, 0), (1, 5)

Now, let's rearrange the nodes based on their degrees from lowest to highest:
Nodes: 13, 2, 5, 11, 14, 3, 0, 6, 12, 1, 10, 9, 7, 8, 4

Now, let's count the triangles:
