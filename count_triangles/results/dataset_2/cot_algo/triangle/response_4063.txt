Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 16) (4, 15) (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 18) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 3) (15, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 2) (10, 5) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 8) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 11) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 18) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 6) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 12) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 6) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 12) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 16) (1, 14) (1, 19) (14, 1) (19, 10) (19, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 11) 

Response:
The given graph with the 20 nodes and 60 edges can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
(5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 16) (4, 15) 
(3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 18) (15, 13) (8, 17) (8, 12) (10, 17) 
(10, 19) (17, 6) (17, 11) (2, 13) (2, 10) (18, 6) 
(0, 16) (0, 11) (16, 6) (11, 17) (11, 12)
(1, 14) (1, 19) (12, 0) 

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:

Degree of each node:
0: 3 (Degree)
1: 2
2: 4
3: 4
4: 3
5: 3
6: 4
8: 4
9: 2
10: 4
11: 4
12: 3
13: 4
14: 1
15: 4
16: 3
17: 4
18: 3
19: 2

Sorted nodes based on degree:
1: 2
9: 2
14: 1
19: 2
4: 3
5: 3
16: 3
0: 3
12: 3
6: 4
8: 4
10: 4
11: 4
13: 4
15: 4
17: 4
18: 3
2: 4
3: 4

Triangles found:
<0, 4, 16>
<0, 6, 11>
<0, 6, 16>

<8, 12, 0>
<8, 17, 10>
<10, 17, 6>
<11, 17, 6>
<12, 0, 11>

Total number of triangles is [19].
