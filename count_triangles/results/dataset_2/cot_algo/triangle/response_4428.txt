Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 25) (15, 24) (0, 27) (0, 17) (0, 29) (0, 13) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 25) (8, 3) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 16) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 26) (23, 5) (7, 15) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 28) (12, 29) (17, 0) (17, 29) (17, 2) (17, 4) (29, 0) (29, 12) (29, 17) (29, 18) (21, 3) (21, 16) (28, 12) (28, 10) (1, 26) (1, 4) (26, 23) (26, 1) (26, 13) (26, 16) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 10) (5, 23) (5, 18) (13, 0) (13, 26) (11, 23) (11, 9) (10, 28) (10, 2) (10, 14) (14, 10) (25, 15) (25, 27) (25, 19) (25, 22) (6, 0) (6, 24) (6, 22) (24, 15) (24, 6) (24, 9) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 21) (16, 26) (19, 25) (19, 4) (20, 12) (20, 18) (9, 11) (9, 24) (4, 17) (4, 1) (4, 19) (18, 3) (18, 29) (18, 5) (18, 20) (22, 25) (22, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be used to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, let's list the nodes and their degrees:
Node 0: degree 5
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 6
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 2
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 2
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 1
Node 15: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 18: degree 4
Node 19: degree 2
Node 20: degree 2
Node 21: degree 2
Node 22: degree 2
Node 23: degree 4
Node 24: degree 3
Node 25: degree 4
Node 26: degree 4
Node 27: degree 2
Node 28: degree 2
Node 29: degree 4

Sorting nodes by their degree yields:
14 < 1, 5, 7, 9, 19, 20, 22, 27, 28 < 0, 2, 4, 10, 11, 13 < 8, 12, 16, 17, 18, 23, 24, 29 < 3, 6, 15, 25, 26

Using the degree-based ordering and provided edges, we consider each edge connecting vertices where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
<0, 27, 25>
<2, 8, 16>
<2, 17, 4>
<3, 15, 21>
<3, 18, 29>
<3, 8, 16>
<4, 17, 29>
<4, 19, 25>
<6, 0, 24>
<6, 22, 25>
<8, 2, 16>
<8, 3, 16>
<10, 2, 28>
<10, 14, 28>

There are 14 unique triangles found as follows: <0, 25, 27>, <0, 25, 29>, <0, 27, 29>, <2, 4, 17>, <2, 4, 19>, <2, 17, 29>, <3, 15, 21>, <3, 18, 29>, <3, 16, 8>, <4, 17, 29>, <6, 0, 24>, <6, 22, 25>, <8, 2, 16>, <10, 2, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
