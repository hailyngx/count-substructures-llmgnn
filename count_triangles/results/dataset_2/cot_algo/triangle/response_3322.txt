Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 21) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 26) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 23) (4, 0) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 24) (1, 13) (1, 22) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 18) (12, 25) (12, 22) (20, 15) (20, 21) (28, 29) (28, 9) (28, 18) (29, 28) (29, 19) (26, 3) (26, 14) (26, 6) (9, 28) (9, 23) (2, 13) (2, 22) (22, 1) (22, 12) (22, 2) (22, 5) (22, 0) (14, 26) (14, 23) (14, 5) (17, 24) (17, 19) (17, 27) (25, 12) (25, 10) (21, 16) (21, 20) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 22) (0, 10) (0, 24) (10, 25) (10, 0) (10, 27) (19, 11) (19, 29) (19, 17) (6, 26) (6, 18) (24, 7) (24, 8) (24, 17) (24, 0) (23, 15) (23, 9) (23, 14) (23, 27) (5, 11) (5, 22) (5, 14) (5, 18) (18, 13) (18, 28) (18, 6) (18, 5) (27, 17) (27, 10) (27, 23) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, the vertices need to be sorted according to their degree:
Node 28: degree 3
Node 29: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 6: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 10: degree 3
Node 12: degree 2
Node 20: degree 2
Node 25: degree 2
Node 7: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 15: degree 4
Node 17: degree 3
Node 24: degree 4
Node 0: degree 5
Node 5: degree 4
Node 8: degree 3
Node 11: degree 3
Node 16: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4
Node 21: degree 3
Node 22: degree 5
Node 26: degree 4
Node 27: degree 3
Node 4: degree 1
Node 18: degree 4

Now, we will relabel the vertices in ascending order of their degrees:
Node 29: 0
Node 1: 1
Node 2: 2
Node 6: 3
Node 12: 4
Node 20: 5
Node 25: 6
Node 28: 7
Node 17: 8
Node 21: 9
Node 27: 10
Node 10: 11
Node 22: 12
Node 19: 13
Node 16: 14
Node 26: 15
Node 0: 16
Node 8: 17
Node 13: 18
Node 7: 19
Node 3: 20
Node 15: 21
Node 5: 22
Node 9: 23
Node 24: 24
Node 18: 25
Node 11: 26
Node 4: 27
Node 14: 28

Next, we will count the total number of triangles and output them inside brackets []: 
[27]

The unique triangles found are:
<8, 24, 0>
<0, 8, 13>
<15, 3, 7>
<0, 10, 25>
<24, 0, 4>
<13, 2, 22>
<2, 22, 5>
<2, 13, 8>
<7, 3, 26>
<13, 8, 24>
<22, 2, 13>
<22, 5, 0>
<5, 22, 0>
<18, 13, 8>
<19, 17, 24>
<18, 28, 9>
<6, 18, 5>
<3, 15, 16>
<21, 16, 15>
<17, 27, 23>
<17, 19, 29>
<14, 26, 6>
<14, 5, 18>
<14, 23, 9>
<26, 3, 15>
<26, 6, 18>
