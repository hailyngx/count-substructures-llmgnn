Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 10) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 19) (8, 4) (13, 16) (13, 6) (4, 8) (4, 11) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 19) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 19) (12, 9) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 15) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 15) (5, 1) (5, 17) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 15) (19, 3) (19, 0) (19, 12) (17, 0) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 5) (17, 9) (9, 12) (9, 17) (9, 14) (15, 12) (15, 16) (15, 2) (15, 11) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 6) (14, 1) (14, 9) (18, 11) (18, 10) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 10) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (0, 7), (0, 17), (0, 19), (1, 5), (1, 10), (1, 14), (2, 7), (2, 15), (2, 17), (3, 6), (3, 10), (3, 19), (4, 8), (4, 11), (5, 17), (6, 10), (6, 12), (6, 13), (7, 17), (8, 4), (9, 12), (9, 14), (9, 17), (10, 18), (11, 15), (11, 18), (12, 6), (12, 9), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 19), (13, 6), (13, 16), (14, 1), (14, 9), (15, 2), (15, 11), (15, 16), (16, 12), (16, 13), (16, 15), (16, 17), (17, 2), (17, 5), (17, 9), (17, 16), (18, 10), (18, 11), (19, 0), (19, 3), (19, 12)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes: 8, 18, 5, 13, 18, 14, 7, 10, 0, 2, 4, 15, 3, 9, 1, 16, 6, 17, 12, 19

Now we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 18]
<Triangles: <0, 7, 17>, <0, 12, 19>, <0, 17, 2>, <0, 17, 9>, <2, 7, 17>, <3, 10, 19>, <3, 12, 6>, <3, 12, 9>, <4, 11, 15>, <6, 10, 3>, <6, 12, 9>, <6, 12, 13>, <9, 12, 16>, <9, 12, 19>, <10, 1, 5>, <10, 6, 3>, <11, 15, 16>, <12, 15, 16>>
