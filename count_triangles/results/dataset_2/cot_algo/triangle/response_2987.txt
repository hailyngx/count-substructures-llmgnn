Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is:  \[ 3, 6, 2, 9, 4, 7, 0, 8, 1, 5. \]

\[ Total \ number \ of \ triangles: [16] \]
