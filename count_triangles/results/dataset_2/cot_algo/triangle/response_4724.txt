Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 14) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 12) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 12) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 10) (10, 3) (10, 0) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 9) (12, 14) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 4 - Degree 4
Node 10 - Degree 4
Node 0 - Degree 4
Node 11 - Degree 4
Node 13 - Degree 4
Node 1 - Degree 5
Node 2 - Degree 3
Node 5 - Degree 5
Node 6 - Degree 5
Node 9 - Degree 4
Node 12 - Degree 5
Node 14 - Degree 5
Node 3 - Degree 5
Node 7 - Degree 5
Node 8 - Degree 5

Using the degree-based ordering, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph.

There are a total of [18] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 7, 13>
<1, 9, 12>
<1, 11, 13>
<1, 11, 12>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 14>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 14>
<5, 13, 14>
<8, 9, 12>
<8, 12, 14>
<9, 7, 12>
<10, 0, 3>
