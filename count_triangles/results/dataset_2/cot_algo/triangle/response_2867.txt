Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 8) (14, 4) (14, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections and then following the steps mentioned earlier. Let's start by applying this method to the given graph:

Nodes sorted by their degree:
Node 15: 0
Node 4: 1
Node 12: 1
Node 5: 2
Node 14: 2
Node 7: 2
Node 1: 2
Node 9: 2
Node 11: 2
Node 8: 3
Node 10: 3
Node 6: 3
Node 13: 3
Node 2: 4
Node 3: 5

Now, we will go through each edge ensuring that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. We will count the triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 13>
<0, 5, 13>
<0, 6, 13>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 8, 10>
<3, 6, 13>
<3, 7, 14>
<3, 9, 11>
<5, 8, 13>
<6, 8, 11>
<6, 8, 13>
<6, 11, 13>
<8, 10, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
