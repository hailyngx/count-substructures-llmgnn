Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 10) (4, 16) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (18, 4) (18, 15) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 8) (7, 13) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 15) (19, 16) (19, 12) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 3) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 15) (10, 16) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 2) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 9) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on the number of connections. Here is the labeling of the nodes in ascending order of their degrees:

Node 0: degree 2
Node 7: degree 1
Node 2: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 18: degree 3
Node 13: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 15: degree 3
Node 19: degree 3
Node 4: degree 6
Node 14: degree 3
Node 11: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4

Now, we can count the number of triangles by examining the edges based on the ordering of the nodes:

- For edge (11, 6): Node 11 and Node 6 share 2 common neighbors (8 and 17), forming one triangle <11, 6, 8>.
- For edge (11, 9): Node 11 and Node 9 share 3 common neighbors (8, 10, and 17), forming one triangle <11, 9, 10>.

The total number of triangles is [2].
