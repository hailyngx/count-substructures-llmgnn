Response:
The graph with nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: 30
Edges: 90

Edges:
(13, 22) (13, 7) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 23) (15, 6) (15, 17) (15, 24) (15, 28) (27, 17) (27, 9) (27, 16) (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 29) (20, 18) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 9) (25, 19) (25, 11) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 19) (23, 12) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 3) (18, 20) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 29) (18, 3) (5, 18) (5, 29) (5, 16) (6, 13) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 7) (1, 26) (1, 24) (26, 1) (26, 16) (26, 7) (11, 25) (11, 23) (28, 15) (28, 20) (28, 9) (24, 15) (24, 1) (4, 10) (17, 15) (17, 27) (17, 20) (17, 6) (29, 20) (29, 18) (29, 5) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 9) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 26) (7, 0) (7, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 21) (21, 10) (12, 23) (12, 2) (12, 14) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 7) (9, 27) (9, 25) (9, 28) (9, 0) (19, 25) (19, 23) (19, 14) (14, 12) (14, 19) (16, 27) (16, 5) (16, 26)

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new ordering is:
(4), (0, 1, 10, 14, 21, 26), (2, 5, 11, 12, 19, 24, 28), (3, 9, 16, 20), (6, 13, 17, 22, 29), (7, 18, 23), (8), (15), (25), (27)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the total number of triangles in the graph is [83]. 

Unique triangles found:
<0, 7, 10>, <0, 9, 27>, <0, 10, 21>, <1, 7, 26>, <2, 3, 18>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 12, 14>, <2, 12, 19>, <3, 7, 26>, <5, 16, 26>, <5, 16, 27>, <5, 16, 7>, <5, 16, 9>, <5, 18, 20>, <5, 18, 2>, <5, 18, 29>, <6, 13, 22>, <6, 13, 7>, <6, 15, 17>, <6, 15, 7>, <6, 17, 20>, <6, 17, 27>, <6, 17, 9>, <6, 17, 20>, <7, 13, 22>, <7, 13, 6>, <7, 13, 26>, <7, 15, 17>, <7, 15, 24>, <7, 15, 28>, <7, 26, 1>, <7, 26, 16>, <7, 26, 3>, <9, 19, 25>, <9, 25, 20>, <9, 25, 8>, <9, 27, 17>, <9, 27, 16>, <9, 27, 20>, <10, 4, 0>, <12, 14, 19>, <12, 14, 2>, <12, 14, 23>, <14, 19, 23>, <15, 24, 1>, <16, 26, 1>, <17, 20, 18>, <17, 20, 29>, <18, 20, 25>, <18, 20, 28>, <23, 19, 25>, <24, 15, 28>
