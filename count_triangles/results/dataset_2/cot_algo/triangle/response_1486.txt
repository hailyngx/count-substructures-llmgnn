Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 15) (17, 1) (17, 6) (4, 18) (4, 14) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 6) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 19) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 13) (1, 17) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 5) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 16) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 9) (16, 3) (16, 6) (2, 13) (2, 9) (9, 14) (9, 2) (5, 15) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: (0, 7), (0, 15), (1, 13), (1, 17), (2, 13), (2, 9), (3, 11), (3, 14), (3, 16), (3, 19), (4, 14), (4, 18), (5, 15), (6, 8), (6, 16), (6, 17), (6, 18), (7, 0), (7, 8), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 12), (8, 13), (8, 19), (9, 2), (9, 14), (10, 11), (10, 15), (11, 10), (11, 3), (11, 15), (11, 18), (11, 19), (12, 8), (12, 14), (13, 1), (13, 2), (13, 8), (13, 19), (14, 3), (14, 4), (14, 9), (14, 12), (15, 0), (15, 10), (15, 11), (15, 18), (15, 5), (16, 3), (16, 6), (17, 1), (17, 6), (18, 4), (18, 6), (18, 11), (18, 15), (19, 8), (19, 11), (19, 13), (19, 3)

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degree from least to most:
Nodes by Degree: [5, 9, 0, 1, 10, 12, 16, 17, 2, 4, 7, 5, 13, 19, 6, 3, 11, 18, 8, 14]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:
Total number of triangles: [28]
Unique triangles: <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 15>, <0, 15, 5>, <1, 13, 2>, <3, 11, 10>, <3, 11, 15>, <3, 11, 18>, <3, 11, 19>, <3, 14, 4>, <3, 14, 9>, <3, 14, 12>, <3, 16, 6>, <3, 16, 17>, <3, 16, 18>, <4, 14, 9>, <4, 14, 12>, <6, 8, 7>, <6, 8, 13>, <6, 8, 19>, <6, 16, 3>, <6, 16, 17>, <6, 16, 18>, <6, 17, 1>, <6, 17, 7>, <9, 2, 13>, <10, 11, 15>, <11, 15, 18>, <14, 3, 16>
