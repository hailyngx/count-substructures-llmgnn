Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 14) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 29) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 29) (15, 5) (0, 3) (0, 27) (0, 24) (0, 11) (0, 4) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 7) (7, 27) (7, 23) (7, 17) (20, 25) (20, 29) (25, 20) (25, 10) (1, 26) (1, 28) (1, 23) (1, 18) (10, 25) (10, 8) (10, 19) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 29) (12, 27) (12, 11) (12, 16) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (22, 19) (22, 28) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 14) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 22) (19, 5) (29, 26) (29, 15) (29, 20) (29, 11) (29, 14) (18, 9) (18, 1) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 4) (23, 7) (23, 1) (23, 6) (24, 0) (24, 17) (17, 7) (17, 16) (17, 24) (17, 28) (28, 1) (28, 22) (28, 17) (28, 14) (13, 2) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 23) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 16) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 29) (14, 28) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with 30 nodes and 90 edges as described. 
Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph.

Nodes sorted by their degree (number of connections):
Nodes: [24, 21, 13, 11, 22, 21, 17, 18, 17, 17, 19, 13, 13, 18, 22, 22, 15, 16, 15, 16, 21, 18, 21, 15, 11, 23, 24, 22, 25, 19]
Degrees: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

Now, we will list the edges based on the degree-based ordering:
(24, 0), (21, 19), (13, 2), (11, 0), (22, 19), (21, 17), (17, 7), (18, 9), (17, 16), (17, 24), (17, 23), (19, 10), (13, 6), (13, 2), (18, 1), (22, 28), (22, 19), (15, 3), (18, 1), (15, 29), (15, 3), (16, 12), (21, 17), (17, 7), (21, 15), (18, 1), (21, 15), (11, 0)

Counting the number of triangles using the method described, we find:
Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles found: <0, 11, 29>, <1, 9, 18>, <1, 9, 26>, <1, 18, 28>, <2, 13, 19>, <2, 13, 6>, <2, 19, 22>, <3, 15, 29>, <7, 17, 24>
