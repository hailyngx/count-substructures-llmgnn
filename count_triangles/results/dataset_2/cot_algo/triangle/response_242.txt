Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be visually represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 0), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 0), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 3), (4, 2), (7, 6), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (1, 7), (1, 5), (1, 0), (1, 8), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 0), (5, 6), (5, 1), (0, 6), (0, 9), (0, 1), (0, 8), (0, 2), (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 0)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on the number of edges connected to them:

Node 5: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 6
Node 0: Degree 6
Node 6: Degree 6

With the degree-based ordering, we take the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Let's count the triangles and list them:

[Total number of triangles: 3]
Unique triangles: <2, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <0, 1, 8>
