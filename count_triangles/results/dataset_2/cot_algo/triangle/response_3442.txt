Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 7) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 12) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to use the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

First, let's sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Nodes with 0 connections: 10
Nodes with 1 connection: 5, 13
Nodes with 2 connections: 3, 5, 6, 10, 12
Nodes with 3 connections: 0, 4
Nodes with 4 connections: 2, 8, 9, 11, 14
Nodes with 5 connections: 1, 7

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degree:

0 -> 1
4 -> 2
8 -> 3
9 -> 4
11 -> 5
1 -> 6
7 -> 7
12 -> 8
13 -> 9
2 -> 10
3 -> 11
5 -> 12
6 -> 13
14 -> 14
10 -> 15

Next, we will list the unique triangles found in the graph:

<1, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 3>
<6, 8, 7>
<6, 8, 9>
<8, 3, 4>
<8, 3, 7>
<8, 3, 9>
<8, 4, 9>
<8, 7, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
