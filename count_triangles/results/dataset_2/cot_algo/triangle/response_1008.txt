Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 10) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 0) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (14, 9) (14, 3) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 13), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 10), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 11), (9, 14), (9, 0), (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 10), (7, 4), (7, 12), (10, 5), (10, 4), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 13), (10, 2), (11, 9), (11, 10), (11, 1), (11, 6), (11, 8), (11, 2), (8, 4), (8, 11), (8, 0), (8, 6), (8, 3), (13, 5), (13, 10), (12, 7), (12, 10), (12, 3), (1, 5), (1, 11), (1, 6), (1, 0), (6, 11), (6, 8), (6, 1), (6, 0), (3, 8), (3, 12), (3, 0), (3, 14), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 1), (0, 6), (0, 3), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 10), (2, 11), (14, 9)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees from least to most connected:
Nodes in ascending order of degrees: 7, 12, 13, 14, 1, 3, 6, 0, 5, 2, 8, 4, 11, 9, 10

Now, we will start counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. (12, 7) - No triangles can be formed.
2. (13, 5) - No triangles can be formed.
3. (1, 5) - No triangles can be formed.
4. (14, 9) - No triangles can be formed.
5. (1, 6) - Triangle formed: <1, 6, 11>
6. (0, 1) - No triangles can be formed.
7. (3, 12) - Triangle formed: <3, 12, 7>
8. (0, 3) - Triangle formed: <0, 3, 14>
9. (5, 2) - No triangles can be formed.
10. (2, 9) - No triangles can be formed.
11. (8, 4) - No triangles can be formed.
12. (9, 4) - No triangles can be formed.
13. (4, 7) - Triangle formed: <4, 7, 12>
14. (11, 9) - Triangle formed: <11, 9, 4>
15. (10, 5) - No triangles can be formed.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <1, 6, 11>, <3, 12, 7>, <0, 3, 14>, <4, 7, 12>
