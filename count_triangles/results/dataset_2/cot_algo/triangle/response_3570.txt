Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:  

Node 8: 0 connections  
Node 5: 5 connections  
Node 7: 5 connections  
Node 0: 6 connections  
Node 6: 6 connections  
Node 8: 6 connections  
Node 4: 6 connections  
Node 1: 7 connections  
Node 9: 7 connections  
Node 3: 7 connections  
Node 2: 7 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles found are:  

Total number of triangles: [5]  
Unique triangles: <1, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 3, 5>, <1, 2, 6>
