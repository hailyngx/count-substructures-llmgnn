Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on the number of connections are:

0 -> 3 connections
6 -> 3 connections
8 -> 4 connections
5 -> 4 connections
1 -> 4 connections
4 -> 5 connections
2 -> 5 connections
9 -> 5 connections
7 -> 6 connections
3 -> 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
1. Process the edge (0, 3): no triangles formed.
2. Process the edge (6, 3): no triangles formed.
3. Process the edge (8, 4): no triangles formed.
4. Process the edge (5, 4): no triangles formed.
5. Process the edge (5, 2): no triangles formed.
6. Process the edge (5, 9): no triangles formed.
7. Process the edge (1, 4): triangle formed with node 5: <1, 4, 5>.
8. Process the edge (1, 9): no triangles formed.
9. Process the edge (4, 7): triangle formed with node 8: <4, 7, 8>.
10. Process the edge (4, 2): triangle formed with node 5: <2, 4, 5>.
11. Process the edge (7, 0): no triangles formed.
12. Process the edge (7, 3): triangle formed with node 5: <3, 7, 5>.
13. Process the edge (7, 6): no triangles formed.
14. Process the edge (7, 8): no triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles found: <1, 4, 5>, <4, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 5>.
