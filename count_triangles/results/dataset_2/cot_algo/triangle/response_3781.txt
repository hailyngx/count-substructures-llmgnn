Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 1) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 22) (21, 24) (20, 1) (20, 26) (20, 13) (20, 10) (25, 6) (25, 18) (2, 22) (2, 11) (29, 22) (29, 18) (12, 7) (12, 15) (5, 13) (5, 10) (6, 25) (6, 24) (6, 8) (6, 16) (9, 8) (22, 21) (22, 2) (22, 29) (13, 20) (13, 5) (0, 7) (0, 28) (0, 26) (18, 25) (18, 29) (18, 26) (18, 3) (26, 20) (26, 0) (26, 18) (26, 17) (10, 21) (10, 20) (10, 5) (15, 12) (15, 17) (15, 28) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 27) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 23) (24, 21) (24, 6) (24, 11) (24, 27) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 24) (14, 1) (14, 23) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 17) (17, 26) (17, 15) (17, 3) (1, 7) (1, 20) (1, 19) (1, 14) (28, 0) (28, 15) (23, 19) (23, 14) (27, 21) (27, 8) (27, 24) (16, 4) (16, 6) (16, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles is as follows:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:  
Node 9: 0 connections  
Node 28: 1 connection  
Node 2: 2 connections  
Node 14: 2 connections  
Node 5: 2 connections  
Node 29: 2 connections  
Node 12: 2 connections  
Node 15: 2 connections  
Node 13: 2 connections  
Node 3: 3 connections  
Node 20: 3 connections  
Node 10: 3 connections  
Node 27: 3 connections  
Node 19: 3 connections  
Node 22: 3 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 1: 4 connections  
Node 26: 4 connections  
Node 18: 4 connections  
Node 24: 4 connections  
Node 16: 4 connections  
Node 6: 4 connections  
Node 8: 4 connections  
Node 21: 4 connections  
Node 17: 4 connections  
Node 11: 4 connections  
Node 4: 5 connections  
Node 25: 5 connections  
Node 0: 5 connections  

2. Relabel the vertices from 0 to 29 based on the sorted order.

Based on the sorted order, the nodes will be relabeled as follows:
Node 0 -> 0  
Node 28 -> 1  
Node 2 -> 2  
Node 14 -> 3  
Node 5 -> 4  
Node 29 -> 5  
Node 12 -> 6  
Node 15 -> 7  
Node 13 -> 8  
Node 3 -> 9  
Node 20 -> 10  
Node 10 -> 11  
Node 27 -> 12  
Node 19 -> 13  
Node 22 -> 14  
Node 7 -> 15  
Node 1 -> 16  
Node 26 -> 17  
Node 18 -> 18  
Node 24 -> 19  
Node 16 -> 20  
Node 6 -> 21  
Node 8 -> 22  
Node 21 -> 23  
Node 17 -> 24  
Node 11 -> 25  
Node 4 -> 26  
Node 25 -> 27  

Now, let's count the triangles by checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge:

Total number of triangles: [142]
