Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 0), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 9), (4, 5), (4, 1), (8, 2), (8, 7), (5, 6), (5, 4), (5, 1), (5, 3), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 3), (2, 0), (0, 6), (0, 9), (0, 2), (0, 7), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 0), (7, 1), (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 2)

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes sorted by degree: 8, 4, 3, 7, 5, 2, 0, 9, 1, 6
Relabeling nodes according to degree: 
Node 8 -> A
Node 4 -> B
...
Node 6 -> J

Edges according to relabeled nodes: (J, B), (J, F), (J, A), (J, C), (J, E), (J, I), (B, J), (B, D), (B, A), (B, G), (B, I), (D, B), (D, F), (D, A), (A, I), (A, G), (F, J), (F, D), (F, A), (F, C), (I, J), (I, A), (I, C), (I, E), (A, J), (A, B), (A, I), (A, H), (C, B), (C, A), (C, I), (C, G), (G, B), (G, A), (G, C), (G, D), (H, J), (H, I), (H, C)

Triangles:
[28]
<J, B, F>, <J, A, G>, <J, A, I>, <J, A, C>, <J, I, C>, <J, I, A>, <J, F, D>, <B, A, G>, <B, A, I>, <B, A, C>, <B, G, C>, <D, A, F>, <F, A, C>, <I, A, C>, <I, A, G>, <I, A, H>, <I, C, G>, <A, I, H>, <A, I, C>, <A, H, J>, <A, C, G>, <F, A, D>, <F, A, C>, <C, A, G>, <C, A, I>, <G, A, D>, <G, A, C>
