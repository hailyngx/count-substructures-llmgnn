Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 5) (11, 4) (11, 9) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method proceeds as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by the number of edges each is connected to, from least to most:
Node 4 (Degree 3)
Node 7 (Degree 4)
Node 3 (Degree 4)
Node 11 (Degree 2)
Node 5 (Degree 3)
Node 13 (Degree 3)
Node 0 (Degree 5)
Node 1 (Degree 5)
Node 6 (Degree 4)
Node 2 (Degree 4)
Node 12 (Degree 4)
Node 14 (Degree 4)
Node 9 (Degree 5)
Node 10 (Degree 5)
Node 8 (Degree 6)

2. Relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 4 → Node 0
Node 7 → Node 1
Node 3 → Node 2
Node 11 → Node 3
Node 5 → Node 4
Node 13 → Node 5
Node 0 → Node 6
Node 1 → Node 7
Node 6 → Node 8
Node 2 → Node 9
Node 12 → Node 10
Node 14 → Node 11
Node 9 → Node 12
Node 10 → Node 13
Node 8 → Node 14

3. Check for triangles:
- Edge (0, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 4.
- Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 8.
- Edge (0, 11) forms a triangle with shared connection 4.
- Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 0.
- Edge (1, 13) forms a triangle with shared connection 5.
- Edge (1, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 7.
- Edge (2, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 3.
- Edge (3, 10) forms a triangle with shared connection 8.
- Edge (3, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 0.
- Edge (4, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 3.
- Edge (4, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 0.
- Edge (5, 0) forms a triangle with shared connection 4.
- Edge (6, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 7.
- Edge (6, 13) forms a triangle with shared connection 5.
- Edge (8, 10) forms a triangle with shared connection 3.
- Edge (8, 12) forms a triangle with shared connection 6.
- Edge (8, 14) forms a triangle with shared connection 10.
- Edge (9, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 7.
- Edge (9, 0) forms a triangle with shared connection 4.
- Edge (10, 14) forms a triangle with shared connection 8.
- Edge (12, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 6.
- Edge (12, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 1.
- Edge (12, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 7.
- Edge (13, 14) forms a triangle with shared connection 8.
