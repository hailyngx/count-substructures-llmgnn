Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 0) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 11) (2, 29) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 27) (29, 0) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 24) (12, 8) (5, 21) (22, 9) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 11) (24, 26) (24, 12) (24, 8) (24, 13) (16, 28) (16, 15) (28, 2) (28, 16) (20, 29) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 23) (8, 12) (8, 24) (8, 20) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 8) (19, 15) (25, 27) (25, 15) (27, 9) (27, 29) (27, 25) (4, 22) (4, 0) (4, 15) (11, 26) (11, 22) (11, 1) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 1) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 25) (15, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 2) (3, 20) (3, 17) (3, 10) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 23) (18, 23) (18, 0) (23, 20) (23, 17) (23, 18) (23, 21) (0, 9) (0, 29) (0, 4) (0, 17) (0, 18) (10, 1) (10, 3) (13, 7) (13, 24) (21, 5) (21, 23) 

Response:
The graph has the following edges:
- (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 0) (9, 27) 
- (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 11) 
- (2, 29) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 28) 
- (29, 20) (29, 27) 
- (7, 12) (7, 13) 
- (12, 24) (12, 8) 
- (5, 21) 
- (22, 4) (22, 11) 
- (24, 8) (24, 13) 
- (16, 15) (16, 28) 
- (20, 3) (20, 23) (20, 8) 
- (8, 19) (8, 14) 
- (25, 27) (25, 15) 
- (27, 25) 
- (4, 15) 
- (11, 1) 
- (14, 1) 
- (15, 19) 
- (1, 10) 
- (3, 17) 
- (17, 23) (17, 0) 
- (18, 23) (18, 0) 
- (23, 21) 
- (10, 3) 
- (13, 24) 
- (21, 5)  

Now let's count the total number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Vertices sorted by the number of connections (degrees):
0: 7
1: 3
3: 4
4: 3
5: 2
7: 2
10: 2
11: 3
13: 2
14: 3
15: 4
16: 2
17: 3
18: 2
19: 2
20: 4
21: 2
22: 4
23: 4
24: 4
25: 2
26: 4
27: 4
28: 3
29: 4
8: 5
9: 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
- Total number of triangles: [9]
- Unique triangles: <4, 8, 24>, <8, 20, 29>, <4, 15, 17>, <15, 16, 28>, <8, 12, 24>, <8, 14, 2>, <8, 19, 15>, <22, 9, 26>, <0, 9, 27>
