Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 3) (1, 11) (15, 7) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 7) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 14) (9, 12) (18, 9) (18, 3) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 12) (11, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (16, 19) (16, 2) (16, 6) (6, 19) (6, 16) (6, 0) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 10) (3, 8) (3, 18) (3, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 12) (2, 17) (2, 16) (12, 17) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 14) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, we will construct the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges:
- 0: {4, 5, 6, 13}
- 1: {11}
- 2: {16, 17}
- 3: {8, 12, 18}
- 4: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- 5: {0, 4, 10, 14}
- 6: {0, 16, 19}
- 7: {15, 17, 10}
- 8: {3, 4, 10}
- 9: {4, 12, 14, 18}
- 10: {5, 7, 8}
- 11: {1}
- 12: {3, 9, 14, 17, 19}
- 13: {0, 17, 19}
- 14: {5, 9, 12}
- 15: {7}
- 16: {2, 6, 19}
- 17: {2, 7, 12, 13}
- 18: {3, 9}
- 19: {6, 12, 13, 16}

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method, sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections):

Nodes in ascending order of degrees: [1, 15, 2, 11, 18, 16, 8, 10, 13, 14, 9, 19, 3, 0, 6, 5, 12, 7, 17, 4]

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [54]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 4, 13>
<0, 5, 10>
<0, 5, 14>
<0, 6, 16>
<3, 8, 10>
<3, 9, 12>
<3, 9, 18>
<7, 10, 17>
<12, 14, 17>
