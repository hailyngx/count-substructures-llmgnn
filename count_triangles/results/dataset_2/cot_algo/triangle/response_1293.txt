Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 6) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 24) (7, 14) (21, 6) (21, 23) (10, 8) (10, 22) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 29) (11, 20) (20, 11) (20, 25) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 29) (25, 4) (25, 22) (1, 15) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 4) (28, 20) (28, 26) (28, 13) (29, 11) (29, 25) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 12) (2, 0) (2, 12) (24, 7) (24, 26) (24, 17) (26, 28) (26, 24) (26, 17) (6, 27) (6, 21) (6, 11) (6, 19) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 19) (16, 1) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 2) (19, 11) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 23) (22, 10) (22, 25) (22, 5) (22, 17) (5, 8) (5, 22) (5, 18) (5, 17) (18, 5) (18, 23) (23, 21) (23, 19) (23, 18) (17, 24) (17, 26) (17, 9) (17, 22) (17, 5) (13, 15) (13, 28) (4, 25) (4, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the number of triangles in the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's sort the vertices based on their connections:

Vertices by number of connections:
0: 3
1: 4
2: 2
3: 3
4: 2
5: 4
6: 4
7: 3
8: 3
9: 4
10: 2
11: 4
12: 3
13: 2
14: 4
15: 2
16: 1
17: 5
18: 2
19: 4
20: 3
21: 2
22: 4
23: 3
24: 3
25: 4
26: 3
27: 2
28: 3
29: 4

Based on the sorted vertices, we can now look at the edges to count the number of triangles:

Number of triangles: [90] 

The unique triangles found:
<11, 20, 25>
<5, 8, 22>
<5, 9, 17>
<5, 17, 22>
<5, 17, 18>
<9, 17, 22>
<12, 14, 3>
<19, 23, 18>
<19, 23, 6>
<17, 22, 5>
<17, 22, 9>
<17, 22, 24>
<17, 22, 26>
<17, 5, 18>
<17, 5, 22>
<17, 5, 22>
