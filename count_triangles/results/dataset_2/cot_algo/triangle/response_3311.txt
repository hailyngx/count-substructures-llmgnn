Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 15) (4, 17) (8, 11) (8, 7) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 15) (1, 5) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 13) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 17) (19, 9) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 12) (16, 10) (16, 17) (17, 4) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 15) (15, 4) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 17) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 12) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 17) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: <br>
Node 16 has 2 connections. <br>
Node 1 has 2 connections. <br>
Node 19 has 2 connections. <br>
Node 18 has 3 connections. <br>
Node 4 has 3 connections. <br>
Node 10 has 3 connections. <br>
Node 1 has 3 connections. <br>
Node 2 has 4 connections. <br>
Node 5 has 4 connections. <br>
Node 3 has 4 connections. <br>
Node 14 has 4 connections. <br>
Node 12 has 5 connections. <br>
Node 0 has 5 connections. <br>
Node 13 has 5 connections. <br>
Node 6 has 5 connections. <br>
Node 11 has 6 connections. <br>
Node 9 has 6 connections. <br>
Node 7 has 6 connections. <br>
Node 17 has 7 connections. <br>
Node 15 has 8 connections. <br>

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method for triangle counting and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles: 

[Total number of triangles: 35]
