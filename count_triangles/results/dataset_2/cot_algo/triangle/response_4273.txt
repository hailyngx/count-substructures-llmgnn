Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 14) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 17) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 4) (6, 11) (6, 17) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 14) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 19) (15, 19) (15, 17) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 3) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 18) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 15) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 16) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 18) (16, 4) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 16) (18, 8) (18, 3) (18, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort the vertices by their number of connections and then proceed with counting the triangles.

The sorted list of vertices is:
Node 12: 1 connection
Node 19: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 16: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 18: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections

Now, we will go through each edge while considering the vertices as per their sorted order and count the triangles formed by shared connections.

After calculating, we find that there are 26 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles in the graph are:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 16>
<0, 5, 10>
<0, 5, 13>
<0, 10, 19>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 10>
<2, 7, 14>
<3, 10, 19>
<3, 18, 19>
<4, 5, 13>
<4, 5, 16>
<4, 11, 17>
<5, 9, 13>
<8, 13, 14>
<8, 13, 16>
<10, 11, 17>
<10, 0, 3>
<14, 8, 13>
<14, 8, 16>
<14, 2, 7>
<14, 2, 16>
<14, 16, 18>
<15, 17, 19>
<16, 9, 13>
<16, 14, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [26].
