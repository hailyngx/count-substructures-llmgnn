Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 9) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 13) (17, 2) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 11) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 13) (16, 18) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 14) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 5) (18, 16) (18, 14) (18, 19) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 6) (6, 19) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 19) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 12) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 14) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method consists of sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then relabeling the vertices accordingly. 

The sorted vertices with their degrees are:
Node 16: degree 1
Node 18: degree 2
Node 15: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 17: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 16: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4
Node 0: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 14: degree 5
Node 10: degree 6
Node 11: degree 6
Node 13: degree 6
Node 7: degree 6
Node 9: degree 6
Node 8: degree 6

Following the method, we will consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections and check for shared connections to count triangles.

The total number of triangles is: [24]

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 17>
<0, 10, 13>
<0, 12, 14>

<0, 2, 19>
