Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 14) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 3) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 5) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 11) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 11), 
(1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 10), (1, 12),
(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 8),
(3, 11), (3, 12), (3, 14),
(4, 2), (4, 9), (4, 11),
(5, 10), (5, 12),
(6, 0), (6, 12), (6, 13), (6, 14),
(7, 1), (7, 8), (7, 10), (7, 13), (7, 14),
(8, 2), (8, 7), (8, 11), (8, 13),
(9, 4), (9, 14),
(10, 1), (10, 5), (10, 7), (10, 13),
(11, 0), (11, 3), (11, 4), (11, 8),
(12, 1), (12, 3), (12, 5), (12, 6),
(13, 6), (13, 7), (13, 8), (13, 10), (13, 14),
(14, 6), (14, 7), (14, 9), (14, 13).

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles: 

Nodes sorted by degree:
0(4), 3(3), 9(2), 10(4), 2(3), 5(4), 8(4), 12(4), 1(4), 11(4), 4(3), 6(4), 13(5), 7(5), 14(5).

Triangles:
[54]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 12>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 12>, <1, 5, 12>, <1, 7, 10>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 11>, <4, 9, 14>, <6, 7, 13>, <6, 12, 14>, <6, 13, 14>, <7, 8, 13>, <7, 10, 13>, <10, 13, 14>.
