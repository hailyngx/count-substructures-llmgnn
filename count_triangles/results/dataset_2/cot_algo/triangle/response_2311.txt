Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 8) (1, 16) (1, 18) (12, 10) (12, 17) (2, 15) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 11) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 14) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 10) (9, 17) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 15) (14, 13) (14, 16) (14, 11) (18, 1) (18, 0) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 0) (0, 18) (0, 17) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 6) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degree is as follows:
(3, 18), (1, 12), (9, 12), (6, 12), (12, 10), (2, 8), (8, 8), (4, 8), (7, 8), (16, 8), (5, 8), (13, 8), (19, 8), (14, 8), (11, 8), (10, 8), (15, 8), (17, 8), (0, 4)

From the given edges, we can determine the triangles and count them. 

The total number of triangles is [16].

The unique triangles found are:
<15, 3, 5>, <15, 3, 2>, <15, 3, 8>, <15, 2, 8>, <4, 19, 13>, <4, 19, 10>, <12, 17, 9>, <8, 5, 11>, <13, 14, 11>, <16, 7, 10>, <11, 6, 10>, <14, 16, 4>, <14, 16, 11>, <14, 16, 13>, <17, 0, 18>, <17, 9, 0>
