Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 4) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 14) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 4) (14, 12) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most is as follows:
Node  11  has  2  connections.
Node  7  has  2  connections.
Node  1  has  3  connections.
Node  13  has  3  connections.
Node  3  has  4  connections.
Node  10  has  4  connections.
Node  5  has  5  connections.
Node  0  has  5  connections.
Node  14  has  5  connections.
Node  6  has  5  connections.
Node  2  has  6  connections.
Node  8  has  6  connections.
Node  4  has  6  connections.
Node  12  has  6  connections.
Node  9  has  7  connections.

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge between (6, 9): Shared connections = 8, 4 -> Triangle formed: <6, 9, 4>
2. Edge between (6, 12): No triangle formed.
3. Edge between (6, 8): No triangle formed.
4. Edge between (6, 0): No triangle formed.
5. Edge between (9, 8): No triangle formed.
6. Edge between (9, 4): No triangle formed.
7. Edge between (10, 0): No triangle formed.
8. Edge between (10, 12): No triangle formed.
9. Edge between (10, 14): No triangle formed.
10. Edge between (11, 1): No triangle formed.
11. Edge between (11, 13): No triangle formed.
12. Edge between (11, 5): No triangle formed.
13. Edge between (5, 13): No triangle formed.
14. Edge between (5, 1): No triangle formed.
15. Edge between (5, 3): No triangle formed.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
The unique triangles found are: <6, 9, 4>.
