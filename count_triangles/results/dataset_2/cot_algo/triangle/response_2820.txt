Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 0) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 2) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 12) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 12) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 12) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles in the provided graph is as follows:

1. Relabel the vertices based on their number of connections (degree):
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 6

2. Now, we will look at each edge and count the number of triangles it participates in:
- (4, 7): Forms a triangle with nodes 7, 3, and 14 <7, 3, 14>.
- (4, 0): Forms a triangle with nodes 0, 6, and 14 <0, 6, 14>.
- (4, 5): Forms a triangle with nodes 5, 1, and 6 <5, 1, 6>.
- (7, 4): No new triangles.
- (7, 0): No new triangles.
- (7, 3): Forms a triangle with nodes 3, 14, and 12 <3, 14, 12>.
- (7, 2): No new triangles.
- (7, 5): Forms a triangle with nodes 5, 1, and 2 <5, 1, 2>.
- (1, 6): No new triangles.
- (1, 14): Forms a triangle with nodes 14, 0, and 9 <14, 0, 9>.
- (1, 5): Forms a triangle with nodes 5, 2, and 6 <5, 2, 6>.
- (1, 9): No new triangles.
- (3, 7): No new triangles.
- (3, 14): Forms a triangle with nodes 14, 8, and 12 <14, 8, 12>.

- (8, 13): No new triangles.
- (8, 14): Forms a triangle with nodes 14, 0, and 2 <14, 0, 2>.
- (8, 11): No new triangles.
- (13, 8): No new triangles.
- (13, 11): Forms a triangle with nodes 11, 9, and 2 <11, 9, 2>.
- (13, 0): No new triangles.
- (5, 4): No new triangles.
- (5, 7): No new triangles.
- (5, 1): No new triangles.
- (5, 6): No new triangles.
- (5, 2): No new triangles.
- (5, 10): No new triangles.
- (6, 1): No new triangles.
- (6, 5): No new triangles.
- (6, 2): Forms a triangle with nodes 2, 0, and 12 <2, 0, 12>.
- (6, 0): Forms a triangle with nodes 0, 14, and 2 <0, 14, 2>.
- (0, 4): No new triangles.
- (0, 7): No new triangles.
- (0, 13): No new triangles.
- (0, 6): No new triangles.
- (0, 14): No new triangles.
- (0, 2): No new triangles.
- (14, 1): No new triangles.
- (14, 3): Forms a triangle with nodes 3, 8, and 12 <3, 8, 12>.
- (14, 8): No new triangles.
- (14, 0): No new triangles.
- (11, 8): No new triangles.
- (11, 13): No new triangles.
- (11, 9): No new triangles.
- (11, 2): No new triangles.
- (9, 1): No new triangles.
- (9, 11): No new triangles.
- (9, 12): Forms a triangle with nodes 12, 3, and 10 <12, 3, 10>.
- (2, 7): No new triangles.
- (2, 5): No new triangles.
- (2, 6): No new triangles.
- (2, 0): No new triangles.
- (2, 11): No new triangles.
- (2, 12): No new triangles.
- (12, 3): No new triangles.
- (12, 9): No new triangles.
- (12, 2): No new triangles.
- (12, 10): No new triangles.
- (10, 5): No new triangles.
- (10, 12): No new triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7] and the unique triangles found are <7, 3, 14>, <0, 6, 14>, <5, 1, 6>, <5, 2, 6>, <14, 0, 9>, <14, 8, 12>, and <11, 9, 2>.
