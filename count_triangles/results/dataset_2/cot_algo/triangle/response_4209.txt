Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 13) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree of connectivity and then counting the triangles formed by these nodes. 

The sorted list of nodes with their degrees is as follows:
0: 3
5: 2
10: 2
7: 3
1: 3
6: 3
12: 4
13: 4
4: 5
2: 5
14: 6
8: 6
3: 6
11: 6
9: 6

Based on the edges provided, we can identify the following triangles:

<0, 10, 1>
<2, 9, 4>
<2, 13, 0>
<3, 9, 4>
<3, 13, 0>
<3, 9, 11>
<3, 13, 2>
<4, 8, 1>
<4, 12, 7>
<4, 12, 2>
<6, 7, 4>
<6, 11, 8>
<6, 14, 2>
<7, 12, 4>
<8, 11, 3>
<13, 2, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
