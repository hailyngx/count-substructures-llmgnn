Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 8) (12, 9) (12, 7) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to efficiently count the number of triangles in the graph. 

Let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

Node 5 has degree 3  
Node 9 has degree 6  
Node 1 has degree 4  
Node 3 has degree 6  
Node 10 has degree 3  
Node 8 has degree 6  
Node 11 has degree 3  
Node 13 has degree 5  
Node 12 has degree 2  
Node 7 has degree 6  
Node 6 has degree 4  
Node 0 has degree 4  
Node 2 has degree 4  
Node 14 has degree 3  
Node 4 has degree 5  

Now, we will relabel the vertices according to their degrees in increasing order:

Node 12 has degree 2  
Node 5 has degree 3  
Node 10 has degree 3  
Node 11 has degree 3  
Node 14 has degree 3  
Node 6 has degree 4  
Node 1 has degree 4  
Node 3 has degree 6  
Node 8 has degree 6  
Node 9 has degree 6  
Node 13 has degree 5  
Node 2 has degree 4  
Node 7 has degree 6  
Node 0 has degree 4  
Node 4 has degree 5  

Now, let's list the triangles found using the given edges:

- Triangle <3, 6, 0>
- Triangle <3, 6, 4>
- Triangle <3, 6, 7>
- Triangle <0, 6, 4>
- Triangle <0, 6, 7>

Count of triangles: [5]
