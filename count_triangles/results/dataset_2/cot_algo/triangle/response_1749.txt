Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 0) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 6) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 5) (18, 2) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 0) (3, 11) (3, 4) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 17) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 7) (17, 13) (17, 1) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 4) (15, 16) (8, 5) (8, 9) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 14) (12, 1) (12, 4) (0, 9) (0, 6) (16, 15) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 15) (7, 19) (14, 4) (19, 4) (19, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then relabeling the vertices accordingly. Here is the sorted list of nodes with their connections:
- Node 5: 5 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 10: 4 connections
- Node 11: 5 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 18: 2 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 13: 3 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 17: 2 connections
- Node 15: 4 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 4: 5 connections
- Node 12: 2 connections
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 16: 1 connection
- Node 7: 5 connections
- Node 14: 1 connection
- Node 19: 2 connections

Now, we will count the triangles formed by checking the shared connections for each edge in the order of the sorted vertices. 

After counting, the total number of triangles is found to be [4]. 

The unique triangles found are:
- <5, 6, 10>
- <5, 6, 0>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <11, 13, 17>
