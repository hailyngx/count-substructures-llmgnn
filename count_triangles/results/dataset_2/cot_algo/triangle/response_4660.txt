Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 6
- Node 3: degree 6

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

1. Edge (5, 9): 
    - Node 5 (degree 3) is less than Node 9 (degree 3). Check for shared connections between 5 and 9: None.
2. Edge (5, 2): 
    - Node 5 (degree 3) is less than Node 2 (degree 6). Check for shared connections between 5 and 2: Node 1.
3. Edge (5, 8):
    - Node 5 (degree 3) is less than Node 8 (degree 3). Check for shared connections between 5 and 8: None.
4. Edge (5, 1):
    - Node 5 (degree 3) is less than Node 1 (degree 6). Check for shared connections between 5 and 1: Node 1.
5. Edge (9, 4):
    - Node 9 (degree 3) is less than Node 4 (degree 3). Check for shared connections between 9 and 4: Node 3.
6. Edge (9, 2):
    - Node 9 (degree 3) is less than Node 2 (degree 6). Check for shared connections between 9 and 2: Node 1.
7. Edge (9, 3):
    - Node 9 (degree 3) is less than Node 3 (degree 6). Check for shared connections between 9 and 3: Node 4.
8. Edge (6, 2):
    - Node 6 (degree 3) is less than Node 2 (degree 6). Check for shared connections between 6 and 2: Node 1.
9. Edge (6, 8):
    - Node 6 (degree 3) is less than Node 8 (degree 3). Check for shared connections between 6 and 8: None.
10. Edge (6, 4):
    - Node 6 (degree 3) is less than Node 4 (degree 3). Check for shared connections between 6 and 4: Node 3.

After going through all the edges, we found a total of 6 triangles in the graph. 
Therefore, the output should be [6]. 
And the unique triangles found are: 
<1, 5, 2>, <1, 9, 2>, <1, 9, 4>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 6, 4>, <3, 9, 4>.
