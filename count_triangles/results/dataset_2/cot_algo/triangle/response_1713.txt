Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Edges:  
- 0: 9, 4, 7, 3  
- 1: 5, 3  
- 2: 5, 9, 4, 7, 6  
- 3: 5, 1, 8, 0  
- 4: 7, 8, 0, 2  
- 5: 6, 2, 1, 3  
- 6: 5, 7, 8, 2  
- 7: 9, 4, 0, 6, 2  
- 8: 9, 4, 3, 6  
- 9: 8, 2, 7, 0
