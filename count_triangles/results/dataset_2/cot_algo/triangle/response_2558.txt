Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 24) (15, 28) (6, 15) (6, 20) (9, 25) (9, 11) (9, 16) (22, 4) (22, 5) (22, 7) (22, 21) (23, 2) (23, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 26) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 4) (10, 23) (10, 1) (17, 2) (2, 23) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 26) (19, 26) (19, 14) (19, 20) (19, 0) (26, 8) (26, 2) (26, 19) (11, 9) (11, 28) (11, 24) (28, 15) (28, 11) (28, 7) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 18) (0, 1) (7, 22) (7, 28) (20, 6) (20, 19) (4, 3) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 14) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 12) (24, 15) (24, 11) (24, 25) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 29) (1, 5) (29, 1) (29, 27) (21, 22) (21, 18) (5, 22) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 25) (25, 9) (25, 24) (25, 5) (25, 18) (27, 29) (14, 19) (14, 12) (18, 0) (18, 21) (18, 25) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering for the vertices based on the number of connections (degree) is as follows:
Vertex 1 - degree 3
Vertex 29 - degree 2
Vertex 27 - degree 1
Vertex 3 - degree 2
Vertex 7 - degree 2
Vertex 6 - degree 2
Vertex 9 - degree 3
Vertex 11 - degree 3
Vertex 17 - degree 2
Vertex 13 - degree 4
Vertex 16 - degree 4
Vertex 19 - degree 4
Vertex 21 - degree 2
Vertex 23 - degree 2
Vertex 26 - degree 4
Vertex 5 - degree 5
Vertex 25 - degree 5
Vertex 4 - degree 5
Vertex 12 - degree 4
Vertex 14 - degree 2
Vertex 18 - degree 3
Vertex 24 - degree 3
Vertex 0 - degree 4
Vertex 2 - degree 5
Vertex 20 - degree 3
Vertex 8 - degree 4
Vertex 22 - degree 5
Vertex 28 - degree 3
Vertex 10 - degree 2

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- We will only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
- Count triangles formed by the shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

The total number of triangles found is [8].

The unique triangles found are:
<12, 4, 13>
<12, 5, 14>
<12, 16, 25>
<13, 4, 12>
<14, 5, 12>
<16, 9, 25>
<18, 0, 1>
<18, 0, 15>
