The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 14) (1, 10) (21, 1) (21, 12) (21, 15) (21, 29) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 13) (5, 6) (5, 24) (22, 26) (22, 24) (22, 20) (22, 29) (22, 7) (26, 22) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 17) (7, 22) (7, 25) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 17) (25, 7) (25, 23) (10, 1) (15, 21) (15, 23) (15, 28) (11, 9) (11, 20) (23, 25) (23, 15) (23, 2) (23, 24) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 27) (14, 1) (14, 26) (14, 7) (24, 5) (24, 22) (24, 23) (24, 16) (17, 26) (17, 7) (17, 27) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 28) (0, 18) (0, 19) (3, 0) (3, 4) (16, 24) (16, 20) (28, 15) (28, 0) (28, 13) (2, 26) (2, 7) (2, 23) (12, 21) (12, 8) (20, 22) (20, 11) (20, 16) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 13) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 4) (29, 21) (29, 22) (13, 9) (13, 28) (13, 4) (18, 0) (27, 8) (27, 17) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
- 0: {9, 3, 18, 19, 28}
- 1: {21, 14, 10} 
- 2: {26, 7, 23}
- 3: {0, 4}
- 4: {3, 19, 13}
- 5: {6, 24}
- 6: {9, 5, 19}
- 7: {22, 25, 14, 2, 17}
- 8: {9, 12, 27}
- 9: {6, 8, 0, 11, 13}
- 10: {1}
- 11: {9, 20}
- 12: {21, 8}
- 13: {9, 28, 4}
- 14: {1, 26, 7}
- 15: {21, 23, 28}
- 16: {24, 20}
- 17: {26, 7, 27}
- 18: {0}
- 19: {6, 4, 0}
- 20: {22, 16, 11}
- 21: {1, 12, 15, 29}
- 22: {26, 24, 20, 29, 7}
- 23: {25, 15, 2, 24}
- 24: {5, 22, 23, 16}
- 25: {7, 23}
- 26: {22, 14, 2, 17}
- 27: {8, 17}
- 28: {15, 0, 13}
- 29: {21, 22}

The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices sorted by degrees:
0 < 10 < 11 < 12 < 16 < 18 < 1 < 17 < 5 < 13 < 15 < 26 < 3 < 19 < 4 < 7 < 8 < 2 < 9 < 14 < 20 < 21 < 22 < 23 < 24 < 25 < 27 < 28 < 29 < 6

By following the method described earlier to count the triangles formed by the shared connections between vertices of each edge, the total number of triangles is [14].

Here are the unique triangles found:
<6, 9, 19>
<0, 9, 13>
<0, 9, 19>
<1, 12, 21>
<6, 7, 22>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 13, 28>
<4, 13, 19>
<0, 18, 28>
<7, 22, 26>
<7, 14, 26>
<7, 17, 26>
<9, 13, 28>
<16, 20, 24>
