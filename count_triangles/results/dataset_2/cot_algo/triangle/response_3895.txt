Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves labeling the vertices based on their degrees. To do this, we need to count the number of connections each node has in the given graph.

| Node | Connections |
|------|-------------|
| 0    | 4           |
| 1    | 2           |
| 2    | 5           |
| 3    | 4           |
| 4    | 4           |
| 5    | 5           |
| 6    | 4           |
| 7    | 5           |
| 8    | 4           |
| 9    | 4           |

Now, we sort the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order and assign labels accordingly:

| Node | Connections | Label |
|------|-------------|-------|
| 1    | 2           | 0     |
| 0    | 4           | 1     |
| 3    | 4           | 2     |
| 6    | 4           | 3     |
| 8    | 4           | 4     |
| 4    | 4           | 5     |
| 9    | 4           | 6     |
| 7    | 5           | 7     |
| 2    | 5           | 8     |
| 5    | 5           | 9     |

Now let's count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering:

- For edge (1, 4): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (0, 4): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (3, 6): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (2, 6): Triangle formed with node 3: <2, 6, 3>.
- For edge (2, 3): Triangle formed with node 6: <2, 3, 6>.

Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles: <2, 6, 3>, <2, 3, 6>
