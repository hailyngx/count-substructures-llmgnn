Node 3: connected to 12, 14, 23, 29
Node 4: connected to 16, 22, 23
Node 5: connected to 0, 7, 10, 19
Node 6: connected to 9, 12, 17, 19
Node 7: connected to 5, 11, 17
Node 8: connected to 16, 13, 20, 25, 22
Node 9: connected to 2, 6, 12, 17, 18
Node 10: connected to 5, 16, 22, 12, 28
Node 11: connected to 7
Node 12: connected to 3, 6, 9, 10, 15
Node 13: connected to 2, 8
Node 14: connected to 3, 29
Node 15: connected to 12, 27
Node 16: connected to 4, 8, 10
Node 17: connected to 6, 7, 9, 23, 29
Node 18: connected to 9
Node 19: connected to 5, 6, 25, 27
Node 20: connected to 2, 8
Node 22: connected to 4, 8, 10, 27
Node 23: connected to 4, 17, 3
Node 24: connected to 26
Node 25: connected to 8, 19, 26
Node 26: connected to 27, 24, 25, 29
Node 27: connected to 15, 19, 22, 26
Node 28: connected to 2, 10
Node 29: connected to 3, 14, 17, 26

Next, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
0: 1
11: 1
18: 1
24: 1
28: 1
1: 2
5: 4
4: 3
7: 3
13: 2
15: 2
16: 3
20: 2
6: 4
2: 4
8: 5
25: 3
10: 5
12: 5
3: 4
14: 2
17: 5
23: 3
9: 5
19: 4
22: 4
26: 4
27: 4
29: 4

Now, let's count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [76]

Unique triangles:
