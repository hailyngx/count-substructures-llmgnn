Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (13, 7) (13, 3) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 3) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 3) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 10) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort the vertices by their number of connections, from least to most connections. The sorted vertices are as follows:

Vertices with 0 connections: 6, 9, 13
Vertices with 1 connection: 0, 1, 5, 11, 13
Vertices with 2 connections: 3, 6, 9, 14
Vertices with 3 connections: 2, 5, 8
Vertices with 4 connections: 7, 11
Vertices with 5 connections: 10, 12
Vertices with 6 connections: 4

Now, starting with edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will count the number of triangles:

We find the following triangles:
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 10, 12>
<2, 6, 14>
<1, 5, 11>
<1, 8, 12>
<0, 3, 12>
<1, 5, 11>
<4, 7, 3>
<4, 7, 10>
<4, 7, 11>
<4, 10, 12>
<7, 10, 3>
<11, 12, 14>
<10, 11, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
