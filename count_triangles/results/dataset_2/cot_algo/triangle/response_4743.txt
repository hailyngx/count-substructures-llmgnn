Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 4), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 0), (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 6), (4, 2), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 1), (8, 7), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 0), (0, 9), (0, 6), (0, 7), (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 7), (7, 8), (7, 6), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 1), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 7), (3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 7)

Next, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 6

Now, we will start counting the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

[Total Number of Triangles: 3]

<5, 1, 7>
<5, 1, 8>
<5, 1, 7>
