Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 0) (22, 12) (18, 22) (18, 6) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 26) (23, 11) (23, 7) (23, 24) (23, 27) (26, 8) (26, 2) (26, 16) (26, 0) (1, 20) (1, 14) (1, 19) (17, 25) (17, 3) (17, 28) (11, 23) (11, 6) (11, 29) (11, 25) (10, 8) (10, 21) (10, 20) (21, 10) (21, 9) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 16) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 6) (25, 17) (25, 11) (25, 0) (16, 26) (16, 4) (16, 5) (24, 23) (24, 5) (24, 15) (3, 17) (3, 20) (7, 23) (29, 8) (29, 11) (29, 27) (20, 1) (20, 10) (20, 3) (20, 9) (27, 23) (27, 29) (2, 26) (2, 19) (9, 21) (9, 4) (9, 20) (9, 15) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 0) (28, 17) (28, 5) (15, 24) (15, 9) (15, 14) (5, 16) (5, 24) (5, 28) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 15) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 13) (0, 22) (0, 26) (0, 25) (0, 19) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes with their degrees: 
0 (6), 1 (3), 2 (2), 3 (2), 4 (3), 5 (3), 6 (3), 7 (1), 8 (3), 9 (4), 10 (3), 11 (4), 12 (3), 13 (2), 14 (4), 15 (3), 16 (3), 17 (3), 18 (2), 19 (3), 20 (4), 21 (2), 22 (5), 23 (4), 24 (3), 25 (3), 26 (4), 27 (2), 28 (2), 29 (3)

Sorted by degree in ascending order:
7, 2, 3, 13, 18, 21, 27, 28, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 25, 0, 14, 20, 24, 29, 19, 11, 23, 26, 9, 22

Applying the degree-based ordering to the edges:
(7, 23), (2, 26), (2, 19), (3, 20), (3, 17), (13, 22), (18, 22), (21, 10), (27, 29), (27, 23), (28, 17), (1, 20), (1, 19), (4, 16), (4, 9), (4, 14), (5, 24), (5, 28), (6, 12), (6, 11), (8, 26), (8, 10), (8, 29), (12, 22), (15, 24), (15, 14), (16, 26), (16, 4), (17, 25), (18, 6), (0, 26)
