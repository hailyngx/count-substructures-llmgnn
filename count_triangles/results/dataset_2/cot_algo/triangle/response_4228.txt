Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 8), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 0), (1, 7), (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 8), (3, 4), (4, 9), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 0), (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 0), (8, 6), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 2), (0, 8)

Next, we will label the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):

Node 7 (degree 1): Connected to nodes 1, 2, 5
Node 6 (degree 2): Connected to nodes 5, 8, 9
Node 4 (degree 3): Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 9
Node 3 (degree 4): Connected to nodes 1, 4, 8, 9
Node 0 (degree 5): Connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 8
Node 5 (degree 5): Connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 7
Node 8 (degree 5): Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, 9
Node 2 (degree 6): Connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 1 (degree 6): Connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, 9
Node 9 (degree 7): Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through the edges and count the triangles. 

After calculating, we find that there are a total of [12] triangles in the graph. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<5, 0, 2>, <5, 2, 9>, <5, 2, 0>, <9, 1, 0>, <9, 3, 1>, <9, 3, 8>, <9, 4, 0>, <3, 1, 0>, <3, 8, 2>, <3, 9, 1>, <4, 0, 2>, <4, 0, 8>.
