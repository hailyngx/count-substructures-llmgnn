Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 26) (22, 19) (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 1) (26, 22) (26, 9) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 27) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 23) (17, 27) (17, 11) (5, 0) (5, 27) (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 18) (10, 28) (11, 26) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 25) (28, 10) (28, 27) (28, 15) (29, 7) (4, 14) (4, 27) (4, 0) (4, 25) (27, 26) (27, 17) (27, 5) (27, 28) (27, 4) (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 8) (21, 14) (21, 10) (21, 12) (2, 3) (2, 24) (12, 14) (12, 21) (12, 25) (19, 22) (19, 3) (19, 15) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 15) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (15, 28) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 24) (7, 29) (20, 26) (20, 6) (6, 20) (6, 0) (24, 17) (24, 2) (24, 15) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) (23, 17) (23, 25) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 16) (8, 25) (16, 8) (25, 11) (25, 4) (25, 12) (25, 23) (25, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will involve the following steps: 

1. Sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections) from least to most:
   Nodes in ascending order of degree: [7, 20, 2, 16, 29, 6, 5, 12, 23, 9, 1, 3, 19, 8, 21, 28, 4, 10, 0, 14, 24, 18, 22, 15, 26, 17, 11, 25, 27, 13]

2. Relabel the nodes accordingly:
   Nodes with new labels: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5, 6: 6, 7: 7, 8: 8, 9: 9, 10: 10, 11: 11, 12: 12, 13: 13, 14: 15, 15: 16, 16: 18, 17: 19, 18: 20, 19: 21, 20: 22, 21: 23, 22: 24, 23: 25, 24: 26, 25: 27, 26: 28, 27: 29, 28: 30, 29: 31]

3. Count the triangles by checking for shared connections in the original graph:
   Total number of triangles: [68]
