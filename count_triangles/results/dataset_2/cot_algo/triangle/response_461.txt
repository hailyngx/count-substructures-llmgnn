Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 11) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections). Here is the list of nodes with their degrees in ascending order:  

(3: 2)  
(2: 2)  
(5: 3)  
(8: 3)  
(0: 4)  
(14: 2)  
(10: 4)  
(4: 5)  
(13: 6)  
(7: 4)  
(1: 5)  
(12: 4)  
(11: 5)  
(6: 7)  
(9: 4)  

Now, let's count the number of triangles within this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The total number of triangles is [24].

The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 4, 8>  
<0, 4, 12>  
<0, 4, 14>  
<0, 8, 12>  
<0, 8, 14>  
<0, 12, 14>  
<1, 4, 5>  
<1, 4, 11>  
<1, 5, 11>  
<4, 5, 11>  
<4, 5, 13>  
<4, 10, 12>  
<4, 10, 13>  
<5, 10, 13>  
<6, 7, 9>  
<6, 7, 12>  
<6, 9, 12>  
<6, 11, 13>  
<8, 13, 4>  
<8, 13, 5>  
<9, 11, 13>  
<10, 12, 4>  
<10, 12, 13>
