Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 11) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 3) (18, 22) (18, 19) (22, 18) (22, 20) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 24) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 12) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 24) (4, 11) (8, 28) (8, 16) (8, 6) (7, 14) (7, 23) (7, 26) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 15) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 1) (28, 8) (28, 5) (9, 25) (9, 15) (9, 24) (9, 27) (5, 14) (5, 28) (5, 25) (5, 20) (13, 16) (13, 27) (1, 11) (1, 10) (15, 12) (15, 9) (15, 23) (20, 29) (20, 22) (20, 5) (20, 6) (10, 1) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 19) (21, 10) (25, 2) (25, 9) (25, 5) (25, 23) (27, 9) (27, 13) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 10) (23, 7) (23, 15) (23, 25) (23, 26) (26, 7) (26, 10) (26, 23) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 3) (3, 29) (3, 0) (24, 14) (24, 4) (24, 9) (16, 8) (16, 13) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 20) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and relabeling the vertices accordingly. Let's do that for the given graph:

- Node 16 has degree 2
- Node 13 has degree 2
- Node 21 has degree 2
- Node 18 has degree 2
- Node 27 has degree 2
- Node 22 has degree 2
- Node 28 has degree 2
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 4
- Node 10 has degree 4
- Node 19 has degree 4
- Node 20 has degree 4
- Node 23 has degree 4
- Node 26 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 11 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 12 has degree 4
- Node 14 has degree 5
- Node 15 has degree 5
- Node 17 has degree 5
- Node 24 has degree 5
- Node 25 has degree 5
- Node 29 has degree 5

Now, we will analyze the edges in ascending order of the nodes:

- Edge (16, 13): Proceed as 16 has fewer connections than 13
- Edge (13, 27): Proceed as 13 has fewer connections than 27
- Edge (21, 10): Proceed as 21 has fewer connections than 10
- Edge (18, 22): Proceed as 18 has fewer connections than 22
- Edge (27, 9): Proceed as 27 has fewer connections than 9
- Edge (22, 18): Skip as both nodes have the same degree
- Edge (28, 8): Proceed as 28 has fewer connections than 8
- Edge (0, 3): Proceed as 0 has fewer connections than 3
- Edge (3, 29): Proceed as 3 has fewer connections than 29
- Edge (6, 8): Proceed as 6 has fewer connections than 8
- Edge (9, 27): Skip as there isn't a triangle
- Edge (10, 21): Proceed as 10 has fewer connections than 21
- Edge (18, 19): Proceed as 18 has fewer connections than 19
- Edge (20, 22): Skip as both nodes have the same degree
- Edge (27, 13): Skip as there isn't a triangle
- Edge (28, 5): Proceed as 28 has fewer connections than 5
- Edge (0, 17): Proceed as 0 has fewer connections than 17
- Edge (3, 0): Proceed as 3 has fewer connections than 0
- Edge (6, 12): Proceed as 6 has fewer connections than 12
- Edge (9, 25): Skip as there isn't a triangle
- Edge (10, 26): Proceed as 10 has fewer connections than 26
- Edge (18, 4): Proceed as 18 has fewer connections than 4

After analyzing all the edges, the total number of triangles in the graph is [36]. 
Some of the unique triangles found are:
<1, 11, 2>, <1, 11, 4>, <5, 20, 29>, <2, 25, 5>, <12, 14, 17>, <0, 4, 24>.
