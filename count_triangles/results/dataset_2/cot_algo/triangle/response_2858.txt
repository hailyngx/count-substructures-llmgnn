Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 10) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 18) (7, 5) (10, 16) (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 9) (1, 13) (1, 18) (15, 19) (15, 0) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 6) (19, 0) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 12) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 14) (18, 7) (18, 1) (18, 5) (18, 19) (12, 17) (12, 8) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 8) (14, 9) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 0) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 15, 19, 3, 13.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 13, 18.
- Node 3 is connected to node 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 13.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 11, 7, 19, 18.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 17, 19, 13.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 18, 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 11, 16, 9, 14, 12.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 17, 8, 14.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 16, 17.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 14, 5, 8.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 17, 8.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 0, 6.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11, 16, 8, 9.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 19, 0.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 8, 14, 10.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 10, 6, 9, 12.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 5, 19.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 15, 5, 18, 6, 0.

Let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes by degree: 3, 1, 7, 12, 10, 4, 15, 2, 17, 18, 6, 13, 9, 16, 14, 11, 8, 19, 0

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles as follows:

[Number of triangles: 2]

Unique triangles found: 
<16, 14, 8>
<5, 18, 19>
