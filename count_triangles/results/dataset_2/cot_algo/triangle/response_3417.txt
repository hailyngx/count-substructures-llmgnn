Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 0) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 2) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 0) 

Response:
We will now construct the graph based on the given edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 10, 8, 4, and 13.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 2, 10, and 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 8, 12, and 13.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 11, 7, 13, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 10, 0.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 12, 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 2, 13.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 2, 0, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 14, 1.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 11, 0, 12, 4.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 10, 14.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 5, 10, 2.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 2, 0.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 11.

Now we will sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order:
(14, 0), (4, 1), (12, 2), (7, 3), (6, 4), (8, 5), (13, 6), (11, 7), (2, 8), (9, 9), (1, 10), (3, 11), (10, 12), (5, 13), (0, 14)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles formed:
1. Calculate the triangles formed by checking shared connections: 
   - <0, 4, 1>
   - <0, 4, 10>
   - <0, 5, 8>
   - <0, 5, 12>
   - <0, 10, 12>
   
2. Output the total number of triangles: [5]
