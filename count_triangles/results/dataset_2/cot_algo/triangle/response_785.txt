Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 6) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 2) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 4) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the number of triangles in the graph efficiently.

First, we need to sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order:

Nodes:  
2 - degree 4  
13 - degree 4  
1 - degree 4  
3 - degree 5  
7 - degree 5  
4 - degree 5  
6 - degree 5  
0 - degree 6  
14 - degree 6  
11 - degree 6  
12 - degree 6  
9 - degree 7  
8 - degree 7  
10 - degree 7  
5 - degree 8  

Next, we'll list the edges in the order of vertices with lower degree first:

Edges:  
(2, 0)  
(13, 1)  
(1, 7)  
(3, 0)  
(7, 1)  
(4, 5)  
(6, 2)  
(0, 8)  
(11, 7)  
(12, 1)  
(9, 8)  
(10, 0)  
(0, 14)  
(14, 4)  
(10, 4)  
(11, 6)  
(12, 3)  
(9, 11)  
(8, 13)  
(10, 14)  
(8, 14)  
(11, 10)  
(6, 10)  
(6, 11)  
(13, 8)  
(12, 7)  
(9, 12)  
(12, 5)  
(9, 7)  
(5, 4)  
(5, 6)  
(5, 12)  

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the shared connections. After counting, we find:  
Total number of triangles: [14]  

Unique triangles:  
<0, 2, 3>  
<0, 2, 6>  
<1, 7, 12>  
<1, 13, 8>  
<4, 5, 14>  
<6, 10, 11>  
<6, 10, 4>  
<7, 9, 12>  
<8, 13, 1>  
<8, 14, 0>  
<9, 11, 10>  
<9, 11, 7>  
<10, 14, 4>  
<11, 7, 12>
