Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. Let's relabel the vertices accordingly: 

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 14: 3 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections

Now, we will traverse the edges in the sorted order and count the triangles:

1. Node 0 (2 connections) -> Node 12 (4 connections) and Node 6 (5 connections), no triangles
2. Node 1 (6 connections) -> Node 4 (5 connections) and Node 6 (5 connections), forms triangle <1, 4, 6>
3. Node 2 (4 connections) -> Node 4 (5 connections) and Node 7 (4 connections), no shared connection
4. Node 3 (4 connections) -> Node 4 (5 connections) and Node 7 (4 connections), no shared connection
5. Node 10 (3 connections) -> Node 5 (4 connections) and Node 11 (4 connections), no shared connection
6. Node 5 (4 connections) -> Node 2 (4 connections) and Node 4 (5 connections), forms triangle <2, 4, 5>
7. Node 9 (3 connections) -> Node 4 (5 connections) and Node 6 (5 connections), forms triangle <4, 6, 9>
8. Node 6 (5 connections) -> Node 0 (2 connections) and Node 12 (4 connections), no shared connection
9. Node 10 (3 connections) -> Node 11 (4 connections) and Node 5 (4 connections), no shared connection
10. Node 11 (4 connections) -> Node 7 (4 connections) and Node 14 (3 connections), no shared connection
11. Node 4 (5 connections) -> Node 1 (6 connections) and Node 14 (3 connections), no shared connection
12. Node 8 (4 connections) -> Node 3 (4 connections) and Node 7 (4 connections), forms triangle <3, 7, 8>
13. Node 7 (4 connections) -> Node 2 (4 connections) and Node 3 (4 connections), forms triangle <2, 3, 7>
14. Node 12 (4 connections) -> Node 6 (5 connections) and Node 13 (4 connections), no shared connection
15. Node 13 (4 connections) -> Node 1 (6 connections) and Node 3 (4 connections), no shared connection

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <1, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 7, 8>
