Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 17) (15, 11) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 18) (19, 8) (16, 0) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 6) (2, 7) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 11) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 13) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 18) (12, 3) (12, 5) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 18) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 13) (18, 11) (17, 15) (17, 4) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 13) (4, 17) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 18) (11, 9) (9, 14) (9, 11) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

Edges:
(3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 0) (15, 17) (15, 11) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 2) (8, 19) 
(8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 18) (19, 16) (16, 4) (16, 6) (7, 10) (5, 12) (5, 1) (6, 14) 
(14, 9) (1, 13) (10, 18) (12, 5) (13, 4) (18, 11) (17, 4) 

Now, let's calculate the total number of triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Degrees:
0: 6
1: 4
2: 2
3: 3
4: 5
5: 4
6: 3
7: 3
8: 5
9: 2
10: 3
11: 4
12: 2
13: 3
14: 3
15: 4
16: 4
17: 2
18: 6
19: 2

Now, sorting vertices by their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes in order: [2, 9, 12, 17, 19, 0, 6, 7, 13, 3, 10, 14, 5, 15, 16, 1, 11, 4, 8, 18]

Following the degree-based ordering approach and counting the triangles, we find:
Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles found: 
<3, 5, 12>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 7, 10>
<13, 1, 8>
<13, 4, 18>
<11, 14, 6>
<11, 14, 9>
<11, 18, 4>
<4, 14, 9>
<4, 16, 6>
