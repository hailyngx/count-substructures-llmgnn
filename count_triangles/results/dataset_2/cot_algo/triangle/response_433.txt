Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 25) (27, 19) (27, 23) (18, 15) (18, 22) (18, 23) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 16) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 20) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 2) (0, 10) (0, 2) (20, 10) (20, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 29) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 12) (21, 28) (21, 19) (21, 29) (28, 21) (28, 4) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 4) (24, 26) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 14) (16, 22) (16, 6) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 9) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 7) (4, 28) (4, 26) (4, 19) (25, 15) (25, 29) (19, 15) (19, 27) (19, 21) (19, 4) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (3, 7) (7, 24) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 8) (14, 24) (14, 1) (14, 29) (23, 27) (23, 18) (23, 9) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 23) (9, 12) (12, 6) (12, 24) (12, 11) (12, 9) (8, 20) (8, 7) (29, 5) (29, 21) (29, 25) (29, 14) 

Response:
Based on the provided graph, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:  
(15, 19), (15, 18), (15, 25),  
(27, 19), (27, 23),  
(18, 15), (18, 22), (18, 23),  
(22, 18), (22, 26), (22, 16),  
(10, 17), (10, 0), (10, 6), (10, 20),  
(17, 10), (17, 13), (17, 9), (17, 2),  
(0, 10), (0, 2),  
(20, 10), (20, 8),  
(5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 29),  
(6, 10), (6, 16), (6, 12),  
(21, 28), (21, 19), (21, 29),  
(28, 21), (28, 4),  
(26, 22), (26, 24), (26, 4),  
(24, 26), (24, 7), (24, 12), (24, 14),  
(16, 22), (16, 6),  
(13, 17), (13, 2), (13, 9),  
(1, 5), (1, 14), (1, 7),  
(4, 28), (4, 26), (4, 19),  
(25, 15), (25, 29),  
(19, 15), (19, 27), (19, 21), (19, 4),  
(2, 17), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 13),  
(11, 7), (11, 12),  
(3, 7),  
(7, 24), (7, 1), (7, 11), (7, 3), (7, 8),  
(14, 24), (14, 1), (14, 29),  
(23, 27), (23, 18), (23, 9),  
(9, 17), (9, 13), (9, 23), (9, 12),  
(12, 6), (12, 24), (12, 11), (12, 9),  
(8, 20), (8, 7),  
(29, 5), (29, 21), (29, 25), (29, 14)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes by degree:  
3 connections: 4, 9, 26  
4 connections: 0, 13, 16, 21, 22  
5 connections: 8, 15, 24, 28  
6 connections: 5, 6, 18, 19  
7 connections: 1, 2, 7, 10, 12, 17, 25, 29  
8 connections: 20, 23, 27  
9 connections: 11, 14

Now, we will count the triangles and output the result:

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles found:  
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 17>, <0, 2, 13>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 7, 11>, <1, 7, 29>, <5, 7, 14>
