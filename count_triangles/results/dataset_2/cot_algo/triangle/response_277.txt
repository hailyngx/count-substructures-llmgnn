Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (9, 6), (9, 1), (9, 7), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 0), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (8, 2), (8, 0), (2, 8), (0, 7), (7, 9), (7, 1), (7, 3)}

Degree-Based Ordering:
Node 2: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 5

Now, starting from the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we count the triangles:

Triangles:
[14]

Unique triangles:
<3, 4, 8>
<0, 3, 4>
<3, 6, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
