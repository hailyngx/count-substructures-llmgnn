Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (15, 9) (15, 8) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 15) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 12) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (4, 5) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 6) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 16) (8, 15) (8, 9) (13, 17) (13, 11) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 10) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 16) (10, 14) (16, 18) (16, 10) (16, 14) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 14) (11, 13) (11, 17) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 16) (14, 2) (19, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
(3, 7), (3, 19), (3, 18), (15, 9), (15, 8), (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 0), (9, 15), 
(9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 12), (7, 3), (7, 12), (7, 6), (7, 10), (12, 9), (12, 7), (4, 5), 
(4, 18), (4, 0), (4, 14), (4, 6), (18, 3), (18, 4), (18, 16), (8, 15), (8, 9), (13, 17), 
(13, 11), (17, 13), (17, 2), (17, 11), (1, 6), (1, 14), (6, 7), (6, 4), (6, 1), (0, 5), 
(0, 4), (0, 10), (10, 7), (10, 0), (10, 16), (10, 14), (16, 18), (16, 10), (16, 14), 
(2, 5), (2, 17), (2, 14), (11, 13), (11, 17), (14, 4), (14, 1), (14, 10), (14, 16), 
(14, 2), (19, 3)

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices in increasing order of degrees: 
1, 11, 13, 15, 16, 19, 0, 2, 8, 12, 17, 18, 3, 7, 9, 10, 14, 4, 5, 6

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

There are 10 triangles in total []
Unique triangles found: 
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 4>
<2, 5, 17>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 14, 16>
<4, 14, 10>
<4, 14, 2>
<6, 1, 14>
