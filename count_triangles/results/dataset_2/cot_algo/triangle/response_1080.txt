Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 11) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) 

Response:
The graph for the given edges looks as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 
(0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 2), 
(1, 2), (1, 10), (1, 9), 
(2, 0), (2, 6), (2, 11), 
(3, 7), (3, 10), (3, 12), 
(4, 9), (4, 10), (4, 14), (4, 6), 
(5, 11), (5, 0), (5, 7), 
(6, 4), (6, 2), (6, 11), (6, 12), 
(7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 5), (7, 0), (7, 14), (7, 9), 
(8, 14), (8, 12), (8, 7), 
(9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 14), 
(10, 1), (10, 3), (10, 4), (10, 9), 
(11, 13), (11, 5), (11, 6), (11, 2), (11, 9), 
(12, 3), (12, 8), (12, 13), (12, 6), (12, 14), 
(13, 12), (13, 11), 
(14, 8), (14, 4), (14, 7), (14, 12), (14, 9)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree from lowest to highest:
Nodes Degrees: 
0: 3, 
1: 3, 
3: 3, 
5: 3, 
6: 4, 
8: 4, 
13: 4, 
2: 4, 
4: 5, 
11: 5, 
12: 5, 
10: 5, 
7: 6, 
9: 6, 
14: 6

Using the degree-based ordering method, we count the triangles:
Triangles: 23

<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 2, 10>, <1, 9, 10>, <3, 7, 10>, <3, 7, 12>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 11>, <4, 6, 12>, <4, 9, 11>, <4, 9, 14>, <4, 10, 14>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 11>, <5, 7, 14>, <6, 9, 11>, <7, 9, 10>, <7, 9, 11>, <8, 12, 14>, <11, 12, 13>, <11, 12, 14>, <9, 10, 14>
