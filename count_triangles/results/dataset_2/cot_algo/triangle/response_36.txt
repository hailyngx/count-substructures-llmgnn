Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are as follows: 

Node 9: degree 2
Node 5: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 4: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 7: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 6: degree 6

By following the degree-based ordering method, let's count the triangles:

- Triangle <5, 1, 3>
- Triangle <1, 3, 6>
- Triangle <3, 6, 0>
- Triangle <6, 0, 2>
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
