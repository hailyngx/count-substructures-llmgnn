Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 2) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 8) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 18) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 1) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 11) (7, 9) (16, 5) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 11) (11, 6) (11, 19) (11, 17) (11, 2) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 4) (1, 18) (1, 8) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 13) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (2, 15) (2, 11)

Node 6: 5, 17, 11, 8
Node 7: 9
Node 8: 6, 1, 0
Node 9: 7, 14, 13
Node 10: 12, 18, 13, 14
Node 11: 6, 19, 17, 2
Node 12: 4, 10, 0, 18
Node 13: 9, 10, 0
Node 14: 9, 10
Node 15: 3, 19, 2
Node 16: 5
Node 17: 6, 3, 11
Node 18: 12, 19, 10, 1
Node 19: 15, 18, 11

Counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find:
[Total number of triangles: 23]
