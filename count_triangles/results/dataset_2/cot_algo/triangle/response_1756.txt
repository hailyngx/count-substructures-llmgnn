Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 1) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 14) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 1) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (10, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges:
- 0: 1, 2, 6, 11
- 1: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9, 13
- 2: 0, 1, 4, 6
- 3: 7, 11, 14
- 4: 2, 5, 6, 12, 14
- 5: 1, 4, 14
- 6: 0, 2, 4, 13
- 7: 1, 3, 8, 11, 12
- 8: 7, 12, 13
- 9: 1, 11
- 10: 12
- 11: 0, 3, 7, 9, 13, 14
- 12: 4, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14
- 13: 1, 6, 8, 11, 12
- 14: 3, 4, 5, 11, 12

Now, we count the total number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 15]

<0, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 14>
<1, 7, 13>
<1, 9, 11>
<2, 4, 6>
<4, 12, 14>
<7, 8, 12>
<7, 11, 14>
<11, 13, 14>
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 11>
<0, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 5, 14>
