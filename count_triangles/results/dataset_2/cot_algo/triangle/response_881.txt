Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. Here are the steps to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Create a sorted list of vertices based on their degree:
   - Vertex 7: degree 2
   - Vertex 15: degree 3
   - Vertex 6: degree 6
   - Vertex 5: degree 3
   - Vertex 13: degree 4
   - Vertex 8: degree 3
   - Vertex 4: degree 4
   - Vertex 3: degree 4
   - Vertex 11: degree 5
   - Vertex 10: degree 4
   - Vertex 12: degree 5
   - Vertex 2: degree 5
   - Vertex 1: degree 4
   - Vertex 14: degree 5
   - Vertex 9: degree 6

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degree:
   - Vertex 7 -> Node 1
   - Vertex 15 -> Node 2
   - Vertex 6 -> Node 3
   - Vertex 5 -> Node 4
   - Vertex 13 -> Node 5
   - Vertex 8 -> Node 6
   - Vertex 4 -> Node 7
   - Vertex 3 -> Node 8
   - Vertex 11 -> Node 9
   - Vertex 10 -> Node 10
   - Vertex 12 -> Node 11
   - Vertex 2 -> Node 12
   - Vertex 1 -> Node 13
   - Vertex 14 -> Node 14
   - Vertex 9 -> Node 15

3. Analyze the edges to count triangles:
   - <6, 9> (Node 3, Node 15): Shared connections with Node 2 and Node 12 -> Triangle <3, 9, 12>
   - <6, 5> (Node 3, Node 4): No triangle
   - <6, 1> (Node 3, Node 13): Shared connections with Node 12 and Node 14 -> Triangle <3, 13, 14>
   - <6, 2> (Node 3, Node 12): Shared connections with Node 9 and Node 14 -> Triangle <3, 9, 14>
   - <6, 11> (Node 3, Node 9): Shared connections with Node 3 and Node 14 -> Triangle <3, 9, 14>
   - <6, 8> (Node 3, Node 6): Shared connections with Node 5 and Node 11 -> Triangle <3, 5, 11>

4. Calculate the total number of triangles:
   - Total number of triangles = 4
   - Unique triangles: <3, 9, 12>, <3, 13, 14>, <3, 9, 14>, <3, 5, 11>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
