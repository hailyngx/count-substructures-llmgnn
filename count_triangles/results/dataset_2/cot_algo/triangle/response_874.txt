Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Degree of each node: 0(3), 1(4), 2(4), 3(6), 4(4), 5(4), 6(5), 7(4), 8(5), 9(3)

Node order based on degree: 0, 9, 2, 4, 7, 1, 8, 5, 6, 3

After sorting, the edges to be considered based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections are:
(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (9, 2), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (4, 0), (1, 3), (1, 7), (1, 8), (7, 6), (1, 8)

Now, we check for shared connections to count the triangles:
- Triangle with vertices (0, 1, 3)
- Triangle with vertices (1, 7, 6)
- Triangle with vertices (1, 8, 7)

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<1, 7, 6>
<1, 8, 7>
