Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly. 

The vertices with their corresponding degrees are:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 1: degree 6
- Node 6: degree 6

Following the rule of selecting only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can start counting the triangles:

Triangles:
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <4, 8, 9>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <5, 7, 8>
- <5, 7, 9>
- <5, 8, 9>
