Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 14) (15, 18) (15, 8) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 0) (10, 18) (10, 2) (17, 1) (17, 19) (1, 17) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 13) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 12) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 16) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 16) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 11) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 5) 

Response:
The given graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: (4, 7), (13, 0), (16, 0)
- 1: (17, 19)
- 2: (4, 6), (10, 2), (16, 2)
- 3: (7, 3), (14, 3)
- 4: (0, 7), (2, 4), (7, 4)
- 5: (7, 5), (18, 5), (19, 5)
- 6: (2, 4), (12, 6)
- 7: (3, 4), (14, 7)
- 8: (9, 15), (11, 8), (13, 8)
- 9: (8, 11), (8, 12), (9, 11)
- 10: (2, 18)
- 11: (8, 14)
- 12 : (6, 9), (12, 16), (12, 19)
- 13: (0, 13), (8, 13), (19, 13)
- 14: (3, 7), (11, 14), (14, 19) 
- 15: (8, 15)
- 16: (0, 2), (12, 16)
- 17: (1, 19)
- 18: (5, 15)
- 19: (5, 17), (13, 14), (14, 19)

Next, we apply the Degree-Based Ordering method and sort vertices based on their degree (number of connections):
1. Node 1 (degree 1)
2. Node 10 (degree 1)
3. Node 17 (degree 1)
4. Node 15 (degree 1)
5. Node 16 (degree 1)
6. Node 18 (degree 1)
7. Node 0 (degree 3)
8. Node 3 (degree 2)
9. Node 5 (degree 3)
10. Node 6 (degree 2)
11. Node 9 (degree 3)
12. Node 11 (degree 2)
13. Node 7 (degree 3)
14. Node 12 (degree 3)
15. Node 4 (degree 3)
16. Node 2 (degree 4)
17. Node 13 (degree 3)
18. Node 8 (degree 3)
19. Node 19 (degree 5)

Now, we can start counting the triangles. 

Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles: 
<13, 14, 19>
<4, 7, 14>
<4, 7, 19>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 10, 18>
<8, 11, 14>
<2, 4, 16>
<2, 10, 18>
<6, 12, 16>
<5, 18, 19>
