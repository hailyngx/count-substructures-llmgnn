Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 19) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 25) (11, 21) (8, 23) (8, 25) (8, 7) (23, 10) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 21) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 21) (6, 5) (6, 24) (28, 26) (28, 27) (28, 4) (9, 10) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 1) (22, 9) (22, 2) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 0) (13, 27) (26, 23) (26, 28) (26, 2) (26, 20) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 2) (1, 9) (1, 19) (24, 6) (2, 22) (2, 26) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 7) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 25) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 16) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 27) (0, 3) (0, 13) (20, 26) (20, 21) (20, 16) (21, 11) (21, 23) (21, 5) (21, 20) (25, 11) (25, 8) (25, 13) (25, 19) (12, 5) (12, 17) (16, 18) (16, 20) (27, 28) (27, 13) (27, 7) (17, 23) (17, 12) (17, 4) (4, 28) (4, 17) 

Response:
Based on the provided graph, after sorting vertices by their degrees in increasing order and relabeling them accordingly, the vertices and their degrees are as follows:
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 23: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 22: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 26: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 24: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 19: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 20: degree 3
- Node 21: degree 4
- Node 25: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Consider the edge (3, 15):
   - Check for shared connections between vertices 3 and 15: None

2. Consider the edge (3, 7):
   - Check for shared connections between vertices 3 and 7: None

3. Consider the edge (3, 0):
   - Check for shared connections between vertices 3 and 0: None
   
...

After considering all edges, we find that there are a total of [56] triangles in this graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 9, 10>
<3, 9, 11>
<3, 9, 13>
<3, 9, 25>
<3, 17, 21>
<3, 18, 14>
<3, 18, 26>
<3, 21, 5>
<3, 21, 25>
<3, 21, 26>
<3, 25, 11>
<5, 6, 12>
...
(A total of 56 unique triangles)
