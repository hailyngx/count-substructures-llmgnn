Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

The sorted nodes based on their degree are:
1. Node 0 (degree 2)
2. Node 7 (degree 3)
3. Node 13 (degree 2)
4. Node 2 (degree 4)
5. Node 5 (degree 4)
6. Node 9 (degree 4)
7. Node 3 (degree 4)
8. Node 12 (degree 4)
9. Node 1 (degree 5)
10. Node 6 (degree 5)
11. Node 11 (degree 3)
12. Node 4 (degree 5)
13. Node 10 (degree 5)
14. Node 14 (degree 6)
15. Node 8 (degree 6)

Now, we will count the number of triangles:
- Since the edge (4, 8) has both vertices with degrees less than 6, we will count the triangles related to this edge:
  - Triangles: <4, 8, 14>, <4, 8, 10>, <4, 8, 1>, <4, 8, 0>
  
- Since the edge (4, 12) has both vertices with degrees less than 6, we will count the triangles related to this edge:
  - Triangles: <4, 12, 13>, <4, 12, 5>, <4, 12, 3>, <4, 12, 1>

- Since the edge (8, 10) has both vertices with degrees equal to 5, we will count the triangles related to this edge:
  - Triangles: <8, 10, 6>, <8, 10, 9>, <8, 10, 11>

- Since the edge (8, 1) has both vertices with degrees less than 5, we will count the triangles related to this edge:
  - Triangles: <8, 1, 0>

- Since the edge (13, 12) has both vertices with degrees less than 4, we will count the triangles related to this edge:
  - Triangles: <13, 12, 5>, <13, 12, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11], and the unique triangles found are:
<4, 8, 14>, <4, 8, 10>, <4, 8, 1>, <4, 8, 0>, <4, 12, 13>, <4, 12, 5>, <4, 12, 3>, <4, 12, 1>, <8, 10, 6>, <8, 10, 9>, <8, 10, 11>.
