Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 1) (7, 17) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (18, 14) (18, 0) (18, 8) (5, 11) (5, 2) (6, 11) (6, 2) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 15) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 0) (12, 4) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 9) (15, 17) (15, 19) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 9) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 13) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 16) (14, 4) (14, 18) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections and relabeling them accordingly. The sorted vertices with their degrees are:
0: 4
2: 2
6: 2
7: 2
12: 1
15: 2
5: 2
13: 3
14: 2
18: 3
3: 4
8: 3
1: 5
16: 3
11: 4
17: 4
10: 4
19: 5
9: 5
4: 5

Now, let's count the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 13> (shared connections: 3)
2. Triangle <0, 1, 18> (shared connections: 1)
3. Triangle <0, 13, 18> (shared connections: 0)
4. Triangle <1, 3, 11> (shared connections: 1)
5. Triangle <1, 3, 17> (shared connections: 1)
6. Triangle <1, 7, 17> (shared connections: 1)
7. Triangle <1, 10, 11> (shared connections: 1)
8. Triangle <1, 10, 19> (shared connections: 1)
9. Triangle <1, 17, 15> (shared connections: 1)
10. Triangle <3, 8, 16> (shared connections: 1)
11. Triangle <3, 11, 5> (shared connections: 1)
12. Triangle <3, 11, 6> (shared connections: 1)
13. Triangle <10, 11, 5> (shared connections: 1)
14. Triangle <10, 11, 6> (shared connections: 1)
15. Triangle <10, 9, 19> (shared connections: 1)
16. Triangle <13, 0, 18> (shared connections: 0)
17. Triangle <13, 16, 8> (shared connections: 1)
18. Triangle <17, 1, 7> (shared connections: 1)

There are a total of [18] triangles.
