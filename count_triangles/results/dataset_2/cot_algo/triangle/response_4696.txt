Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 10) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the number of triangles in this graph.

Let's first sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes in ascending order of degree: [3, 5, 13, 7, 1, 6, 2, 9, 0, 10, 8, 14, 4, 11, 12]

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 3 -> A
Node 5 -> B
Node 13 -> C
Node 7 -> D
Node 1 -> E
Node 6 -> F
Node 2 -> G
Node 9 -> H
Node 0 -> I
Node 10 -> J
Node 8 -> K
Node 14 -> L
Node 4 -> M
Node 11 -> N
Node 12 -> O

Based on relabeling, the edges are as follows: (E, F) (E, G) (E, C) (E, L) (A, I) (A, M) (A, K) (M, A) (M, K) (M, O) (M, N) (M, D) (K, A) (K, M) (K, J) (K, D) (I, A) (I, N) (I, D) (N, M) (N, I) (N, H) (N, L) (F, G) (F, O) (F, N) (F, J) (C, E) (C, J) (D, K) (D, J) (D, H) (L, E) (L, M) (L, N) (L, F) (L, E) (O, E) (O, M) (O, G) (O, J) (G, L) (G, D) (G, O) (G, H) (H, N) (H, D) (H, G) (H, F) (H, J) (J, K) (J, F) (J, C) (J, O) (J, H)

By analyzing the shared connections between nodes of each edge, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [12]

And the unique triangles found are: <D, K, J>, <D, H, G>, <D, H, N>, <D, K, J>, <D, K, M>, <E, L, O>, <E, F, O>, <E, F, N>, <E, F, J>, <L, N, F>, <L, N, M>, <A, M, K>.
