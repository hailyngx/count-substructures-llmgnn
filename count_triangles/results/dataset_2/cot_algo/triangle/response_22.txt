Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (6), (7), (3), (1)
- 1: (7), (8), (0)
- 2: (5), (4), (3)
- 3: (5), (6), (7), (2), (0)
- 4: (5), (9), (2)
- 5: (6), (2), (4), (3)
- 6: (5), (9), (3), (8), (0)
- 7: (9), (0), (3), (8), (1)
- 8: (9), (6), (7), (1)
- 9: (6), (8), (4), (7)

Degree-Based Ordering:
Node 1 (Degree 2)
Node 2 (Degree 3)
Node 4 (Degree 3)
Node 8 (Degree 3)
Node 0 (Degree 4)
Node 3 (Degree 5)
Node 5 (Degree 4)
Node 9 (Degree 4)
Node 6 (Degree 5)
Node 7 (Degree 5)

Triangles:
