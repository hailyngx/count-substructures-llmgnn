Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 15) (5, 13) (5, 4) (6, 18) (6, 16) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 19) (18, 8) (18, 6) (18, 11) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 16) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 14) (0, 16) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 3) (12, 16) (12, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (11, 18) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 9) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 3) (3, 8) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 14) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 3) (14, 2) (9, 12) (9, 11) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 14)
