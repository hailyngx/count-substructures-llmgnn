Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 2) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 1) (4, 8) (4, 14) (2, 10) (18, 8) (18, 5) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 5) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 9) (15, 10) (15, 1) (15, 12) (5, 18) (5, 14) (5, 19) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 7) (12, 15) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 3) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the number of triangles in the given graph.

The sorted vertices based on their degree are:
(18) - degree: 2
(2, 4, 5, 6, 12, 18) - degree: 2
(0, 1, 16, 17, 19) - degree: 3
(3, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15) - degree: 4
(11) - degree: 5
(9) - degree: 6

We will now analyze each edge and check for shared connections.

The triangles found are:
<0, 1, 15>
<0, 3, 16>
<0, 14, 5>
<1, 15, 10>
<1, 15, 12>
<3, 16, 0>
<3, 16, 14>
<3, 16, 7>
<4, 14, 5>
<7, 3, 16>
<7, 3, 9>
<7, 9, 1>
<7, 9, 3>
<8, 11, 10>
<8, 11, 17>
<9, 1, 15>
<10, 1, 15>
<10, 1, 17>
<10, 11, 17>
<10, 13, 1>
<10, 15, 1>
<11, 8, 17>
<11, 17, 10>
<13, 1, 15>
<13, 1, 17>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [25].
