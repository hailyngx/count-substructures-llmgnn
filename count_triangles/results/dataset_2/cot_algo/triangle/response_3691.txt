Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to count the number of triangles in the graph efficiently. Let's start by constructing the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 0), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 0), (9, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 0), (3, 8), (5, 8), (8, 0)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:
Node 1 (degree 1): 4, 9, 5, 8
Node 2 (degree 2): 6, 2
Node 3 (degree 3): 7, 3, 0
Node 4 (degree 4): 1
Node 5 (degree 5): 

Now, we need to count the triangles. Since we should only consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- Triangle 1: (4, 7) shares 1 neighbor with (4) and 2 neighbors with (7) = <4, 7, 3>
- Triangle 2: (4, 0) shares 1 neighbor with (4) and 2 neighbors with (0) = <4, 0, 1>
- Triangle 3: (9, 4) shares 1 neighbor with (9) and 2 neighbors with (4) = <9, 4, 0>
- Triangle 4: (6, 5) shares 2 neighbors with (6) and 2 neighbors with (5) = <6, 5, 1>
- Triangle 5: (6, 3) shares 1 neighbor with (6) and 2 neighbors with (3) = <6, 3, 7>
- Triangle 6: (9, 3) shares 1 neighbor with (9) and 2 neighbors with (3) = <9, 3, 7>
- Triangle 7: (1, 3) shares 1 neighbor with (1) and 2 neighbors with (3) = <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle 8: (1, 0) shares 1 neighbor with (1) and 2 neighbors with (0) = <1, 0, 4>
- Triangle 9: (3, 8) shares 2 neighbors with (3) and 2 neighbors with (8) = <3, 8, 5>

Total number of triangles: [9]
