Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 0) (21, 0) (21, 20) (21, 12) (2, 1) (2, 29) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 15) (29, 22) (15, 29) (15, 7) (15, 18) (27, 7) (27, 5) (27, 8) (22, 29) (22, 23) (22, 16) (23, 22) (23, 14) (23, 28) (8, 27) (8, 14) (4, 18) (4, 19) (17, 29) (17, 20) (17, 28) (18, 15) (18, 4) (18, 16) (5, 27) (5, 13) (5, 24) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 11) (20, 21) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 6) (7, 15) (7, 27) (7, 25) (25, 2) (25, 7) (25, 6) (19, 4) (19, 24) (3, 0) (28, 23) (28, 17) (28, 9) (28, 24) (0, 1) (0, 21) (0, 3) (16, 22) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 14) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 6) (26, 12) (14, 23) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 16) (6, 20) (6, 25) (6, 26) (6, 10) (10, 6) (11, 13) (11, 26) (11, 9) (12, 21) (12, 26) (12, 24) (24, 5) (24, 19) (24, 28) (24, 12) (9, 28) (9, 16) (9, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph based on the provided edges yields the following results:

Sorted vertices by their number of connections:
(30) 0, 3 connections
(18) 1, 2 connections
(5) 2, 3 connections
(12) 29, 4 connections
(19) 15, 4 connections
(21) 27, 3 connections
(13) 22, 3 connections
(27) 23, 3 connections
(10) 8, 2 connections
(26) 4, 4 connections
(15) 17, 4 connections
(6) 5, 4 connections
(28) 13, 3 connections
(22) 20, 4 connections
(24) 7, 4 connections
(20) 25, 3 connections
(11) 19, 2 connections
(7) 18, 3 connections
(17) 16, 4 connections
(9) 26, 4 connections
(16) 11, 3 connections

Based on the connections, the total number of triangles is: [15]
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 21>, <0, 3, 21>, <2, 25, 7>, <2, 29, 22>, <15, 28, 24>, <15, 7, 27>, <22, 16, 18>, <22, 16, 14>, <23, 14, 5>, <23, 28, 24>, <8, 27, 5>, <8, 14, 5>, <18, 16, 9>, <18, 16, 14>, <18, 4, 19>
