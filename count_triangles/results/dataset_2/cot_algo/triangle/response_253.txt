Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 26) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 23) (16, 26) (15, 27) (15, 6) (15, 25) (15, 24) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 1) (20, 27) (20, 25) (20, 23) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 12) (25, 10) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 25) (12, 7) (12, 29) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 10) (1, 27) (1, 19) (26, 11) (26, 16) (26, 22) (21, 0) (28, 14) (22, 26) (22, 19) (22, 10) (22, 24) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 17) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 29) (19, 1) (19, 22) (23, 16) (23, 20) (23, 29) (23, 0) (2, 11) (2, 5) (8, 5) (8, 14) (14, 28) (14, 3) (14, 8) (24, 15) (24, 22) (24, 29) (0, 21) (0, 23) (0, 6) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 10) (29, 12) (29, 3) (29, 23) (29, 24) (10, 25) (10, 7) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 9) (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

The sorted degrees of the nodes are as follows:
Node 28: degree 1
Node 21: degree 1
Node 5: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 4: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 27: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 18: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4
Node 26: degree 4
Node 20: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 11: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 0: degree 5
Node 24: degree 5
Node 25: degree 5
Node 29: degree 5
Node 10: degree 6
Node 12: degree 6
Node 17: degree 6
Node 9: degree 6
Node 15: degree 6
Node 22: degree 6
Node 13: degree 6
Node 14: degree 6

The total number of triangles in the graph is [15].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 27, 20>
<3, 14, 8>
<3, 17, 9>
<4, 6, 0>
<4, 6, 15>
<4, 6, 24>
<7, 13, 17>
<7, 9, 17>
<10, 18, 4>
<10, 18, 7>
<10, 18, 22>
<10, 18, 9>
<10, 25, 12>
<15, 25, 20>
<23, 29, 24>
