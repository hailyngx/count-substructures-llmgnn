Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 5) (14, 10) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 12) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 2) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the vertices based on their degrees. Let's list the nodes along with their degrees:

- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 6
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 6
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 5

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 8 (degree 1)<-> Node 0 (degree 3)
- Node 6 (degree 3)<-> Node 13 (degree 3)
- Node 2 (degree 4)<-> Node 9 (degree 4)<-> Node 10 (degree 4)
- Node 11 (degree 5)<-> Node 3 (degree 5)<-> Node 5 (degree 5)<-> Node 14 (degree 5)
- Node 1 (degree 6)<-> Node 4 (degree 6)<-> Node 7 (degree 6)<-> Node 12 (degree 6)

Now, let's find the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. For the edge (6, 1):
   - Node 6 (degree 3) and Node 1 (degree 6) share nodes [4, 7]. Triangle found: <1, 4, 6>.

2. For the edge (6, 10):
   - Node 6 (degree 3) and Node 10 (degree 4) do not meet the condition.

3. For the edge (6, 4):
   - Node 6 (degree 3) and Node 4 (degree 6) share nodes [7]. Triangle found: <4, 6, 7>.

(**Note:** All triangles with a shared edge have been considered only once)

Total number of triangles: [2]
