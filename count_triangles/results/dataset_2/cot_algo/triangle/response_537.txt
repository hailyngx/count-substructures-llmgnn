Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 8) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 10) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Vertices in increasing order of degree:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 12: 2 connections
Node 14: 2 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
