Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph and count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Sorted by the number of connections:
Nodes with 1 connection: 1, 9
Nodes with 2 connections: 4, 9
Nodes with 3 connections: 1, 8
Nodes with 4 connections: 2, 4, 6, 9
Nodes with 5 connections: 0, 1, 2
Nodes with 6 connections: 0, 1, 9
Nodes with 7 connections: 3, 6, 8
Nodes with 8 connections: 5
Nodes with 9 connections: 7

Triangles found:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<5, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [11]
