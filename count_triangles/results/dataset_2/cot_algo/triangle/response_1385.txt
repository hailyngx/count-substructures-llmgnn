Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 15) (9, 3) (26, 28) (26, 3) (11, 16) (11, 23) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 19) (16, 14) (16, 27) (18, 22) (18, 17) (18, 3) (22, 18) (22, 0) (22, 8) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 17) (27, 16) (27, 12) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 20) (28, 26) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 10) (5, 13) (5, 23) (5, 1) (5, 25) (5, 17) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 24) (8, 9) (8, 22) (8, 24) (8, 10) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 14) (19, 16) (19, 4) (25, 5) (25, 21) (25, 10) (29, 9) (29, 16) (29, 21) (2, 12) (2, 4) (24, 13) (24, 8) (15, 9) (15, 0) (0, 22) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 3) (3, 9) (3, 26) (3, 18) (3, 0) (1, 7) (1, 5) (21, 13) (21, 25) (21, 29) (21, 4) (4, 19) (4, 2) (4, 21) (10, 6) (10, 28) (10, 8) (10, 25) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 5) (14, 16) (14, 23) (20, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in determining the number of triangles in the given graph. Let's count the number of triangles step by step:

1. The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees (from least to most connected) is as follows:
   Vertices: 26, 27, 1, 2, 7, 20, 4, 15, 19, 24, 0, 14, 10, 11, 21, 12, 18, 22, 5, 3, 25, 16, 6, 17, 8, 13, 9, 29, 23, 28

2. Checking for triangles starting with edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
   - Triangle <4, 16, 19> (shared connection: 16)
   - Triangle <5, 13, 21> (shared connection: 21)

3. Finally, counting the total number of triangles:
   Total number of triangles: [2]
