Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 19) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 0) (3, 17) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 0) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 15) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (16, 4) (16, 1) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 10) (10, 6) (18, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 16) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 19) (15, 17) (19, 9) (19, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in efficiently counting triangles in a graph. Let's follow the steps to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Sort nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:
```
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 10: 1 connection
Node 15: 1 connection
Node 18: 1 connection
Node 16: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 17: 6 connections
Node 13: 7 connections
```

2. Relabel the nodes accordingly for easier reference:
```
Node 3: A
Node 10: B
Node 15: C
Node 18: D
Node 16: E
Node 5: F
Node 11: G
Node 6: H
Node 19: I
Node 12: J
Node 0: K
Node 8: L
Node 1: M
Node 14: N
Node 2: O
Node 4: P
Node 9: Q
Node 7: R
Node 17: S
Node 13: T
```

3. Count the triangles based on shared connections:
```
Total number of triangles = 15
```

The unique triangles found are:
```
<2, 4, 13>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 11, 12>, <0, 12, 19>, <0, 11, 2>, <6, 12, 13>, <7, 1, 5>, <7, 4, 13>, <7, 11, 14>, <5, 12, 14>, <5, 7, 14>, <9, 13, 17>, <7, 4, 2>, <13, 8, 2>, <13, 17, 9>
```

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is `[15]`.
