Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 15) (4, 10) (4, 15) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 6) (13, 5) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 0) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 15) (17, 12) (17, 6) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 6) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 18) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 16) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 6) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 19) (15, 8) (0, 12) (0, 11) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 16) (2, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) (16, 3) (16, 14) (16, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

After sorting the nodes by the number of connections they have, we have the following order:
Node 11 (Degree 2)
Node 1 (Degree 2)
Node 4 (Degree 2)
Node 8 (Degree 2)
Node 13 (Degree 2)
Node 3 (Degree 3)
Node 2 (Degree 4)
Node 0 (Degree 4)
Node 14 (Degree 4)
Node 16 (Degree 4)
Node 17 (Degree 4)
Node 18 (Degree 4)
Node 10 (Degree 5)
Node 15 (Degree 5)
Node 19 (Degree 5)
Node 6 (Degree 6)
Node 7 (Degree 6)
Node 12 (Degree 6)
Node 9 (Degree 6)
Node 5 (Degree 7)

Now, let's count the triangles: 
- For each edge, we check if the node with the lower label has fewer connections.
- Then we count the triangles formed by shared connections between the two vertices.

The total number of triangles is [31].

The unique triangles found are: 
<5, 9, 19>, <5, 9, 15>, <5, 10, 4>, <5, 13, 19>, <5, 19, 7>, <9, 15, 4>, <9, 15, 19>, <4, 10, 2>, <7, 14, 2>, <7, 19, 8>, <7, 12, 17>, <12, 7, 19>, <12, 7, 14>, <12, 17, 6>, <13, 5, 19>, <3, 11, 0>, <3, 16, 14>, <3, 18, 6>, <11, 0, 12>, <19, 15, 8>, <17, 12, 6>, <8, 19, 7>, <8, 19, 15>, <8, 6, 17>, <6, 2, 1>, <6, 2, 16>, <10, 2, 14>, <14, 16, 2>, <18, 9, 15>, <16, 14, 2>, <16, 2, 10>
