Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Relabeling the vertices according to their degrees:
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 3
- Vertex 16: degree 2
- Vertex 12: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 5
- Vertex 17: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 13: degree 3
- Vertex 14: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 4
- Vertex 11: degree 3
- Vertex 18: degree 4
- Vertex 15: degree 4
- Vertex 1: degree 5
- Vertex 19: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 10: degree 4

Counting triangles:
- Total triangles: [48]
- Unique triangles: 
    - <14, 6, 13>, <6, 16, 3>, <10, 1, 9>, <10, 1, 16>, 
    - <10, 1, 2>, <10, 1, 7>, <1, 16, 3>, <1, 16, 6>, 
    - <1, 16, 10>, <1, 16, 2>, <1, 16, 5>, <1, 16, 12>, 
    - <1, 16, 18>, <6, 16, 1>, <6, 16, 3>, <6, 16, 10>, 
    - <6, 16, 18>, <6, 16, 14>, <16, 14, 3>, <16, 14, 15>, 
    - <16, 14, 6>, <16, 14, 1>, <16, 14, 10>, <16, 14, 18>,
