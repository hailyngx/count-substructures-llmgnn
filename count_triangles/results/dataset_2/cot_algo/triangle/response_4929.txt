Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 19) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 15) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (2, 12) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 11) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 15) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 14) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 10) (0, 6) (0, 12) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 16) (17, 9) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 19) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 18) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 15) (14, 19) 

Response:
The given graph has been constructed with 20 nodes and 60 edges as described. 

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph:

Vertices sorted by degree: 
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 18: Degree 3
Node 17: Degree 1
Node 16: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 12: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 15: Degree 3
Node 11: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 19: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 14: Degree 5
Node 10: Degree 3

Now, let's count the triangles:

- For the edge (5, 9): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (5, 10): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (9, 17): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (9, 14): Triangle <9, 14, 19> formed.
- For the edge (9, 19): Triangle <9, 14, 19> formed.
- For the edge (5, 10): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (6, 10): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (6, 11): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (6, 0): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (8, 13): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (8, 4): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (13, 8): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (13, 1): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (13, 15): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (4, 8): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (4, 19): Triangle <4, 19, 14> formed.
- For the edge (4, 3): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (4, 1): No triangles formed.

- For the edge (7, 16): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (7, 3): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (12, 2): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (12, 0): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (2, 18): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (1, 15): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (15, 14): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (19, 10): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (11, 18): No triangles formed.
- For the edge (17, 9): No triangles formed.
