Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree, from lowest to highest:

Node 4: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 5: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 0: degree 5
Node 8: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5

Starting with the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
(4, 1) --> shared connection with (1, 7) --> Triangle <1, 4, 7>
(4, 9) --> shared connection with (9, 2) --> Triangle <2, 4, 9>
(5, 2) --> shared connection with (2, 3) --> Triangle <2, 3, 5>
(5, 4) --> shared connection with (4, 9) --> Triangle <4, 5, 9>
(5, 3) --> shared connection with (3, 1) --> Triangle <1, 3, 5>
(9, 6) --> shared connection with (6, 8) --> Triangle <6, 8, 9>
(7, 0) --> shared connection with (0, 1) --> Triangle <0, 1, 7>
(7, 2) --> shared connection with (2, 6) --> Triangle <2, 6, 7>
(7, 1) --> shared connection with (1, 4) --> Triangle <1, 4, 7>
(7, 8) --> shared connection with (8, 6) --> Triangle <6, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [7]
