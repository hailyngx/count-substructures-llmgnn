Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 10) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 19) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 18) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 13) (17, 19) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 2) (4, 11) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 2) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 0) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 9) (13, 10) (13, 7) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 2) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 2) (8, 7) (9, 15) 

Response:
The vertices and their corresponding connections are as follows:
Vertex 0: 3, 18, 19, 2
Vertex 1: 16, 5, 19
Vertex 2: 6, 12, 14, 0
Vertex 3: 0, 10, 6, 18
Vertex 4: 11
Vertex 5: 11, 16, 1, 6, 19
Vertex 6: 3, 5, 15, 2
Vertex 7: 14, 13, 8
Vertex 8: 7
Vertex 9: 15
Vertex 10: 16, 3, 13
Vertex 11: 16, 5, 4
Vertex 12: 2
Vertex 13: 10, 7
Vertex 14: 18, 7, 2
Vertex 15: 16, 6, 9
Vertex 16: 11, 15, 1, 5, 10
Vertex 17: 19
Vertex 18: 3, 18, 14, 0
Vertex 19: 1, 17, 5, 18, 0

The triangles found based on the Degree-Based Ordering method are as follows:
[<3, 0, 2>, <3, 0, 18>, <3, 6, 5>, <3, 10, 16>, <3, 10, 13>, <7, 13, 14>, <5, 6, 19>, <0, 2, 18>, <0, 2, 19>, <0, 18, 19>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
