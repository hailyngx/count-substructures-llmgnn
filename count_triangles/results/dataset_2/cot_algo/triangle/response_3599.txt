Next, using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Nodes ranked by degree: [0, 26, 24, 23, 7, 21, 20, 28, 18, 2, 27, 3, 4, 22, 5, 6, 14, 9, 19, 12, 8, 10, 1, 13, 17, 11, 15, 16, 25, 29]

Calculating number of triangles using the given edges and the Degree-Based Ordering method results in:
Total number of triangles: [72]
