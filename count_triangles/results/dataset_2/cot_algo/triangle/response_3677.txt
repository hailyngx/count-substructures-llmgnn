Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 
Node 9 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 3
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 3 has degree 6
Node 8 has degree 5
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 0 has degree 5
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 3

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start with the edges involving nodes with the lower degree. 
By following this method, we find that there are a total of 14 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are:
<3, 0, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 2, 0>
<3, 2, 4>
<3, 2, 8>
<3, 8, 7>
<3, 8, 1>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 8, 7>
<7, 1, 8>
<4, 2, 8>
<6, 8, 4>
<5, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
