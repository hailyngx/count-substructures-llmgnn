Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9 based on the given edges and their connections.

The degree-based ordering is as follows:
(0:2), (5:2), (9:2), (4:3), (7:3), (1:4), (8:4), (3:5), (6:6), (2:6)

There are a total of [12] triangles in the graph.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 8, 7>
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 8, 1>
<1, 8, 7>
<1, 8, 3>
<1, 8, 4>
<2, 9, 7>
<2, 9, 6>
<3, 8, 7>
