Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 14) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 0) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 1) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their respective connections:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 4, 8, 10, 14
- Node 2: 1, 6, 9, 13
- Node 3: 0, 10, 13
- Node 4: 1, 11, 14
- Node 5: 7, 9, 14
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7, 9, 13
- Node 7: 5, 6, 12
- Node 8: 1, 9, 10
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 10: 1, 3, 8, 11, 12
- Node 11: 4, 10, 13, 14
- Node 12: 7, 10, 11, 14
- Node 13: 2, 3, 6, 11
- Node 14: 1, 4, 5, 11, 12

According to the Degree-Based Ordering method, the edges to consider based on the lower label having fewer connections are:
(5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 8), (10, 3), (11, 4), (12, 7), (13, 3), (14, 5), (14, 4)

After checking for shared connections between vertices of each edge, the total number of triangles is [10]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 4, 14>, <1, 10, 12>, <1, 10, 14>, <1, 11, 14>, <2, 6, 13>, <3, 10, 12>, <3, 10, 13>, <3, 11, 13>, <6, 7, 12>, <9, 6, 13>
