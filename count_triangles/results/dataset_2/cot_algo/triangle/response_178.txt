Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 14) (5, 18) (5, 0) (9, 28) (9, 10) (9, 12) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 26) (15, 7) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 13) (7, 15) (7, 21) (7, 3) (7, 22) (21, 15) (21, 7) (21, 3) (22, 7) (22, 19) (22, 4) (22, 24) (23, 2) (23, 28) (28, 9) (28, 23) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 20) (29, 26) (2, 23) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 14) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 26) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 25) (17, 6) (20, 27) (20, 29) (4, 22) (4, 26) (13, 27) (13, 17) (13, 6) (3, 7) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 18) (25, 17) (25, 6) (25, 10) (19, 15) (19, 22) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 25) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 18) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 3) (26, 15) (26, 29) (26, 8) (26, 4) (14, 16) (14, 2) (24, 22) (10, 9) (10, 25) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 1) (12, 9) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: 
(11, 16), (11, 0), (11, 6), (11, 8), (16, 1), (16, 14), 
(5, 18), (5, 0), 
(9, 10), (9, 12), 
(15, 27), (15, 19), (15, 26), (15, 7), (15, 21), 
(27, 20), (27, 13), 
(7, 21), (7, 3), (7, 22), 
(21, 3), 
(22, 4), (22, 24), 
(23, 2), (23, 28), 
(28, 29), 
(29, 20), 
(2, 17), 
(8, 26), 
(17, 25), (17, 6), 
(20, 29), 
(4, 26), 
(13, 17), (13, 6), 
(3, 18), 
(25, 10), 
(19, 22), 
(6, 11), 
(1, 18), 
(0, 5), (0, 3), 
(26, 4), 
(14, 16), 
(24, 22), 
(10, 25)

Now, we sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections):

Nodes and their degrees:
0: 3, 1: 3, 4: 3, 8: 3, 9: 3, 12: 3, 13: 3, 14: 3, 16: 3, 19: 3, 21: 3, 24: 2, 28: 3, 29: 3, 2: 5, 17: 4, 26: 4, 5: 2, 10: 3, 15: 5, 27: 3, 20: 3, 7: 4, 22: 4, 23: 2, 25: 3, 3: 4, 6: 4, 11: 4, 18: 3

Now, let's count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering:

Triangles: [57]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 18>, <1, 2, 14>, <1, 3, 18>, <1, 8, 17>, <2, 13, 17>, <2, 17, 17>, <2, 17, 25>, <2, 26, 4>, <2, 26, 8>, <2, 26, 29>, <3, 7, 21>, <3, 7, 22>, <3, 15, 21>, <3, 15, 27>, <3, 18, 5>, <3, 19, 22>, <3, 21, 15>, <4, 6, 25>, <4, 22, 6>, ...
