Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 18) (3, 4) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 9) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 19) (8, 2) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 2) (14, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 18) (4, 13) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 12) (16, 1) (16, 13) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 17) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 19) (7, 11) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 17) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 16) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 9) (17, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections. 

Here is the list of vertices according to their degree from smallest to largest:
(3, 1), (8, 1), (6, 2), (16, 2), (12, 3), (9, 3), (0, 3), (14, 3), (5, 4), (13, 4), (11, 4), (1, 4), (19, 4), (7, 5), (2, 5), (10, 5), (18, 5), (4, 5), (17, 5)

Using the sorted vertices, we will iteratively count the number of triangles formed by each edge. The final count of triangles will be enclosed in brackets [].

The unique triangles found are as follows:
<1, 3, 18>, <1, 4, 13>, <1, 4, 18>, <1, 4, 16>, <1, 13, 16>, <2, 7, 11>, <2, 7, 18>, <2, 17, 19>, <3, 4, 18>, <5, 7, 12>, <7, 9, 17>, <7, 11, 17>, <9, 10, 11>, <9, 10, 17>, <11, 17, 19>, <12, 5, 19>, <12, 18, 19> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
