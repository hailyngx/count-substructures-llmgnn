Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: <0, 3, 6, 8, 1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 9>.

Counting the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. For edge (5, 2): Node 2 has fewer connections than node 5. They share a connection with node 1, forming a triangle <1, 2, 5>.

2. For edge (5, 1): Node 1 has fewer connections than node 5. They share a connection with node 2, forming a triangle <1, 2, 5>.

3. For edge (5, 4): Node 4 has fewer connections than node 5. They share a connection with nodes 7 and 8, forming two triangles <4, 5, 7> and <4, 5, 8>.

4. For edge (5, 3): Node 3 has fewer connections than node 5. They share a connection with node 1, forming a triangle <1, 3, 5>.

5. For edge (5, 7): Node 5 has fewer connections than node 7. They share a connection with nodes 4 and 8, forming a triangle <4, 5, 8>.

6. For edge (9, 6): Node 6 has fewer connections than node 9. They share a connection with nodes 4 and 8, forming two triangles <4, 6, 8>.

7. For edge (9, 8): Node 8 has fewer connections than node 9. They share a connection with nodes 4 and 6, forming two triangles <4, 6, 8>.

8. For edge (9, 2): Node 2 has fewer connections than node 9. They share a connection with node 1, forming a triangle <1, 2, 9>.

9. For edge (9, 7): Node 7 has fewer connections than node 9. They share a connection with node 5, forming a triangle <5, 7, 9>.
