Now, let's count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 33]

<Triangles found: <8, 19, 26>, <8, 19, 2>, <8, 19, 11>, <8, 19, 9>, <8, 2, 19>, <8, 2, 11>, <8, 2, 26>, <8, 2, 19>, <8, 26, 2>, <8, 26, 11>, <8, 26, 19>, <8, 26, 2>, <8, 11, 19>, <8, 11, 2>, <8, 11, 26>, <8, 11, 19>, <8, 9, 19>, <8, 9, 11>, <8, 9, 19>, <8, 25, 10>, <8, 25, 17>, <8, 25, 10>, <8, 25, 9>, <8, 10, 20>, <8, 10, 25>, <8, 10, 17>, <8, 10, 25>, <8, 17, 25>, <8, 17, 10>, <11, 26, 9>, <11, 26, 2>, <11, 26, 8>>
