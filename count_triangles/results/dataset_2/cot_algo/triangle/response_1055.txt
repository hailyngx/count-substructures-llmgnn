Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 16) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 17) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 19) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (18, 16) (18, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 15) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 1) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 12) (14, 11) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 5) (17, 9) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 16) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 0) (13, 10) (13, 12) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 12) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 12) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently. 

Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: 
(6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 0), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 17), (9, 16), (9, 7), (4, 7), (4, 0), 
(4, 16), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 11), (7, 17), (10, 11), (10, 13), (10, 19), (11, 7), 
(11, 10), (11, 14), (11, 8), (18, 16), (18, 0), (3, 2), (3, 5), (8, 9), (8, 11), 
(8, 15), (19, 10), (19, 15), (19, 1), (1, 6), (1, 19), (1, 12), (14, 11), (15, 8), 
(15, 19), (15, 5), (17, 9), (17, 7), (2, 3), (2, 16), (12, 1), (12, 13), (12, 5), 
(12, 0), (13, 10), (13, 12), (5, 3), (5, 15), (5, 12), (0, 6), (0, 4), (0, 18), 
(0, 12), (16, 9), (16, 4), (16, 18), (16, 2)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Nodes sorted by degree: [2, 13, 18, 10, 14, 15, 3, 5, 12, 19, 8, 1, 11, 17, 4, 0, 6, 7, 9, 16]

We will now count the triangles using the sorted order. 

Number of triangles: [36]
Unique triangles found: 
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 16>, <0, 6, 12>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 12, 16>, 
<1, 6, 19>, <1, 6, 12>, <1, 12, 19>, 
<4, 7, 16>, <4, 7, 17>, <4, 16, 18>, 
<5, 3, 12>, <5, 3, 15>, <5, 12, 15>, 
<8, 9, 11>, <8, 9, 17>, <8, 11, 14>, <8, 11, 17>, <8, 9, 15>, 
<10, 11, 13>, 
<11, 7, 17>, 
<12, 13, 10>, <12, 13, 5>, <12, 13, 15>, 
<15, 8, 19>, <15, 8, 5>, <15, 5, 12>, 
<16, 2, 3>, <16, 2, 18>, 
<17, 7, 9>, 
<18, 0, 16>, 
<19, 10, 15>
