Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to efficiently count the number of triangles in a graph. Let's follow the steps to find the total number of triangles in the given graph.

Nodes sorted by their degrees (number of connections):
(3) - 0 connections
(5) - 0 connections
(9) - 0 connections
(0) - 2 connections
(2) - 4 connections
(5) - 4 connections
(1) - 5 connections
(3) - 5 connections
(8) - 5 connections
(7) - 7 connections

After relabeling the nodes:
(0) - 1
(2) - 2
(5) - 3
(1) - 4
(3) - 5
(9) - 6
(8) - 7
(6) - 8
(4) - 9
(7) - 10

Now, let's find the triangles in the graph using the provided edges:

Triangles:
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
