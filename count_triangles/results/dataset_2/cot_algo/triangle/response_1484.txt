Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (16, 5) (14, 18) (14, 19) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 18) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 15) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 18) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 8) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 15) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 12) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 0) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 5) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 8) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 3) (19, 14) (4, 9) (13, 11) (5, 16) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering starts by sorting the vertices based on their degree:

Nodes in increasing order of degrees: 
Node 14: degree 2
Node 19: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 13: degree 2
Node 16: degree 2
Node 2: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 19: degree 2
Node 0: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 18: degree 4
Node 7: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 17: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 15: degree 5
Node 11: degree 5

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees (starting from 0):

Nodes with the new labels:
Node 19: degree 2 -> Node 0
Node 14: degree 2 -> Node 1
Node 13: degree 2 -> Node 2
Node 4: degree 2 -> Node 3
Node 16: degree 2 -> Node 4
Node 2: degree 4 -> Node 5
Node 10: degree 4 -> Node 6
Node 0: degree 4 -> Node 7
Node 5: degree 4 -> Node 8
Node 18: degree 4 -> Node 9
Node 7: degree 3 -> Node 10
Node 9: degree 4 -> Node 11
Node 1: degree 4 -> Node 12
Node 12: degree 4 -> Node 13
Node 6: degree 4 -> Node 14
Node 8: degree 4 -> Node 15
Node 17: degree 5 -> Node 16
Node 3: degree 5 -> Node 17
Node 15: degree 5 -> Node 18
Node 11: degree 5 -> Node 19

Analyzing the edges based on the Degree-Based Ordering:
(3, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 15) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 9) (7, 0) (9, 6) (9, 15) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 13) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 17) (13, 11) (15, 2) (15, 5)

Counting the triangles:
Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <1, 6, 7>, <6, 12, 13>, <6, 7, 11>
