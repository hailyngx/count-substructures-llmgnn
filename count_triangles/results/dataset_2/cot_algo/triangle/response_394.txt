Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
Let's first sort the nodes by their degree in ascending order:

Node 0: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections

Next, we'll analyze the edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:

Considering edge (1, 3): Both nodes have 5 connections. No triangles.
Considering edge (1, 5): Node 1 has 5 connections, Node 5 has 4 connections. Shared connection with Node 3 forms a triangle <1, 3, 5>.
Considering edge (1, 9): Node 1 has 5 connections, Node 9 has 5 connections. No triangles.
Considering edge (1, 8): Node 1 has 5 connections, Node 8 has 3 connections. No triangles.
Considering edge (3, 7): Node 3 has 5 connections, Node 7 has 4 connections. Shared connection with Node 5 forms a triangle <3, 5, 7>.
Considering edge (3, 6): Both nodes have 4 connections. No triangles.
Considering edge (3, 5): Both nodes have 4 connections. No triangles.
Considering edge (3, 4): Node 3 has 5 connections, Node 4 has 5 connections. Shared connection with Node 5 forms a triangle <3, 5, 4>.
Considering edge (4, 8): Node 4 has 5 connections, Node 8 has 3 connections. No triangles.
Considering edge (4, 0): Node 4 has 5 connections, Node 0 has 3 connections. No triangles.
Considering edge (8, 2): Node 8 has 3 connections, Node 2 has 3 connections. No triangles.
Considering edge (2, 9): Node 2 has 3 connections, Node 9 has 5 connections. No triangles.
Considering edge (2, 7): Node 2 has 3 connections, Node 7 has 4 connections. No triangles.
Considering edge (9, 7): Node 9 has 5 connections, Node 7 has 4 connections. Shared connection with Node 3 forms a triangle <9, 3, 7>.
Considering edge (9, 0): Node 9 has 5 connections, Node 0 has 3 connections. No triangles.
Considering edge (6, 7): Node 6 has 4 connections, Node 7 has 4 connections. Shared connection with Node 3 forms a triangle <6, 3, 7>.
Considering edge (5, 7): Node 5 has 4 connections, Node 7 has 4 connections. No triangles.
Considering edge (5, 0): Node 5 has 4 connections, Node 0 has 3 connections. No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [3]

Therefore, the unique triangles found are <1, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 7>, <6, 3, 7>.
