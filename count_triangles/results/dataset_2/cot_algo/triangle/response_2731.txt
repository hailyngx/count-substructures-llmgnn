Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 6) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 8) (17, 29) (17, 21) (17, 7) (29, 17) (29, 6) (29, 25) (29, 14) (6, 18) (6, 29) (6, 21) (6, 14) (28, 22) (28, 12) (28, 27) (28, 19) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 7) (26, 5) (24, 15) (24, 21) (0, 16) (0, 12) (7, 17) (7, 13) (7, 27) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 24) (21, 9) (1, 2) (1, 25) (15, 24) (15, 25) (8, 22) (8, 19) (8, 27) (19, 28) (19, 8) (19, 9) (14, 29) (14, 6) (14, 9) (16, 0) (16, 25) (16, 10) (4, 13) (4, 3) (5, 26) (5, 10) (3, 4) (3, 20) (3, 12) (2, 1) (2, 27) (2, 20) (12, 28) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 20) (20, 3) (20, 2) (20, 12) (20, 27) (20, 11) (23, 25) (23, 10) (25, 29) (25, 1) (25, 15) (25, 16) (25, 23) (9, 21) (9, 19) (9, 14) (27, 28) (27, 7) (27, 8) (27, 2) (27, 20) (11, 13) (11, 20) (10, 16) (10, 5) (10, 23) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us in counting triangles efficiently. Let's first list the nodes based on their number of connections:

Node 5: 2 connections
Node 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 23, 26: 3 connections
Node 2, 3, 9, 12, 13, 14, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 28, 29: 4 connections
Node 6, 17, 18, 25, 27: 5 connections

Based on the connections, we will relabel the nodes and then count the triangles:

Node 0: 0 -> 0 (3 connections)
Node 1: 1 -> 1 (3 connections)
Node 2: 7 -> 2 (4 connections)
Node 3: 8 -> 3 (3 connections)
Node 4: 10 -> 4 (3 connections)
Node 5: 11 -> 5 (3 connections)
Node 6: 15 -> 6 (5 connections)
Node 7: 16 -> 7 (3 connections)
Node 8: 23 -> 8 (3 connections)
Node 9: 26 -> 9 (3 connections)
Node 10: 2 -> 10 (4 connections)
Node 11: 3 -> 11 (3 connections)
Node 12: 9 -> 12 (4 connections)
Node 13: 12 -> 13 (4 connections)
Node 14: 13 -> 14 (4 connections)
Node 15: 19 -> 15 (4 connections)
Node 16: 20 -> 16 (4 connections)
Node 17: 21 -> 17 (4 connections)
Node 18: 22 -> 18 (4 connections)
Node 19: 24 -> 19 (4 connections)
Node 20: 28 -> 20 (4 connections)
Node 21: 29 -> 21 (4 connections)
Node 22: 6 -> 22 (5 connections)
Node 23: 17 -> 23 (4 connections)
Node 24: 18 -> 24 (4 connections)
Node 25: 25 -> 25 (5 connections)
Node 26: 27 -> 26 (4 connections)
Node 27: 5 -> 27 (3 connections)
Node 28: 14 -> 28 (4 connections)
Node 29: 27 -> 29 (4 connections)

Now, counting the triangles:

<2, 7, 21>
<2, 7, 27>
<3, 20, 27>
<5, 10, 23>
<6, 8, 9>
<6, 9, 21>
<6, 14, 29>
<10, 16, 25>
<10, 20, 27>
<13, 14, 29>
