Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 12) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree.

Vertex 0 has 1 connection.
Vertex 6 has 3 connections.
Vertex 13 has 4 connections.
Vertex 10 has 4 connections.
Vertex 14 has 4 connections.
Vertex 11 has 4 connections.
Vertex 7 has 4 connections.
Vertex 9 has 4 connections.
Vertex 8 has 5 connections.
Vertex 3 has 5 connections.
Vertex 12 has 6 connections.
Vertex 2 has 6 connections.
Vertex 1 has 6 connections.
Vertex 4 has 6 connections.
Vertex 5 has 6 connections.

Based on the degree-based ordering, the vertices are now relabeled as follows:
0, 6, 13, 10, 14, 11, 7, 9, 8, 3, 12, 2, 1, 4, 5.

Now, we will count the triangles by considering the edges in the order they were listed:

Triangles:
1. <1, 4, 8>
2. <1, 4, 11>
3. <1, 4, 2>
4. <1, 2, 14>
5. <1, 2, 6>
6. <7, 1, 4>
7. <7, 1, 14>
8. <7, 4, 11>
9. <7, 4, 2>
10. <9, 5, 8>
11. <9, 5, 12>
12. <9, 5, 11>
13. <9, 12, 11>
14. <8, 5, 12>
15. <8, 5, 11>
16. <8, 5, 10>
17. <8, 5, 9>
18. <13, 0, 10>
19. <13, 0, 3>
20. <13, 0, 8>
21. <13, 3, 6>
22. <13, 3, 2>
23. <13, 3, 14>
24. <13, 6, 2>
25. <13, 6, 12>
26. <13, 3, 7>
27. <3, 6, 12>
28. <2, 6, 12>
29. <2, 6, 11>
30. <2, 6, 4>
