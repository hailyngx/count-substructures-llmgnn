Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Let's label the nodes from 0 to 9 based on their degree in increasing order:

Node 9 has degree 5
Node 4 has degree 4
Nodes 7, 1 have degree 3
Nodes 3, 6, 2, 8 have degree 3
Nodes 0, 5 have degree 2

Now, we will analyze the edges based on the node labels to count the number of triangles in the graph.

For each edge, we only consider it if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Count of triangles: [18]

Unique triangles:
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 8, 7>
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 2, 4>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<0, 5, 7>
<2, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<0, 1, 5>
