Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 8) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 0) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 3) (10, 7) (10, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 8) (8, 12) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. 

First, let's list the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:
Nodes: 5, 13, 10, 2, 1, 9, 3, 6, 14, 0, 12, 4, 8, 7, 11

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the edges considering the lower labeled node having fewer connections:
- <5, 9, 2>
- <5, 9, 1>
- <5, 4, 7>
- <5, 4, 11>
- <5, 4, 2>
- <5, 13, 0>
- <9, 7, 12>
- <9, 7, 11>
- <9, 1, 10>
- <4, 7, 11>
- <4, 7, 3>
- <4, 11, 0>
- <7, 12, 2>
- <7, 0, 13>
- <12, 2, 14>
- <6, 3, 8>
- <13, 0, 8>
- <0, 11, 3>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
