Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 1) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 3) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 8) (10, 5) (10, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Let's relabel the vertices based on their degrees.

The sorted list of vertices with their degrees:
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 14: 2 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 12: 4 connections

Now, we'll examine the edges while considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections than the other vertex.

The triangles formed by shared connections are:
<0, 1, 11>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 7, 12>
<1, 2, 11>
<3, 6, 12>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 7, 12>
<4, 9, 12>
<4, 9, 10>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 14>
<8, 13, 14>
<8, 13, 7>

Total number of triangles: [13]
