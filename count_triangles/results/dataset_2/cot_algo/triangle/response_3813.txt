Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 8) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 5) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 2) (12, 4) (12, 13) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 0, 2, 8,  10, 12, 14, 9, 5, 6, 3, 1, 11, 7, 4, 13.

Using Degree-Based Ordering method to find triangles:
- Looking at edge (4, 7): Both 4 and 7 have 4 connections each. As 4 has a lower label, we proceed.
    - Shared connections: 6, 9
    - Triangle: <4, 6, 7>, <4, 9, 7>
- Looking at edge (4, 12): As 4 has a lower label, we proceed.
    - Shared connections: None
- Looking at edge (4, 5): As 4 has a lower label, we proceed.
    - Shared connections: None
- Looking at edge (4, 6): As 4 has a lower label, we proceed.
    - Shared connections: None

... (continue evaluating all edges)

After evaluating all edges, the total number of triangles [] in the graph is 12.
The unique triangles found are: <9, 6, 7>, <9, 1, 7>, <13, 1, 3>, <13, 5, 2>, <3, 0, 11>, <11, 0, 5>, <11, 6, 4>, <11, 6, 13>, <11, 4, 5>, <4, 9, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 4, 11>.
