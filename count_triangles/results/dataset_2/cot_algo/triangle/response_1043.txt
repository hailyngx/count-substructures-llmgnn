Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 18) (0, 21) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 25) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 9) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 3) (18, 21) (18, 11) (18, 16) (26, 0) (26, 20) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 3) (28, 26) (28, 4) (4, 28) (4, 9) (4, 10) (27, 17) (27, 6) (25, 0) (25, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 5) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 11) (9, 20) (9, 4) (9, 11) (29, 1) (29, 26) (29, 3) (8, 25) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 17) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 23) (16, 18) (16, 22) (6, 12) (6, 27) (6, 15) (17, 27) (17, 8) (17, 5) (13, 21) (13, 12) (13, 24) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 22) (24, 8) (24, 13) (22, 0) (22, 16) (22, 5) (11, 18) (11, 15) (11, 9) (3, 2) (3, 26) (3, 29) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 23) (23, 1) (23, 19) (23, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. 

Sorted list of vertices with their degrees:
(2, 1), (28, 2), (27, 2), (16, 2), (8, 4), (16, 3), (24, 3), (5, 4), (22, 4), (11, 4), (15, 4), (9, 4), (25, 4), (29, 4), (3, 4), (13, 4), (10, 4), (26, 5), (18, 5), (12, 5), (7, 5), (6, 6), (20, 6), (4, 6), (21, 6), (19, 6), (1, 7), (0, 7), (14, 7), (23, 7)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and given edges, we find the triangles as follows:

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 21, 26>, <0, 21, 29>, <0, 25, 26>, <0, 25, 29>, <0, 9, 20>, <0, 9, 26>, <0, 20, 26>, <0, 20, 29>, <4, 9, 10>, <4, 10, 20>, <4, 10, 26>, <4, 10, 29>, <9, 11, 18>, <9, 11, 20>, <9, 11, 26>, <9, 20, 26>, <9, 20, 29>, <10, 15, 17>, <10, 17, 26>, <11, 15, 18>, <11, 15, 20>, <11, 15, 26>, <13, 21, 29>, <15, 17, 22>, <15, 22, 23>, <17, 19, 23>, <20, 26, 29>, <4, 10, 26>, <0, 21, 29>, <0, 20, 29>, <0, 25, 29>, <0, 9, 26>, <4, 10, 29>
