Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 8) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 0) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 15
Edges: 60

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

0: 5 connections
3: 3 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 3 connections
4: 5 connections
6: 3 connections
8: 5 connections
7: 4 connections
10: 4 connections
12: 4 connections
14: 4 connections
9: 5 connections
5: 3 connections
11: 3 connections
13: 5 connections

Now, based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

1. For edge (5, 9):
   Shared connections: None

2. For edge (5, 13):
   Shared connections: None

3. For edge (5, 8):
   Shared connections: None

4. For edge (9, 5):
   Shared connections: None

5. For edge (9, 4):
   Shared connections: None

6. For edge (9, 13):
   Shared connections: 0 (forms triangle with nodes 5 and 13) <5, 9, 13>

7. For edge (9, 7):
   Shared connections: None

8. For edge (9, 0):
   Shared connections: None

9. For edge (6, 7):
   Shared connections: None

10. For edge (6, 4):
    Shared connections: None

11. For edge (6, 8):
    Shared connections: None

12. For edge (10, 11):
    Shared connections: None

13. For edge (10, 12):
    Shared connections: None

14. For edge (10, 7):
    Shared connections: None

15. For edge (10, 1):
    Shared connections: None

16. For edge (11, 14):
    Shared connections: None

17. For edge (11, 0):
    Shared connections: None

18. For edge (13, 2):
    Shared connections: None

19. For edge (13, 1):
    Shared connections: None

20. For edge (13, 14):
    Shared connections: 0 (forms triangle with nodes 9 and 5) <5, 13, 9>

21. For edge (4, 12):
    Shared connections: None

22. For edge (4, 3):
    Shared connections: None

23. For edge (1, 14):
    Shared connections: None

24. For edge (3, 12):
    Shared connections: None

25. For edge (3, 0):
    Shared connections: None

26. For edge (2, 0):
    Shared connections: None

27. For edge (8, 5):
    Shared connections: None

28. For edge (8, 6):
    Shared connections: None

29. For edge (8, 12):
    Shared connections: None

30. For edge (8, 14):
    Shared connections: None

31. For edge (8, 7):
    Shared connections: None

32. For edge (7, 6):
    Shared connections: None

33. For edge (7, 10):
    Shared connections: None

34. For edge (7, 8):
    Shared connections: None
