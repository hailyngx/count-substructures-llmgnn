Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 12) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, first, we will sort the vertices based on their degree from lowest to highest:

- Node 5 has a degree of 4
- Node 9 has a degree of 5
- Node 6 has a degree of 4
- Node 4 has a degree of 5
- Node 7 has a degree of 5
- Node 10 has a degree of 3
- Node 11 has a degree of 4
- Node 8 has a degree of 3
- Node 0 has a degree of 3
- Node 14 has a degree of 2
- Node 13 has a degree of 4
- Node 1 has a degree of 3
- Node 2 has a degree of 6
- Node 12 has a degree of 5
- Node 3 has a degree of 5

Now, we will relabel the vertices according to degree (starting from 0):

- Node 14: 0
- Node 10: 1
- Node 1: 2
- Node 0: 3
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 5
- Node 8: 6
- Node 2: 7
- Node 4: 8
- Node 7: 9
- Node 11: 10
- Node 13: 11
- Node 12: 12
- Node 3: 13
- Node 9: 14

Now, we will count the triangles using the degree-based ordering method. 

The total number of triangles [] is 10, and the unique triangles found <> are:

<4, 0, 3>
<4, 8, 7>
<4, 13, 11>
<0, 3, 12>
<5, 4, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 2, 4>
<7, 8, 6>
<11, 1, 2>
<13, 10, 3>
