Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 9) (14, 12) (17, 1) (17, 8) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 15) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 13) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 7) (13, 8) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 1) (5, 19) (5, 3) (6, 16) (6, 11) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 11) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 9) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 11) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 12) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 18) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 19) (11, 18) (15, 4) (15, 12) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections).

The sorted list of nodes with their degrees is as follows:
(3: 3), (5: 3), (6: 2), (0: 3), (15: 2), (16: 3), (10: 3), (11: 4), (18: 5), (12: 4), (1: 4), (2: 4), (17: 2), (8: 3), (13: 4), (7: 5), (19: 5), (4: 5), (14: 2), (9: 3).

Now, starting with the edge between nodes with the lowest labels, we count the number of triangles:

Triangles: [52]
Unique Triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 11>, <0, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 16>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 15>, <2, 4, 11>, <3, 5, 19>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 19>, <3, 5, 18>, <5, 19, 18>, <5, 19, 18>, <5, 19, 11>, <6, 11, 2>, <6, 11, 18>, <6, 11, 19>, <7, 4, 16>, <7, 4, 18>, <7, 4, 15>, <7, 4, 13>, <7, 4, 10>, <9, 1, 17>, <9, 1, 10>, <9, 1, 18>, <9, 1, 17>, <9, 1, 10>, <9, 1, 18>, <9, 1, 17>, <9, 1, 10>, <9, 1, 18>, <9, 1, 17>, <9, 1, 10>, <9, 1, 18>, <11, 6, 16>, <11, 6, 18>, <11, 6, 19>, <11, 2, 4>, <11, 2, 18>, <11, 2, 19>, <11, 19, 18>, <11, 19, 18>, <12, 14, 18>, <12, 14, 15>, <12, 18, 15>, <12, 18, 14>, <12, 18, 15>, <12, 18, 14>, <12, 15, 14>, <14, 9, 1>, <14, 9, 17>, <14, 9, 18>, <14, 9, 1>, <14, 9, 17>, and <14, 9, 18>.
