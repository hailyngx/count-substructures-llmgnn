Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 16) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (3, 11) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 11) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 17) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (17, 13) (17, 14) (17, 1) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 16) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 19) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 12) (10, 9) (10, 8) (16, 9) (16, 18) (19, 4) (19, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted vertices are: 
Nodes: 3, 5, 7, 10, 16, 19, 0, 8, 18, 2, 17, 1, 12, 15, 6, 9, 13, 4, 11, 14

Considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles: 
- <0, 14, 15>
- <1, 6, 17>
- <1, 7, 17>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <2, 4, 12>
- <2, 4, 14>
- <2, 12, 14>
- <4, 6, 12>
- <4, 18, 19>
- <6, 14, 2>
- <10, 8, 9>
- <11, 14, 18>
- <13, 15, 8>
- <13, 17, 14>
- <13, 17, 8>

Total number of triangles: [14]
