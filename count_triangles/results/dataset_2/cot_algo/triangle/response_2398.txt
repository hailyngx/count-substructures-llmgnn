Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the labels are as follows:
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 0: 7 connections

Based on the degree-based ordering, we analyze the edges in the following order:
1. (5, 0) - Check shared connections: 3
2. (5, 3) - Check shared connections: 1
3. (5, 7) - Check shared connections: None
4. (9, 6) - Check shared connections: 4, 8
5. (9, 8) - Check shared connections: 4, 6
6. (9, 4) - Check shared connections: 6
7. (9, 2) - Check shared connections: 1, 3
8. (9, 1) - Check shared connections: 3
9. (6, 9) - Skip because vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 9
10. (6, 3) - Check shared connections: 4
11. (6, 4) - Check shared connections: 3
12. (6, 8) - Check shared connections: 4
13. (6, 0) - Check shared connections: None
14. (1, 9) - Check shared connections: 3
15. (1, 3) - Check shared connections: 9, 4
16. (1, 2) - Check shared connections: None
17. (1, 7) - Check shared connections: None
18. (3, 5) - Skip because both vertices have the same number of connections
19. (3, 6) - Check shared connections: 4, 1
20. (3, 1) - Check shared connections: 9, 4
21. (3, 4) - Check shared connections: 6
22. (3, 2) - Check shared connections: 9, 1
23. (4, 9) - Check shared connections: 6
24. (4, 6) - Check shared connections: 3, 1
25. (4, 3) - Check shared connections: 6
26. (4, 0) - Check shared connections: None
27. (8, 9) - Check shared connections: 6, 4
28. (8, 6) - Check shared connections: 4
29. (8, 0) - Check shared connections: None
30. (0, 5) - Skip because both vertices have the same number of connections
31. (0, 6) - Check shared connections: 4, 3
32. (0, 4) - Check shared connections: 6
33. (0, 8) - Check shared connections: None
34. (7, 5) - Check shared connections: None
35. (7, 1) - Check shared connections: None
36. (7, 2) - Check shared connections: None
37. (2, 9) - Check shared connections: 1, 3
38. (2, 1) - Check shared connections: None
39. (2, 3) - Check shared connections: 1, 9
40. (2, 7) - Check shared connections: None

Total number of triangles: [16]
Unique triangles: <0, 5, 3>, <0, 6, 4>, <1, 9, 3>, <1, 9, 4>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 1>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 2, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 3>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 9, 1>, <8, 9, 4>, <9, 1, 3>, <9, 2, 7>
