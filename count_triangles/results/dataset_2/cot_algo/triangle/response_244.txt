Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (12, 6) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 3) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 1) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes connected by edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 12, 3, 11.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 14, 10.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 4, 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 13, 0, 14, 11.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, 0, 10, 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 4, 10.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 12, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 11, 2, 13, 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 4, 13, 10, 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 11, 10.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 8, 1.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 0, 14, 3.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 0.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 3.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11, 3, 1.

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
1. Node 1 has degree 3.
2. Nodes 0, 6, 9, 12, 14 have degree 4.
3. Nodes 5, 7, 13 have degree 5.
4. Nodes 2, 3, 11 have degree 6.
5. Nodes 4, 10, 8 have degree 6.

Next, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles. 

Number of triangles: [10]

Triangles found: <1, 7, 14>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 10, 4>, <1, 10, 8>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 4, 3>, <4, 7, 13>, <4, 8, 13>, <4, 8, 10>, <2, 7, 4>.
