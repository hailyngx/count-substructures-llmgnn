Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 14) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 0) (13, 19) (13, 6) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 7) (15, 18) (15, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 17) (8, 12) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 6) (0, 18) (0, 3) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 19) (17, 8) (6, 13) (6, 7) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 3) (16, 18) (16, 2) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 16) (12, 11) (12, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, the nodes are relabeled accordingly. Let's apply this method to the given graph:

Sorted nodes by degree:  
Node 0: 2 connections  
Node 1: 3 connections  
Node 17: 1 connections  
Node 6: 2 connections  
Node 13: 2 connections  
Node 16: 2 connections  
Node 12: 2 connections  
Node 4: 3 connections  
Node 18: 4 connections  
Node 15: 2 connections  
Node 3: 3 connections  
Node 5: 4 connections  
Node 9: 4 connections  
Node 8: 4 connections  
Node 10: 4 connections  
Node 19: 4 connections  
Node 7: 5 connections  
Node 11: 4 connections  
Node 2: 3 connections  
Node 14: 4 connections  

Now, let's count the number of triangles by considering the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles:  
1. <0, 3, 19>  
2. <0, 18, 4>  
3. <1, 7, 5>  
4. <1, 14, 2>  
5. <2, 16, 18>  
6. <3, 0, 19>  
7. <4, 18, 15>  
8. <4, 19, 13>  
9. <5, 7, 9>  
10. <7, 1, 14>  
11. <8, 9, 5>  
12. <8, 12, 11>  
13. <13, 19, 10>  
14. <14, 1, 11>  
15. <16, 2, 11>  
16. <18, 0, 3>  

Total number of triangles: [16]
