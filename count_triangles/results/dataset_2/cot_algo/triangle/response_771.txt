Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) 

Response:
The graph can be illustrated as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges (connections between nodes):
- 0: 4, 6, 8, 9
- 1: 5, 9
- 2: 3, 6, 8
- 3: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
- 4: 0, 3, 5, 7
- 5: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
- 6: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7
- 7: 4, 5, 6, 9
- 8: 0, 2, 3, 9
- 9: 1, 7, 8, 0

Now, we will order the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:
0, 1, 2, 8, 9, 7, 5, 6, 3, 4

Counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Only count triangles when the lower-labeled vertex of an edge has fewer connections.
2. Check for shared connections to count triangles.

The total number of triangles is [16].

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
