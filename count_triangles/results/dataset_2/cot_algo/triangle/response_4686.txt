Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (12, 14) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 0) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 13) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 10) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order first. 

Here are the vertices sorted by their degrees:
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 12: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 4
Node 14: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 10: Degree 6
Node 1: Degree 6
Node 5: Degree 6
Node 3: Degree 6
Node 13: Degree 6
Node 0: Degree 6

Now, we will go through each edge in the order of sorting and count the triangles:

Triangles:
[10] 

The total number of triangles found in the graph is [10]. 

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 11>
<0, 1, 13>
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 10>
<0, 5, 11>
<1, 5, 11>
<2, 10, 14>
<4, 6, 10>
