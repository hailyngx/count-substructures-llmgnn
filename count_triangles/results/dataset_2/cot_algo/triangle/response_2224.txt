Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 6) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 27) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 27) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 5) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 5) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 24) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 18) (4, 22) (4, 9) (4, 15) (8, 22) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 23) (12, 1) (12, 16) (2, 1) (19, 3) (19, 26) (19, 13) (19, 27) (26, 14) (26, 19) (26, 16) (18, 11) (18, 28) (28, 18) (28, 29) (28, 13) (29, 14) (29, 20) (29, 28) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 23) (15, 6) (22, 4) (22, 8) (22, 16) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 26) (16, 22) (16, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (5, 3) (5, 20) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 0) (23, 7) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 9) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 23) (9, 13) (13, 25) (13, 19) (13, 28) (13, 9) (13, 24) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 19) (24, 25) (24, 23) (24, 13) 

Response:
The given graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges:
- 0: {3, 6}
- 1: {2, 12, 27, 3}
- 2: {1}
- 3: {0, 1, 19, 5}
- 4: {22, 9, 15}
- 5: {3, 20}
- 6: {0, 10, 14, 15}
- 7: {8, 23}
- 8: {7, 22}
- 9: {4, 16, 13, 23}
- 10: {6, 11, 15, 16}
- 11: {10, 18}
- 12: {1, 16}
- 13: {25, 19, 28, 9, 24}
- 14: {17, 26, 29, 6}
- 15: {4, 10, 23, 6}
- 16: {10, 12, 22, 26, 9}
- 17: {26, 14}
- 18: {11, 28}
- 19: {3, 13, 26, 27}
- 20: {5, 25, 29}
- 22: {4, 8, 16}
- 23: {7, 15, 24, 9}
- 24: {25, 23, 13}
- 25: {24, 20, 13}
- 26: {14, 19, 16}
- 27: {17, 1, 19}
- 28: {18, 13, 29}
- 29: {14, 20, 28}

Now, let's list the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:

Nodes by degree: [18, 2, 3, 5, 7, 0, 4, 7, 8, 11, 1, 6, 8, 6, 4, 6, 5, 2, 5, 6, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5]

Now, count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.  

Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles found: <16, 9, 13>, <16, 13, 25>, <16, 13, 24>, <17, 14, 26>, <19, 13, 28>
