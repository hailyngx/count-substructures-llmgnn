Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 11) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 4) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) (4, 11) (4, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 1) 

Response:
We will now construct the graph with the given nodes and edges and then count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The given edges in the graph are as follows:
(5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 11) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 4) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) (4, 11) (4, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 1)

Now we will sort the nodes by their degree and relabel the vertices accordingly:

New vertex labels and degrees:
0: 5 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 1 connection
6: 5 connections
7: 5 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 6 connections
10: 4 connections
11: 5 connections
12: 4 connections
13: 5 connections
14: 6 connections

Now, we proceed with counting the triangles:
Triangles: [11]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 12>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 14>
<1, 7, 12>
<2, 7, 14>
<3, 7, 12>
<3, 13, 14>
<4, 11, 14>
<6, 7, 14>
<8, 10, 11>
