Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 1) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 11) (2, 6) (2, 18) (2, 11) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 3) (5, 8) (5, 14) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 19) (15, 9) (15, 12) (4, 13) (4, 16) (12, 17) (12, 15) (12, 8) (19, 14) (19, 16) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 16) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 1) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (3, 18) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 18) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: (0, 1), (0, 14), (1, 9), (1, 16), (2, 6), (2, 11), (2, 18), (3, 13), (3, 18), (3, 13), (4, 13), (4, 16), (5, 8), (5, 14), (5, 8), (6, 2), (6, 11), (6, 13), (7, 8), (7, 10), (7, 13), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 12), (9, 1), (9, 15), (9, 16), (10, 7), (10, 14), (10, 17), (11, 2), (11, 6), (11, 17), (11, 18), (12, 8), (12, 15), (12, 17), (13, 3), (13, 4), (13, 6), (13, 7), (14, 0), (14, 5), (14, 10), (14, 19), (15, 9), (15, 12), (16, 1), (16, 4), (16, 9), (16, 19), (17, 10), (17, 11), (17, 12), (17, 18), (18, 2), (18, 3), (18, 11), (18, 17), (19, 14), (19, 16)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on the number of connections each node has in ascending order and relabel the nodes accordingly.

Nodes by degree: 0(2), 19(2), 5(2), 7(3), 15(3), 18(4), 1(4), 4(4), 10(4), 12(4), 3(4), 13(4), 16(4), 14(4), 6(4), 8(4), 9(4), 11(4), 2(4), 17(4)

After relabeling, we get the following edges following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
(0, 1), (0, 14), (1, 9), (1, 16), (5, 8), (5, 14), (7, 8), (7, 10), (7, 13), (2, 6), (2, 11), (2, 18), (3, 13), (3, 18), (3, 13), (4, 13), (4, 16), (5, 8), (5, 14), (6, 2), (6, 11), (6, 13), (7, 8), (7, 13), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 12), (9, 1), (9, 15), (9, 16), (10, 7), (10, 14), (10, 17), (11, 2), (11, 6), (11, 17), (11, 18), (12, 8), (12, 15), (12, 17), (13, 3), (13, 4), (13, 6), (13, 7), (14, 0), (14, 5), (14, 10), (15, 9), (15, 12), (16, 1), (16, 4), (16, 9), (16, 19), (17, 10), (17, 11), (17, 12), (17, 18), (18, 2), (18, 3), (18, 11), (18, 17), (19, 16)

Now, we will count the triangles formed:

Unique triangles found:
<10, 14, 19>
