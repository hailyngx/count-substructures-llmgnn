Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree from least to most are: 5, 9, 1, 2, 8, 7, 0, 4, 3, 6.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The triangles found are as follows:

<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 0>
<2, 3, 1>
<4, 7, 6>
<6, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<6, 8, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 8, 6>
<5, 8, 7>
<5, 9, 6>

The total number of triangles is [16].
