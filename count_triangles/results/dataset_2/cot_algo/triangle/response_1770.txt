Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Edges:  
(4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 1), (4, 6),  
(7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 9), (7, 2), (7, 5),  
(1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 0), (1, 8),  
(3, 9), (3, 8),  
(6, 1),  
(9, 7), (9, 1), (9, 3),  
(8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 5),  
(5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 0),  
(2, 8), (2, 0),  
(0, 1), (0, 5)  

Degree-Based Ordering:  
Nodes by their connections:  
0 (degree 4)  
2 (degree 2)  
3 (degree 2)  
6 (degree 2)  
5 (degree 3)  
8 (degree 4)  
9 (degree 4)  
1 (degree 5)  
7 (degree 5)  
4 (degree 6)  

Triangles and counting:  
Since we have 10 nodes, there can be a maximum of 10 choose 3 = 120 triangles in the graph.  
By the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles is [3].  

Unique triangles:  
<0, 1, 4>
