Now, let's count the number of triangles within this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted by their connections: 
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 14: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5

Triangles:
[80] 

Unique triangles:
<1, 12, 5>, <3, 14, 6>, <2, 14, 3>, <4, 7, 2>, <13, 0, 11>, <9, 8, 10>, <5, 12, 4>, <0, 1, 10>, <9, 0, 13>, <8, 13, 4>
