Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 2) (13, 20) (13, 7) (22, 0) (22, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (21, 26) (21, 18) (21, 29) (2, 13) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 20) (29, 21) (29, 2) (29, 10) (6, 9) (6, 24) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 24) (9, 14) (18, 21) (18, 19) (18, 25) (0, 22) (0, 20) (20, 13) (20, 2) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 10) (15, 20) (15, 11) (15, 16) (28, 26) (28, 25) (26, 21) (26, 28) (26, 5) (26, 12) (3, 22) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (11, 15) (11, 3) (11, 27) (11, 5) (8, 9) (16, 15) (16, 25) (19, 2) (19, 18) (24, 6) (24, 9) (24, 17) (24, 25) (5, 26) (5, 11) (5, 7) (23, 17) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 27) (7, 17) (17, 24) (17, 23) (17, 7) (4, 1) (4, 14) (10, 1) (10, 29) (10, 20) (10, 3) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 25) (27, 11) (27, 7) (12, 1) (12, 26) (25, 18) (25, 28) (25, 16) (25, 24) (25, 14) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges provided have been represented accordingly. Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

After sorting the vertices by their degrees in increasing order, the relabeling is as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 23 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 19 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 12 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 17 has degree 3
- Node 28 has degree 3
- Node 18 has degree 3
- Node 16 has degree 3
- Node 15 has degree 3
- Node 22 has degree 3
- Node 21 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 20 has degree 4
- Node 24 has degree 4
- Node 27 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 13 has degree 4
- Node 25 has degree 5
- Node 29 has degree 5
- Node 7 has degree 5
- Node 26 has degree 6
- Node 3 has degree 6
- Node 10 has degree 6
- Node 11 has degree 6
- Node 4 has degree 6
- Node 14 has degree 6
- Node 9 has degree 6

Now, we will count the number of triangles:
- Total triangles: [24]

Unique triangles found:
- <5, 7, 11>
- <7, 11, 27>
- <7, 11, 5>
- <7, 11, 3>
- <7, 11, 17>
- <5, 11, 3>
- <5, 11, 7>
- <9, 6, 24>
- <21, 29, 2>
- <9, 24, 17>
- <25, 24, 17>
- <21, 29, 10>
- <10, 1, 4>
- <10, 1, 12>
