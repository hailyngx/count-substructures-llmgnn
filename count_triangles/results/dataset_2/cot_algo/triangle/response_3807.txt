Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 2) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 13) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 1) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 1) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 9) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 9) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 16) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 2) (8, 5) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 11) (2, 15) (2, 16) (2, 17) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 17) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 17) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Vertices sorted based on their degrees (number of connections):
0: 2 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
5: 3 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 1 connection
10: 3 connections
14: 3 connections
17: 4 connections
1: 5 connections
6: 5 connections
11: 5 connections
12: 5 connections
13: 5 connections
15: 5 connections
16: 4 connections
18: 5 connections
2: 4 connections
9: 4 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's count the triangles:

1. (0, 7) and (0, 14) share node 0 => <0, 7, 14>
2. (0, 14) and (14, 1) share node 14 => <0, 14, 1>
3. (0, 7) and (7, 18) share node 7 => <0, 7, 18>
4. (3, 9) and (9, 1) share node 9 => <3, 9, 1>
5. (3, 9) and (9, 7) share node 9 => <3, 9, 7>
6. (14, 1) and (1, 15) share node 1 => <14, 1, 15>
7. (14, 1) and (1, 13) share node 1 => <14, 1, 13>
8. (15, 10) and (10, 16) share node 10 => <15, 10, 16>
9. (15, 1) and (1, 13) share node 1 => <15, 1, 13>
10. (15, 2) and (2, 16) share node 2 => <15, 2, 16>
11. (5, 8) and (8, 5) share node 5 => <5, 8, 13>
12. (5, 13) and (13, 1) share node 13 => <5, 13, 1>
13. (5, 13) and (13, 12) share node 13 => <5, 13, 12>
14. (5, 12) and (12, 10) share node 12 => <5, 12, 10>
15. (6, 3) and (3, 9) share node 3 => <6, 3, 9>
16. (6, 13) and (13, 5) share node 13 => <6, 13, 5>
17. (6, 13) and (13, 12) share node 13 => <6, 13, 12>
18. (6, 11) and (11, 17) share node 11 => <6, 11, 17>
19. (4, 11) and (11, 17) share node 11 => <4, 11, 17>
