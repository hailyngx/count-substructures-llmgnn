Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 5) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 4) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 19) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 16) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 5) (1, 17) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 5) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 19) (0, 9) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 14) (9, 0) (9, 14) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 1) (13, 7) (13, 16) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 9) (16, 4) (16, 13) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 15) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 8) (6, 17) (6, 12) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently in a graph. 

First, let's list the nodes according to their degree from least to most:

Nodes: 
3, 6, 2, 16, 13, 9, 14, 18, 4, 15, 10, 7, 12, 5, 8, 0, 1, 17, 11, 19

Now, using the list of edges given and the ordering of nodes, we can count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles is [27].

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 11>
<0, 1, 15>
<0, 1, 17>
<0, 4, 11>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 7, 19>
<0, 9, 14>
<0, 11, 18>
<1, 5, 17>
<1, 8, 17>
<1, 15, 19>
<1, 8, 5>
<1, 15, 14>
<3, 8, 17>
<4, 11, 18>
<6, 12, 17>
<7, 13, 16>
<9, 14, 18>
<10, 5, 8>
<11, 18, 14>
<16, 4, 13>
<17, 7, 19>
<17, 10, 5>
<17, 19, 15>
