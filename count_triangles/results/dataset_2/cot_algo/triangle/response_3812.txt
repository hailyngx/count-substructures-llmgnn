Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are:  
Node 1: 2 connections  
Node 6: 2 connections  
Node 7: 2 connections  
Node 5: 4 connections  
Node 8: 4 connections  
Node 4: 4 connections  
Node 0: 5 connections  
Node 3: 5 connections  
Node 9: 5 connections  
Node 2: 5 connections 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will look at each edge and count the triangles:  
1. (5, 9): 5 is connected to 4, 8, and 3, and 9 is connected to 1, 2, 3, and 4, so we have the triangle <5, 9, 4>.  
2. (5, 8): No additional triangles.  
3. (5, 0): No additional triangles.  
4. (5, 3): No additional triangles.  
5. (9, 5): No additional triangles.  
6. (9, 4): No additional triangles.  
7. (9, 2): No additional triangles.  
8. (9, 3): No additional triangles.  
9. (9, 1): No additional triangles.  
10. (1, 9): No additional triangles.  
11. (1, 7): No additional triangles.  
12. (3, 5): No additional triangles.  
13. (3, 9): No additional triangles.  
14. (3, 7): No additional triangles.  
15. (3, 0): No additional triangles.  
16. (3, 4): No additional triangles.  
17. (2, 9): No additional triangles.  
18. (2, 8): No additional triangles.  
19. (2, 6): No additional triangles.  
20. (2, 4): No additional triangles.  
21. (8, 5): No additional triangles.  
22. (8, 2): No additional triangles.  
23. (8, 0): No additional triangles.  
24. (8, 7): No additional triangles.  
25. (8, 6): No additional triangles.  
26. (0, 5): No additional triangles.  
27. (0, 3): No additional triangles.  
28. (0, 8): No additional triangles.  
29. (0, 4): No additional triangles.  
30. (0, 6): No additional triangles.  
31. (6, 2): No additional triangles.  
32. (6, 8): No additional triangles.  
33. (6, 0): No additional triangles.  
34. (7, 1): No additional triangles.  
35. (7, 3): No additional triangles.  
36. (7, 8): No additional triangles.  
37. (4, 9): No additional triangles.  
38. (4, 3): No additional triangles.  
39. (4, 2): No additional triangles.  
40. (4, 0): No additional triangles.  

The total number of triangles in the given graph is: [1]  
The unique triangle found is: <5, 9, 4>.
