Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is as follows:
Vertices: 3 < 1 < 6 < 0 < 1 < 4 < 7 < 8 < 9 < 5

Next, let's find the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. (3, 6) - No triangles
2. (1, 8) - No triangles
3. (6, 2) - Triangle <2, 6, 3>
4. (0, 4) - No triangles
5. (1, 7) - No triangles
6. (4, 2) - No triangles
7. (7, 8) - Triangle <7, 8, 1>
8. (8, 9) - No triangles
9. (9, 5) - Triangle <5, 9, 8>

Total number of triangles: [3] 

Unique triangles found: <2, 6, 3>, <7, 8, 1>, <5, 9, 8>
