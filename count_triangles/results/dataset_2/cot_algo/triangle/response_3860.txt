Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 16) (9, 19) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 17) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 16) (17, 7) (17, 14) (17, 10) (10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 8) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 16) (8, 10) (8, 11) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 13) (0, 5) (0, 13) (3, 14) (3, 6) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 1) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 13) (15, 18) (15, 1) (15, 16) (15, 12) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 15) (16, 12) (6, 10) (6, 3) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 19) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 12) (13, 18) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be described as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(5, 0), (9, 16), (9, 19), (4, 18), (4, 19), (4, 2), (7, 11), (7, 19), (7, 10), (7, 17), (14, 17), (14, 3), (14, 16), (17, 7), (17, 14), (17, 10), (10, 7), (10, 17), (10, 6), (10, 8), (2, 4), (2, 19), (2, 16), (8, 10), (8, 11), (18, 4), (18, 15), (18, 13), (0, 5), (0, 13), (3, 14), (3, 6), (11, 7), (11, 8), (11, 1), (1, 11), (1, 15), (1, 13), (15, 18), (15, 1), (15, 16), (15, 12), (16, 9), (16, 14), (16, 2), (16, 15), (16, 12), (6, 10), (6, 3), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 19), (19, 9), (19, 4), (19, 7), (19, 2), (19, 12), (13, 18), (13, 0), (13, 1)

To count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to order the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 5: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 18: degree 3
Node 0: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 15: degree 4
Node 16: degree 6
Node 11: degree 4
Node 4: degree 5
Node 10: degree 5
Node 17: degree 4
Node 14: degree 3
Node 19: degree 5

Following the method explained earlier and considering the given edges, the total number of triangles in this graph is: [22]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 13>
<0, 1, 15>
<4, 18, 13>
<4, 2, 19>
<4, 2, 16>
<18, 15, 13>
<18, 15, 1>
<18, 15, 16>
<10, 7, 17>
<10, 7, 14>
<10, 6, 3>
<10, 8, 11>
<16, 14, 17>
<16, 14, 3>
<16, 14, 12>
<16, 15, 12>
<16, 15, 1>
<16, 15, 18>
<16, 12, 19>
<19, 12, 15>
