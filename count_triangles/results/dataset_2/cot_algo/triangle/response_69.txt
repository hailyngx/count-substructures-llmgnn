Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (17, 19) (17, 5) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 16) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 16) (18, 7) (18, 6) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 0) (11, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 15) (14, 5) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 15) (9, 1) (9, 13) (15, 12) (15, 14) (15, 16) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 19) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 9) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 18) (19, 17) (19, 14) (19, 16) (19, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves relabeling the vertices based on their degree of connections. Here is the list of vertices sorted by their degrees in ascending order:

Node 0 has 2 edges.
Node 9 has 2 edges.
Node 11 has 2 edges.
Node 18 has 3 edges.
Node 1 has 3 edges.
Node 17 has 3 edges.
Node 15 has 4 edges.
Node 5 has 4 edges.
Node 7 has 4 edges.
Node 13 has 4 edges.
Node 6 has 4 edges.
Node 19 has 4 edges.
Node 16 has 4 edges.
Node 4 has 4 edges.
Node 8 has 4 edges.
Node 3 has 5 edges.
Node 14 has 5 edges.
Node 12 has 5 edges.
Node 2 has 5 edges.
Node 10 has 5 edges.

Now, we will traverse through the edges and count the number of triangles. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Number of triangles: [20]
