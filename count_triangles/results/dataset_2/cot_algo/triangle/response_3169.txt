Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 2) (15, 8) (15, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 17) (2, 4) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (17, 2) (17, 4) (17, 7) (10, 5) (10, 19) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (7, 17) (7, 9) (7, 16) (7, 18) (16, 7) (12, 15) (12, 13) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 18) (19, 1) (19, 10) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 4) (14, 18) (14, 4) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 14) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 17) (4, 13) (4, 14) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 2)
(1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19)
(2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 17)
(3, 0) (3, 2)
(4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 17)
(5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 11)
(6, 0) (6, 8)
(7, 9) (7, 16) (7, 17) (7, 18)
(8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 15)
(9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13)
(10, 5) (10, 19)
(11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 18)
(12, 15) (12, 13)
(13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 12)
(14, 4) (14, 18)
(15, 8) (15, 12)
(16, 7)
(17, 2) (17, 4) (17, 7)
(18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 14)
(19, 1) (19, 10)

Next, we will sort the vertices by their degrees (number of connections):

Vertices: 16, 3, 6, 10, 12, 14, 15, 0, 1, 19, 8, 5, 16, 18, 9, 11, 17, 2, 4, 7

Now, let's count the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [41]
Unique Triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 17>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 4, 14>, <0, 4, 17>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 9, 11>, <0, 9, 11>, <0, 11, 5>, <0, 11, 9>, <1, 13, 4>, <1, 13, 9>, <4, 13, 14>, <4, 13, 17>, <5, 10, 19>, <7, 9, 13>, <7, 9, 13>, <7, 9, 13>, <7, 9, 13>, <7, 9, 13>, <7, 11, 18>, <7, 11, 18>, <7, 11, 18>, <7, 16, 18>, <7, 17, 2>, <7, 17, 4>, <7, 17, 4>, <7, 17, 4>, <11, 18, 14>, <11, 18, 18>, <14, 18, 7>, <14, 18, 11>, <15, 12, 13>, <17, 2, 4>, <17, 2, 7>, <17, 4, 13>, <18, 11, 18>, <18, 14, 4>
