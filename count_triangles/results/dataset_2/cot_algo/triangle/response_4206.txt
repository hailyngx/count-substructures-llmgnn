Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 3) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 12) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (10, 11), (10, 0), (10, 6), (10, 1), (10, 2), (10, 9), (11, 10), (11, 3), (11, 8), (11, 2), (4, 8), (4, 12), (4, 9), (4, 0), (8, 11), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 3), (8, 1), (0, 10), (0, 4), (0, 14), (14, 0), (14, 7), (14, 13), (2, 10), (2, 11), (2, 8), (2, 12), (2, 5), (2, 3), (3, 11), (3, 8), (3, 2), (3, 13), (3, 5), (5, 8), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7), (13, 14), (13, 3), (13, 12), (12, 4), (12, 2), (12, 13), (1, 10), (1, 8), (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 7), (6, 10), (6, 1), (7, 14), (7, 5), (7, 1), (9, 10), (9, 4), (9, 1)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Nodes sorted by degree: 7, 6, 13, 14, 5, 12, 3, 4, 9, 0, 6, 1, 2, 11, 10, 8

Starting to count triangles: 
1. (7, 1) - Shared connections: 14
2. (6, 1) - Shared connections: 10
3. (13, 3) - Shared connections: 14
4. (14, 0) - Shared connections: 10
5. (5, 2) - Shared connections: 8
6. (12, 2) - Shared connections: None
7. (3, 11) - Shared connections: 10
8. (4, 8) - Shared connections: 11
9. (9, 1) - Shared connections: 10
10. (0, 10) - Shared connections: None
11. (6, 10) - Shared connections: 1

Total triangles found: [11]

Unique triangles found: <1, 7, 14>, <3, 11, 13>, <0, 10, 14>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 11>, <4, 8, 11>, <1, 6, 10>, <1, 9, 10>, <5, 7, 14>, <1, 6, 7>
