Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 16) (14, 10) (17, 3) (17, 19) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 18) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 16) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 18) (11, 3) (11, 19) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 15) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 15) (12, 1) (15, 6) (15, 2) (15, 12) (19, 17) (19, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (16, 14) (16, 4) (10, 14) (10, 3)
