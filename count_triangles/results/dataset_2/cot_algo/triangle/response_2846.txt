Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 12) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 10) (17, 19) (17, 4) (17, 7) (1, 14) (1, 13) (5, 15) (5, 9) (5, 11) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (4, 17) (4, 19) (8, 9) (8, 12) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 2) (16, 7) (16, 10) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 19) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (0, 15) (0, 18) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 16) (10, 6) (13, 1) (13, 18) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 13) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 8) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: (3, 15), (3, 9), (3, 18), (15, 0), (15, 5), (15, 12), (14, 6), (14, 1), (14, 12), (17, 19), (17, 4), (17, 7), (1, 13), (5, 11), (5, 9), (9, 11), (9, 5), (4, 19), (8, 12), (8, 9), (7, 16), (7, 10), (7, 17), (16, 10), (11, 19), (6, 10), (6, 14), (0, 18), (2, 7), (2, 6), (13, 18)

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices with their degrees:
0: 2, 1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 3, 4: 2, 5: 3, 6: 3, 7: 4, 8: 2, 9: 5, 10: 4, 11: 3, 12: 3, 13: 2, 14: 4, 15: 4, 16: 2, 17: 3, 18: 3, 19: 3

Vertices sorted by degree:
0, 1, 4, 8, 13, 16, 3, 5, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18, 19, 7, 2, 10, 14, 15, 9

Now, let's start counting the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [12]
Unique triangles: <1, 13, 18>
