Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 7) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 19) (4, 13) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 14) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 16) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (11, 14) (11, 18) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 2) (12, 14) (12, 8) (10, 13) (10, 7) (7, 17) (7, 5) (7, 10) (19, 13) (19, 0) (6, 17) (6, 4) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 16) (1, 5) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Edges: (3, 15), (15, 3), (15, 9), (15, 5), (15, 2), (14, 17), (14, 11), (14, 18), (14, 12), (17, 14), (17, 6), (17, 5), (17, 7), (8, 13), (8, 9), (8, 12), (13, 8), (13, 5), (13, 4), (13, 10), (13, 19), (4, 13), (4, 18), (4, 6), (18, 14), (18, 4), (18, 11), (18, 16), (5, 15), (5, 17), (5, 13), (5, 1), (5, 7), (11, 14), (11, 18), (9, 15), (9, 8), (9, 0), (9, 2), (0, 9), (0, 16), (0, 19), (16, 18), (16, 0), (16, 2), (12, 14), (12, 8), (10, 13), (10, 7), (7, 17), (7, 5), (7, 10), (19, 13), (19, 0), (6, 17), (6, 4), (2, 15), (2, 9), (2, 16), (1, 5).

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 16: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 10: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 19: degree 3
Node 11: degree 3
Node 3: degree 2
Node 2: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 18: degree 4
Node 12: degree 3
Node 14: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 8: degree 3
Node 5: degree 5
Node 9: degree 4
Node 13: degree 6
Node 15: degree 5

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles.
We will not count a triangle if the vertex with the lower label has more connections.

[Total number of triangles: 10]

Unique triangles:<0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 5, 13>, <0, 5, 15>, <4, 6, 17>, <4, 13, 17>, <4, 13, 18>, <4, 13, 19>, <5, 7, 17>, <5, 13, 17>
