Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 4) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first.

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 11), (6, 0), (9, 0), (9, 8), (9, 14), (9, 7), (9, 0), (9, 12), (8, 0), (13, 8), (13, 5), (13, 4), (13, 3), (13, 7), (7, 12), (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 3), (2, 12), (2, 1), (2, 4), (11, 6), (11, 14), (11, 1), (14, 1), (14, 4), (1, 10), (3, 13), (3, 12), (3, 5), (3, 10), (4, 14), (4, 0)
- 1: (7, 1), (12, 1), (5, 3), (2, 1), (11, 1), (14, 1), (10, 1), (0, 1)
- 2: (7, 12), (12, 2), (5, 3), (1, 2), (4, 2)
- 3: (13, 3), (10, 3), (5, 3), (12, 3)
- 4: (14, 4), (2, 4), (4, 13), (4, 0)
- 5: (6, 5), (13, 5), (5, 3)
- 6: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 11), (6, 0), (5, 6), (11, 6)
- 7: (9, 7), (7, 13), (7, 12), (1, 7)
- 8: (9, 8), (8, 13), (8, 0)
- 9: (6, 9), (9, 8), (9, 14), (9, 7), (9, 0), (12, 9), (14, 9)
- 10: (1, 10), (3, 10)
- 11: (6, 11), (11, 14), (11, 1)
- 12: (7, 12), (12, 3), (12, 2), (3, 12)
- 13: (8, 13), (13, 5), (13, 4), (13, 3), (7, 13), (3, 13)
- 14: (9, 14), (14, 11), (14, 1), (14, 4)

Next, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabel them. 

1. Node 10 (Degree 2)
2. Node 4 (Degree 4)
3. Node 2 (Degree 5)
4. Node 12 (Degree 5)
5. Node 14 (Degree 5)
6. Node 5 (Degree 6)
7. Node 8 (Degree 6)
8. Node 0 (Degree 6)
9. Node 1 (Degree 7)
10. Node 3 (Degree 7)
11. Node 11 (Degree 7)
12. Node 7 (Degree 7)
13. Node 13 (Degree 7)
14. Node 6 (Degree 8)
15. Node 9 (Degree 8)

Now, let's look for triangles by checking shared connections (edges) based on the relabeling. 

Triangles:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 14>
- <0, 4, 14>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 2, 12>
- <1, 4, 14>
- <1, 7, 12>
- <2, 4, 14>
- <2, 7, 12>
- <3, 10, 12>
- <4, 13, 14>
- <4, 0, 6>
- <5, 6, 13>
- <7, 9, 12>
