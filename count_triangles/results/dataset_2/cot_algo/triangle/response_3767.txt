Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
The graph is as follows: 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Edges:  
(6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8)  
(9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0)  
(1, 3) (1, 8)  
(3, 4)  
(0, 7)  
(2, 4)  
(8, 5)  

Next, we sort the nodes by their degrees in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:  
Nodes: 5, 3, 7, 2, 6, 1, 8, 0, 4, 9  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles:  
- For edge (0, 7): No triangles are formed.  
- For edge (2, 4): No triangles are formed.  
- For edge (6, 1): One triangle <1, 6, 8> is found.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].  
The unique triangles found are:  
<1, 6, 8>
