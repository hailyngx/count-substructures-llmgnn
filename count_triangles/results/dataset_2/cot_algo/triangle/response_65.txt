Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 13) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 15) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (2, 3) (2, 15) (18, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 8) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 19) (5, 3) (19, 11) (19, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 16) (4, 0) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 16) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 16) (9, 10) (9, 16) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 16) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 15)
