Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 12) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 12) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (6, 11) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 14) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: (5, 2), (5, 12), (5, 11), (5, 0), (9, 4), (9, 14), (9, 10), (9, 12), (1, 3), (1, 14), (1, 12), (1, 7), (3, 1), (3, 11), (3, 7), (3, 2), (3, 8), (10, 9), (10, 11), (10, 13), (11, 5), (11, 3), (11, 10), (11, 0), (11, 6), (11, 12), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 12), (12, 5), (12, 9), (12, 1), (12, 11), (12, 7), (12, 4), (2, 5), (2, 3), (2, 8), (2, 0), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 0), (4, 9), (4, 12), (4, 13), (4, 0), (6, 11), (6, 14), (14, 9), (14, 1), (14, 6), (14, 13), (13, 10), (13, 4), (13, 14), (0, 5), (0, 11), (0, 2), (0, 8), (0, 4)

Let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Degrees:
0: 6
1: 4
2: 4
3: 5
4: 5
5: 4
6: 2
7: 3
8: 3
9: 4
10: 3
11: 6
12: 6
13: 3
14: 4

Sorted by degrees (least to most):
6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 1, 2, 5, 9, 14, 3, 4, 11, 12, 0

Triangles:
[14]

Unique triangles:
<0, 5, 11>
