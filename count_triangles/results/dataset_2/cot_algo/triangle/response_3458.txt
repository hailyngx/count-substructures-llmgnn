Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
   Node 0: degree 4
   Node 1: degree 4
   Node 2: degree 5
   Node 3: degree 5
   Node 4: degree 4
   Node 5: degree 5
   Node 6: degree 3
   Node 7: degree 4
   Node 8: degree 4
   Node 9: degree 3
   
2. Relabeling the nodes based on their degrees:
   Nodes sorted by degree: 6, 9, 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 5, 3, 2
   Relabeled nodes: 
   Node 6 (degree 3) becomes Node 0
   Node 9 (degree 3) becomes Node 1
   Node 0 (degree 4) becomes Node 2
   Node 1 (degree 4) becomes Node 3
   Node 4 (degree 4) becomes Node 4
   Node 7 (degree 4) becomes Node 5
   Node 8 (degree 4) becomes Node 6
   Node 5 (degree 5) becomes Node 7
   Node 3 (degree 5) becomes Node 8
   Node 2 (degree 5) becomes Node 9
   
3. With the nodes relabeled, counting triangles in the graph:
   - Checking each edge where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:
     - Edge (5, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <5, 9, 4>
     - Edge (5, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <5, 1, 3>
     - Edge (5, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <5, 4, 7>
     - Edge (5, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 0: <5, 3, 0>
     - Edge (5, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 8: <5, 7, 8>
     - Edge (9, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <9, 4, 7>
     - Edge (4, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <4, 7, 5>
     - Edge (7, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 8: <7, 3, 8>
     - Edge (3, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <3, 1, 2>
     - Edge (1, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 0: <1, 5, 0>
     - Edge (3, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <3, 5, 9>
     - Edge (8, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <8, 7, 4>
     - Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <0, 4, 2>
     - Edge (2, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <2, 1, 3>
     - Edge (2, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <2, 3, 5>
   
   The total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
