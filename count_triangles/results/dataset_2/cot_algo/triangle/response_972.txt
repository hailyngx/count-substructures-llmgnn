Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 19) (10, 17) (17, 13) (17, 10) (17, 19) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 14) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 1) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 16) (11, 15) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 6) (16, 5) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 1) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 19) (12, 2) (12, 15) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 13) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 15) (1, 5) (1, 18) (1, 16) (6, 7) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 15) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Let's first sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes with their degrees:
0: 4
1: 3
2: 4
3: 4
4: 4
5: 4
6: 2
7: 3
8: 2
9: 2
10: 2
11: 1
12: 2
13: 5
14: 3
15: 4
16: 4
17: 4
18: 3
19: 5

Now, let's proceed with counting the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 10]

<0, 1, 18>
<0, 8, 13>
<0, 7, 16>
<1, 5, 16>
<2, 4, 19>
<3, 9, 13>
<3, 13, 16>
<4, 14, 15>
<13, 17, 19>
<15, 18, 19>
