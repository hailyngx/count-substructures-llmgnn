Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 12) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The graph nodes and connections can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: (5, 8), (5, 12), (5, 4), (5, 10), (9, 8), (9, 11), (9, 13), (9, 12), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 11), (4, 3), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 13), (7, 1), (10, 5), (10, 11), (10, 6), (10, 2), (11, 9), (11, 4), (11, 10), (11, 14), (11, 6), (2, 10), (2, 8), (2, 1), (2, 3), (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 2), (8, 14), (8, 6), (0, 3), (0, 13), (14, 11), (14, 8), (14, 3), (14, 13), (12, 5), (12, 9), (12, 4), (12, 1), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 2), (3, 0), (3, 14), (1, 7), (1, 2), (1, 12), (6, 10), (6, 11), (6, 8), (13, 9), (13, 7), (13, 0), (13, 14)

Next, we need to sort the nodes by their number of connections:

Nodes in increasing order of connections:
0: 2 connections
1: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
12: 4 connections
13: 4 connections
14: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
7: 4 connections
10: 4 connections
3: 5 connections
9: 5 connections
8: 5 connections
4: 6 connections
11: 6 connections
5: 6 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
The total number of triangles is [10].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 13, 14>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 13>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 12, 2>
<1, 12, 4>
<2, 8, 14>
<3, 7, 13>
<4, 11, 6>
<5, 8, 10>
