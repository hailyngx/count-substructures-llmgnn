Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 1) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 12) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2)
(1, 4) (1, 8)
(2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 0) (2, 4)
(3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13)
(4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 1)
(5, 6) (5, 12)
(6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12)
(7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 13)
(8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 1) (8, 12)
(9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3)
(10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8)
(11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12)
(12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0)
(13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 14)
(14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Degree-Based Ordering: 
0 (Degree 4) -> 14 (Degree 5) -> 5 (Degree 2) -> 8 (Degree 5) -> 1 (Degree 2) -> 10 (Degree 4) -> 11 (Degree 4) -> 12 (Degree 5) -> 2 (Degree 4) -> 3 (Degree 4) -> 6 (Degree 6) -> 13 (Degree 3) -> 7 (Degree 4) -> 9 (Degree 3) -> 4 (Degree 5)

Triangles: [45]
Unique Triangles: <0, 10, 2>, <0, 10, 12>, <0, 10, 14>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 14>, <0, 12, 5>, <0, 12, 10>, <0, 14, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 14>, <2, 6, 12>, <2, 6, 14>, <3, 6, 13>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 11>, <4, 7, 13>, <4, 8, 12>, <4, 8, 1>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 12>, <6, 10, 11>, <6, 10, 12>, <6, 12, 11>, <7, 11, 13>, <8, 10, 12>, <8, 10, 4>, <8, 12, 5>, <8, 12, 11>, <9, 6, 3>, <10, 11, 14>, <11, 12, 8>, <11, 14, 13>, <12, 0, 2>, <12, 0, 5>, <12, 0, 10>, <12, 0, 14>, <12, 5, 6>, <12, 8, 4>, <12, 8, 10>, <13, 7, 3>, <13, 14, 4>, <14, 0, 2>, <14, 0, 4>, <14, 0, 13>, <14, 2, 4>, <14, 2, 13>
