Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 19) (14, 8) (14, 16) (14, 13) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 18) (4, 16) (7, 3) (7, 6) (19, 5) (19, 9) (19, 1) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 16) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (6, 7) (15, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (1, 5) (1, 19) (1, 10) (1, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 13) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 18) (12, 17) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 0) (18, 17) (18, 11) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 4) (16, 8) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 0) (2, 17) (2, 10) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: {1, 5, 11, 12, 13}
- 1: {0, 5, 10, 19}
- 2: {10, 17}
- 3: {5, 7, 10, 12, 13}
- 4: {8, 16}
- 5: {0, 1, 3, 19}
- 6: {7}
- 7: {3, 6}
- 8: {4, 14, 16, 17}
- 9: {11, 16, 19}
- 10: {1, 2, 3}
- 11: {0, 9, 18}
- 12: {0, 3, 15, 17}
- 13: {0, 3, 14}
- 14: {8, 13, 16}
- 15: {12}
- 16: {4, 8, 9, 14}
- 17: {2, 8, 12, 18}
- 18: {11, 17}
- 19: {1, 5, 9}

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The vertices sorted by their number of connections (degree):
0(5) < 2(2), 6(1), 15(1), 18(2), > 7(2), 4(1), 14(3), 10(3), 16(4), 12(4), > 3(5), 1(4), 17(4), 11(3), 8(4), 9(3), 19(3), 5(4), 13(3), 0(5)

Calculating the number of triangles, we get:
[Number of triangles]: [16]

Triangles found:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 19>, <0, 3, 12>, <0, 3, 13>, <1, 5, 19>, <3, 12, 17>, <3, 12, 0>, <3, 12, 15>, <3, 12, 17>, <3, 13, 14>, <3, 13, 14>, <3, 13, 0>, <8, 14, 16>, <8, 14, 13>, <8, 14, 16>, <8, 16, 14>
