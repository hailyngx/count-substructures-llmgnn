Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 11) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 0) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 12) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us efficiently count the number of triangles in the graph. Let's go through the steps:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 1: 5 edges
Node 2: 4 edges
Node 7: 3 edges
Node 8: 2 edges
Node 9: 3 edges
Node 0: 4 edges
Node 10: 3 edges
Node 6: 4 edges
Node 12: 4 edges
Node 11: 4 edges
Node 4: 4 edges
Node 13: 5 edges
Node 3: 6 edges
Node 14: 5 edges
Node 5: 5 edges

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we will start from the vertices with lower degrees.

Starting with Node 8 (2 edges):
- No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

Moving on to Node 7 (3 edges):
- Shared connections with Node 5 and Node 4 form a triangle: <4, 5, 7>.

Next, Node 9 (3 edges):
- Shared connections with Node 10 and Node 11 form two triangles: <9, 10, 11> and <9, 10, 13>.

Then, Node 10 (3 edges):
- Shared connections with Node 9 and Node 13 form one triangle: <9, 10, 13>.

After Node 10, we continue to the nodes with more connections:
Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 6, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 3, Node 14, Node 5, and Node 1.

Finally, we count the total number of triangles found:
Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <4, 5, 7>, <9, 10, 11>, <9, 10, 13>, <4, 5, 12>.
