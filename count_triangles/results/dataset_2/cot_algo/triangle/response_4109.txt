Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 0) (9, 28) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 16) (26, 8) (13, 22) (13, 29) (13, 20) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 20) (22, 17) (2, 14) (2, 21) (2, 11) (29, 13) (29, 17) (29, 25) (0, 9) (0, 5) (27, 4) (27, 18) (27, 7) (27, 5) (20, 13) (20, 22) (20, 25) (20, 17) (25, 29) (25, 20) (25, 1) (25, 24) (17, 22) (17, 29) (17, 20) (17, 19) (17, 7) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 18) (28, 9) (28, 26) (4, 22) (4, 27) (4, 19) (4, 21) (3, 16) (21, 2) (21, 4) (21, 23) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 16) (10, 14) (15, 10) (15, 12) (5, 0) (5, 27) (5, 10) (5, 19) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 5) (14, 26) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 10) (1, 25) (1, 6) (1, 23) (6, 1) (8, 26) (8, 24) (8, 18) (23, 21) (23, 1) (23, 24) (24, 25) (24, 8) (24, 23) (7, 27) (7, 17) (18, 27) (18, 11) (18, 8) (16, 26) (16, 3) (16, 10) (12, 15) 

Response:
The graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. To count the number of triangles, we will first sort the vertices by their degree:

Node 6 has a degree of 1.
Nodes 0, 12, 3, 9, and 30 have a degree of 2.
Nodes 1, 7, 8, 24, and 25 have a degree of 3.
Nodes 4, 5, 10, 11, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29 have a degree of 4.
Nodes 2, 13, 16, and 17 have a degree of 5.

Next, we will relabel the nodes according to their degrees.

Node 6 -> 1
Nodes 0, 12, 3, 9, 30 -> 2
Nodes 1, 7, 8, 24, 25 -> 3
Nodes 4, 5, 10, 11, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29 -> 4
Nodes 2, 13, 16, 17 -> 5

Now, we will examine each edge starting with the ones where the lower relabeled node has fewer connections:

Edges between nodes (0, 9), (0, 5), (3, 16), (1, 6), (8, 18), (12, 15), (6, 1), and (7, 17) do not create triangles.

For the remaining edges:

Triangles: 
<2, 9, 28>
<2, 5, 27>
<2, 9, 28>
<4, 22, 20>
<4, 22, 17>
<4, 22, 13>
<4, 22, 20>
<4, 22, 17>
<4, 22, 13>
<4, 27, 5>
<4, 27, 17>
<4, 27, 19>
<4, 21, 23>
<4, 21, 2>
<4, 21, 14>
<4, 19, 5>
<4, 19, 27>
<4, 19, 17>
<5, 10, 14>
<5, 10, 16>
<5, 27, 4>
<16, 3, 26>
<16, 3, 10>
<16, 26, 14>
<16, 26, 28>
<16, 10, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [25].
