Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges is as follows: 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 0), (5, 3), (9, 4), (9, 1), (6, 7), (6, 0), (4, 8), (4, 0), (8, 7), (8, 3), (8, 1), (2, 8), (2, 3), (0, 6), (0, 4), (0, 3), (7, 1)

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
0 -> 4
1 -> 4
2 -> 3
3 -> 5
4 -> 4
5 -> 6
6 -> 4
7 -> 3
8 -> 4
9 -> 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's count the triangles:

Triangles:
<5, 9, 1>
<5, 9, 4>

Total number of triangles: [2]
