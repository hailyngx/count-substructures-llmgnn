Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first sort the vertices by their number of connections (degree) in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:

- Node 28 - degree 1
- Node 20 - degree 1
- Node 15 - degree 1
- Node 13 - degree 1
- Node 6 - degree 2
- Node 10 - degree 2
- Node 5 - degree 2
- Node 7 - degree 3
- Node 3 - degree 3
- Node 19 - degree 4
- Node 12 - degree 4
- Node 29 - degree 4
- Node 23 - degree 4
- Node 4 - degree 4
- Node 21 - degree 4
- Node 18 - degree 4
- Node 22 - degree 4
- Node 1 - degree 4
- Node 8 - degree 5
- Node 25 - degree 5
- Node 11 - degree 5
- Node 26 - degree 5
- Node 27 - degree 5
- Node 0 - degree 6
- Node 16 - degree 6
- Node 2 - degree 6
- Node 9 - degree 6
- Node 17 - degree 6
- Node 24 - degree 6

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
