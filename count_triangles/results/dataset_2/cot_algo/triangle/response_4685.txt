Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes and their connections are as follows based on the given edges:

0: 1, 3, 5, 8
1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6
2: 1, 3, 8, 9
3: 0, 1, 2
4: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
5: 0, 1, 4, 9
6: 1, 4, 8, 9
7: 4, 8
8: 0, 2, 4, 7
9: 2, 4, 5, 6

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Labeling vertices from least to most connections:
0 (degree 4) < 3 (degree 4) < 7 (degree 2) < 2 (degree 4) < 8 (degree 4) < 6 (degree 4) < 1 (degree 5) < 9 (degree 4) < 5 (degree 4) < 4 (degree 5)

Finding triangles:

Triangles: [<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 3, 1>, <0, 3, 2>, <0, 8, 2>, <0, 8, 4>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 2>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 6, 4>, <2, 8, 4>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 6>]

Total number of triangles: [15]
