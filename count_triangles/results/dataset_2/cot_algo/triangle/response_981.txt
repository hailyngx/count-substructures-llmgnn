Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 19) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 18) (4, 14) (18, 4) (18, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 17) (0, 2) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 15) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 8) (11, 7) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 4) (12, 1) (12, 15) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 13) (6, 18) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 13) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 6) (17, 15) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 13) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 10) (15, 16) (15, 12) (15, 7) (15, 17) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 19) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 20 nodes and the given 60 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(5, 17) (5, 16) (5, 14) 
(9, 8) (9, 19) 
(1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 12) 
(3, 7) (3, 8) 
(4, 18) (4, 14) (18, 4) (18, 6) 
(8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 17) 
(0, 2) 
(16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 15) 
(10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 2) 
(11, 8) (11, 7) 
(12, 1) (12, 15) 
(7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 13) 
(6, 18) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 13) 
(17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 6) (17, 15) 
(19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 13) 
(2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 10) 
(15, 16) (15, 12) (15, 7) (15, 17) 
(13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 19) 

Next, let's order the nodes based on their degrees from least to most connections:

Nodes in order: 0, 12, 9, 11, 4, 3, 10, 18, 19, 5, 16, 6, 1, 2, 15, 14, 13, 8, 17, 7

Now, we will count the triangles:
Triangles: [39]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 16>
<0, 2, 10>
<0, 2, 15>
<9, 8, 17>
<4, 14, 1>
<18, 4, 14>
<18, 4, 6>
<10, 13, 7>
<11, 8, 17>
<12, 15, 7>
<2, 10, 13>
<15, 7, 6>
<15, 7, 17>
<6, 13, 19>
<6, 7, 13>
<17, 8, 3>
<17, 8, 11>
<17, 6, 7>
<17, 15, 16>
<17, 15, 12>
<17, 15, 7>
