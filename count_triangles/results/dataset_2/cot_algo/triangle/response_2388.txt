Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 11) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. The sorted vertices are labeled accordingly. 

After relabeling the vertices, we can list the edges based on the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections. 

1. Vertex 0: Degree 3
2. Vertex 13: Degree 3
3. Vertex 9: Degree 2
4. Vertex 12: Degree 2
5. Vertex 8: Degree 4
6. Vertex 4: Degree 4
7. Vertex 2: Degree 5
8. Vertex 3: Degree 5
9. Vertex 1: Degree 5
10. Vertex 7: Degree 5
11. Vertex 10: Degree 5
12. Vertex 14: Degree 6
13. Vertex 6: Degree 6
14. Vertex 11: Degree 7
15. Vertex 5: Degree 7

Based on the degrees and the order, we now list the edges: 

(9, 4) (12, 8) (9, 11) (12, 7) (13, 8) 

Next, we check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to find the triangles: 

1. Triangle: <9, 11, 4>
2. Triangle: <12, 8, 13>

Counting the unique triangles found, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
