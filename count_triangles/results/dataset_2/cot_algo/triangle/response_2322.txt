Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 22) (15, 12) (15, 28) (27, 2) (27, 3) (7, 21) (7, 14) (7, 26) (7, 8) (21, 7) (21, 9) (20, 25) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 0) (10, 17) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 26) (17, 11) (1, 26) (1, 22) (26, 7) (26, 17) (26, 1) (26, 16) (26, 0) (28, 15) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 12) (28, 5) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 22) (29, 18) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 22) (6, 12) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 22) (13, 25) (13, 5) (13, 24) (24, 6) (24, 13) (24, 18) (11, 20) (11, 17) (11, 18) (14, 7) (14, 12) (9, 21) (18, 29) (18, 24) (18, 11) (2, 27) (2, 19) (2, 0) (23, 10) (23, 19) (8, 7) (8, 20) (12, 15) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 14) (4, 16) (19, 29) (19, 2) (19, 23) (0, 25) (0, 17) (0, 26) (0, 2) (3, 27) (3, 20) (22, 15) (22, 1) (22, 29) (22, 6) (22, 5) (16, 26) (16, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. 

Given the sorted vertices based on their degrees: 
Vertex 27 has degree 2.
Vertex 7 has degree 4.
Vertex 21 has degree 4.
Vertex 20 has degree 4.
Vertex 25 has degree 4.
Vertex 10 has degree 4.
Vertex 1 has degree 4.
Vertex 28 has degree 5.
Vertex 29 has degree 5.
Vertex 6 has degree 5.
Vertex 5 has degree 5.
Vertex 13 has degree 5.
Vertex 24 has degree 5.
Vertex 11 has degree 5.
Vertex 14 has degree 5.
Vertex 9 has degree 5.
Vertex 18 has degree 5.
Vertex 2 has degree 5.
Vertex 23 has degree 5.
Vertex 8 has degree 5.
Vertex 12 has degree 5.
Vertex 19 has degree 5.
Vertex 0 has degree 6.
Vertex 3 has degree 6.
Vertex 22 has degree 6.
Vertex 26 has degree 6.
Vertex 4 has degree 2.
Vertex 16 has degree 2.

Now, we can count the number of triangles.

Total number of triangles: [50]
