Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 8) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 4) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 19) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 19) (8, 18) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 18) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 0) (1, 14) (1, 10) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 13) (9, 2) (9, 10) (0, 18) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 15) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 4) (13, 3) (13, 16) (13, 15) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 15) (15, 14) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Here is the list of vertices with their degrees in increasing order:
(0: 1) (18: 2) (19: 2) (1: 2) (9: 3) (5: 4) (6: 4) (7: 4) (16: 4) (17: 4) (2: 4) (11: 4) (12: 5) (3: 5) (8: 5) (13: 5) (15: 5) (4: 6) (14: 6) (10: 6)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 10]
<0, 18, 8> 
<0, 18, 19> 
<0, 19, 18> 
<2, 9, 10> 
<2, 9, 4> 
<2, 13, 15> 
<5, 6, 4> 
<7, 16, 3> 
<11, 12, 8> 
<13, 15, 4>
