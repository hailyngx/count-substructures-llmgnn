Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: {9, 4, 8, 5}
- 1: {9, 3, 5}
- 2: {9, 3, 4, 8, 7}
- 3: {6, 1, 2, 8}
- 4: {8, 5, 0, 2}
- 5: {6, 1, 4, 0}
- 6: {5, 7, 3}
- 7: {6, 9, 8, 2}
- 8: {3, 4, 2, 0, 7}
- 9: {2, 1, 7, 0}

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 4 with degree 4
- Node 1 with degree 3
- Node 5 with degree 4
- Node 3 with degree 4
- Node 0 with degree 4
- Node 2 with degree 5
- Node 6 with degree 3
- Node 7 with degree 4
- Node 8 with degree 5
- Node 9 with degree 4

With the sorted nodes, we analyze each edge while following the condition of lower label node having fewer connections:
- Skipping: (6, 5)
- Skipping: (6, 7)
- Skipping: (6, 3)
- Skipping: (9, 2)
- Valid: (9, 1) forms the triangle <1, 9, 2>
- Skipping: (9, 0)
- Valid: (1, 3) forms the triangle <1, 3, 2>
- Valid: (1, 5) forms the triangle <1, 5, 0>
- Skipping: (3, 6)
- Valid: (3, 1) forms the triangle <1, 3, 2>
- Skipping: (3, 2)
- Skipping: (3, 8)
- Skipping: (4, 8)
- Valid: (4, 0) forms the triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Valid: (4, 5) forms the triangle <4, 5, 0>
- Skipping: (4, 2)
- Skipping: (8, 3)
- Skipping: (8, 4)
- Skipping: (8, 2)
- Skipping: (8, 0)
- Valid: (8, 7) forms the triangle <7, 8, 2>
- Skipping: (5, 6)
- Valid: (5, 1) forms the triangle <1, 5, 0>

- Skipping: (2, 9)
- Skipping: (2, 3)
- Skipping: (2, 4)
- Skipping: (2, 8)
- Skipping: (2, 7)
- Skipping: (0, 9)
- Valid: (0, 4) forms the triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Skipping: (0, 8)
- Skipping: (0, 5)
- Skipping: (7, 6)
- Skipping: (7, 9)
- Skipping: (7, 8)
- Skipping: (7, 2)

Count of triangles: [5]
Triangles found: <1, 9, 2>, <1, 3, 2>, <1, 5, 0>, <0, 4, 5>, <7, 8, 2>
