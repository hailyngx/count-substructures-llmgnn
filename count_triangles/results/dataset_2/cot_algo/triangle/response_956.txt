Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 0) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 7) (17, 16) (17, 11) (17, 7) (4, 19) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 15) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 18) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 19) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 9) (11, 17) (11, 3) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 7) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 5) (18, 0) (18, 14) (1, 6) (1, 13) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 2) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 15) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 2) (13, 6) (13, 1) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 5) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree would be: 

Node 10: degree 1
Node 8: degree 1
Node 2: degree 2
Node 18: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 16: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 15: degree 4
Node 19: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 17: degree 5
Node 5: degree 5
Node 11: degree 5
Node 9: degree 6
Node 7: degree 6

Now, let's count the triangles:

After checking all the edges, the total number of triangles found is [8].

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 16, 17>
<2, 15, 16>
<2, 15, 3>
<2, 15, 4>
<18, 0, 14>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 9>
<14, 4, 19>
