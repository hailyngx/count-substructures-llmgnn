Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections, relabeling them, and counting the triangles by checking for shared connections between the vertices. Let's construct the graph and find the number of triangles.

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

To count the triangles, we'll consider the edges following the method mentioned earlier.

The total number of triangles found is [10].

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
