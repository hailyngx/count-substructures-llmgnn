Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 12) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 27) (21, 7) (21, 13) (21, 12) (21, 14) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 28) (25, 23) (25, 10) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 11) (23, 25) (23, 29) (23, 10) (2, 18) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 9) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 12) (12, 15) (12, 7) (12, 21) (12, 18) (28, 3) (28, 20) (28, 26) (26, 20) (26, 28) (26, 4) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 16) (13, 21) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 9) (17, 20) (17, 13) (17, 6) (22, 2) (22, 16) (0, 9) (10, 25) (10, 8) (10, 23) (6, 17) (6, 24) (6, 19) (24, 7) (24, 6) (24, 1) (14, 15) (14, 21) (14, 1) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 27) (19, 6) (19, 29) (29, 8) (29, 23) (29, 19) (1, 24) (1, 14) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 22) (16, 4) (27, 7) (27, 9) (11, 8) (4, 3) (4, 26) (4, 16) 

Response:
The graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, ..., 29}

Edges:
(3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 4) 
(15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 12) 
(7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 27) 
(21, 7) (21, 13) (21, 12) (21, 14) 
(20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 28) 
(25, 23) (25, 10) 
(8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 11) 
...

Now, let's determine the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort nodes by their degree:
Node 9: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4
Node 24: degree 4
...

2. Relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 9 -> A
Node 16 -> B
Node 24 -> C
...

3. Check for triangles:
Triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 14, 24>
<2, 13, 21>
...

[Total number of triangles: 25]
