Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 18) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 12) (3, 18) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 2) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 15) (0, 8) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 4) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 16) (12, 1) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 12) (16, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 19) (17, 11) (15, 5) (19, 3) (19, 2) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 4) (18, 13) (18, 3) (18, 14) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 14) (1, 12) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: 
(0, 8), (0, 10),
(1, 12),
(2, 5), (2, 11), (2, 19),
(3, 11), (3, 12), (3, 18), (3, 19),
(4, 10), (4, 14), (4, 16),
(5, 2), (5, 13), (5, 15),
(6, 9), (6, 11), (6, 14),
(7, 11), (7, 14),
(8, 0), (8, 10), (8, 13), (8, 16),
(9, 6), (9, 10), (9, 16),
(10, 0), (10, 4), (10, 8), (10, 9),
(11, 2), (11, 3), (11, 6), (11, 7), (11, 17),
(12, 1), (12, 3), (12, 13), (12, 16),
(13, 5), (13, 8), (13, 12), (13, 18),
(14, 4), (14, 6), (14, 7), (14, 18),
(15, 5),
(16, 4), (16, 8), (16, 12),
(17, 11),
(18, 3), (18, 13), (18, 14),
(19, 2), (19, 3)

Now, we will label the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 15: Degree 1
Node 1, 7, 17, 18: Degree 2
Node 0, 1, 9, 17: Degree 3
Node 4, 5, 7, 15, 19: Degree 4
Node 8, 14, 16: Degree 5
Node 2, 3, 12, 13, 18: Degree 5
Node 6, 10, 11: Degree 5

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Number of triangles: [16]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 8, 10>, 
<2, 11, 3>, 
<2, 11, 5>, 
<3, 12, 18>, 
<4, 10, 8>, 
<5, 13, 2>, 
<5, 13, 15>, 
<6, 9, 11>, 
<8, 10, 4>, 
<8, 13, 5>, 
<8, 16, 4>, 
<11, 17, 7>, 
<12, 16, 4>, 
<13, 18, 3>, 
<14, 4, 16>, 
<14, 18, 3>
