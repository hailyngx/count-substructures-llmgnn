Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 28) (2, 15) (2, 29) (2, 26) (2, 13) (29, 2) (29, 16) (28, 9) (28, 18) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 21) (12, 14) (12, 22) (26, 2) (26, 25) (26, 11) (1, 7) (1, 25) (1, 14) (1, 24) (16, 29) (16, 10) (8, 9) (8, 18) (10, 16) (10, 21) (10, 22) (10, 25) (21, 12) (21, 10) (21, 4) (21, 5) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 10) (25, 27) (27, 25) (27, 11) (27, 5) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 1) (0, 11) (0, 23) (13, 6) (13, 2) (11, 26) (11, 27) (11, 0) (19, 17) (19, 20) (24, 1) (24, 23) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 21) (20, 19) (20, 23) (22, 12) (22, 10) (22, 17) (17, 19) (17, 22) (17, 18) (23, 0) (23, 24) (23, 20) (18, 28) (18, 8) (18, 17) (5, 7) (5, 21) (5, 27) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The Degree-Based Ordering is as follows:
`Node: Total Edges (Degree)`

0: 2 (2)
11: 4 (3)
19: 2 (2)
20: 2 (2)
23: 3 (3)
27: 3 (3)
1: 4 (4)
24: 2 (2)
2: 4 (4)
29: 2 (2)
26: 3 (3)
25: 4 (4)
10: 4 (4)
16: 2 (2)
5: 3 (3)
7: 3 (3)
21: 4 (4)
12: 5 (5)
14: 3 (3)
6: 4 (4)
13: 2 (2)
4: 3 (3)
9: 5 (5)
28: 2 (2)
3: 4 (4)
8: 3 (3)
17: 3 (3)
22: 3 (3)
18: 3 (3)
15: 2 (2)

Based on Degree-Based Ordering, we will traverse the edges to count the triangles.

Total number of triangles: [16]
