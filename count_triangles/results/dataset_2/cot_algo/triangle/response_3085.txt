Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 24) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 13) (9, 23) (9, 12) (18, 22) (18, 23) (18, 6) (22, 18) (22, 10) (22, 29) (22, 3) (7, 25) (21, 0) (21, 11) (10, 22) (10, 24) (10, 20) (10, 29) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 19) (0, 21) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 12) (20, 10) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 14) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 11) (28, 0) (28, 29) (29, 22) (29, 10) (29, 0) (29, 28) (29, 26) (4, 19) (8, 11) (8, 1) (1, 17) (1, 8) (6, 18) (6, 23) (6, 26) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 13) (25, 7) (25, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 14) (27, 20) (27, 3) (11, 21) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 25) (14, 20) (14, 13) (15, 5) (15, 26) (26, 29) (26, 6) (26, 15) (26, 2) (26, 16) (23, 9) (23, 18) (23, 6) (16, 17) (16, 26) (16, 3) (2, 26) (2, 24) (3, 22) (3, 27) (3, 16) (24, 5) (24, 10) (24, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections they have:

- Node 7 has 1 connection
- Node 4 has 1 connection
- Node 8 has 2 connections
- Node 21 has 2 connections
- Node 18 has 3 connections
- Node 25 has 2 connections
- Node 17 has 4 connections
- Node 6 has 3 connections
- Node 14 has 2 connections
- Node 5 has 3 connections
- Node 15 has 2 connections
- Node 9 has 4 connections
- Node 13 has 4 connections
- Node 12 has 3 connections
- Node 28 has 2 connections
- Node 19 has 4 connections
- Node 27 has 2 connections
- Node 1 has 3 connections
- Node 10 has 4 connections
- Node 22 has 4 connections
- Node 2 has 2 connections
- Node 3 has 3 connections
- Node 20 has 4 connections
- Node 29 has 5 connections
- Node 26 has 5 connections
- Node 11 has 4 connections
- Node 16 has 3 connections
- Node 0 has 5 connections

Now, we will only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- (7, 25) - Both have fewer connections, no triangle.
- (4, 19) - Both have fewer connections, no triangle.
- (8, 11) - Both have fewer connections, no triangle.
- (21, 0) - Both have fewer connections, no triangle.
- (18, 22) - Both have the same number of connections, no triangle.
- (25, 11) - Both have fewer connections, no triangle.
- (17, 1) - Both have the same number of connections, no triangle.
- (6, 18) - Both have the same number of connections, no triangle.
- (14, 20) - Both have the same number of connections, no triangle.
- (5, 9) - Both have fewer connections, no triangle.
- (15, 26) - Both have fewer connections, no triangle.
- (9, 13) - Both have the same number of connections, no triangle.
- (13, 19) - Both have the same number of connections, no triangle.
- (12, 9) - Both have fewer connections, no triangle.
- (28, 29) - Both have the same number of connections, no triangle.
- (19, 17) - Both have the same number of connections, no triangle.
- (27, 20) - Both have fewer connections, no triangle.
- (1, 8) - Both have fewer connections, no triangle.
- (10, 22) - Both have the same number of connections, no triangle.
- (22, 18) - Both have the same number of connections, no triangle.
- (2, 24) - Both have fewer connections, no triangle.
- (3, 16) - Both have fewer connections, no triangle.
- (7, 25) - Both have fewer connections, no triangle.
- (26, 29) - Both have the same number of connections, no triangle.
- (23, 9) - Both have fewer connections, no triangle.
- (16, 17) - Both have the same number of connections, no triangle.
- (2, 26) - Both have fewer connections, no triangle.
- (3, 27) - Both have few connections, no triangle.
  
Now, let's calculate the total number of triangles: 
[3] 

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 12, 21>, <1, 8, 17>, <1, 8, 11>, <3, 16, 26>
