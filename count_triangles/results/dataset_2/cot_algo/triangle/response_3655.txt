Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The constructed graph with nodes and edges is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: 6, 7, 8, 9
- 1: 2, 4, 9
- 2: 1, 8, 9
- 3: 0, 4, 7, 8
- 4: 1, 3, 5, 6
- 5: 4, 7, 8, 9
- 6: 0, 4, 7
- 7: 0, 3, 5, 6
- 8: 0, 2, 3, 5, 9
- 9: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: <0, 8, 9>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
