Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 5) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their degrees:

1. Node 1 has degree 3
2. Node 7 has degree 3
3. Node 12 has degree 3
4. Node 0 has degree 3
5. Node 14 has degree 4
6. Node 8 has degree 4
7. Node 4 has degree 4
8. Node 10 has degree 4
9. Node 2 has degree 4
10. Node 5 has degree 5
11. Node 11 has degree 5
12. Node 3 has degree 5
13. Node 6 has degree 6
14. Node 13 has degree 6
15. Node 9 has degree 6

Based on the degrees, the ordering is as follows:
1. Node 1
2. Node 7
3. Node 12
4. Node 0
5. Node 14
6. Node 8
7. Node 4
8. Node 10
9. Node 2
10. Node 5
11. Node 11
12. Node 3
13. Node 6
14. Node 13
15. Node 9

Now, we will count the triangles by examining the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
1. Edge (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 have 6 connections. No triangles.
2. Edge (6, 14) - 6 has 6 connections, 14 has 4 connections. No triangles.
3. Edge (6, 3) - 6 has 6 connections, 3 has 5 connections. Triangle <3, 6, 14>.
4. Edge (6, 11) - 6 has 6 connections, 11 has 5 connections. Triangle <3, 6, 11>.
5. Edge (6, 13) - 6 has 6 connections, 13 has 6 connections. No triangles.
6. Edge (9, 10) - Both 9 and 10 have 4 connections. No triangles.
7. Edge (9, 13) - Both 9 and 13 have 6 connections. No triangles.
8. Edge (9, 0) - 9 has 6 connections, 0 has 3 connections. Triangle <0, 9, 12>.
9. Edge (1, 3) - Both 1 and 3 have 5 connections. No triangles.
10. Edge (1, 2) - Both 1 and 2 have 4 connections. No triangles.
11. Edge (1, 8) - 1 has 3 connections, 8 has 4 connections. No triangles.
12. Edge (3, 5) - 3 has 5 connections, 5 has 5 connections. Triangle <3, 5, 13>.
13. Edge (10, 7) - 10 has 4 connections, 7 has 3 connections. Triangle <7, 10, 2>.
14. Edge (2, 4) - Both 2 and 4 have 4 connections. No triangles.
15. Edge (8, 7) - 8 has 4 connections, 7 has 3 connections. No triangles.
16. Edge (0, 12) - 0 has 3 connections, 12 has 3 connections. No triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <3, 6, 14>, <3, 6, 11>, <0, 9, 12>, <3, 5, 13>, and <7, 10, 2>.
