Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's designate the nodes with their corresponding connections:  
Node 0: 5, 7, 9, 2, 8  
Node 1: 3, 2, 4, 8  
Node 2: 9, 1, 4, 0  
Node 3: 9, 1, 7  
Node 4: 9, 1, 6, 2  
Node 5: 6, 8, 0, 7  
Node 6: 5, 7, 4, 8  
Node 7: 5, 9, 3, 6  
Node 8: 5, 1, 6, 0  
Node 9: 4, 2, 3, 7, 0  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can generate the following unique triangles:  
<3, 1, 4>  
<3, 1, 9>  
<3, 7, 9>  
<1, 4, 2>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
