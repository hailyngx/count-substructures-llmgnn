Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to efficiently count the number of triangles in the given graph.

By sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 7 (Degree 5) - Label 0
Node 2 (Degree 4) - Label 1
Node 4 (Degree 3) - Label 2
Node 6 (Degree 3) - Label 3
Node 8 (Degree 4) - Label 4
Node 9 (Degree 4) - Label 5
Node 0 (Degree 5) - Label 6
Node 3 (Degree 6) - Label 7
Node 1 (Degree 7) - Label 8
Node 5 (Degree 4) - Label 9

Now, we will look at each edge to count the number of triangles. Only consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles is: [14]
The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 8>.
