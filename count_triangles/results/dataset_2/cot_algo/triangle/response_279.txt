Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 19) (10, 5) (17, 12) (17, 4) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 16) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 11) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 11) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 1) (8, 6) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 16) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 1) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 7) (16, 15) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 3) (3, 19) (3, 7) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 11) (15, 16) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 12) 

Response:
The vertices with their respective connections are as follows:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 4: 5 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 10: 3 connections
- Node 11: 4 connections
- Node 12: 4 connections
- Node 13: 3 connections
- Node 14: 2 connections
- Node 15: 4 connections
- Node 16: 4 connections
- Node 17: 2 connections
- Node 18: 3 connections
- Node 19: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabel them as follows:
- Node 8 (1 connection) → Node 0
- Node 3 (2 connections) → Node 1, and so on

The sorted edges considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections are:
- (8, 6) (3, 19) (17, 12) (14, 16) (17, 4) (6, 2) (14, 7) (10, 19) (17, 4) (12, 17) (17, 4) (13, 5) (10, 19) (6, 2) (7, 9) (19, 16) (9, 15) (17, 4) (13, 5) (15, 9) (7, 3) (6, 2)

Counting the triangles formed by the shared connections, we find the following unique triangles:
- <4, 17, 12>
- <5, 13, 2>
- <9, 15, 4>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
