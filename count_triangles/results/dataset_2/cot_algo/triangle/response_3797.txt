Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 21) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 29) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 2) (20, 1) (20, 25) (20, 7) (20, 18) (25, 20) (25, 15) (18, 22) (18, 20) (18, 8) (4, 8) (4, 27) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 4) (7, 11) (7, 20) (7, 12) (7, 27) (12, 7) (12, 15) (17, 11) (17, 29) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 6) (29, 26) (26, 29) (26, 28) (26, 24) (26, 14) (26, 0) (28, 26) (28, 27) (28, 24) (24, 26) (24, 28) (24, 21) (27, 4) (27, 7) (27, 28) (27, 21) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 5) (23, 10) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 6) (15, 25) (15, 12) (6, 29) (6, 23) (21, 22) (21, 24) (21, 27) (21, 14) (0, 10) (0, 26) (14, 26) (14, 23) (14, 21) (14, 16) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 9) (9, 2) (16, 3) (16, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. In this case, the sorted vertices are as follows:

Node 9: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 15: Degree 2
Node 12: Degree 2
Node 13: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 18: Degree 3
Node 19: Degree 2
Node 28: Degree 4
Node 20: Degree 4
Node 22: Degree 4
Node 14: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 17: Degree 4
Node 21: Degree 4
Node 16: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 23: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 29: Degree 4
Node 25: Degree 2
Node 24: Degree 3
Node 26: Degree 5
Node 11: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 27: Degree 4

Now, we will proceed with counting the triangles:

Triangles: [174]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 23>, <0, 3, 29>, <0, 6, 23>, <0, 6, 29>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 10, 23>, <2, 11, 23>, <2, 11, 14>, <3, 6, 23>, <3, 6, 29>, <3, 8, 18>, <4, 8, 27>, <5, 19, 2>, <6, 23, 14>, <7, 11, 17>, <7, 11, 20>, <7, 12, 15>, <7, 11, 20>, <8, 1, 3>, <14, 16, 3>, <14, 16, 23>, <16, 3, 14>, <21, 24, 26>, <21, 24, 27>, <24, 26, 14>, <24, 26, 28>, <26, 29, 3>, <27, 7, 21>
