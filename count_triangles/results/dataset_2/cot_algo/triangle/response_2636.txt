Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 14) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) 

Response:
The vertices and their degrees are as follows:
0: degree 4
3: degree 3
6: degree 2
9: degree 3
14: degree 2
5: degree 4
8: degree 4
13: degree 4
7: degree 6
4: degree 4
12: degree
1: degree 6
10: degree 5
11: degree 3
2: degree 5

The vertices sorted in ascending order of degrees are: 6, 14, 3, 9, 6, 14, 3, 9, 6, 14, 3, 9, 6, 14, 11, 6, 14, 11, 12 6, 14, 11, 12, 5, 8, 13, 5, 8, 13, 5, 8, 13, 5, 8, 13, 5, 10, 4, 1, 10, 4, 1, 10, 4, 1, 10, 4, 1, 10, 4, 1, 2, 7, 2

Therefore, the triangles and their count are:
[<0, 7, 5>, <0, 10, 4>, <0, 12, 4>, <0, 12, 1>, <3, 1, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 0>, <3, 12, 4>, <6, 5, 10>, <6, 10, 2>, <9, 1, 7>, <9, 11, 2>, <9, 11, 4>, <9, 2, 13>, <14, 5, 2>, <14, 12, 0>]
