Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 10) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 13) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 3) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 10) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 3) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 1) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph can be represented as follows:
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 11: 3 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 13: 2 connections
Node 14: 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we need to start counting triangles by processing edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections.

There are [37] triangles in the graph, and here are the unique triangles:
<0, 1, 10>
<0, 1, 12>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 10>
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 3, 12>
<0, 3, 14>
