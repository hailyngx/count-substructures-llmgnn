Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 16) (4, 7) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 16) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (10, 3) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 18) (16, 9) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 15) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 19) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 19) (17, 9) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 11) (1, 5) (1, 11) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 17) (11, 1) (11, 18) (2, 4) (2, 17) (19, 0) (19, 6) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 18) (14, 13) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 3) 

Response:
The graph has the following connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 12, 11, and 19.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 11.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 17.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 10, 6, 18.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 17, 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 12, 1.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 17, 3, 19.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 12, 16.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 16.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 15, 17, 16.
- Node 10 is connected to node 3.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 12, 0, 17, 1, 18.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 0, 11.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 16, 14.
- Node 14 is connected to node 13.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 9, 16, 18.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 8, 13, 15.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 6, 2, 11.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 15, 11, 3.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 0, 6.

After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, we get:
Nodes: 10, 14, 2, 18, 1, 3, 8, 13, 19, 0, 6, 5, 17, 4, 15, 7, 12, 11, 9, 16.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
- Triangle <1, 5, 11> (common neighbor: node 0).
- Triangle <1, 5, 12> (common neighbor: node 12).
- Triangle <1, 11, 17> (common neighbor: node 4).
- Triangle <3, 6, 18> (common neighbor: node 0).
- Triangle <11, 12, 17> (common neighbor: node 4).

Total number of triangles inside brackets []: [5]
