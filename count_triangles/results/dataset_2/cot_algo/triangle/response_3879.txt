Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 23) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 6) (0, 27) (0, 11) (0, 29) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 7) (27, 6) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 0) (11, 10) (11, 22) (11, 13) (11, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 19) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 25) (7, 27) (7, 18) (12, 14) (12, 9) (29, 17) (29, 0) (29, 6) (29, 25) (29, 24) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 26) (19, 22) (19, 1) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 21) (21, 26) (21, 28) (21, 2) (28, 21) (28, 2) (13, 11) (13, 26) (13, 3) (24, 29) (24, 26) (1, 19) (1, 15) (1, 18) (15, 1) (2, 21) (2, 28) (22, 11) (22, 19) (22, 20) (6, 17) (6, 27) (6, 29) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 5) (16, 14) (16, 5) (5, 3) (5, 16) (23, 14) (23, 0) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 20) (25, 8) (25, 29) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 1) (20, 22) (20, 9) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes: {1: 4, 20: 4, 2: 2, 15: 2, 28: 2, 16: 2, 5: 2, 12: 2, 17: 2, 7: 3, 18: 3, 10: 4, 3: 4, 13: 4, 21: 4, 24: 4, 26: 4, 11: 6, 8: 6, 4: 6, 19: 6, 22: 6, 29: 6, 6: 6, 25: 6, 0: 6, 9: 6, 27: 6, 14: 6, 23: 6}
