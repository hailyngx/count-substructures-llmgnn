Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 10) (6, 5) (6, 18) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 17) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 18) (4, 13) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 15) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 16) (1, 19) (17, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 15) (16, 8) (16, 1) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 12) (3, 2) (3, 13) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 15) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
The graph with nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (6, 18) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 4) (8, 16) (8, 17) (4, 18) (4, 13) (18, 15) (1, 14) (1, 16) (1, 19) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 19) (19, 15) (16, 15) (3, 14)

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degrees (from least to most connected):

Nodes with 1 connection: {11, 7, 17, 19, 12, 0, 3}
Nodes with 2 connections: {15, 16}
Nodes with 3 connections: {6, 13, 14}
Nodes with 4 connections: {1, 18}
Nodes with 5 connections: {2, 8}
Nodes with 6 connections: {5, 10}
Nodes with 7 connections: {9, 4}

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Using edges (5, 9): (5, 9) shares connection 10, so we form a triangle <5, 9, 10>.
2. Using edges (5, 6): No triangle formed.
3. Using edges (5, 12): No triangle formed.
4. Using edges (5, 1): No triangle formed.
5. Using edges (9, 8): No triangle formed.
6. Using edges (9, 4): No triangle formed.
7. Using edges (9, 10): No triangle formed.
8. Using edges (10, 11): No triangle formed.
9. Using edges (10, 13): No triangle formed.
10. Using edges (10, 2): No triangle formed.
11. Using edges (6, 18): No triangle formed.
12. Using edges (2, 3): No triangle formed.
13. Using edges (2, 18): No triangle formed.
14. Using edges (2, 4): No triangle formed.
15. Using edges (8, 16): No triangle formed.
16. Using edges (8, 17): No triangle formed.
17. Using edges (4, 18): No triangle formed.
18. Using edges (4, 13): No triangle formed.
19. Using edges (18, 15): No triangle formed.
20. Using edges (1, 14): No triangle formed.
21. Using edges (1, 16): No triangle formed.
22. Using edges (1, 19): No triangle formed.
23. Using edges (0, 7): No triangle formed.
24. Using edges (0, 12): No triangle formed.
25. Using edges (7, 19): No triangle formed.
26. Using edges (19, 15): No triangle formed.
27. Using edges (16, 15): No triangle formed.
28. Using edges (3, 14): No triangle formed.
