Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 12) (17, 15) (17, 11) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (8, 9) (8, 7) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 18) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 18) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (18, 12) (18, 0) (18, 5) (19, 13) (19, 2) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 5) (16, 1) (16, 4) (16, 5) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 16) (4, 6) (2, 14) (2, 10) (2, 19) (6, 11) (6, 4) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 16) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
- (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 15), (0, 18)
- (1, 3), (1, 12), (1, 16)
- (2, 10), (2, 14), (2, 19)
- (3, 14), (3, 9)
- (4, 6), (4, 9), (4, 14), (4, 16)
- (5, 12), (5, 15), (5, 16), (5, 18)
- (6, 11), (6, 4)
- (7, 8), (7, 12)
- (8, 9), (8, 7)
- (9, 3)
- (10, 11)
- (11, 17)
- (12, 1), (12, 5), (12, 7), (12, 17), (12, 18)
- (13, 19)
- (15, 0), (15, 5), (15, 17)
- (16, 1), (16, 4), (16, 5)
- (17, 11), (17, 12), (17, 15)
- (18, 0), (18, 5), (18, 12)
- (19, 2), (19, 13)

Next, we'll sort the nodes by their degree in ascending order and relabel them accordingly. 

New node ordering based on degree: {8, 13, 10, 6, 7, 16, 3, 4, 2, 9, 0, 1, 5, 11, 17, 15, 18, 12, 14, 19}

Now, we'll list the triangles by examining the edges and counting the triangles that can be formed by shared connections. 

After counting the triangles, we find that the total number of triangles is [21].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 16>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 15>, <0, 5, 15>, <1, 3, 12>, <1, 12, 17>, <3, 4, 16>, <4, 6, 11>, <4, 12, 17>, <5, 12, 18>, <5, 15, 17>, <7, 8, 9>, <10, 11, 17>, <12, 17, 18>, <12, 17, 15>, <12, 18, 0>, <12, 18, 5>, <12, 18, 15>, <13, 19, 2>, <15, 17, 18>
