Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 19) (0, 3) (0, 15) (2, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 9) (17, 5) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 7) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 16) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 9) (16, 19) (16, 6) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 1) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 16) (6, 15) (3, 0) (3, 18) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (14, 4) (14, 8) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 7) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 6) (5, 17) (5, 3) 

Response:
The graph with degree-based ordering is as follows:
Nodes: 0(3), 1(4), 2(1), 3(6), 4(3), 5(2), 6(4), 7(4), 8(4), 9(3), 10(2), 11(4), 12(4), 13(3), 14(2), 15(3), 16(2), 17(3), 18(4), 19(4)

The triangles found in the graph are:
<9, 17, 5>
<3, 0, 15>
<3, 5, 17>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 7, 13>
<4, 9, 17>
<8, 14, 4>
<8, 14, 9>
<16, 6, 15>
<16, 6, 8>
<16, 6, 1>
<16, 6, 19>
<16, 19, 8>
<17, 1, 11>
<17, 1, 6>
<17, 1, 12>
<17, 9, 4>
<17, 9, 7>
<18, 12, 2>
<18, 12, 1>
<18, 12, 10>
<19, 8, 14>
<19, 11, 10>
<19, 11, 7>

Thus, there are a total of [24] triangles in the given graph.
