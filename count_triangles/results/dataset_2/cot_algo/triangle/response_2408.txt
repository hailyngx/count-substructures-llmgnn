Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 29) (4, 15) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 11) (21, 25) (21, 29) (6, 15) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 27) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 1) (22, 11) (22, 24) (26, 13) (26, 20) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 15) (28, 16) (28, 14) (28, 23) (25, 7) (25, 21) (25, 11) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 1) (17, 12) (17, 23) (17, 2) (5, 19) (5, 10) (5, 27) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 0) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 27) (11, 7) (11, 22) (11, 25) (11, 2) (20, 26) (20, 27) (20, 10) (24, 8) (24, 22) (24, 23) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 11) (2, 14) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 19) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 16) (15, 18) (29, 4) (29, 21) (29, 16) (29, 19) (27, 13) (27, 5) (27, 3) (27, 20) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 20) (14, 28) (14, 18) (14, 2) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 18) (23, 28) (23, 17) (23, 24) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will now be used to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

The sorted vertices and their connections (degree) are as follows:
(2: 4), (5: 4), (6: 1), (9: 3), (10: 3), (18: 4), (28: 4), (0: 4), (3: 3), (7: 3), (11: 4), (12: 3), (13: 3), (15: 4), (16: 3), (19: 4), (20: 3), (21: 2), (22: 2), (24: 3), (25: 3), (27: 4), (1: 3), (4: 2), (8: 3), (14: 3), (17: 3), (23: 3), (26: 2), (29: 4)

Triangles found are:
[<0, 8, 13>, <0, 8, 24>, <0, 9, 19>, <0, 19, 23>, <2, 14, 18>, <2, 14, 28>, <2, 17, 23>, <2, 17, 24>, <3, 9, 10>, <3, 9, 27>, <3, 10, 20>, <3, 27, 5>, <4, 15, 16>, <5, 10, 20>, <11, 25, 29>, <13, 20, 27>, <14, 18, 28>]

The total number of triangles is:
[17]
