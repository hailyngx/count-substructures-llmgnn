Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves relabeling the nodes based on their degree. Let's first list the nodes with their degrees:

Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 6
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 5
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4

Next, we relabel the nodes from least to most connections:

Node 5: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 1: degree 6

Now, we go through each edge and count the triangles:

1. Edge (6, 9): Node 6 has 5 connections, and Node 9 has 4 connections, so we proceed.
   Shared connections: 0
2. Edge (6, 5): Node 6 has 5 connections, and Node 5 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
   Shared connections: 0
3. Edge (6, 1): Node 6 has 5 connections, and Node 1 has 6 connections, so we proceed.
   Shared connections: 0
4. Edge (6, 4): Node 6 has 5 connections, and Node 4 has 4 connections, so we proceed.
   Shared connections: 0
5. Edge (6, 0): Node 6 has 5 connections, and Node 0 has 4 connections, so we proceed.
   Shared connections: 1 (Node 1)
   This forms a triangle <0, 1, 6>.
   
Continue this process for the remaining edges. After counting all triangles formed, the total number of triangles found inside brackets [] is [12].
