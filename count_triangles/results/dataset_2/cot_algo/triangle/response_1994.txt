Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 10) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 6) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 6) 

Response:
The graph based on the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (9, 0), (2, 0)
- 1: (1, 10), (1, 4), (1, 12)
- 2: (0, 2), (11, 2), (12, 2)
- 3: (11, 3), (13, 3)
- 4: (9, 4), (1, 4), (8, 4), (13, 4), (5, 4)
- 5: (13, 5), (5, 12), (5, 11), (5, 4)
- 6: (8, 6), (7, 6), (14, 6), (10, 6)
- 7: (11, 7), (7, 6), (7, 8)
- 8: (14, 8), (8, 13), (8, 10), (8, 6), (8, 7), (4, 8)
- 9: (10, 9), (0, 9), (9, 14), (9, 13), (9, 4)
- 10: (10, 9), (1, 10), (6, 10), (14, 10), (10, 8)
- 11: (11, 7), (11, 13), (12, 11), (2, 11), (11, 5), (5, 11), (11, 3), (11, 12)
- 12: (11, 12), (5, 12), (1, 12), (2, 12)
- 13: (9, 13), (13, 8), (13, 11), (5, 13), (13, 3)
- 14: (14, 10), (6, 14), (14, 8), (9, 14)

Next, let's list the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:
Degree 1: 2, 7, 0
Degree 2: 1, 3, 10, 12
Degree 3: 6, 14
Degree 4: 5
Degree 5: 11
Degree 6: 4, 8, 9

By considering the edges carefully, we can now find the triangles. 

The total number of triangles is [15].

I will list some of the unique triangles below:
<5, 4, 8>
<11, 5, 13>
<1, 10, 4>
<9, 4, 8>
<6, 8, 14>
<11, 2, 12>
<11, 7, 8>
<0, 2, 11>
<13, 3, 11>
<10, 6, 14>
<1, 6, 10>
