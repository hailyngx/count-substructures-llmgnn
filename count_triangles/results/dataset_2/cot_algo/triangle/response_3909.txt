Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. First, sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):
   - Node 5 has 2 edges
   - Node 1 has 4 edges
   - Node 7 has 4 edges
   - Node 8 has 4 edges
   - Node 0 has 4 edges
   - Node 6 has 4 edges
   - Node 4 has 5 edges
   - Node 3 has 5 edges
   - Node 9 has 8 edges
   - Node 2 has 8 edges

2. Relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
   - Node 5 (Degree 2) -> Node 0
   - Node 1 (Degree 4) -> Node 1
   - Node 7 (Degree 4) -> Node 2
   - Node 8 (Degree 4) -> Node 3
   - Node 0 (Degree 4) -> Node 4
   - Node 6 (Degree 4) -> Node 5
   - Node 4 (Degree 5) -> Node 6
   - Node 3 (Degree 5) -> Node 7
   - Node 9 (Degree 8) -> Node 8
   - Node 2 (Degree 8) -> Node 9

3. List the edges with the lower labeled vertex coming first:

(0, 5) (4, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (0, 4) (6, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (4, 7) (6, 1) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 2) (2, 3) (4, 8) (7, 2) (4, 2) (8, 3) (4, 0) (9, 5) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (2, 9)        

4. Now we will count the triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 4>
<2, 8, 0>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 7, 4>
<3, 8, 4>

5. Finally, output the total number of triangles:
