Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. Let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices sorted by degree:
0(3) < 6(3) < 4(3) < 8(4) < 5(4) < 7(4) < 3(5) < 1(6) < 9(6) < 2(7)

Now, we will count the triangles by considering only the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

Total number of triangles: [12]  
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 3>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 0>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 3, 7>, <7, 8, 3>
