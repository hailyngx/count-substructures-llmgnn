Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 19) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 17) (12, 11) (12, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 16) (1, 5) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 14) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 5) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 10) (13, 0) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 15) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 15) (16, 1) (16, 13) (17, 4) (17, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 17) (19, 3) (19, 0) (19, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 19) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 13), (0, 19), (1, 5), (1, 11), (1, 14), (1, 16), (2, 9), (2, 11), (2, 14),
(3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 19), (4, 6), (4, 10), (4, 13), (4, 17), (5, 15),
(6, 13), (6, 19), (7, 8), (7, 11), (7, 15),
(8, 17), (9, 10),
(12, 13),
(13, 16)

Next, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices by degree (least to most):
16, 17, 18, 19, 0, 2, 7, 8, 12, 6, 9, 4, 14, 1, 5, 15, 10, 3, 13, 11

Now, we will re-label the nodes based on their degrees and proceed to count the triangles.
The total number of triangles inside brackets will be shown at the end.
