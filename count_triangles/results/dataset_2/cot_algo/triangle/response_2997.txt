Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 14) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with the given nodes and edges. Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted by their number of connections (degree):
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 11: 3 connections

Edges considered:
(0, 3): Forms a triangle <0, 3, 4>
(0, 4): Forms a triangle <0, 4, 3>
(0, 12): No triangles formed
(1, 3): No triangles formed
(1, 5): Forms a triangle <1, 5, 14>
(1, 7): Forms a triangle <1, 7, 5>
(1, 8): No triangles formed
(1, 14): No triangles formed
(2, 6): Forms a triangle <2, 6, 10>
(2, 9): No triangles formed
(2, 10): No triangles formed
(2, 14): No triangles formed
(3, 4): Forms a triangle <3, 4, 0>
(3, 5): No triangles formed
(3, 8): Forms a triangle <3, 8, 1>
(3, 1): No triangles formed
(4, 9): No triangles formed
(4, 12): Forms a triangle <4, 12, 0>
(4, 3): No triangles formed
(6, 7): Forms a triangle <6, 7, 2>
(6, 10): No triangles formed
(6, 14): No triangles formed
(6, 2): No triangles formed
(7, 9): No triangles formed

(8, 11): No triangles formed
(8, 6): No triangles formed
(8, 13): No triangles formed
(8, 1): No triangles formed
(9, 2): No triangles formed
(9, 7): No triangles formed
(9, 4): No triangles formed
(10, 13): No triangles formed
(10, 6): No triangles formed
(10, 2): No triangles formed
(10, 14): No triangles formed
(11, 12): No triangles formed
(11, 8): No triangles formed
(12, 0): No triangles formed
(12, 4): No triangles formed
(12, 11): No triangles formed
(13, 7): No triangles formed
(13, 10): No triangles formed
(14, 2): No triangles formed
(14, 5): No triangles formed
(14, 6): No triangles formed

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 4>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 7, 5>, <3, 4, 0>, <6, 7, 2>, <7, 5, 1>
