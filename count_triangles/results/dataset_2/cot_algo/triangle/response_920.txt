Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 20) (13, 0) (13, 27) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 11) (26, 4) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 29) (11, 26) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (6, 1) (6, 12) (21, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (15, 16) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 20) (19, 11) (19, 5) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 23) (25, 18) (27, 13) (27, 25) (27, 9) (27, 8) (16, 15) (16, 29) (16, 8) (2, 12) (2, 20) (2, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 29) (17, 9) (0, 13) (0, 8) (28, 22) (28, 23) (18, 11) (18, 25) (18, 23) (23, 25) (23, 28) (23, 18) (8, 27) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 29) (14, 8) (14, 22) (14, 7) (14, 10) (22, 28) (22, 14) (4, 26) (4, 2) (4, 9) (9, 3) (9, 27) (9, 17) (9, 4) (20, 13) (20, 5) (20, 2) (29, 3) (29, 16) (29, 12) (29, 8) (7, 5) (7, 14) (24, 12) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
- Sort vertices by their number of connections (degree) from least to most.
- Relabel the vertices accordingly: 
  - Node 16 has degree 2,
  - Node 17 has degree 1,  
  - Node 18 has degree 3,
  - Node 19 has degree 2,
  - Node 20 has degree 3,
  - Node 21 has degree 1,
  - Node 22 has degree 2,
  - Node 23 has degree 3,
  - Node 24 has degree 1,
  - Node 25 has degree 4,
  - Node 26 has degree 4,
  - Node 27 has degree 4,
  - Node 28 has degree 2,
  - Node 29 has degree 4,
  - Node 0 has degree 3,
  - Node 1 has degree 2,
  - Node 2 has degree 3,
  - Node 3 has degree 4,
  - Node 4 has degree 3,
  - Node 5 has degree 5,
  - Node 6 has degree 2,
  - Node 7 has degree 2,
  - Node 8 has degree 5,
  - Node 9 has degree 4,
  - Node 10 has degree 3,
  - Node 11 has degree 4,
  - Node 12 has degree 4,
  - Node 13 has degree 5,
  - Node 14 has degree 3,
- Process the edges based on the relabeled vertices and count the triangles.

After the analysis, the total number of triangles [] found in the graph is 11. The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<11, 19, 5>, <4, 9, 27>, <3, 5, 20>, <8, 14, 7>, <3, 11, 19>, <5, 7, 14>, <3, 9, 17>, <4, 9, 3>, <9, 27, 8>, <9, 4, 2>, <22, 28, 23>.
