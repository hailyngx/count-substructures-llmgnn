Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 15) (10, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (6, 17) (6, 12) (3, 16) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 4) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 2) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 18) (19, 15) (19, 2) (19, 4) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 18) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 9) (7, 11) (7, 16) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 13) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 9) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 12) (4, 11) (4, 19) (14, 5) (14, 12) (13, 10) (13, 9) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
(0, 8), (0, 16), (0, 17), (0, 18), 
(1, 5), (1, 11), (1, 12), 
(2, 3), (2, 12), (2, 15), (2, 19), 
(3, 16), 
(4, 11), (4, 12), (4, 19), 
(5, 1), (5, 14), 
(6, 12), (6, 17), 
(7, 11), (7, 16), 
(8, 0), (8, 16), (8, 18), 
(9, 13), (9, 15), (9, 16), (9, 18), 
(10, 13), (10, 15), 
(11, 1), (11, 4), (11, 7), 
(12, 1), (12, 2), (12, 4), (12, 6), (12, 14), 
(13, 9), (13, 10), 
(14, 5), (14, 12), 
(15, 2), (15, 9), (15, 10), (15, 19), 
(16, 0), (16, 3), (16, 7), (16, 8), (16, 9), 
(17, 0), (17, 6), (17, 12), 
(18, 0), (18, 8), (18, 9), 
(19, 2), (19, 4), (19, 15)

Now, let's label the nodes according to their degrees in increasing order.

Nodes by degree: 
Node 4 - Degree 2
Node 7 - Degree 2
Node 13 - Degree 2
Node 5 - Degree 2
Node 6 - Degree 2
Node 14 - Degree 2
Node 3 - Degree 3
Node 10 - Degree 3
Node 17 - Degree 3
Node 1 - Degree 3
Node 18 - Degree 3
Node 0 - Degree 4
Node 2 - Degree 4
Node 12 - Degree 5
Node 8 - Degree 3
Node 11 - Degree 3
Node 9 - Degree 4
Node 16 - Degree 5
Node 15 - Degree 4
Node 19 - Degree 4

Now, we will count the triangles and list the unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [21]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 8, 16>, <0, 8, 18>, <0, 16, 18>, 
<1, 5, 11>, <1, 11, 12>, 
<2, 3, 12>, <2, 3, 16>, <2, 12, 16>, <2, 15, 19>, 
<4, 11, 12>, <4, 11, 14>, <4, 12, 14>, 
<7, 11, 16>, 
<8, 9, 18>, <8, 16, 18>, 
<9, 13, 15>, <9, 13, 16>, <9, 15, 16>, 
<12, 14, 5>, <12, 14, 6>, 
<15, 9, 19>
