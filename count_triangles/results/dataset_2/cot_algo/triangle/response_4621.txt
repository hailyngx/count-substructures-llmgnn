Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 23) (5, 27) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 27) (9, 12) (2, 29) (2, 19) (29, 2) (29, 23) (29, 3) (29, 4) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 27) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 3) (26, 17) (19, 2) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 17) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 13) (28, 26) (28, 11) (28, 24) (4, 29) (4, 25) (27, 5) (27, 9) (27, 1) (27, 17) (6, 14) (6, 0) (21, 12) (21, 25) (21, 17) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 22) (8, 3) (23, 5) (23, 29) (23, 11) (23, 3) (12, 9) (12, 21) (12, 8) (12, 0) (18, 9) (18, 19) (7, 11) (7, 24) (17, 26) (17, 19) (17, 27) (17, 21) (14, 6) (14, 15) (25, 4) (25, 21) (25, 16) (25, 0) (3, 29) (3, 26) (3, 8) (3, 23) (20, 22) (20, 16) (24, 28) (24, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 16) (13, 11) (13, 10) (16, 25) (16, 20) (16, 10) (22, 8) (22, 20) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 25) (15, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, also known as the degree of the vertex. Let's list the degrees of each vertex:

Vertex 0: Degree 4
Vertex 1: Degree 3
Vertex 2: Degree 2
Vertex 3: Degree 4
Vertex 4: Degree 3
Vertex 5: Degree 2
Vertex 6: Degree 2
Vertex 7: Degree 2
Vertex 8: Degree 4
Vertex 9: Degree 5
Vertex 10: Degree 3
Vertex 11: Degree 4
Vertex 12: Degree 4
Vertex 13: Degree 2
Vertex 14: Degree 2
Vertex 15: Degree 1
Vertex 16: Degree 3
Vertex 17: Degree 4
Vertex 18: Degree 2
Vertex 19: Degree 4
Vertex 20: Degree 2
Vertex 21: Degree 3
Vertex 22: Degree 2
Vertex 23: Degree 4
Vertex 24: Degree 2
Vertex 25: Degree 4
Vertex 26: Degree 4
Vertex 27: Degree 4
Vertex 28: Degree 3
Vertex 29: Degree 4

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:

Vertex 15: Degree 1
Vertices 2, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 20, 22, 24: Degree 2
Vertices 10, 1, 4, 28: Degree 3
Vertices 21, 3, 16, 0, 25: Degree 4
Vertices 29, 26, 23, 8, 17, 12, 19, 11, 27, 9: Degree 5

Now, let's count the triangles based on the given edges by comparing the vertices based on their labels and degrees. 

Total number of triangles: [36]
