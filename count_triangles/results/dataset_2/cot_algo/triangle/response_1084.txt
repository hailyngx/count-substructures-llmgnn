Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 5) (14, 19) (14, 5) (17, 10) (17, 3) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 18) (2, 11) (2, 7) (18, 10) (18, 12) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 7) (5, 16) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 15) (19, 14) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 15) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 19) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 13) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 13) (3, 17) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. The sorted list of vertices with their degrees is:

(16, 3) (14, 2) (18, 2) (7, 2) (10, 3) (17, 2) (2, 2) (12, 4) (5, 5) (19, 4) (15, 3) (1, 4) (6, 3) (9, 3) (3, 3) (4, 3) (0, 3) (13, 3) (11, 6)

Based on the sorted list, we will consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Analyzing the edges, we find the following triangles:

1. <4, 0, 13>
2. <4, 1, 9>
3. <4, 3, 9>
4. <0, 4, 13>
5. <5, 1, 9>
6. <5, 1, 6>
7. <5, 1, 4>
8. <5, 15, 19>
9. <5, 15, 16>
10. <5, 16, 15>
11. <5, 19, 15>
12. <6, 1, 9>
13. <6, 1, 13>
14. <9, 1, 13>
15. <10, 18, 12>
16. <11, 12, 0>
17. <11, 12, 16>
18. <11, 12, 2>
19. <11, 12, 7>
20. <11, 2, 12>
21. <11, 2, 7>
22. <11, 7, 2>
23. <12, 10, 18>
24. <14, 19, 5>
25. <15, 5, 19>
26. <16, 11, 12>
27. <16, 5, 15>
28. <17, 3, 9>
29. <19, 5, 15>
30. <19, 5, 16>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [30].
