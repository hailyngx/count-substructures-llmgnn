Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 12) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 8) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. 

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections (degree), the nodes are relabeled as follows:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 5
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 6
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 2
Node 11: degree 6
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 6
Node 14: degree 3

Analyzing the edges based on the relabeled nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 10, 12, 14.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 11, 13, 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 11, 13.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 11, 12, 13.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 12.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 13.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 14.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 11.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 10, 13.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 13.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 12.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 9.

Now, counting the triangles:
Total triangles = []
