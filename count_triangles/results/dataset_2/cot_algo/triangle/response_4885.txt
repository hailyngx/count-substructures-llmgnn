Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 17) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 16) (17, 10) (17, 15) (17, 18) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 14) (0, 15) (0, 13) (7, 18) (1, 11) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 3) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 19) (4, 19) (4, 3) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 4) (19, 3) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 0) (13, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 18) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 7) (18, 3) 

Response:
Let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Nodes with the least connections:
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 0, 10, 20: 2 connections
Nodes 4, 12, 13: 3 connections
Nodes 8, 5, 2, 19: 4 connections
Nodes 1, 3, 18, 6, 16, 9: 5 connections
Nodes 11, 15, 17, 14: 6 connections

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Node 7 (1 connection) does not form any triangles.
2. Nodes 0, 10, 20 (2 connections) do not form any triangles.
3. Nodes 4, 12, 13 (3 connections) do not form any triangles.
4. Nodes 8, 5, 2, 19 (4 connections) do not form any triangles.
5. For nodes 1, 3, 18, 6, 16, 9 (5 connections):
    - (1, 6, 9) form a triangle: <1, 6, 9>.
6. For nodes 11, 15, 17, 14 (6 connections):
    - (11, 15, 17) form a triangle: <11, 15, 17>.

Count of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <1, 6, 9>, <11, 15, 17>
