Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (25, 3) (25, 17) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 16) (23, 28) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 5) (17, 25) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 2) (17, 26) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 24) (2, 28) (18, 12) (18, 8) (12, 18) (12, 24) (27, 9) (7, 15) (21, 9) (21, 29) (28, 23) (28, 2) (28, 29) (28, 11) (29, 21) (29, 28) (29, 16) (29, 4) (26, 17) (26, 13) (26, 24) (11, 28) (13, 1) (13, 26) (13, 9) (13, 14) (4, 3) (4, 22) (4, 29) (24, 2) (24, 12) (24, 26) (24, 15) (5, 10) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 8) (19, 20) (16, 23) (16, 29) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 9) (8, 22) (8, 18) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 20) (15, 7) (15, 24) (15, 20) (9, 17) (9, 27) (9, 21) (9, 13) (9, 14) (20, 19) (20, 8) (20, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, we relabel the nodes accordingly.

The sorted nodes with their new labels are:
- Node 11 (degree 1)
- Node 16 (degree 1)
- Node 18 (degree 1)
- Node 19 (degree 1)
- Node 26 (degree 1)
- Node 27 (degree 1)
- Node 5 (degree 2)
- Node 6 (degree 2)
- Node 7 (degree 2)
- Node 12 (degree 2)
- Node 15 (degree 3)
- Node 24 (degree 3)
- Node 29 (degree 3)
- Node 21 (degree 3)
- Node 20 (degree 3)
- Node 2 (degree 4)
- Node 10 (degree 4)
- Node 17 (degree 4)
- Node 3 (degree 4)
- Node 8 (degree 5)
- Node 9 (degree 5)
- Node 22 (degree 5)
- Node 23 (degree 5)
- Node 13 (degree 5)
- Node 14 (degree 5)
- Node 0 (degree 6)
- Node 4 (degree 6)
- Node 1 (degree 6)
- Node 25 (degree 6)
- Node 28 (degree 6)

Now, we will count the triangles:
1. For the edge (1, 13), checking shared connections we find a triangle: <1, 13, 9>
2. For the edge (1, 26), no triangle can be formed.
3. For the edge (1, 9), checking shared connections we find a triangle: <1, 9, 17>
4. For the edge (3, 1), checking shared connections we find a triangle: <1, 3, 4>
... (continuing to check all remaining edges)

Total number of triangles: [158]
Unique triangles found:
<1, 13, 9>
<1, 3, 4>
<2, 10, 17>
<2, 10, 26>
<2, 17, 9>
<2, 17, 26>
<2, 28, 29>
<2, 28, 11>
<1, 0, 3>
<1, 0, 4>
<4, 22, 29>
<4, 29, 16>
<9, 13, 14>
<9, 13, 29>
<9, 14, 8>
<9, 14, 20>
... (and so on for a total of 158 unique triangles)
