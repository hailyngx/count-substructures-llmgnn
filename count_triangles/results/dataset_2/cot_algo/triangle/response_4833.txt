Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 5) (13, 19) (13, 14) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 4) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 17) (17, 2) (17, 12) (17, 4) (17, 7) (8, 15) (8, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 17) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 4) (0, 12) (9, 2) (9, 16) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 18) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 4) (16, 9) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 10) (18, 3) (18, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree. The nodes with their degree are as follows:
(0: 5), (1: 4), (2: 3), (3: 4), (4: 5), (5: 4), (6: 2), (7: 4), (8: 3), (9: 2), (10: 3), (11: 3), (12: 4), (13: 2), (14: 3), (15: 4), (16: 1), (17: 4), (18: 2), (19: 3)

Based on the degree-based ordering, the relabeling of the nodes is as follows:
0 -> 16, 6 -> 15, 9 -> 14, 13 -> 13, 18 -> 12, 3 -> 11, 11 -> 10, 8 -> 9, 2 -> 8, 16 -> 7, 10 -> 6, 5 -> 5, 14 -> 4, 4 -> 3, 1 -> 2, 12 -> 1, 17 -> 0, 7 -> 17, 19 -> 18, 15 -> 19

Now, we will check for triangles among the edges based on the relabeled nodes:
1. Triangles: <3, 11, 18>, <3, 11, 12>, <3, 15, 19>, <11, 1, 2>, <11, 1, 14>, <11, 14, 4>, <18, 12, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
