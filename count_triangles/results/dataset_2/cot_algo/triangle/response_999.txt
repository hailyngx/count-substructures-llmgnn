Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (14, 17) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 2) (8, 11) (8, 2) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 7) (5, 15) (6, 19) (6, 4) (0, 11) (0, 9) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (18, 19) (18, 15) (7, 16) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 9) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 10) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 9) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 10) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 19) (15, 14) (15, 5) (15, 18) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: 11, 9
- 1: 11, 17, 12, 10
- 2: 17, 8, 7
- 3: 16, 13, 4, 10
- 4: 6, 3
- 5: 15
- 6: 19, 4
- 7: 16, 13, 2, 12, 10
- 8: 11, 2
- 9: 0, 12, 19
- 10: 7, 1, 3
- 11: 16, 1, 0, 8
- 12: 7, 1, 9
- 13: 17, 3, 19, 7
- 14: 17, 15
- 15: 14, 18, 5
- 16: 11, 7, 3
- 17: 14, 1, 13, 2
- 18: 19, 15
- 19: 13, 6, 18, 9

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degree:

Nodes by degree: 5, 4, 18, 9, 0, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 3, 19, 2, 7, 11, 1, 17, 13

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
