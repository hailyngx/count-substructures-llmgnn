- Node 23 is connected to nodes 1, 14, 17, 19.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 2, 13, 16, 22.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 18, 27.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 12.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 13, 16, 18, 21, 25.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 9.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 5, 10, 12, 19.

By sorting the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order, we get the following order:
Node 3, 4, 20, 7, 11, 13, 25, 0, 1, 14, 18, 22, 2, 26, 5, 15, 6, 12, 8, 28, 9, 21, 10, 24, 19, 23, 16, 17, 27, 29.

Based on this order, we can now count the number of triangles. 
The total number of triangles is [14].
The unique triangles found are:
<3, 7, 27>, <3, 16, 25>, <4, 9, 21>, <4, 9, 28>, <4, 19, 9>, <5, 6, 29>, <5, 12, 26>, <7, 18, 25>, <8, 15, 17>, <8, 21, 27>, <9, 19, 23>, <9, 19, 29>, <11, 6, 20>, <13, 16, 24>.
