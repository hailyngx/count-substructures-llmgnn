Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 6) (1, 19) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 2) (15, 17) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 18) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 4) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 9) (16, 0) (16, 4) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 12) (4, 14) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 13) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 18) (11, 5) (11, 13) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 15) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 14) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 18) (18, 15) (18, 3) (18, 14) 

Response:
The nodes can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the nodes will be relabeled based on their degree in ascending order:
Nodes and their new labels:
Node 5 - Label 0 - (degree 2)
Node 1 - Label 1 - (degree 2)
Node 17 - Label 2 - (degree 3)
Node 8 - Label 3 - (degree 3)
Node 16 - Label 4 - (degree 3)
Node 10 - Label 5 - (degree 4)
Node 15 - Label 6 - (degree 4)
Node 19 - Label 7 - (degree 4)
Node 0 - Label 8 - (degree 3)
Node 4 - Label 9 - (degree 4)
Node 12 - Label 10 - (degree 4)
Node 9 - Label 11 - (degree 3)
Node 13 - Label 12 - (degree 3)
Node 11 - Label 13 - (degree 2)
Node 6 - Label 14 - (degree 3)
Node 7 - Label 15 - (degree 3)
Node 2 - Label 16 - (degree 3)
Node 3 - Label 17 - (degree 3)
Node 14 - Label 18 - (degree 3)
Node 18 - Label 19 - (degree 3)

Now, we will count the triangles by examining the edges:
