Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 4) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 8) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 8) (13, 2) (13, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree of connections. Let's process the graph based on this method:

1. Node Degrees:
- Node 0: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 4
- Node 2: Degree 5
- Node 3: Degree 5
- Node 4: Degree 6
- Node 5: Degree 5
- Node 6: Degree 3
- Node 7: Degree 2
- Node 8: Degree 5
- Node 9: Degree 3
- Node 10: Degree 4
- Node 11: Degree 5
- Node 12: Degree 3
- Node 13: Degree 2
- Node 14: Degree 4

2. Relabel the nodes in ascending order of their degrees:
- Node 7 (Degree 2)
- Node 13 (Degree 2)
- Node 6 (Degree 3)
- Node 9 (Degree 3)
- Node 12 (Degree 3)
- Node 0 (Degree 4)
- Node 1 (Degree 4)
- Node 10 (Degree 4)
- Node 14 (Degree 4)
- Node 2 (Degree 5)
- Node 3 (Degree 5)
- Node 8 (Degree 5)
- Node 11 (Degree 5)
- Node 4 (Degree 6)
- Node 5 (Degree 5)

3. Process the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
- Check (1, 3): Node 1 is lower labeled, proceed since Node 1 has fewer connections.
  - Shared connections with Node 3: (1, 3, 11), (1, 3, 4)
- Check (1, 10): Node 1 is lower labeled, proceed since Node 1 has fewer connections.
  - Shared connections with Node 10: (1, 10, 4)
- Check (1, 9): Node 1 is lower labeled, proceed since Node 1 has fewer connections.
  - Shared connections with Node 9: (1, 9, 0)
- Check (1, 12): Node 1 is lower labeled, proceed since Node 1 has fewer connections.
  - Shared connections with Node 12: (1, 12, 0)
  
... (continue checking all edges)

After checking all edges, we find the following triangles:
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 10, 4>
<1, 9, 0>
<1, 12, 0>
<3, 5, 11>
<3, 5, 14>
<3, 4, 11>
<5, 6, 14>
<5, 2, 11>
<2, 8, 11>
<2, 8, 12>
<2, 8, 4>
<2, 4, 13>
<8, 7, 12>
<8, 7, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
