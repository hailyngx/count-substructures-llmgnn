Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 17) (8, 3) (8, 0) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 18) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 11) (18, 13) (18, 5) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 0) (17, 15) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 5) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 6) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 16) (11, 2) (11, 4) (19, 3) (19, 9) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 12) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 16) (10, 14) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 14) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 9) (9, 19) (9, 16) (14, 2) (14, 10) (14, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (3, 15), (3, 19), (3, 8), (15, 1), (15, 17), (8, 0), (13, 17), (13, 7), (13, 18), (2, 14), (2, 7), (18, 5), (1, 5), (17, 12), (4, 11), (4, 6), (6, 10), (11, 2), (19, 9), (0, 12), (16, 9), (5, 14)

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degrees:

Nodes by Degree:
0: 3
1: 3
2: 3
4: 3
18: 3
6: 4
7: 4
12: 4
5: 5
9: 2
14: 3
10: 4
16: 4
11: 3
19: 2
3: 3
8: 2
15: 3
13: 3
17: 4

Using Degree-Based Ordering method, we check the edges in the order provided only if the lower labeled node has fewer connections:

Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 15>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 1, 3>
4. <0, 12, 5>
5. <0, 12, 17>
6. <0, 8, 3>
7. <1, 5, 17>
8. <1, 15, 3>
9. <2, 7, 13>
10. <4, 6, 10>
11. <5, 10, 14>
12. <5, 10, 16>

Total number of triangles: [12]
