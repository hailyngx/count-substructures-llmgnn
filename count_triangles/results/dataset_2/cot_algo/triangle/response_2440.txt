Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (4, 6) (4, 12) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 10) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 2) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph can be represented as follows: 

- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 5: 6 connections
- Node 6: 6 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 9: 5 connections
- Node 10: 5 connections
- Node 11: 5 connections
- Node 12: 5 connections
- Node 13: 4 connections
- Node 14: 2 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can start counting the triangles based on the edges provided. 

The triangles found in the graph are:

1. <4, 12, 7>
2. <5, 6, 13>
3. <5, 6, 9>
4. <5, 6, 4>
5. <5, 6, 3>
6. <5, 11, 7>
7. <5, 11, 2>
8. <5, 11, 12>
9. <5, 11, 9>
10. <1, 0, 3>
11. <2, 5, 13>
12. <2, 5, 14>
13. <12, 0, 1>
14. <12, 0, 2>
15. <12, 11, 7>
16. <10, 5, 6>
17. <10, 5, 11>
18. <10, 5, 13>
19. <10, 5, 14>
20. <12, 4, 6>
21. <12, 4, 7>
22. <12, 4, 13>
23. <10, 8, 6>
24. <10, 8, 9>
25. <10, 8, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [25].
