Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 8) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 9) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 12) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 5) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 4) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 0) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 18) (0, 15) (0, 18) (10, 4) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 5) (5, 17) (5, 1) (2, 7) (7, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in this graph is as follows:

Nodes sorted by their degrees in ascending order:
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 1
Node 10: Degree 1
Node 2: Degree 1
Node 17: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 18: Degree 3
Node 15: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 19: Degree 3
Node 11: Degree 3
Node 16: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 12: Degree 5
Node 14: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 5

Triangles found based on the method:
[15]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15], and the unique triangles found are <0, 15, 18>, <3, 8, 13>, <6, 9, 12>, <4, 9, 13>, <4, 12, 14>, <4, 12, 15>, <2, 7, 5>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 17>, <8, 13, 3>, <9, 6, 1>, <12, 15, 0>, <12, 15, 6>, <13, 8, 18>, <13, 12, 4>.
