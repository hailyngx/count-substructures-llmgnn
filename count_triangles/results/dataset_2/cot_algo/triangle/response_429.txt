Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 11) (9, 12) (26, 19) (26, 23) (3, 16) (15, 23) (15, 17) (15, 2) (0, 28) (0, 24) (0, 17) (0, 25) (20, 1) (20, 8) (2, 15) (2, 24) (8, 20) (8, 25) (19, 26) (19, 21) (19, 28) (19, 24) (19, 6) (29, 9) (29, 27) (29, 16) (29, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 4) (23, 26) (23, 15) (1, 20) (1, 13) (6, 19) (6, 22) (4, 11) (4, 22) (4, 5) (22, 6) (22, 4) (12, 9) (12, 16) (12, 28) (12, 18) (16, 3) (16, 29) (16, 12) (16, 27) (25, 9) (25, 0) (25, 8) (27, 29) (27, 16) (27, 21) (27, 17) (24, 0) (24, 2) (24, 19) (24, 28) (14, 18) (14, 7) (28, 0) (28, 19) (28, 12) (28, 24) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 5) (21, 19) (21, 27) (21, 17) (18, 12) (18, 14) (18, 13) (13, 1) (13, 18) (17, 15) (17, 0) (17, 27) (17, 21) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (10, 29) (10, 7) (10, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: (9, 29), (9, 25), (9, 11), (9, 12), (26, 19), (26, 23), (3, 16), (15, 23), (15, 17), (15, 2), (0, 28), (0, 24), (0, 17), (0, 25), (20, 1), (20, 8), (2, 15), (2, 24), (8, 20), (8, 25), (19, 26), (19, 21), (19, 28), (19, 24), (19, 6), (29, 27), (29, 16), (29, 10), (11, 5), (11, 4), (23, 15), (1, 13), (6, 22), (4, 22), (4, 5), (12, 18), (16, 27), (25, 8), (27, 21), (27, 17), (14, 7), (7, 10)

After sorting the nodes by their degrees, we get the following list of vertices:
Nodes: 13, 3, 1, 0, 2, 10, 7, 14, 20, 21, 6, 22, 18, 28, 16, 8, 12, 17, 24, 26, 19, 15, 5, 25, 27, 11, 4, 23, 29, 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find that the total number of triangles is [9].

The unique triangles are:
<1, 13, 18>, <1, 13, 20>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 1, 20>, <1, 2, 24>, <6, 14, 18>, <4, 5, 7>, <9, 11, 29>, <9, 12, 19>
