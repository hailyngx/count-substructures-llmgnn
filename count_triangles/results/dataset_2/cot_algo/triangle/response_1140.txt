Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
The given graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. To count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections).

The degrees of the vertices are as follows:
Node 0: degree 3, Node 1: degree 3, Node 2: degree 5, Node 3: degree 3, Node 4: degree 5, Node 5: degree 5, Node 6: degree 4, Node 7: degree 5, Node 8: degree 2, Node 9: degree 4, Node 10: degree 5, Node 11: degree 4, Node 12: degree 4, Node 13: degree 4, Node 14: degree 4

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 8: label 0, Node 0: label 1, Node 1: label 2, Node 3: label 3, Node 9: label 4, Node 6: label 5, Node 14: label 6, Node 12: label 7, Node 11: label 8, Node 13: label 9, Node 2: label 10, Node 4: label 11, Node 7: label 12, Node 5: label 13, Node 10: label 14

Now, we will check the shared connections between edges with lower labeled vertices having fewer connections:
Triangles found: <0, 4, 12>, <0, 2, 13>, <0, 5, 12>, <0, 5, 13>, <0, 7, 12>, <0, 13, 14>, <1, 4, 12>, <1, 7, 12>, <2, 4, 13>, <4, 11, 13>, <4, 5, 11>, <4, 5, 12>, <4, 5, 13>, <4, 7, 11>, <4, 7, 12>, <4, 10, 13>, <5, 7, 11>, <5, 7, 12>, <5, 11, 13>, <7, 11, 12>

Total number of triangles: [19]
