Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes can be relabeled by sorting them based on their degree:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 6

Based on this relabeling, the edges are as follows:
- (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2)
- (2, 0) (2, 1)
- (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9)
- (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 3)
- (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7)
- (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6)
- (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4)
- (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 4)
- (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4)
- (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The total number of triangles is [38]. 

And the unique triangles found are:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 9, 3>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 7, 5>
<4, 8, 9>
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 2, 5>
