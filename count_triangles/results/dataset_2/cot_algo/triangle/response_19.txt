Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (5, 9), (5, 1), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 1), (6, 9), (6, 2), (6, 0), (4, 7), (4, 3), (4, 2), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 2), (7, 1), (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (8, 9), (8, 7), (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 1), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 7), (1, 8), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8)

Next, let's sort the vertices by their degree:

Degree 0: 5, 3, 4
Degree 1: 0, 6, 1
Degree 2: 8
Degree 3: 2
Degree 6: 9, 7

Now, we will count the triangles:

Triangles: [ 7 ]

Unique triangles found: <2, 6, 9> <2, 7, 8> <1, 7, 8> <1, 5, 9> <0, 6, 8> <4, 7, 8> <3, 4, 7>
