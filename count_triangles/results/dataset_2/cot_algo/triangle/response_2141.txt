Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 17) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (17, 8) (17, 19) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 19) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 16) (18, 5) (18, 11) (11, 18) (11, 2) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 2) (16, 0) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 14) (2, 11) (2, 15) (5, 3) (5, 18) (5, 16) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 14) (19, 16) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 15) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges:
- 0: {10, 14, 16, 6, 9}
- 1: {3, 15, 6, 9}
- 2: {11, 15}
- 3: {1, 5}
- 4: {12, 13}
- 5: {3, 18, 16}
- 6: {1, 0, 14}
- 7: {12, 13, 8}
- 8: {7, 13, 17}
- 9: {1, 0, 15}
- 10: {0, 12}
- 11: {18, 2}
- 12: {4, 7, 10, 19}
- 13: {4, 7, 8}
- 14: {0, 6, 16, 19}
- 15: {1, 2, 9}
- 16: {0, 14, 19, 5}
- 17: {8, 19}
- 18: {5, 11}
- 19: {17, 12, 14, 16}

Now, sorting the nodes by their degree from least to most:
{2, 18, 11, 5, 8, 9, 3, 10, 17, 15, 4, 6, 1, 7, 0, 16, 12, 13, 19, 14}

Number of triangles [10]:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 10, 12>
<0, 14, 16>
<0, 14, 19>
<0, 16, 19>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 9, 15>
<5, 16, 19>
