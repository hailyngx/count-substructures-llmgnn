Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 23) (5, 10) (9, 18) (9, 2) (3, 17) (3, 20) (3, 8) (15, 1) (15, 26) (18, 9) (18, 26) (18, 0) (18, 29) (22, 14) (22, 11) (22, 24) (22, 1) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 10) (27, 12) (27, 29) (0, 18) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 19) (20, 3) (20, 0) (20, 7) (20, 13) (6, 28) (6, 16) (28, 6) (28, 14) (28, 2) (13, 20) (13, 4) (13, 11) (26, 15) (26, 18) (26, 25) (16, 6) (16, 24) (16, 25) (1, 15) (1, 22) (1, 19) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 24) (8, 21) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 7) (29, 18) (29, 27) (29, 11) (4, 12) (4, 13) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 28) (2, 23) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 8) (23, 5) (23, 2) (23, 10) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 7) (7, 20) (7, 17) (7, 14) (21, 8) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 25) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 23) (11, 22) (11, 13) (11, 29) (25, 26) (25, 16) (25, 19) 

Response:
The given graph has the following edges:
(5, 2) (5, 23) (5, 10) (9, 18) (9, 2) (3, 17) (3, 20) (3, 8) (15, 1) (15, 26) (18, 9) (18, 26) (18, 0) (18, 29) (22, 14) (22, 11) (22, 24) (22, 1) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 10) (27, 12) (27, 29) (0, 18) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 19) (20, 3) (20, 0) (20, 7) (20, 13) (6, 28) (6, 16) (28, 6) (28, 14) (28, 2) (13, 20) (13, 4) (13, 11) (26, 15) (26, 18) (26, 25) (16, 6) (16, 24) (16, 25) (1, 15) (1, 22) (1, 19) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 24) (8, 21) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 7) (29, 18) (29, 27) (29, 11) (4, 12) (4, 13) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 28) (2, 23) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 8) (23, 5) (23, 2) (23, 10) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 7) (7, 20) (7, 17) (7, 14) (21, 8) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 25) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 23) (11, 22) (11, 13) (11, 29) (25, 26) (25, 16) (25, 19)

First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices: 5, 9, 3, 15, 18, 22, 12, 27, 0, 20, 6, 28, 13, 26, 16, 1, 8, 17, 29, 4, 2, 24, 23, 14, 7, 21, 19, 10, 11, 25

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[74]

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 2, 23>, <5, 10, 23>, <5, 2, 9>, <5, 9, 10>, <5, 9, 18>, <5, 18, 26>, <5, 18, 29>, <5, 18, 0>, <9, 2, 18>, <3, 17, 20>, <3, 17, 0>, <3, 20, 0>, <15, 1, 26>, <18, 9, 26>, <18, 9, 29>, <18, 0, 29>, <22, 14, 24>, <22, 14, 28>, <22, 11, 24>, <22, 11, 29>, <12, 27, 4>, <12, 27, 29>, <27, 12, 29>, <0, 20, 17>, <0, 20, 13>, <20, 7, 13>, <6, 28, 16>, <28, 14, 7>, <13, 20, 4>, <13, 20, 11>, <13, 4, 11>, <26, 18, 25>, <16, 6, 25>, <16, 24, 8>, <1, 15, 22>, <1, 15, 26>, <1, 19, 25>, <1, 8, 21>, <8, 3, 24>, <8, 3, 21>, <8, 24, 21>, <17, 3, 7>, <17, 0, 19>, <29, 18, 27>, <29, 27, 11>, <4, 12, 13>, <2, 5, 23>, <2, 9, 28>, <2, 23, 10>, <24, 22, 16>, <24, 22, 8>, <24, 8, 21>, <23, 5, 10>, <14, 22, 28>, <14, 22, 7>, <14, 28, 7>, <7, 20, 17>, <7, 17, 14>, <21, 8, 24>, <19, 0, 25>, <19, 1, 25>, <10, 5, 23>, <10, 12, 23>, <10, 12, 27>, <10, 23, 27>, <11, 13, 29>, <25, 16, 19>
