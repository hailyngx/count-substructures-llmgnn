Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 5) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the nodes by their degree and then analyzing the triangles formed by edges accordingly:

Node 7 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 10 has degree 4
Node 11 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 6
Node 5 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 5
Node 12 has degree 4
Node 0 has degree 3
Node 14 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 5
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 13 has degree 2
Node 4 has degree 2

Now, we will analyze the edges where the vertex with the smaller label has fewer connections:

Triangles from edges:
(4, 2) -> shared connections: [10]
(4, 7) -> shared connections: [3, 9]
(4, 7) -> shared connections: [3, 9]
(7, 3) -> shared connections: [1]
(7, 9) -> shared connections: [1]
(7, 9) -> shared connections: [1]
(3, 1) -> shared connections: [7, 5]
(3, 5) -> shared connections: [1, 10]
(3, 6) -> shared connections: [12]
(5, 13) -> shared connections: [12]
(9, 0) -> shared connections: [11, 6]
(9, 8) -> shared connections: [3, 10]
(9, 2) -> shared connections: [4, 6]
(10, 2) -> shared connections: [4]
(10, 14) -> shared connections: [6, 12]
(11, 0) -> shared connections: [6, 9]
(10, 14) -> shared connections: [6, 12]
(10, 11) -> shared connections: [1]
(10, 8) -> shared connections: [3, 9]
(10, 5) -> shared connections: [1, 3]
(10, 5) -> shared connections: [1, 3]
(11, 12) -> shared connections: [6]
(11, 12) -> shared connections: [6]
(8, 9) -> shared connections: [3, 10]
(8, 3) -> shared connections: [7, 10]

This gives us a total of [22] triangles in the graph.
Unique triangles: <2, 4, 10>, <3, 5, 10>, <3, 5, 1>, <6, 12, 11>, <9, 0, 11>, 
<9, 3, 8>, <9, 3, 10>, <7, 4, 3>, <3, 7, 9>, <6, 14, 12>, <9, 2, 4>
