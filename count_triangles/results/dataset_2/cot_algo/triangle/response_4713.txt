Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 9) (16, 2) (16, 4) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 14) (13, 15) (13, 7) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 6) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 15) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (4, 16) (4, 12) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 6) (18, 0) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 17) (19, 1) (19, 18) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 18) (14, 5) (2, 16) (2, 9) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 0) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 0) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 9) (0, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections). The sorted order of the nodes along with their connections is as follows:

Nodes in sorted order with their degrees:
(3: 2), (2: 3), (13: 2), (12: 3), (1: 2), (7: 2), (11: 2), (16: 2), (19: 2), (4: 4), (15: 4), (10: 4), (8: 2), (5: 6), (18: 6), (14: 6), (17: 6), (6: 4), (0: 4), (9: 4)

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will consider the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections. We will count the number of triangles formed by these connections.

After examining the connections, the total number of triangles is [24]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 5, 17>, <0, 6, 18>, <0, 9, 17>, <0, 9, 6>, 
<3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, 
<4, 12, 14>, <4, 12, 18>, <4, 14, 16>, <4, 14, 18>, 
<5, 12, 14>, <5, 12, 18>, 
<5, 14, 17>, <5, 14, 18>, 
<6, 10, 15>, <6, 10, 17>, <6, 15, 18>, <6, 17, 18>, 
<10, 15, 17>, 
<14, 12, 18>, <14, 5, 18>, 
<15, 10, 17>
