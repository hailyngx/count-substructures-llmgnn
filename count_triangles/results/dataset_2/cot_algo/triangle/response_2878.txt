Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (27, 15) (27, 3) (27, 7) (27, 5) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 19) (29, 2) (29, 13) (29, 23) (20, 7) (20, 9) (19, 2) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 17) (26, 19) (26, 23) (21, 28) (21, 3) (28, 21) (28, 16) (9, 20) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 16) (22, 9) (22, 24) (22, 25) (22, 3) (11, 19) (16, 28) (16, 9) (16, 6) (8, 9) (8, 25) (18, 19) (18, 9) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 22) (3, 23) (0, 4) (0, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (23, 29) (23, 26) (23, 3) (23, 25) (1, 15) (1, 7) (1, 24) (24, 22) (24, 1) (5, 27) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 4) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 17) (7, 27) (7, 20) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 25) (14, 12) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 25) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 17) (13, 29) (13, 10) (25, 22) (25, 8) (25, 23) (25, 7) (25, 6) (17, 19) (17, 4) (17, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in this graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
Vertices:  
0: 2 connections   
1: 3 connections  
2: 3 connections  
3: 4 connections  
4: 3 connections  
5: 4 connections  
6: 5 connections  
7: 5 connections  
8: 2 connections   
9: 5 connections  
10: 3 connections  
11: 1 connection  
12: 3 connections  
13: 2 connections  
14: 1 connection  
15: 2 connections  
16: 4 connections  
17: 3 connections  
18: 4 connections  
19: 5 connections  
20: 2 connections  
21: 2 connections  
22: 4 connections  
23: 4 connections  
24: 2 connections  
25: 5 connections  
26: 2 connections  
27: 4 connections  
28: 2 connections  
29: 3 connections  

2. Relabel the vertices according to their sorted order.

The triangles found in the graph are:
<2, 3, 29>
<6, 7, 25>
<4, 5, 17>
<9, 16, 25>
<12, 17, 12>
<12, 14, 10>
<19, 26, 23>
<5, 27, 15>
<7, 25, 22>
<4, 17, 12>
<9, 18, 19>
<7, 20, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [12].
