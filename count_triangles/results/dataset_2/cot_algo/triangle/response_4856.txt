Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 12) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 3) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) (14, 13) (14, 3) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 5) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:
```
Node 0: 9, 13, 4, 5
Node 1: 7, 2, 5
Node 2: 6, 11, 4, 1
Node 3: 13, 12, 7, 14, 5
Node 4: 8, 12, 0, 2
Node 5: 3, 7, 1, 0
Node 6: 9, 7, 2
Node 7: 10, 3, 5, 1, 6
Node 8: 9, 11, 13, 4, 12
Node 9: 6, 8, 11, 0
Node 10: 11, 7
Node 11: 9, 10, 13, 8, 12, 2
Node 12: 11, 8, 4, 3
Node 13: 11, 8, 3, 14, 0
Node 14: 13, 3
```

Now, let's count the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method.

The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:
```
Node 14: degree 2
Node 1: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 8: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 5: degree 5
Node 7: degree 5
Node 2: degree 6
Node 4: degree 6
Node 12: degree 6
Node 13: degree 6
Node 11: degree 6
```

Examining each edge, the triangles formed are:
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 4, 12>
- <0, 4, 13>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 5, 13>
- <0, 9, 6>
- <0, 9, 8>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 2, 7>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <2, 4, 12>
- <2, 4, 11>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 11, 4>
- <3, 13, 14>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <3, 5, 14>
- <3, 7, 5>
- <4, 8, 11>
- <4, 8, 12>
- <4, 11, 12>
- <5, 7, 1>
- <5, 7, 3>
- <5, 7, 14>
- <6, 9, 8>
- <7, 1, 2>
- <7, 1, 5>
- <7, 3, 5>
- <8, 9, 6>
- <8, 9, 11>
- <8, 9, 13>
- <11, 9, 6>
- <11, 12, 4>
- <11, 12, 8>
- <12, 4, 0>
- <13, 3, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [36].
