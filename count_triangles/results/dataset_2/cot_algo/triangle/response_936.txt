Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices based on their connections:

Node 5 has 7 connections,
Node 4 has 5 connections,
Node 3 has 5 connections,
Node 0 has 4 connections,
Node 2 has 4 connections,
Node 7 has 4 connections,
Node 1 has 3 connections,
Node 9 has 3 connections,
Node 6 has 2 connections,
Node 8 has 2 connections.

Using the sorted order, we proceed to find the triangles:

1. (5, 9): Shares connections with 3 and 4. Triangle formed with nodes 3 and 4: <3, 4, 5>
2. (5, 6): No triangles formed.
3. (5, 1): Shares connections with 3. Triangle formed with nodes 3 and 4: <3, 1, 5>
4. (5, 4): No triangles formed.
5. (5, 3): Shares connections with 1, 4, and 9. Triangles formed with nodes 1 and 4: <1, 3, 5> and <3, 4, 5>
6. (5, 7): Shares connections with 3 and 0. Triangle formed with nodes 3 and 0: <0, 3, 5>

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <3, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 5>
