Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 22) (9, 2) (9, 20) (9, 23) (0, 28) (0, 21) (27, 14) (27, 11) (27, 20) (10, 17) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 21) (29, 17) (29, 20) (29, 6) (4, 1) (18, 24) (21, 0) (21, 17) (28, 0) (28, 2) (24, 18) (24, 26) (24, 3) (24, 8) (26, 24) (26, 16) (3, 17) (3, 24) (3, 16) (3, 13) (11, 27) (11, 22) (11, 25) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 23) (20, 9) (20, 27) (20, 29) (12, 16) (12, 25) (12, 22) (12, 15) (16, 17) (16, 26) (16, 3) (16, 12) (7, 10) (7, 19) (7, 15) (15, 12) (15, 7) (15, 2) (6, 29) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (14, 27) (14, 6) (14, 22) (22, 5) (22, 11) (22, 12) (22, 14) (2, 9) (2, 28) (2, 15) (2, 25) (8, 24) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 6) (23, 9) (23, 19) (23, 25) (23, 1) (25, 11) (25, 12) (25, 2) (25, 23) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 23) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
(5, 19) (5, 22) 
(9, 2) (9, 20) (9, 23) 
(0, 28) (0, 21) 
(27, 14) (27, 11) (27, 20) 
(10, 17) (10, 7) 
(17, 29) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 21) 
(29, 6) 
(4, 1) 
(18, 24) 
(24, 26) (24, 3) (24, 8) 
(26, 16) 
(3, 13) 
(11, 25) (11, 22) 
(19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 23) 
(20, 29) 
(12, 25) (12, 22) (12, 15) 
(7, 15) 
(6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) 
(22, 14) 
```

After sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:

```
Nodes: 
1 - 4, 5, 9, 0
2 - 7, 8, 10, 20, 21
3 - 13, 15, 16, 17, 22, 25, 29
4 - 1, 3, 18, 23
5 - 6, 11, 14, 19, 24, 26, 27, 28
```

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph, we find that there are 5 triangles in total: 

```
[5]
```

Unique triangles found:
1. <1, 2, 21>
2. <1, 3, 17>
3. <1, 5, 19>
4. <4, 13, 3>
5. <11, 22, 25>
