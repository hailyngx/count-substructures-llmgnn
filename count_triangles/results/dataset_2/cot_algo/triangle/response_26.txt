Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 14) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 12) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (2, 7) (2, 4) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 0) 

Response:
The given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 7), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 12), (1, 6), (1, 10), (1, 13), (2, 4), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10), (4, 13), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 7), (5, 9), (5, 11), (5, 13), (5, 14), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 10), (8, 3), (8, 12), (8, 14), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (10, 0), (10, 1), (10, 4), (10, 7), (10, 14), (11, 0), (11, 5), (11, 13), (12, 0), (12, 8), (12, 13), (13, 1), (13, 4), (13, 5), (13, 11), (13, 12), (13, 14), (14, 5), (14, 8), (14, 10), (14, 13)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph:

Node Degrees:
0: 5
1: 3
2: 2
3: 3
4: 5
5: 5
6: 3
7: 5
8: 3
9: 4
10: 4
11: 3
12: 3
13: 6
14: 4

Nodes Sorted by Degrees:
2, 11, 12, 1, 3, 6, 8, 0, 10, 7, 9, 4, 14, 5, 13

Triangles Found:
[24]

Unique Triangles:
<0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 10>, <0, 12, 13>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 10>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 10, 13>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 13>, <4, 10, 14>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 11>, <5, 7, 13>, <5, 9, 13>, <5, 9, 14>, <7, 10, 14>, <9, 13, 14>, <10, 13, 14>
