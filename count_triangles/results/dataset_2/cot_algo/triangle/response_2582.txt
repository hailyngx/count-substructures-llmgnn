Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 11) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 14) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14  
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 12), (5, 3), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 11), (6, 10), (6, 2), (1, 14), (1, 13), (1, 7), (3, 14), (8, 10), (13, 11), (4, 7), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 12), (14, 3), (2, 11), (10, 7)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

1. Sort nodes based on their degrees:  
Nodes in increasing order of degree: 0, 2, 5, 13, 7, 10, 3, 1, 11, 12, 6, 8, 4, 9, 14  
Relabeling:  
0 -> 0 (degree: 3)  
2 -> 1 (degree: 3)  
5 -> 2 (degree: 4)  
13 -> 3 (degree: 2)  
7 -> 4 (degree: 4)  
10 -> 5 (degree: 3)  
3 -> 6 (degree: 2)  
1 -> 7 (degree: 3)  
11 -> 8 (degree: 4)  
12 -> 9 (degree: 5)  
6 -> 10 (degree: 3)  
8 -> 11 (degree: 4)  
4 -> 12 (degree: 6)  
9 -> 13 (degree: 4)  
14 -> 14 (degree: 4)  

2. Checking edges with the node with lower label having fewer connections:  
Triangles formed by edges:  
<0, 10, 11>  
<0, 10, 7>  
<0, 10, 14>  
<0, 11, 13>  
<0, 11, 7>  
<0, 11, 14>  
<0, 12, 5>  
<0, 12, 6>  
<0, 12, 14>  
<0, 14, 1>  
<0, 14, 3>  
<0, 14, 7>  
<0, 14, 12>  
<1, 11, 2>  
<1, 11, 4>  
<1, 11, 6>  
<1, 11, 8>  
<1, 12, 4>  
<1, 4, 12>  
<1, 7, 4>  
<1, 7, 13>  
<1, 7, 14>  
<1, 7, 4>

<3, 14, 1>  
<3, 14, 7>  
<4, 7, 11>  
<4, 7, 12>  
<4, 7, 2>  
<4, 7, 6>  
<4, 8, 9>  
<4, 8, 10>  
<5, 12, 6>  
<7, 11, 13>  
<10, 0, 11>  
<10, 0, 12>  
<10, 6, 2>  
<11, 0, 14>  
<11, 0, 12>  
<11, 2, 6>  
<12, 0, 5>  
<12, 0, 6>  
<12, 0, 14>  
<12, 4, 6>  
<12, 4, 8>  
<12, 5, 6>  
<14, 0, 3>  
<14, 0, 7>
