Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 4) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 22) (21, 15) (2, 5) (2, 6) (29, 26) (29, 14) (14, 29) (14, 3) (14, 25) (17, 20) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 4) (20, 17) (20, 25) (20, 7) (20, 22) (25, 14) (25, 20) (25, 4) (25, 18) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 28) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 15) (26, 29) (26, 0) (13, 17) (11, 28) (11, 27) (28, 5) (28, 11) (28, 0) (28, 15) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 25) (4, 27) (27, 11) (27, 4) (27, 24) (3, 21) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 8) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (12, 9) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 10) (0, 26) (0, 28) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 23) (7, 20) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (24, 27) (24, 18) (24, 15) (18, 25) (18, 0) (18, 24) (23, 0) (23, 10) (10, 9) (10, 16) (10, 23) (22, 21) (22, 20) (22, 15) (15, 21) (15, 6) (15, 28) (15, 24) (15, 22) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on the number of edges each node has. 

The sorted nodes are:
Node 19: degree 0
Node 30: degree 0
Node 2: degree 2
Node 30: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 18: degree 3
Node 23: degree 3
Node 29: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4
Node 22: degree 4
Node 26: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 27: degree 4
Node 10: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 11: degree 5
Node 20: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5
Node 24: degree 5
Node 16: degree 5
Node 25: degree 6
Node 15: degree 6
Node 1: degree 7
Node 4: degree 7
Node 21: degree 7
Node 0: degree 8
