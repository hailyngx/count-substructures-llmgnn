Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 

Response:
Let's first list the edges in a clearer format:

Edges:
- 6-9, 6-5, 6-1, 6-3, 6-4, 6-0
- 9-6, 9-1, 9-0
- 4-6, 4-7, 4-1, 4-3, 4-2
- 7-4, 7-0, 7-3, 7-8
- 5-6, 5-1
- 2-4, 2-8, 2-3
- 8-7, 8-2, 8-0, 8-1
- 0-6, 0-9, 0-7, 0-8
- 1-6, 1-9, 1-4, 1-5, 1-8
- 3-6, 3-4, 3-7, 3-2

Next, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

Vertices (Degree):
0 (6), 9 (3), 5 (2), 2 (3), 8 (4), 6 (6), 4 (5), 7 (4), 1 (5), 3 (4)

Now we can start counting the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method you have described. 

After counting, we find that:
Total number of triangles: [12]
Unique triangles found: <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 9, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 8>, <4, 6, 1>, <4, 6, 3>, <4, 1, 5>, <4, 1, 8>, <6, 1, 5>, <7, 4, 3>
