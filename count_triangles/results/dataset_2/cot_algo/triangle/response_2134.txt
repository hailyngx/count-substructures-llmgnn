Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 6) (6, 8) (6, 12) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 2) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 14) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to count the number of triangles in the given graph. Let's follow the steps:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
   Nodes and their degrees:
   ```
   (5, 3), (9, 4), (1, 2), (8, 4), (10, 3), 
   (11, 4), (13, 5), (4, 5), (7, 4), (12, 5), 
   (6, 2), (0, 4), (3, 6), (2, 4), (14, 5)
   ```

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly based on their degree:
   ```
   (5, 0), (9, 1), (1, 2), (8, 3), (10, 4), 
   (11, 5), (13, 6), (4, 7), (7, 8), (12, 9), 
   (6, 10), (0, 11), (3, 12), (2, 13), (14, 14)
   ```

3. For each edge, proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
   Count the number of triangles formed by shared connections:
   - Total number of triangles: [34]
   
   Unique triangles found:
   - <0, 5, 7>
   - <3, 4, 7>
   - <3, 4, 11>
   - <1, 8, 14>
   - <0, 6, 13>
   - <1, 2, 14>
   - <1, 4, 13>
   - <2, 4, 14>
   - <3, 4, 12>
   - <3, 6, 13>
   - <4, 7, 11>
   - <6, 8, 12>
   - <7, 8, 13>
   - <0, 3, 12>
   - <0, 3, 13>
   - <3, 6, 11>
   - <7, 8, 14>
   - <1, 4, 14>
   - <1, 8, 13>
   - <5, 7, 9>
   - <0, 5, 9>
   - <5, 7, 8>
   - <7, 12, 13>
   - <7, 12, 14>
   - <4, 11, 14>
   - <2, 4, 12>
   - <2, 4, 11>
   - <0, 3, 10>
   - <3, 10, 13>
   - <10, 11, 13>
   - <10, 13, 14>
   - <4, 8, 14>
   - <4, 12, 14>
   - <7, 8, 12>
