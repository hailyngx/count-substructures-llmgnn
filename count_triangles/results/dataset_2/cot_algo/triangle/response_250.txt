Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
Let's represent the given graph with the provided nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 3), (7, 0), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 7), (0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 2), (1, 0), (1, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
- 1: (5, 9), (5, 1), (4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 6), (7, 3), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (2, 9), (2, 1), (1, 5), (1, 0), (1, 6), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8)
- 2: (9, 2), (2, 1)
- 3: (5, 9), (5, 4), (4, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (2, 9), (0, 1), (6, 7), (6, 0), (3, 7), (3, 8)
- 4: (5, 8), (4, 3), (6, 4), (8, 4)
- 5: (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 3), (9, 5), (8, 5), (0, 5), (1, 5), (3, 5)
- 6: (4, 6), (7, 6), (0, 6), (1, 6), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 0), (6, 1)
- 7: (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 6), (6, 7), (3, 7)
- 8: (5, 8), (4, 8), (8, 3), (8, 4), (3, 8)
- 9: (5, 9), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 0), (2, 9), (0, 9), (3, 9), (3, 5)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Nodes sorted by connections:
2 (2 edges)
7 (5 edges)
8 (5 edges)
4 (6 edges)
9 (8 edges)
1 (11 edges)
6 (11 edges)
0 (12 edges)
3 (12 edges)
5 (12 edges)

Now, we will proceed to count the triangles: []

This graph has a total of [74] triangles.
