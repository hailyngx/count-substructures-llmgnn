Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 24) (15, 16) (27, 15) (27, 18) (27, 26) (2, 29) (2, 26) (2, 1) (29, 2) (29, 16) (29, 14) (29, 24) (29, 3) (3, 29) (3, 25) (3, 0) (3, 13) (25, 3) (25, 16) (25, 22) (25, 18) (14, 29) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 26) (8, 13) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 9) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 22) (0, 3) (20, 7) (20, 23) (20, 28) (7, 20) (12, 10) (26, 27) (26, 2) (26, 17) (26, 28) (26, 4) (28, 20) (28, 26) (28, 4) (21, 19) (21, 5) (21, 22) (5, 14) (5, 21) (5, 19) (19, 21) (19, 5) (4, 14) (4, 26) (4, 28) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 23) (6, 1) (6, 18) (11, 14) (11, 18) (23, 15) (23, 20) (23, 1) (16, 15) (16, 29) (16, 25) (16, 17) (16, 22) (24, 15) (24, 29) (22, 25) (22, 10) (22, 21) (22, 16) (18, 27) (18, 25) (18, 6) (18, 11) (9, 13) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}
Edges: (15, 27), (15, 23), (15, 24), (15, 16), (27, 15), (27, 18), (27, 26), (2, 29), (2, 26), (2, 1), (29, 2), (29, 16), (29, 14), (29, 24), (29, 3), (3, 29), (3, 25), (3, 0), (3, 13), (25, 3), (25, 16), (25, 22), (25, 18), (14, 29), (14, 17), (14, 11), (14, 4), (14, 5), (17, 14), (17, 10), (17, 16), (17, 26), (8, 13), (13, 3), (13, 8), (13, 9), (10, 17), (10, 12), (10, 22), (0, 3), (20, 7), (20, 23), (20, 28), (7, 20), (12, 10), (26, 27), (26, 2), (26, 17), (26, 28), (26, 4), (28, 20), (28, 26), (28, 4), (21, 19), (21, 5), (21, 22), (5, 14), (5, 21), (5, 19), (19, 21), (19, 5), (4, 14), (4, 26), (4, 28), (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 23), (6, 1), (6, 18), (11, 14), (11, 18), (23, 15), (23, 20), (23, 1), (16, 15), (16, 29), (16, 25), (16, 17), (16, 22), (24, 15), (24, 29), (22, 25), (22, 10), (22, 21), (22, 16), (18, 27), (18, 25), (18, 6), (18, 11), (9, 13)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

Degree 0: {7, 9, 12, 20}
Degree 1: {0, 6}
Degree 2: {19, 21}
Degree 3: {4, 5, 11}
Degree 4: {1, 22, 24, 28}
Degree 5: {10, 13}
Degree 6: {18, 26}
Degree 7: {14}
Degree 8: {8, 23}
Degree 9: {15, 17}
Degree 11: {27}
Degree 12: {29}
Degree 13: {16}
Degree 15: {3}

Now, we will go through the list of edges and count the triangles:
- (2, 29) forms triangle with shared connection 16: <2, 29, 16>
- (2, 26) and (26, 27) form triangle with shared connection 17: <2, 26, 27>
- (2, 1) and (1, 6) form triangle with shared connection 16: <2, 1, 6>
- (3, 13) and (13, 8) form triangle with shared connection 14: <3, 13, 8>
- (3, 25) and (25, 22) form triangle with shared connection 16: <3, 25, 22>
- (17, 10) forms triangle with shared connection 22: <17, 10, 22>

[Total number of triangles: 5]
