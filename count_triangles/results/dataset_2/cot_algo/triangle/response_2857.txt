Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 19) (26, 28) (26, 0) (15, 9) (27, 0) (27, 7) (0, 26) (0, 27) (0, 23) (4, 12) (4, 23) (18, 9) (18, 8) (3, 11) (3, 29) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 21) (11, 17) (6, 21) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 25) (21, 11) (21, 6) (21, 13) (21, 5) (21, 25) (28, 26) (28, 24) (28, 10) (5, 21) (5, 2) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 25) (19, 17) (12, 4) (12, 24) (12, 22) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 29) (1, 16) (1, 24) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 25) (25, 6) (25, 21) (25, 19) (25, 17) (25, 13) (14, 24) (14, 29) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 5) (23, 0) (23, 4) (29, 3) (29, 1) (29, 14) (29, 22) (13, 21) (13, 25) (13, 16) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 20) (24, 28) (24, 12) (24, 1) (24, 14) (7, 27) (7, 19) (8, 18) (8, 11) (22, 12) (22, 29) (22, 20) (20, 16) (20, 22) (10, 28) (10, 14) 

Response:
[18, 8] - These vertices will be labeled as 0 and 1 since they have the least number of connections.
[3, 4, 7, 10, 13, 15, 20] - Labeled as 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
[11, 27] - Labeled as 9, 10
[1, 5, 6, 12] - Labeled as 11, 12, 13, 14
[17, 19, 21, 22, 26] - Labeled as 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
[2, 9, 16, 23] - Labeled as 20, 21, 22, 23
[0, 24, 25, 28, 29] - Labeled as 24, 25, 26, 27, 28

With the vertices relabeled, we can now count the number of triangles. 

There are a total of [12] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are as follows:
<1, 9, 11>, <4, 11, 15>, <6, 11, 13>, <6, 11, 17>, <6, 11, 21>, <6, 11, 25>, <6, 13, 25>, <6, 17, 25>, <6, 21, 25>, <11, 12, 24>, <11, 17, 19>, <12, 14, 29>.
