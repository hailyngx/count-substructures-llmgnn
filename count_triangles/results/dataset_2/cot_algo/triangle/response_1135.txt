Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 6) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 25) (16, 10) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 5) (22, 18) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 7) (22, 1) (1, 22) (1, 14) (26, 29) (26, 0) (26, 12) (4, 18) (28, 0) (28, 24) (29, 26) (29, 7) (29, 13) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 25) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 17) (8, 27) (8, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 23) (23, 9) (23, 19) (12, 26) (12, 24) (12, 17) (6, 11) (6, 24) (24, 22) (24, 28) (24, 12) (24, 6) (24, 10) (19, 15) (19, 23) (19, 17) (19, 13) (0, 26) (0, 28) (0, 9) (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 2) (17, 8) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 3) (17, 5) (7, 22) (7, 29) (7, 8) (2, 3) (2, 14) (20, 22) (20, 21) (21, 20) (21, 5) (10, 16) (10, 24) (10, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (27, 18) (27, 8) (13, 29) (13, 19) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 21) (25, 11) (25, 16) (25, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently. 

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
0 -> 18
1 -> 0
2 -> 14
3 -> 2
4 -> 1
5 -> 19
6 -> 21
7 -> 28
8 -> 29
9 -> 26
10 -> 6
11 -> 27
12 -> 15
13 -> 5
14 -> 23
15 -> 4
16 -> 22
17 -> 20
18 -> 9
19 -> 12
20 -> 17
21 -> 8
22 -> 13
23 -> 24
24 -> 25
25 -> 11
26 -> 10
27 -> 7
28 -> 16
29 -> 3

Using this relabeling, the graph is as follows:
Nodes: 0-29
Edges: (27, 28) (7, 8) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 5) (28, 24) (20, 17) (20, 21) (20, 22) (20, 5) (29, 26) (29, 7) (29, 19) (29, 2) (24, 22) (24, 28) (24, 10) (24, 6) (11, 16) (11, 25) (11, 6) (11, 27) (16, 25) (16, 10) (16, 11) (21, 22) (21, 20) (17, 8) (17, 20) (17, 3) (17, 5) (22, 18) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 7) (1, 18) (4, 18) (4, 1) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 5) (8, 7) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 27) (8, 9) (27, 18) (27, 8) (27, 11) (26, 29) (26, 0) (26, 9) (0, 26) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 3) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 17) (10, 3)

The total number of triangles []: 28

The unique triangles found <>: <17, 8, 27>, <5, 20, 22>, <0, 18, 27>, <7, 8, 27>, <7, 20, 22>, <4, 18, 27>, <8, 17, 20>, <8, 17, 5>, <8, 20, 22>, <17, 20, 21>, <17, 20, 5>, <17, 5, 20>, <17, 5, 21>, <18, 4, 27>, <18, 5, 22>, <22, 20, 21>, <26, 29, 7>, <26, 29, 19>, <0, 26, 9>, <0, 26, 29>, <0, 26, 10>, <0, 3, 17>, <6, 11, 16>, <16, 11, 25>, <16, 25, 10>, <21, 20, 22>, <3, 10, 16>, <3, 10, 24>
