Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 2) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
- Edges: (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 11), (6, 0), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 14), (9, 10), (9, 3), (4, 9), (4, 5), (4, 14), (4, 11), (8, 5), (8, 10), (8, 1), (7, 6), (7, 12), (7, 0), (7, 2), (12, 7), (12, 5), (12, 3), (5, 4), (5, 8), (5, 12), (5, 1), (3, 9), (3, 12), (3, 11), (3, 0), (11, 6), (11, 4), (11, 3), (11, 0), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 11), (0, 10), (0, 1), (10, 9), (10, 8), (10, 0), (10, 2), (14, 9), (14, 4), (14, 2), (14, 13), (2, 9), (2, 7), (2, 10), (2, 14), (2, 1), (1, 8), (1, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (13, 14)

Next, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
Nodes by degree: 13, 8, 6, 10, 12, 11, 14, 1, 7, 5, 3, 2, 0, 4, 9

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degree, and then count the triangles:
Nodes by relabelled degree: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Now, we will count the triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 28]
<0, 2, 10>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 2, 14>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 12>, <0, 3, 11>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 5, 12>, <0, 6, 11>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 7, 2>, <0, 7, 6>, <0, 7, 12>, <0, 10, 9>, <0, 10, 2>, <0, 10, 8>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 7, 9>
