Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 23) (27, 15) (27, 29) (3, 19) (3, 9) (25, 7) (25, 8) (25, 10) (8, 25) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 23) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 29) (1, 8) (1, 14) (26, 16) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 7) (6, 17) (6, 2) (11, 28) (11, 7) (11, 29) (11, 20) (28, 11) (28, 12) (28, 18) (17, 6) (17, 20) (17, 22) (20, 11) (20, 17) (20, 16) (7, 25) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 18) (10, 25) (10, 21) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 29) (21, 5) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 18) (21, 2) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 14) (22, 17) (12, 5) (12, 28) (12, 10) (12, 16) (16, 26) (16, 20) (16, 12) (29, 27) (29, 4) (29, 11) (29, 10) (0, 21) (0, 24) (23, 15) (23, 13) (23, 2) (24, 0) (24, 18) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 19) (9, 3) (9, 13) (2, 6) (2, 21) (2, 23) (18, 28) (18, 7) (18, 21) (18, 24) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort the nodes based on the number of connections (degree):
Node 22 has 0 connections
Nodes 26, 15, 24, 5, 0, 9, 3, 6, 19, 1, and 2 have 1 connection each
Nodes 25, 4, 16, 20, 14, 12, 17, and 26 have 2 connections each
Nodes 23, 13, and 8 have 3 connections each
Nodes 11, 27, 28, and 21 have 4 connections each
Node 10 has 5 connections
Node 7 has 6 connections
Node 18 has 7 connections
Node 29 has 8 connections

2. Relabel the nodes with the sorted order from 0 to 29:
Node 22 -> Node 0
Nodes 26, 15, 24, 5, 0, 9, 3, 6, 19, 1, and 2 -> Nodes 1-10
Nodes 25, 4, 16, 20, 14, 12, 17, and 26 -> Nodes 11-18
Nodes 23, 13, and 8 -> Nodes 19-21
Nodes 11, 27, 28, and 21 -> Nodes 22-25
Node 10 -> Node 26
Node 7 -> Node 27
Node 18 -> Node 28
Node 29 -> Node 29

3. Count the triangles:
The total number of triangles is [33].
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 23>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 13, 19>, <0, 14, 1>, <0, 21, 18>, <1, 12, 10>, <1, 14, 19>, <1, 18, 28>, <1, 19, 10>, <1, 20, 11>, <1, 21, 5>, <1, 22, 29>, <1, 25, 11>, <1, 28, 18>, <2, 23, 13>, <2, 23, 6>, <2, 23, 21>, <2, 6, 17>, <2, 21, 18>, <5, 12, 10>, <5, 21, 18>, <5, 7, 25>, <6, 17, 22>, <6, 2, 23>, <6, 21, 18>, <9, 13, 23>, <11, 21, 18>, <11, 7, 25>, <12, 16, 26>, <13, 4, 29>, <14, 4, 29>, <15, 23, 13>, <19, 10, 29>.
