Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 14) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 3) (0, 27) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 19) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 25) (22, 18) (22, 6) (22, 21) (10, 17) (10, 26) (17, 10) (17, 26) (17, 21) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 25) (15, 20) (20, 5) (20, 15) (20, 8) (11, 28) (11, 3) (11, 24) (11, 26) (28, 11) (28, 8) (28, 1) (28, 13) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 11) (25, 18) (25, 2) (25, 26) (25, 23) (1, 28) (1, 8) (1, 7) (6, 22) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 14) (12, 29) (19, 0) (19, 27) (19, 18) (19, 4) (8, 0) (8, 20) (8, 28) (8, 1) (8, 21) (24, 11) (24, 12) (24, 4) (26, 10) (26, 17) (26, 11) (26, 25) (26, 7) (13, 28) (13, 21) (21, 27) (21, 22) (21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 13) (4, 19) (4, 24) (7, 1) (7, 26) (29, 12) (29, 16) (16, 9) (16, 29) (23, 25) (14, 5) (14, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting the number of triangles in the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections (degree):
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 13: 2 connections
Vertex 29: 2 connections

Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 10: 4 connections
Vertex 15: 4 connections
Vertex 16: 4 connections
Vertex 23: 4 connections
Vertex 24: 4 connections
Vertex 27: 4 connections

Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections

Vertex 5: 6 connections
Vertex 11: 6 connections
Vertex 17: 6 connections
Vertex 18: 6 connections
Vertex 20: 6 connections
Vertex 22: 6 connections
Vertex 26: 6 connections

Vertex 3: 7 connections
Vertex 8: 7 connections
Vertex 12: 7 connections
Vertex 19: 7 connections
Vertex 21: 7 connections
Vertex 25: 7 connections

Vertex 9: 8 connections
Vertex 14: 8 connections

2. Relabel the vertices:
Vertex 7 (2 connections) -> Vertex 1
Vertex 13 (2 connections) -> Vertex 2
Vertex 29 (2 connections) -> Vertex 3

Vertex 0 (4 connections) -> Vertex 4
Vertex 1 (4 connections) -> Vertex 5
Vertex 10 (4 connections) -> Vertex 6
Vertex 15 (4 connections) -> Vertex 7
Vertex 16 (4 connections) -> Vertex 8
Vertex 23 (4 connections) -> Vertex 9
Vertex 27 (4 connections) -> Vertex 10

Vertex 2 (5 connections) -> Vertex 11
Vertex 4 (5 connections) -> Vertex 12
Vertex 6 (5 connections) -> Vertex 13

Vertex 5 (6 connections) -> Vertex 14
Vertex 11 (6 connections) -> Vertex 15
Vertex 17 (6 connections) -> Vertex 16
Vertex 18 (6 connections) -> Vertex 17
Vertex 20 (6 connections) -> Vertex 18
Vertex 22 (6 connections) -> Vertex 19
Vertex 26 (6 connections) -> Vertex 20

Vertex 3 (7 connections) -> Vertex 21
Vertex 8 (7 connections) -> Vertex 22
Vertex 12 (7 connections) -> Vertex 23
Vertex 19 (7 connections) -> Vertex 24
Vertex 21 (7 connections) -> Vertex 25
Vertex 25 (7 connections) -> Vertex 26

Vertex 9 (8 connections) -> Vertex 27
Vertex 14 (8 connections) -> Vertex 28

3. Check for shared connections to count triangles:
- There are 9 triangles found:
[<0, 3, 11>, <0, 3, 13>, <0, 11, 13>, <1, 8, 28>, <1, 11, 28>, <3, 4, 24>, <3, 11, 24>, <3, 24, 26>, <4, 19, 24>]

The total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
