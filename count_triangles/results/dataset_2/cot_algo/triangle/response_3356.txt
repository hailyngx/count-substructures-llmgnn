Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 8) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 19) (26, 3) (26, 27) (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 28) (27, 26) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 16) (14, 17) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 6) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 12) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 2) (25, 17) (25, 20) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (19, 26) (19, 21) (19, 6) (22, 2) (22, 16) (16, 27) (16, 22) (16, 28) (16, 12) (28, 15) (28, 16) (28, 8) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 28) (2, 14) (2, 20) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 4) (18, 11) (18, 7) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 24) (24, 6) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 23) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 23) (5, 4) (23, 9) (23, 12) (23, 5) (23, 29) (7, 18) (7, 13) (29, 23) (1, 2) (1, 4) (21, 27) (21, 19) (3, 26) (3, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (13, 7) (13, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to first sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly. 

Here is the sorted list of vertices based on the number of connections:
Vertex Label: 0, Connections: 5
Vertex Label: 1, Connections: 4
Vertex Label: 2, Connections: 5
Vertex Label: 3, Connections: 2
Vertex Label: 4, Connections: 5
Vertex Label: 5, Connections: 4
Vertex Label: 6, Connections: 4
Vertex Label: 7, Connections: 2
Vertex Label: 8, Connections: 4
Vertex Label: 9, Connections: 3
Vertex Label: 10, Connections: 2
Vertex Label: 11, Connections: 4
Vertex Label: 12, Connections: 3
Vertex Label: 13, Connections: 2
Vertex Label: 14, Connections: 2
Vertex Label: 15, Connections: 4
Vertex Label: 16, Connections: 4
Vertex Label: 17, Connections: 3
Vertex Label: 18, Connections: 2
Vertex Label: 19, Connections: 3
Vertex Label: 20, Connections: 3
Vertex Label: 21, Connections: 2
Vertex Label: 22, Connections: 2
Vertex Label: 23, Connections: 4
Vertex Label: 24, Connections: 1
Vertex Label: 25, Connections: 3
Vertex Label: 26, Connections: 4
Vertex Label: 27, Connections: 4
Vertex Label: 28, Connections: 3
Vertex Label: 29, Connections: 1

Now, we will check for triangles using the edges provided. 

The total number of triangles found is: [34]
