Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. To apply this method, we first need to find the degrees of each vertex in the given graph:

Vertex 0: 6 connections
Vertex 1: 6 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections

Sorting these vertices by their degrees in ascending order gives us:

Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 0: 6 connections
Vertex 1: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph based on the sorted vertices to count the triangles:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 9>

Finally, we count the total number of triangles: [5]
