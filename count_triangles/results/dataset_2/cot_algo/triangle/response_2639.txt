Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 11) (13, 11) (13, 14) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 10) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. 

Here are the sorted vertices and their connections:

0: 4, 7    
1: 2, 6, 7, 12    
2: 1, 3, 5, 10, 11    
3: 2, 4, 7, 10, 11    
4: 0, 3, 5, 8, 9    
5: 2, 4, 8, 11, 12    
6: 1    
7: 0, 1, 3, 10, 14    
8: 4, 5, 8, 10, 14    
9: 4, 9, 10, 12, 14    
10: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9    
11: 2, 3, 5, 11, 12, 13    
12: 1, 5, 9, 11    
13: 11, 14    
14: 7, 8, 9, 13

Now, we will count the triangles by inspecting the shared connections between the vertices of each edge.

[Number of triangles: 33]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 7, 14>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 12>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 12, 5>
<2, 3, 11>
<2, 3, 10>
<2, 5, 11>
<2, 10, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
