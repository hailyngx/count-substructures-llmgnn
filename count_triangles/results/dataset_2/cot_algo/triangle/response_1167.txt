Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is:  

0 (degree 5)  
1 (degree 3)  
8 (degree 2)  
3 (degree 4)  
2 (degree 5)  
9 (degree 4)  
6 (degree 4)  
7 (degree 4)  
5 (degree 4)   
4 (degree 5)  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 
Using this method, we find that the following unique triangles exist in the graph:  
<0, 2, 3>  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 3, 9>  
<0, 5, 7>  
<0, 6, 9>  
<1, 3, 7>  
<2, 3, 8>  
<2, 5, 7>  
<2, 6, 4>  
<2, 6, 5>  
<2, 8, 4>  
<3, 6, 9>  
<3, 7, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
