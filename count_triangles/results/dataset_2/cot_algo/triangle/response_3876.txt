Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
- Edges: (5, 11), (5, 0), (9, 6), (9, 11), (9, 12), (14, 17), (14, 3), (14, 19), (17, 14), (17, 1), (17, 15), (17, 7), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 10), (10, 6), (10, 12), (11, 5), (11, 9), (11, 3), (8, 13), (8, 0), (13, 8), (13, 3), (13, 1), (13, 15), (2, 18), (2, 12), (2, 3), (2, 7), (18, 2), (18, 1), (1, 17), (1, 6), (1, 13), (1, 18), (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 4), (7, 17), (7, 2), (7, 0), (7, 19), (3, 14), (3, 11), (3, 13), (3, 2), (15, 17), (15, 13), (15, 19), (4, 0), (4, 19), (12, 9), (12, 10), (12, 2), (19, 14), (19, 7), (19, 15), (19, 4)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by degree:
Node 16: 0 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 16: 0 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 16: 0 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 18: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 16: 0 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 16: 0 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 16: 0 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 16: 0 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 16: 0 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 16: 0 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
