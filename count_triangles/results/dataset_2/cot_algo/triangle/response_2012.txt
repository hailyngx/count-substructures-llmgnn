Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 28) (6, 5) (6, 19) (15, 20) (15, 1) (15, 12) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 11) (4, 25) (4, 17) (18, 10) (18, 3) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 16) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 25) (0, 2) (0, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 28) (1, 7) (1, 13) (27, 9) (27, 10) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 21) (25, 4) (25, 28) (25, 11) (21, 16) (21, 19) (21, 12) (21, 14) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 29) (24, 3) (24, 12) (24, 19) (3, 18) (3, 24) (23, 14) (23, 29) (11, 20) (11, 25) (22, 5) (22, 17) (22, 12) (12, 15) (12, 21) (12, 24) (12, 22) (12, 14) (17, 4) (17, 2) (17, 22) (13, 20) (13, 1) (13, 29) (13, 14) (29, 10) (29, 23) (29, 13) (29, 14) (14, 21) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 29) (19, 6) (19, 21) (19, 24) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree or number of connections, from least to most connections. 

Here is the list of nodes in ascending order of degree:
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 22: 3 connections
Node 23: 3 connections
Node 24: 3 connections
Node 26: 3 connections
Node 27: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 21: 4 connections
Node 25: 4 connections
Node 28: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 10: 5 connections
Node 12: 5 connections
Node 16: 5 connections
Node 11: 6 connections
Node 14: 6 connections
Node 29: 6 connections
Node 15: 6 connections
Node 3: 7 connections
Node 20: 7 connections

Now, we will iterate through each edge, checking only if the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. We will count the triangles formed by shared connections.

After counting, the total number of triangles found in the given graph is: [24]

The unique triangles found are:
<6, 5, 1>
<6, 5, 22>
<6, 5, 0>
<6, 19, 24>
<9, 26, 28>
<9, 26, 27>
<10, 27, 9>
<10, 27, 29>
<14, 23, 29>
<19, 21, 24>
<22, 5, 16>
<25, 28, 16>
<1, 15, 13>
<1, 15, 12>
<1, 15, 20>
<3, 18, 24>
<4, 25, 11>
<4, 25, 28>
<5, 16, 28>
<5, 16, 21>
<5, 16, 1>
<12, 21, 14>
<12, 21, 16>
<13, 20, 29>
