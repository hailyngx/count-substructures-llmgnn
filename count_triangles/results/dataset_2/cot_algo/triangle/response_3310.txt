The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 10) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 1) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 10) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 3) (13, 4) (13, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. Let's construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: 
- 0: {7, 11}
- 1: {5, 6, 8, 4, 14}
- 2: {14, 7, 12, 13, 10}
- 3: {6, 4, 10}
- 4: {5, 12, 13, 1, 11, 3}
- 5: {9, 8, 1, 4}
- 6: {9, 1, 7, 3}
- 7: {6, 0, 11, 2, 8}
- 8: {5, 7, 12, 1}
- 9: {5, 6, 10}
- 10: {9, 14, 12, 2, 3}
- 11: {0, 14, 7, 4}
- 12: {8, 4, 2, 10}
- 13: {4, 2}
- 14: {11, 1, 2, 10}

Now, let's label the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:
Vertices: {0, 3, 13, 9, 8, 12, 2, 14, 7, 11, 6, 5, 1, 4, 10}
Degrees: {2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 5}

Based on the degree-based ordering, the vertices are relabeled accordingly: 
Vertices: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Degrees: {2, 5, 5, 3, 6, 4, 4, 5, 4, 3, 5, 4, 4, 2, 4}

Now, let's count the triangles using the degree-based ordering method. Considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:

Triangles: <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 14, 2>, <1, 14, 10>, <4, 11, 7>, <6, 7, 11>, <6, 7, 14>, <7, 8, 12>, <8, 10, 12>, <10, 12, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
