Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes can be sorted based on their degrees as follows: Node 0 (degree 2), Node 6 (degree 2), Node 8 (degree 2), Node 9 (degree 5), Node 2 (degree 4), Node 5 (degree 4), Node 3 (degree 4), Node 1 (degree 5), Node 7 (degree 5), Node 4 (degree 7).

Now, let's count the triangles by considering each edge carefully:

1. Edge (4, 7) - Node 4 and Node 7 share connections with Node 1 and Node 5, forming Triangle <1, 4, 7>.
2. Edge (4, 9) - Node 4 and Node 9 share connections with Node 2, forming Triangle <2, 4, 9>.
3. Edge (4, 5) - Node 4 and Node 5 share connections with Node 1, forming Triangle <1, 4, 5>.
4. Edge (4, 1) - Node 4 and Node 1 share connections with Node 7 and Node 5, forming Triangle <1, 4, 7> and Triangle <1, 4, 5>.
5. Edge (1, 3) - Node 1 and Node 3 share connections with Node 4, forming Triangle <1, 4, 3>.
6. Edge (3, 0) - Node 3 and Node 0 share connections with Node 6, forming Triangle <0, 3, 6>.
7. Edge (3, 8) - Node 3 and Node 8 share connections with Node 0, forming Triangle <0, 3, 8>.
8. Edge (5, 6) - Node 5 and Node 6 share connections with Node 1, forming Triangle <1, 5, 6>.
9. Edge (5, 8) - Node 5 and Node 8 share connections with Node 2, forming Triangle <2, 5, 8>.
10. Edge (0, 6) - Node 0 and Node 6 share connections with Node 3, forming Triangle <0, 3, 6>.
11. Edge (9, 2) - Node 9 and Node 2 share connections with Node 4, forming Triangle <2, 4, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [10] and the unique triangles found are <1, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, and <2, 5, 8>.
