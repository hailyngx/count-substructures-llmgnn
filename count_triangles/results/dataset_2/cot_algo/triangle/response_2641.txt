Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) 

Response:
The graph with nodes and edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0: {5, 9, 4, 2}
- Node 1: {4,7,3,6}
- Node 2: {5,3,0}
- Node 3: {7,1,6,2,8}
- Node 4: {5,7,0,1}
- Node 5: {6,2,8,4,0}
- Node 6: {5,9,7,1,3}
- Node 7: {4,3,6,1,8}
- Node 8: {5,7,3}
- Node 9: {6,0}

Now, let's proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering to count the number of triangles:

1. Node 9 (Degree 2) connects to {6, 0}.
2. Node 2 (Degree 3) connects to {5, 3, 0}.
3. Node 8 (Degree 3) connects to {5, 7, 3}.
4. Node 1 (Degree 4) connects to {4, 7, 3, 6}.
5. Node 9 (Degree 5) connects to {6, 9, 0, 4, 5}.
6. Node 3 (Degree 5) connects to {7, 1, 6, 2, 8}.
7. Node 8 (Degree 5) connects to {5, 7, 3, 8, 0}.
8. Node 4 (Degree 5) connects to {5, 7, 0, 1, 4}.
9. Node 5 (Degree 5) connects to {6, 2, 8, 4, 0}.
10. Node 6 (Degree 5) connects to {5, 9, 7, 1, 3}.

The triangles found in the graph are: <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
