Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 10) 

Response:
The graph has the following edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 14, and 11.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 8, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 10.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 13, 12, and 10.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 12, 0, 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 0, 7, 14.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 1, 11, 12.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 3, 6, 14, 13.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 2, 10, 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 1, 0, 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 8, 2, 3.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 13, 6, 0.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 6, 3.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 11, 3.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 0.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Node 5 has the fewest connections, so we label it as 0.
- Node 1 and Node 2 are next, but Node 2 has fewer connections, so we label it as 1 and Node 1 as 2.
- Node 3 is next, so we label it as 3.
- Node 4 and Node 9 are next, but Node 4 has fewer connections, so we label it as 4 and Node 9 as 5.
- Node 8 is next, so we label it as 6.
- Node 11 and Node 13 are next, but Node 13 has fewer connections, so we label it as 7 and Node 11 as 8.
- Node 10 is next, so we label it as 9.
- Node 6 and Node 12 are next, but Node 12 has fewer connections, so we label it as 10 and Node 6 as 11.
- Node 7 is last, so we label it as 12.

To count the triangles:
- <0, 7, 5>
- <0, 12, 4>
- <0, 7, 13>
- <0, 9, 6>
- <0, 5, 14>
- <2, 1, 8>
- <4, 12, 3>
- <4, 7, 13>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <5, 7, 14>
- <6, 1, 11>
- <9, 2, 8>
- <9, 12, 6>
- <12, 6, 3>
- <13, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [15].
