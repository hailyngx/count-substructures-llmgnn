Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 29) (5, 7) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 6) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 12) (0, 20) (0, 10) (0, 13) (20, 0) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 7) (18, 8) (6, 22) (6, 2) (6, 28) (6, 14) (28, 6) (28, 27) (19, 26) (26, 23) (26, 19) (26, 17) (26, 3) (3, 2) (3, 26) (3, 21) (21, 3) (21, 17) (21, 14) (8, 9) (8, 18) (8, 24) (8, 10) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 27) (10, 1) (4, 22) (4, 16) (4, 25) (4, 11) (12, 23) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 7) (7, 5) (7, 18) (7, 16) (17, 26) (17, 21) (29, 5) (29, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (11, 4) (11, 29) (11, 1) (11, 13) (15, 24) (14, 6) (14, 21) (14, 25) (24, 8) (24, 15) (24, 25) (25, 5) (25, 4) (25, 14) (25, 24) (27, 5) (27, 28) (27, 10) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Here is the sorted list of vertices with their respective degrees:

Node 20: degree 2
Node 28: degree 2
Node 29: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 15: degree 2
Node 19: degree 2
Node 21: degree 3
Node 23: degree 4
Node 25: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 16: degree 3
Node 5: degree 6
Node 9: degree 4
Node 22: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 17: degree 3
Node 24: degree 3
Node 26: degree 5

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. We will identify triangles by looking at shared connections between vertices, where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

Count of triangles: [72]
