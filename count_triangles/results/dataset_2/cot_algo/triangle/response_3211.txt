Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 14) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. After labeling the nodes accordingly, we can identify the triangles present in the graph.

The sorted vertices based on their connections are:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 14: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 12: 6 connections
Node 9: 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we look at the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. (<1, 14>), shared connections: none
2. (<1, 4>), shared connections: none
3. (<3, 11>), shared connections: none
4. (<3, 0>), shared connections: none
5. (<1, 14>), shared connections: none
6. (<5, 7>), shared connections: none
7. (<6, 2>), shared connections: none
8. (<13, 14>), shared connections: none

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [0].
