Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 2) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 19) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 12) (12, 3) (12, 13) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 18) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 18) (17, 11) (17, 2) (19, 15) (19, 9) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 17) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 19) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (0, 14), (0, 18), (0, 1), (1, 14), (1, 2), (1, 18), (2, 16), (2, 7), (2, 14), (2, 1), (2, 17), 
(3, 9), (3, 5), (3, 12), (4, 7), (4, 9), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 13), (8, 5), (8, 18), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 19),
(5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 6), (6, 10), (6, 14), (6, 5), (6, 18), (10, 11), (10, 6), (11, 16), (11, 10), (11, 18), (11, 17), (12, 3), (12, 13), (13, 8), (13, 12), (14, 0), (14, 6), (14, 1), (14, 2), (15, 19), (16, 11), (16, 2), (17, 11), (17, 2), (18, 11), (18, 8), (18, 0), (18, 6), (18, 1), (19, 15), (19, 9)

Total nodes: 20
Total edges: 60

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will label the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes by degree:
0 (Degree 7)
1 (Degree 5)
3 (Degree 5)
4 (Degree 3)
7 (Degree 5)
9 (Degree 4)
11 (Degree 4)
12 (Degree 3)
13 (Degree 3)
15 (Degree 1)
16 (Degree 2)
17 (Degree 2)
5 (Degree 6)
6 (Degree 5)
8 (Degree 4)
10 (Degree 3)
14 (Degree 5)
18 (Degree 6)
19 (Degree 2)
2 (Degree 7)

Now, let's count the triangles:
[<3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 2>, <3, 12, 13>, <3, 12, 9>, <5, 4, 7>, <11, 10, 6>, <11, 10, 17>, <11, 10, 16>, <11, 18, 0>, <11, 18, 6>, <11, 18, 1>, <11, 18, 14>, <4, 7, 5>, <6, 18, 0>, <6, 18, 1>, <6, 18, 14>, <6, 18, 2>, <14, 0, 1>]

Total number of triangles: [19]
