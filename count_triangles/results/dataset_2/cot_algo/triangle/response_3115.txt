Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 14) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
- Edges:
    - 0: 1, 5, 6, 10
    - 1: 0, 5, 6, 8, 12
    - 2: 3, 7, 8, 12
    - 3: 2, 4, 5, 7, 12
    - 4: 3, 7, 11, 14
    - 5: 0, 1, 3, 8, 13
    - 6: 0, 1, 10, 12
    - 7: 2, 3, 4, 8, 10
    - 8: 1, 2, 5, 7, 13
    - 9: 11
    - 10: 0, 6, 7, 11
    - 11: 4, 9, 10, 13, 14
    - 12: 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 14
    - 13: 5, 8, 11
    - 14: 4, 11, 12

Now, sorting the nodes by their degree from least to most, we get the following order:
9, 0, 2, 13, 4, 6, 10, 5, 14, 1, 12, 7, 3, 8, 11

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and looking at the edges, the triangles found in the graph are:
[15]
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 12>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 12>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 8, 12>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 12, 14>, <4, 7, 10>, <5, 8, 13>, <10, 11, 14>, <11, 12, 14>
