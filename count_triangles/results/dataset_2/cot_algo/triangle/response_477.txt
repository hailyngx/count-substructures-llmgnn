Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 6) (14, 17) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 2) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 14) (13, 10) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 19) (5, 7) (5, 18) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 10) (19, 1) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 0) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 19) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 6) (16, 4) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 4) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 5) (18, 9) (6, 15) (6, 0) (1, 8) (1, 19) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 17) (4, 16) (4, 11) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph can be represented as follows:
0: [9, 11, 0, 6]
1: [8, 19, 1]
2: [3, 14, 17]
3: [15, 2, 18]
4: [16, 11]
5: [7, 18]
6: [15, 0]
7: [12, 15, 5]
8: [11, 1]
9: [18, 11, 0]
10: [15, 13, 19]
11: [8, 9, 0, 4]
12: [7, 18, 19]
13: [14, 10]
14: [17, 2, 13]
15: [3, 10, 7, 6, 18]
16: [4]
17: [14, 19, 2]
18: [3, 15, 12, 5, 9]
19: [17, 12, 10, 1]

Now, let's count the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [34]

Unique triangles:
<0, 9, 11>
<1, 8, 19>
<1, 19, 17>
<1, 19, 12>
<1, 0, 11>
<2, 3, 15>
<2, 3, 18>
<2, 14, 17>
