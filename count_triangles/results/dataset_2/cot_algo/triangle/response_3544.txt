Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 11) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles will be as follows:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections from least to most and relabel them accordingly:\
Node 0 (degree 3), Node 9 (degree 3), Node 14 (degree 2), Node 1 (degree 3), Node 7 (degree 4), Node 8 (degree 3), Node 10 (degree 5), Node 12 (degree 5), Node 11 (degree 5), Node 13 (degree 3), Node 4 (degree 4), Node 6 (degree 5), Node 2 (degree 4), Node 5 (degree 5), Node 3 (degree 6)

2. For each edge, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This ensures that each triangle is only counted once.

3. Check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to find triangles.

Counting triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 2, 7>
- Triangle 3: <0, 2, 12>
- Triangle 4: <0, 5, 7>
- Triangle 5: <0, 5, 10>
- Triangle 6: <0, 5, 12>
- Triangle 7: <1, 2, 4>
- Triangle 8: <1, 2, 7>
- Triangle 9: <1, 2, 12>
- Triangle 10: <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle 11: <1, 3, 13>
- Triangle 12: <1, 4, 8>
- Triangle 13: <2, 5, 7>
- Triangle 14: <2, 5, 10>
- Triangle 15: <2, 5, 12>
- Triangle 16: <2, 6, 14>
- Triangle 17: <3, 6, 13>
- Triangle 18: <3, 7, 13>
- Triangle 19: <4, 5, 10>
- Triangle 20: <4, 5, 12>
- Triangle 21: <5, 7, 10>
- Triangle 22: <5, 7, 12>
- Triangle 23: <7, 12, 0>
- Triangle 24: <7, 12, 2>
- Triangle 25: <10, 12, 0>
- Triangle 26: <10, 12, 2>
