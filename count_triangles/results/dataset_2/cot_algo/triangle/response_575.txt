Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 9) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 9) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 6) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 0) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 10) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 9) (9, 12) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 2) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 14) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. Let's first sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Nodes sorted by degrees:
Node 2: degree 2
Node 11: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 1: degree 5
Node 7: degree 4
Node 13: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5
Node 3: degree 4
Node 8: degree 5
Node 12: degree 6

Now, we will go through the edges in the order specified in the prompt, only considering edges where one endpoint has lower degree than the other. We will count the triangles formed as we iterate through the edges.
