Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 14) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 9) (12, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. 

The sorted list of vertices is: 
Vertex 10 - Degree: 3
Vertex 0 - Degree: 3
Vertex 6 - Degree: 2
Vertex 14 - Degree: 3
Vertex 12 - Degree: 4
Vertex 3 - Degree: 4
Vertex 13 - Degree: 4
Vertex 9 - Degree: 4
Vertex 1 - Degree: 4
Vertex 5 - Degree: 6
Vertex 11 - Degree: 6
Vertex 8 - Degree: 6
Vertex 7 - Degree: 6
Vertex 2 - Degree: 6
Vertex 4 - Degree: 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles found is [9].

The unique triangles are: 
<1, 4, 11>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 9, 12>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 8, 13>
<5, 8, 3>
