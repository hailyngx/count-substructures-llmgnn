Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 2) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 14) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 2) (2, 16) (2, 17) (18, 16) (18, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 19) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 6) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 19) (1, 16) (1, 15) (1, 7) (1, 5) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 8) (19, 12) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 5) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 14) (9, 8) (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 13) (13, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (11, 16), (11, 8), (11, 12), (16, 1), (16, 18), (16, 2), (15, 1), (15, 6), (15, 14), (10, 17), (10, 8), (17, 0), (17, 2), (18, 4), (7, 0), (7, 1), (12, 5), (12, 19), (4, 19), (4, 14), (4, 6), (0, 7), (0, 5), (14, 9), (1, 7), (5, 13)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method by sorting the nodes by their number of connections:
Nodes by degree: [16, 15, 17, 1, 18, 12, 10, 8, 9, 11, 19, 5, 14, 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 13]

Now we will relabel the nodes based on the order:
Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

Next, we will count the triangles:
Triangles: [20]

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 5, 14>, <0, 5, 19>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 14>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 14, 19>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 5, 16>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 14>, <4, 6, 12>, <4, 6, 14>, <5, 12, 19>, <5, 8, 11>, <5, 8, 9>, <5, 11, 16>, <6, 12, 19>, <8, 9, 14>, <14, 15, 1>, <14, 15, 6>
