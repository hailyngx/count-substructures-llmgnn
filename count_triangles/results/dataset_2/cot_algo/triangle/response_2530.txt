Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 4) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 6) (4, 16) (4, 9) (4, 17) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 12) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 12) (17, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 9) (15, 5) (15, 6) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 19) (6, 15) (10, 13) (10, 0) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 18) (7, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 7) (18, 16) (18, 7) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is as follows:
Vertices by degree: {11: 2, 8: 3, 13: 4, 4: 3, 16: 6, 0: 4, 14: 4, 1: 3, 17: 1, 3: 2, 6: 6, 10: 2, 12: 3, 5: 3, 19: 3, 15: 2, 2: 1, 9: 4, 18: 2, 7: 4}

Triangles found based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <6, 13, 19>, <4, 9, 14>
