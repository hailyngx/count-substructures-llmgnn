Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 11) (27, 17) (27, 13) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 21) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 20) (2, 22) (2, 17) (2, 0) (29, 0) (29, 24) (20, 7) (20, 25) (20, 14) (20, 5) (25, 20) (8, 13) (8, 21) (8, 6) (13, 15) (13, 27) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 18) (18, 4) (18, 13) (18, 11) (18, 12) (22, 2) (22, 10) (1, 26) (1, 16) (1, 9) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 11) (21, 4) (21, 8) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 14) (28, 21) (28, 23) (24, 29) (24, 11) (6, 8) (6, 21) (3, 16) (17, 27) (17, 4) (17, 2) (23, 26) (23, 28) (11, 27) (11, 18) (11, 26) (11, 24) (19, 15) (19, 16) (19, 0) (19, 12) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 19) (16, 14) (9, 1) (9, 10) (5, 20) (5, 10) (0, 2) (0, 29) (0, 19) (10, 22) (10, 9) (10, 5) (12, 18) (12, 19) (12, 14) (14, 20) (14, 13) (14, 21) (14, 16) (14, 12) 

Response:
The sorted nodes based on their degrees are as follows: 
Node 3: Degree 1  
Node 7: Degree 2  
Node 23: Degree 2  
Node 28: Degree 2  
Node 5: Degree 3  
Node 9: Degree 3  
Node 10: Degree 3  
Node 22: Degree 3  
Node 29: Degree 3  
Node 15: Degree 4  
Node 24: Degree 4  
Node 1: Degree 5  
Node 8: Degree 5  
Node 4: Degree 6  
Node 6: Degree 6  
Node 26: Degree 6  
Node 2: Degree 7  
Node 18: Degree 7  
Node 25: Degree 7  
Node 11: Degree 8  
Node 17: Degree 8  
Node 12: Degree 9  
Node 19: Degree 9  
Node 21: Degree 9  
Node 13: Degree 10  
Node 16: Degree 10  
Node 0: Degree 11  
Node 20: Degree 11  
Node 14: Degree 12  
Node 27: Degree 12  

After applying the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering the edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections, we find the following unique triangles:  
<2, 10, 22>  
<4, 18, 13>  
<0, 19, 12>  
<13, 18, 14>  

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
