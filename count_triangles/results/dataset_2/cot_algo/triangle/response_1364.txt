Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

The vertices in order of their degrees are: 
```
Vertex 13: Degree 2
Vertex 0: Degree 3
Vertex 8: Degree 3
Vertex 4: Degree 4
Vertex 1: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 4
Vertex 6: Degree 4
Vertex 12: Degree 5
Vertex 7: Degree 5
Vertex 14: Degree 5
Vertex 11: Degree 5
Vertex 10: Degree 5
Vertex 9: Degree 5
Vertex 5: Degree 6
Vertex 2: Degree 7
```
