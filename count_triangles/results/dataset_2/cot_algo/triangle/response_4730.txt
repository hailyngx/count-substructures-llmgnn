Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 12) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 

Node 0: degree 3  
Node 7: degree 3  
Node 14: degree 3  
Node 10: degree 3  
Node 6: degree 4  
Node 13: degree 4  
Node 4: degree 4  
Node 11: degree 4  
Node 5: degree 4  
Node 12: degree 5  
Node 9: degree 5  
Node 8: degree 5  
Node 3: degree 6  
Node 2: degree 6  
Node 1: degree 6  

Next, let's count the triangles:

1. Checking the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
   - Edge (5, 9): 
     - Both nodes 5 and 9 have common neighbors 1 and 3, forming a triangle <5, 9, 1>.
   - Edge (5, 1): No triangle.
   - Edge (5, 3):
     - Both nodes 5 and 3 have common neighbor 1, forming a triangle <5, 3, 1>.
  
2. Total number of triangles: [2]
   
The unique triangles found are: <5, 9, 1>, <5, 3, 1>.
