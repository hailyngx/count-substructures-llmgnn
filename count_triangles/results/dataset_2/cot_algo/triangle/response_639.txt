Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 5) (27, 0) (27, 28) (27, 1) (27, 16) (1, 27) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 17) (25, 26) (25, 21) (25, 10) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 15) (7, 15) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 21) (29, 11) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 4) (26, 25) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 15) (26, 11) (20, 21) (20, 10) (2, 17) (2, 16) (22, 14) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 5) (16, 27) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 14) (23, 26) (23, 10) (23, 9) (28, 0) (28, 27) (28, 8) (28, 4) (28, 5) (6, 17) (6, 4) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 7) (15, 26) (15, 11) (14, 8) (14, 22) (14, 16) (14, 10) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 28) (4, 6) (9, 23) (9, 24) (21, 25) (21, 17) (21, 20) (5, 0) (5, 18) (5, 28) (5, 24) (24, 9) (24, 5) (10, 25) (10, 20) (10, 23) (10, 14) (11, 29) (11, 26) (11, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. Then, for each edge, we check for shared connections between the two vertices to count triangles.

After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the labeled vertices are as follows:
0(4), 1(3), 3(1), 25(3), 8(5), 13(4), 7(1), 17(4), 29(1), 19(3), 26(5), 20(2), 2(2), 22(1), 18(3), 16(4), 23(3), 28(5), 6(2), 15(5), 14(4), 4(4), 9(2), 21(3), 5(4), 24(2), 10(4), 11(3), 12(0).

Calculating the triangles using the given edges:
- <0, 27, 28>
- <0, 27, 15>
- <0, 27, 5>
- <27, 0, 28>
- <27, 0, 15>
- <27, 0, 5>
- <0, 15, 5>
- <27, 1, 8>
- <25, 26, 21>
- <25, 26, 10>
- <8, 13, 1>
- <8, 13, 15>
- <17, 3, 6>
- <17, 3, 21>
- <26, 19, 18>
- <26, 19, 4>
- <19, 18, 5>
- <16, 27, 2>
- <16, 17, 2>
- <16, 27, 14>
- <16, 27, 4>
- <16, 2, 4>

- <28, 8, 4>
- <28, 8, 14>
- <6, 4, 17>
- <15, 26, 11>
- <15, 7, 26>
- <14, 8, 16>
- <14, 8, 10>
- <4, 19, 16>
- <4, 19, 28>

- <10, 25, 14>
- <11, 29, 26>
- <11, 26, 15>

There are a total of 42 triangles. So, the output is [42].
