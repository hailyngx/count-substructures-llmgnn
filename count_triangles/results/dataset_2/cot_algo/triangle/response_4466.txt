Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 1), (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 9), (7, 8), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 9), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 5), (5, 4), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 7), (6, 5), (6, 2), (6, 8), (6, 0), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 0), (8, 7), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 7), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 0), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 2), (0, 9)}

Next, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

Sorted Nodes: {7, 8, 9, 3, 2, 6, 1, 5, 0, 4}

Now, we will start counting the total number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 7]

<1, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<7, 8, 9>
<0, 2, 9>
