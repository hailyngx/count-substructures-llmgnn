Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 3) (27, 5) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 0) (13, 6) (23, 15) (23, 8) (23, 4) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 21) (28, 26) (28, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 16) (19, 21) (19, 6) (19, 9) (14, 15) (14, 26) (14, 22) (14, 9) (16, 13) (16, 1) (21, 26) (21, 19) (21, 2) (21, 17) (29, 1) (2, 21) (2, 5) (2, 20) (2, 11) (5, 27) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (3, 27) (3, 17) (3, 24) (3, 12) (17, 21) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 11) (9, 28) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 17) (9, 25) (25, 9) (25, 12) (22, 14) (24, 13) (24, 3) (24, 10) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 18) (6, 20) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 25) (12, 11) (10, 5) (10, 24) (11, 2) (11, 17) (11, 12) (4, 23) (18, 6) (20, 2) (20, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and then proceed with finding triangles based on the edges provided.

Here is the list of vertices with their respective degrees:
(0: 2), (1: 3), (2: 4), (3: 4), (4: 1), (5: 4), (6: 5), (7: 4), (8: 3), (9: 5), (10: 2), (11: 3), (12: 4), (13: 5), (14: 4), (15: 4), (16: 2), (17: 4), (18: 1), (19: 3), (20: 2), (21: 4), (22: 1), (23: 4), (24: 3), (25: 2), (26: 3), (27: 3), (28: 2), (29: 2)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will find the triangles.
After analyzing the given edges, the total number of triangles present in the graph is [69].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 13, 16>
<0, 13, 24>
<1, 15, 23>
<1, 15, 27>
