Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 15) (16, 9) (16, 5) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 0) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 0) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 10) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 7) (7, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 10) (4, 18) (5, 16) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 15) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 19) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 17) (8, 1) (8, 17) (10, 2) (10, 12) (14, 11) (14, 7) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 8) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7)
(1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 11)
(2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 18)
(3, 0)
(4, 18)
(5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 18) (5, 19)
(6, 0) (6, 9) (6, 15)
(7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 18)
(8, 1) (8, 17)
(9, 6) (9, 13) (9, 15) (9, 16)
(10, 2) (10, 12)
(11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 15) (11, 17)
(12, 7) (12, 10)
(13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 19)
(14, 7) (14, 11)
(15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 11)
(16, 5) (16, 9)
(17, 8) (17, 11) (17, 19)
(18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 7)
(19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 17)

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Sort the nodes by their degrees:
0: 3 connections
3: 1 connection
4: 1 connection
6: 3 connections
8: 2 connections
10: 2 connections
12: 2 connections
14: 2 connections
16: 2 connections
1: 3 connections
7: 4 connections
13: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
5: 7 connections
9: 4 connections
17: 3 connections
11: 4 connections
15: 4 connections
18: 4 connections
19: 3 connections

Relabel the nodes accordingly:
0: 0
3: 1
4: 2
6: 3
8: 4
10: 5
12: 6
14: 7
16: 8
1: 9
7: 10
13: 11
2: 12
5: 13
9: 14
17: 15
11: 16
15: 17
18: 18
19: 19

Now, let's count the triangles:
Triangles: [35]
Unique triangles: <2, 5, 18>, <5, 11, 13>, <6, 7, 10>, <0, 6, 7>, <2, 5, 13>, <0, 6, 15>, <9, 11, 15>, <2, 5, 19>, <9, 13, 19>, <10, 12, 7>, <12, 10, 2>, <15, 9, 5>, <7, 14, 11>, <0, 3, 7>, <9, 6, 15>, <11, 17, 19>, <7, 0, 6>, <11, 1, 14>, <13, 5, 19>, <13, 2, 5>, <18, 2, 4>, <13, 19, 17>, <6, 15, 9>, <0, 7, 14>, <0, 7, 18>, <11, 15, 5>, <17, 8, 1>, <12, 7, 14>, <5, 15, 9>, <7, 14, 12>, <5, 16, 9>, <5, 18, 2>, <5, 13, 9>, <18, 7, 0>, <8, 1, 11>
