Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
Let's organize the given graph with nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 1)
- 1: (5, 1), (1, 0), (1, 8)
- 2: (5, 2), (9, 2), (6, 2), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 4)
- 3: (5, 3), (3, 5), (3, 4)
- 4: (9, 4), (6, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (4, 9), (4, 6)
- 5: (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7), (3, 5), (2, 5), (0, 5), (7, 5)
- 6: (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 4), (7, 6), (4, 6)
- 7: (5, 7), (9, 7), (6, 7), (8, 7), (0, 7), (7, 9)
- 8: (9, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 7)
- 9: (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 7), (8, 9), (8, 2), (7, 9)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 5: 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 1>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 9>
