Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 26) (15, 25) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 12) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 24) (22, 1) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 29) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 7) (20, 23) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 29) (4, 18) (17, 20) (17, 29) (17, 25) (17, 24) (29, 0) (29, 6) (29, 17) (26, 15) (26, 14) (26, 21) (11, 3) (11, 28) (11, 25) (28, 22) (28, 11) (28, 9) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 20) (23, 20) (23, 2) (10, 8) (10, 21) (10, 2) (10, 9) (21, 26) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 14) (14, 5) (14, 26) (14, 21) (14, 1) (25, 15) (25, 17) (25, 11) (24, 22) (24, 17) (24, 2) (12, 18) (12, 21) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 12) (9, 0) (9, 28) (9, 19) (9, 10) (1, 22) (1, 14) (2, 3) (2, 23) (2, 10) (2, 24) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed based on the given information, and the vertices have been relabeled according to the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The graph with relabeled vertices and edges is as follows:
Nodes: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29)
Edges: 
(0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 20) 
(1, 14) (1, 22) 
(2, 23) (2, 24) (2, 10) 
(3, 15) (3, 16) 
(4, 12) (4, 18) 
(5, 6) (5, 19) 
(6, 29) 
(7, 8) (7, 20) 
(8, 10) 
(9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 28) 
(10, 21) 
(11, 25) 
(12, 16) (12, 21) 
(14, 21) 
(15, 19) (15, 26) 
(16, 18) 
(17, 24) (17, 25) (17, 29) 
(18, 22) 
(20, 23) 
(21, 26) 
(22, 28)

Now, let's count the triangles using the described method. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [30]. 

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 24>
<9, 12, 16>
<9, 10, 21>
<17, 21, 24>
<17, 25, 29>
<17, 24, 25>
