Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 4) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 8) (2, 14) (2, 9) (2, 4) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 3) (11, 8) (5, 4) (19, 4) (19, 1) (1, 19) (1, 6) (1, 18) (1, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 8) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (12, 17) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 13) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 18) (15, 0) (15, 9) (9, 2) (9, 15) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 19) (13, 10) (13, 16) (13, 18) (18, 0) (18, 1) (18, 7) (18, 13) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(0, 15), (0, 18), (0, 8)
(1, 19), (1, 6), (1, 18), (1, 7)
(2, 14), (2, 9), (2, 4)
(3, 11), (3, 7)
(4, 5), (4, 19)
(5, 4)
(6, 1), (6, 10), (6, 16), (6, 8)
(7, 3), (7, 1), (7, 10), (7, 18)
(8, 0), (8, 11), (8, 6), (8, 17)
(9, 2), (9, 15)
(10, 6), (10, 7), (10, 13)
(11, 3), (11, 8)
(12, 17), (12, 16)
(13, 10), (13, 16), (13, 18)
(14, 17), (14, 2)
(15, 0), (15, 9)
(16, 17), (16, 6), (16, 12), (16, 13)
(17, 14), (17, 16), (17, 12), (17, 8), (17, 4)
(18, 0), (18, 1), (18, 7), (18, 13)
(19, 4), (19, 1)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their degree in ascending order:
Nodes: 5, 19, 15, 11, 9, 12, 13, 0, 10, 3, 5, 18, 1, 7, 2, 14, 6, 16, 17, 8

Now, we will count the triangles:
Triangles: [<0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 18>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 8, 11>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 10>, <1, 6, 18>, <1, 7, 18>, <2, 4, 14>, <2, 4, 17>, <2, 9, 15>, <4, 17, 14>, <6, 10, 7>, <6, 10, 13>, <6, 16, 17>, <7, 10, 13>, <7, 16, 13>, <8, 11, 3>, <13, 16, 17>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [19].
