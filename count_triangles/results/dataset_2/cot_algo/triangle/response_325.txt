Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 5) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 16) (9, 11) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 16) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (17, 0) (17, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 7) (18, 19) (18, 0) (19, 18) (19, 16) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 2) (14, 11) (7, 1) (7, 11) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 0) (12, 1) (12, 0) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 5) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 5) (5, 15) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: (3, 15), (3, 6), (3, 13), (15, 3), (15, 5), (6, 3), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 16), (9, 11), (8, 6), (8, 13), (8, 1), (13, 3), (13, 8), (13, 16), (10, 1), (10, 4), (10, 2), (17, 0), (17, 4), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 10), (1, 12), (1, 7), (18, 19), (18, 0), (19, 18), (19, 16), (11, 9), (11, 14), (11, 7), (11, 5), (11, 2), (14, 11), (7, 1), (7, 11), (2, 10), (2, 11), (2, 4), (4, 10), (4, 17), (4, 2), (4, 0), (12, 1), (12, 0), (16, 6), (16, 13), (16, 19), (16, 5), (0, 17), (0, 18), (0, 4), (0, 12), (0, 5), (5, 15), (5, 11), (5, 16), (5, 0)

Next, let's apply Degree-Based Ordering algorithm to count the number of triangles: 

Vertices sorted by degree: 

Node 16: degree 4
Node 0: degree 5
Node 10: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 12: degree 2
Node 17: degree 2
Node 18: degree 2
Node 19: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 1: degree 5
Node 12: degree 2
Node 9: degree 1
Node 14: degree 1
Node 3: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 11: degree 5
Node 15: degree 2
