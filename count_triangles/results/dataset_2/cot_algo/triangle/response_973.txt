Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections they have. The sorted list of vertices with their respective degrees is as follows:

(12: 3) (13: 5) (0: 4) (2: 4) (3: 4) (6: 4) (1: 4) (4: 4) (11: 4) (8: 4) (14: 4) (7: 4) (10: 3) (5: 3) (9: 5)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Start with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
    - (12, 0) [3 connections] is valid.
    - (12, 3) [4 connections] is not valid.
    - (0, 8) [4 connections] is not valid.
    - (0, 13) [5 connections] is not valid.
    - (0, 6) [4 connections] is not valid.
    - (13, 5) [3 connections] is valid.
    - (13, 7) [4 connections] is not valid.
    - (13, 0) [4 connections] is not valid.
    - (13, 14) [4 connections] is not valid.
    - (0, 6) [4 connections] is not valid.
    - (14, 5) [3 connections] is valid.
    - (14, 2) [4 connections] is not valid.
    - (14, 6) [4 connections] is not valid.
    - (14, 1) [4 connections] is not valid.
    - (14, 13) [4 connections] is not valid.

2. Based on the valid edges, we can identify the following triangles:
    - <12, 0, 13>
    - <12, 0, 5>
    - <13, 5, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] in this graph.
