Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections). Here is the sorted list of nodes:

Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 6
Node 7: degree 5
Node 4: degree 6
Node 2: degree 6
Node 0: degree 6

Following the method, all edges that connect a vertex with a lower label to a vertex with a higher label will be considered for triangles.
