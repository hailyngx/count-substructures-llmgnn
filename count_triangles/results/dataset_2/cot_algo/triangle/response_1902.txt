Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 11) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 0) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. After renumbering the nodes accordingly, we proceed with counting the triangles formed by shared connections between vertices.

The sorted vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0: connections 5
Vertex 1: connections 1
Vertex 3: connections 3
Vertex 5: connections 3
Vertex 9: connections 4
Vertex 10: connections 4
Vertex 7: connections 4
Vertex 11: connections 4
Vertex 12: connections 5
Vertex 13: connections 4
Vertex 4: connections 5
Vertex 2: connections 5
Vertex 14: connections 2
Vertex 6: connections 6
Vertex 8: connections 5

By checking each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles in the graph: 

The total number of triangles is 5.

Unique triangles:
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 2>
<0, 11, 12>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
