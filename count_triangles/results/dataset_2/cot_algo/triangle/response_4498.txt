Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 13) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (7, 11) (7, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (5, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Here's how we can apply this method to the given graph:

Nodes sorted by their degree:
(0: degree 3), (2: degree 3), (6: degree 2), (7: degree 2), (10: degree 3), (12: degree 3), (8: degree 4), (13: degree 4), (3: degree 4), (11: degree 5), (5: degree 6), (1: degree 7), (4: degree 5), (14: degree 6), (9: degree 3)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles by checking for shared connections.

Total number of triangles: [17]

Unique triangles:
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 13>
<1, 4, 14>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 12>
<1, 9, 13>
<2, 5, 14>
<3, 5, 11>
<4, 9, 13>
<4, 14, 13>
<5, 7, 11>
<5, 8, 10>
<5, 8, 14>
<5, 8, 10>
<8, 10, 11>
<8, 10, 14>
