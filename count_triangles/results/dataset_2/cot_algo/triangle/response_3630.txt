Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first organize the given edges into a clearer format:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (2, 9), (0, 7), (0, 1)
- 1: (5, 7), (2, 1), (1, 0), (4, 1)
- 2: (2, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2), (8, 2), (0, 2)
- 3: (9, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (3, 4)
- 4: (8, 4), (1, 4), (3, 4), (4, 3), (2, 4)
- 5: (5, 7), (5, 1), (2, 5), (6, 5)
- 6: (8, 6), (5, 6)
- 7: (7, 3), (8, 7), (7, 0), (5, 7)
- 8: (6, 8), (2, 8), (8, 7), (8, 3), (4, 8), (8, 2)
- 9: (0, 9), (2, 9), (9, 3)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):
Least to most connected nodes:
6 (Degree: 2)
9 (Degree: 2)
0 (Degree: 3)
1 (Degree: 4)
7 (Degree: 4)
5 (Degree: 4)
3 (Degree: 4)
4 (Degree: 5)
8 (Degree: 6)
2 (Degree: 6)

Next, we will label the nodes based on their new order:
- 6 -> 0
- 9 -> 1
- 0 -> 2
- 1 -> 3
- 7 -> 4
- 5 -> 5
- 3 -> 6
- 4 -> 7
- 8 -> 8
- 2 -> 9

Now, we will count the total number of triangles:
[9] 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 9, 1>, <0, 9, 3>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 0>, <3, 7, 4>
