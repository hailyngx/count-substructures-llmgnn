Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 9) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 14) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections each vertex has. Then, relabel the vertices accordingly starting from 0 to 14. 

The sorted vertex list is as follows:
Node 12 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 4 connections.
Node 0 has 5 connections.
Node 3 has 5 connections.
Node 5 has 5 connections.
Node 6 has 5 connections.
Node 13 has 5 connections.
Node 2 has 6 connections.
Node 1 has 6 connections.
Node 7 has 6 connections.
Node 11 has 6 connections.
Node 9 has 6 connections.
Node 10 has 6 connections.
Node 4 has 7 connections.
Node 14 has 7 connections.

Next, we will go through each edge to count the number of triangles in the graph. Since the vertex with the lower label should have fewer connections, we will only consider edges where this condition is met.

The number of triangles in the graph is [3]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<8, 10, 11>,
<2, 5, 6>,
<2, 1, 9>.
