Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
The graph constructed based on the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 0), (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 2), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 1), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 0), (3, 1), (3, 8), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 6), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 0), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 1), (2, 8), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 1), (0, 6)

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees from least to most connections: 3, 5, 2, 1, 4, 0, 6, 7, 8, 9.

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we can find the triangles formed in the graph. 

After analyzing the graph, the total number of triangles is found to be [5].

The unique triangles are: 
<5, 9, 0>, 
<4, 7, 1>, 
<4, 8, 1>, 
<4, 2, 1>, 
<7, 9, 0>.
