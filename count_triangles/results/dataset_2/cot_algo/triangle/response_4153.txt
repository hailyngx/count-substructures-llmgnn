Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- 0: 6, 2, 3, 1
- 1: 9, 0, 7, 4
- 2: 0, 8, 3, 4
- 3: 9, 0, 2, 8, 7, 4
- 4: 9, 2, 3, 1
- 5: 6, 8
- 6: 9, 5, 7, 0
- 7: 6, 8, 3, 1
- 8: 5, 2, 7, 3
- 9: 6, 4, 3, 1

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

Vertices in order of increasing degree:
0: degree 4
1: degree 4
8: degree 4
5: degree 2
7: degree 4
2: degree 4
4: degree 4
6: degree 4
9: degree 4
3: degree 6

Proceeding with the edges in order:
Edges: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 0), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 1), (5, 6), (5, 8), (0, 6), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 1), (2, 0), (2, 8), (2, 3), (2, 4), (8, 5), (8, 2), (8, 7), (8, 3), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 3), (7, 1), (3, 9), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 4), (1, 9), (1, 0), (1, 7), (1, 4), (4, 9), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 1)

Triangles:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 2, 3>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <3, 4, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
