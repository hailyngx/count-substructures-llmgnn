Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph based on the given edges: 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 5), (4, 2), (7, 5), (7, 8), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 0), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 1), (1, 5), (3, 0)

Next, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
0: 4 connections
1: 3 connections
3: 3 connections
5: 3 connections
7: 3 connections
2: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 5 connections
4: 5 connections

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <0, 3, 1>
4. <0, 5, 1>
5. <5, 4, 7>
6. <0, 3, 8>
7. <0, 5, 6>
8. <0, 1, 6>
9. <3, 8, 1>
10. <3, 8, 6>
11. <3, 5, 1>
12. <3, 5, 6>
13. <4, 7, 9>
14. <4, 7, 8>
15. <5, 7, 8>
16. <5, 1, 8>
17. <0, 6, 1>
18. <0, 6, 9>
19. <3, 1, 8>
20. <3, 6, 8>
21. <4, 9, 8>
22. <5, 1, 8>
23. <5, 9, 8>
24. <6, 9, 8>
25. <1, 6, 8>

There are a total of [25] triangles in the given graph.
