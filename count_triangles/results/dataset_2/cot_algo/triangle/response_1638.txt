Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 1) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 18) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 2) (10, 15) (10, 16) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 15) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 17) (3, 14) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 19) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 16) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (19, 17) (0, 1) (0, 17) (0, 18) (18, 1) (18, 15) (18, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 11), (9, 7), (4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 14), (4, 6), (7, 8), (6, 8), (13, 1), (1, 11), (1, 0), (1, 18), (15, 10), (15, 18), (15, 2), (10, 16), (12, 3), (2, 11), (3, 17), (17, 19), (16, 14), (19, 0)

Next, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 2

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees (from smallest to largest) as follows:
Nodes: 8, 9, 10, 13, 19, 7, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find:
- Number of triangles: [24]
- Unique triangles: <1, 4, 12>, <3, 12, 14>, <4, 6, 7>, <3, 12, 2>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 12>, <4, 7, 12>, <1, 11, 2>, <1, 4, 12>, <4, 6, 14>, <3, 12, 16>, <3, 2, 11>, <4, 6, 16>, <4, 3, 14>, <3, 2, 12>, <3, 14, 16>, <12, 2, 11>, <4, 14, 16>, <3, 17, 16>, <12, 2, 3>, <17, 14, 16>, <2, 11, 14>, <17, 3, 14>, <0, 1, 18>
