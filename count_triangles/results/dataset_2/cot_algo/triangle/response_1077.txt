Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 14) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 6) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 1) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 3) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 13) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: (5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 12), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 14), (9, 8), (9, 10), (9, 13), (4, 1), (10, 11), (10, 6), (10, 2), (11, 14), (11, 0), (8, 14), (8, 3), (12, 0), (2, 6), (3, 14)

We will now sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):

Nodes sorted by degree: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 1, 13, 10, 14, 5, 9, 11

Now, we will count the number of triangles using Degree-Based Ordering:

Total number of triangles: [7]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 6, 1>
<2, 6, 1>
<4, 1, 5>
<8, 3, 14>
<10, 6, 11>
