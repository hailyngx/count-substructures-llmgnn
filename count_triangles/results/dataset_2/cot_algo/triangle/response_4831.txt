Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8

Next, we relabel the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in increasing order:
Node 0 (Degree 4)
Node 2 (Degree 3)
Node 8 (Degree 4)
Node 3 (Degree 4)
Node 6 (Degree 5)
Node 1 (Degree 5)
Node 4 (Degree 5)
Node 7 (Degree 4)
Node 9 (Degree 6)

Now, we proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Check edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:
- Edge (2, 3)
- Edge (0, 1)
- Edge (0, 6)
- Edge (0, 8)

2. Count the number of triangles formed by shared connections:
- Triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 6, 9>

Finally, output the total number of triangles inside brackets []:
