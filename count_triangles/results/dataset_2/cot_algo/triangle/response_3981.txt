Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be represented as below:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: {4, 8, 2, 7, 3}
- 1: {4, 8, 2, 9}
- 2: {9, 8, 1, 0}
- 3: {5, 6, 0, 7}
- 4: {0, 6, 1}
- 5: {9, 6, 3}
- 6: {5, 4, 7}
- 7: {9, 8, 6, 0, 3}
- 8: {2, 0, 1, 7}
- 9: {5, 6, 2, 1, 7}

Now, based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we relabel the vertices as:
0: 3 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 5 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 5 connections

Now, we count the number of triangles by considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- For each edge, we check for shared connections to form triangles.

The total number of triangles []: [6]
Unique triangles found <>: <0, 4, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <6, 7, 9>
