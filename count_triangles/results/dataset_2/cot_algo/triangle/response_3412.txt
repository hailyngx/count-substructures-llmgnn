Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 4), (9, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 5), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 4), (4, 9), (4, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 8), (4, 0), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 0), (8, 7), (2, 6), (2, 1), (2, 7), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 7), (7, 5), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 2), (7, 0)

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes would be as follows:

Nodes:
2, 8, 6, 5, 1, 7, 9, 0, 4, 3

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].

Unique triangles found:
<0, 7, 8>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <4, 7, 8>
