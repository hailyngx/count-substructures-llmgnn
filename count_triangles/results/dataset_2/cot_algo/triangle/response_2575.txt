Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 
Vertex 5: Degree 3
Vertex 6: Degree 3
Vertex 4: Degree 3
Vertex 8: Degree 3
Vertex 7: Degree 4
Vertex 0: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 4
Vertex 1: Degree 5
Vertex 2: Degree 5
Vertex 9: Degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

Triangles:
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 4, 9>
<3, 2, 4>

Total number of triangles: [4]
