Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 1), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 9), (7, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 8), (2, 9), (2, 6), (8, 3), (8, 9), (8, 0), (8, 6), (0, 7), (0, 1), (0, 8), (0, 6), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 8), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 8), (6, 0), (5, 7), (5, 1)

We will now label the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:

Nodes sorted by degree:
2, 5, 4, 8, 0, 7, 6, 3, 1, 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles in the graph:

[Total number of triangles: 15]

<2, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 1>, <0, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 6>
