Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 0) (2, 7) (2, 16) (18, 4) (18, 11) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 16) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 3) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 1) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 17) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 6) (10, 4) (10, 0) (11, 18) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 12) (14, 13) (14, 3) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 6) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 16) (15, 4) (15, 9) (12, 11) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 3) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on the number of connections are:
- Node 7 (Degree: 2)
- Node 8 (Degree: 2)
- Node 18 (Degree: 2)
- Node 12 (Degree: 2)
- Node 14 (Degree: 2)
- Node 2 (Degree: 2)
- Node 17 (Degree: 3)
- Node 10 (Degree: 3)
- Node 15 (Degree: 3)
- Node 1 (Degree: 3)
- Node 6 (Degree: 3)
- Node 19 (Degree: 4)
- Node 5 (Degree: 4)
- Node 16 (Degree: 4)
- Node 11 (Degree: 4)
- Node 3 (Degree: 4)
- Node 9 (Degree: 4)
- Node 0 (Degree: 5)
- Node 13 (Degree: 5)
- Node 4 (Degree: 5)

Therefore, the triangles found in the graph are:
- <2, 7, 5>
- <0, 13, 19>
- <6, 3, 14>
- <0, 4, 10>
- <1, 9, 5>
- <16, 6, 11>
- <17, 16, 6>
- <0, 17, 9>
- <0, 13, 14>
- <16, 17, 6>
- <19, 5, 7>
- <1, 9, 15>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <5, 19, 13>
- <0, 13, 8>
- <3, 19, 11>
- <0, 17, 16>
- <3, 6, 11>
- <4, 0, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [18].
