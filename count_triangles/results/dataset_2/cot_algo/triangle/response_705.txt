Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Here is the sorted list of vertices based on their degrees:
Node 16: 3 connections
Node 18: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 15: 2 connections
Node 12: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 19: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
