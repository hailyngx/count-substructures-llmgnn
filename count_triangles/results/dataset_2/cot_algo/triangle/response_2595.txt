Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 10) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The degree distribution of the nodes is as follows:  
Node 0: 4 connections  
Node 1: 6 connections  
Node 2: 5 connections  
Node 3: 4 connections  
Node 4: 5 connections  
Node 5: 4 connections  
Node 6: 3 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 8: 2 connections  
Node 9: 5 connections  
Node 10: 3 connections  
Node 11: 3 connections  
Node 12: 7 connections  
Node 13: 7 connections  
Node 14: 5 connections  
  
Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start by labeling the vertices from lowest to highest degree.  
The ordered vertices are: 8, 6, 10, 11, 0, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 14, 1, 9, 13, 12.  
  
Next, we check the edges based on the vertex labels and count the triangles.  

Count of triangles: [14]  
Unique triangles:  
<4, 12, 7>  
<1, 9, 2>  
<1, 6, 13>  
<0, 2, 1>  
<0, 12, 4>  
<0, 9, 4>  
<3, 7, 12>  
<3, 7, 9>  
<3, 11, 2>  
<5, 8, 14>  
<5, 10, 14>  
<9, 1, 13>  
<9, 2, 13>  
<13, 6, 1>
