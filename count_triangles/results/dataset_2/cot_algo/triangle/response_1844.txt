Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by degree are as follows:
Node 5: 5 edges
Node 9: 4 edges
Node 7: 4 edges
Node 8: 4 edges
Node 1: 4 edges
Node 6: 4 edges
Node 3: 4 edges
Node 0: 4 edges
Node 4: 3 edges
Node 2: 3 edges

Now, we will check for triangles:
