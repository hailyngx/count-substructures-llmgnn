Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 11) (8, 2) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 4) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows based on the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: 7, 4, 6, 1
- 1: 11, 2, 7, 4
- 2: 9, 8, 3, 1
- 3: 5, 12, 2, 6, 4
- 4: 10, 0, 1, 6, 14, 3
- 5: 9, 13, 3, 7
- 6: 12, 0, 3, 4
- 7: 5, 0, 1
- 8: 11, 2
- 9: 5, 13, 2, 11, 12
- 10: 11, 4, 13
- 11: 9, 10, 1, 13, 8
- 12: 9, 14, 6, 3
- 13: 5, 9, 10, 11, 14
- 14: 12, 13, 4

Next, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles found: 
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 4, 14>
- <1, 2, 11>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 14>
- <3, 6, 12>
- <4, 10, 13>
- <4, 11, 13>
- <9, 11, 13>
