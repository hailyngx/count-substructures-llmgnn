Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 16) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 1) (2, 5) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 4) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 12) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 17) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 19) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 16) (19, 18) (19, 1) (19, 3) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (15, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (0, 10) (0, 4) (11, 9) (11, 7) (3, 19) (3, 10) (3, 14) (14, 8) (14, 3) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 17) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves the following steps:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
Nodes: 5, 6, 8, 14, 15, 4, 0, 3, 11, 19, 10, 7, 12, 17, 16, 1, 18, 13, 2, 9

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
Nodes: 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

3. Analyze the edges based on the relabelled vertices and count the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 10>
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 10, 3>
<1, 7, 19>
<2, 4, 18>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 10, 3>
<2, 18, 6>
<3, 10, 2>
<3, 14, 8>
<3, 19, 1>
<4, 0, 2>
<4, 2, 18>
<4, 14, 8>
<5, 2, 9>
<6, 9, 11>
<7, 9, 11>
<7, 1, 19>
<8, 13, 17>
<8, 14, 3>
<8, 14, 15>
<10, 0, 3>
<13, 8, 17>
<16, 13, 17>
<16, 6, 18>
<17, 13, 16>
<18, 2, 6>
