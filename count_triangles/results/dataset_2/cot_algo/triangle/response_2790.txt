Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 11) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 10) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 10) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then, relabel the vertices accordingly. 

Here are the vertices labeled from least connections to most connections:

0 -> 3 connections
13 -> 3 connections
10 -> 4 connections
11 -> 4 connections
1 -> 4 connections
8 -> 4 connections
4 -> 5 connections
3 -> 6 connections
12 -> 6 connections
7 -> 6 connections
9 -> 6 connections
6 -> 6 connections
2 -> 7 connections
5 -> 7 connections
14 -> 7 connections

Next, we will follow the method to count the number of triangles in the graph. Let's calculate it.
