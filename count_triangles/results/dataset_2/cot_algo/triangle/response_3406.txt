Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 13) (16, 8) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 16) (13, 14) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 19) (17, 8) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 12) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 2) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 1) (1, 17) (1, 18) (1, 15) (3, 14) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 1) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 19) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 5) (14, 13) (14, 3) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 0) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 19) 

Response:
The graph after sorting the vertices based on their degrees is as follows:
Nodes: [7, 3, 6, 5, 14, 16, 13, 1, 15, 2, 12, 19, 10, 17, 9, 4, 18, 11, 8, 0]
Edges: (6, 9) (9, 6) (5, 2) (2, 5) (13, 14) (14, 13) (1, 17) (17, 1) (12, 10) (10, 12) (19, 2) (2, 19) (17, 12) (12, 17) (16, 13) (13, 16) (15, 1) (1, 15) (8, 7) (7, 8) (4, 9) (9, 4) (18, 1) (1, 18) (10, 19) (19, 10) (8, 16) (16, 8) (14, 3) (3, 14) (18, 11) (11, 18) (5, 12) (12, 5) (0, 8) (8, 0) (17, 8) (8, 17) (15, 4) (4, 15) (10, 17) (17, 10) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 0) (0, 4) (15, 11) (11, 15) (0, 5) (5, 0) (4, 18) (18, 4) (0, 19) (19, 0) (8, 0) (0, 8) (10, 18) (18, 10) (11, 0) (0, 11) (8, 17) (17, 8) (17, 10) (10, 17) (1, 18) (18, 1)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Total number of triangles: [12]
Unique triangles found: <8, 16, 13>, <1, 15, 4>, <1, 18, 10>, <1, 17, 12>, <1, 18, 4>, <10, 17, 12>, <12, 10, 17>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 19, 10>, <0, 8, 17>, <0, 8, 16>, <0, 4, 18>
