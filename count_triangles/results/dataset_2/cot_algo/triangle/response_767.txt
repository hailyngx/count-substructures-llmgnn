Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 28) (9, 27) (26, 20) (1, 14) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 12) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 28) (18, 13) (11, 13) (11, 20) (28, 9) (28, 18) (28, 17) (28, 24) (5, 21) (13, 18) (13, 11) (13, 29) (13, 6) (7, 25) (7, 3) (7, 24) (25, 7) (25, 15) (15, 25) (15, 16) (15, 23) (16, 21) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 29) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 0) (10, 19) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 12) (24, 28) (24, 7) (24, 19) (19, 10) (19, 24) (19, 22) (19, 2) (22, 19) (22, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 22) (3, 17) (17, 28) (17, 3) (17, 23) (17, 27) (2, 19) (2, 27) (27, 9) (27, 17) (27, 2) (27, 29) (29, 13) (29, 16) (29, 27) (23, 18) (23, 15) (23, 17) (23, 20) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 18) (20, 26) (20, 21) (20, 11) (20, 23) (20, 12) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 20) 

Response:
The nodes can be relabeled based on their degree in ascending order as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 4
- Node 20: degree 5
- Node 21: degree 4
- Node 22: degree 2
- Node 23: degree 4
- Node 24: degree 4
- Node 25: degree 2
- Node 26: degree 1
- Node 27: degree 4
- Node 28: degree 5
- Node 29: degree 4

With the relabeled nodes, analyzing the edges based on the condition that for each edge, the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles is [24].
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 6, 12>
<0, 8, 14>
<0, 8, 16>
<0, 10, 19>
<0, 12, 6>
<1, 4, 14>
<2, 19, 22>
<3, 17, 28>
<3, 7, 24>
<3, 22, 2>
<4, 8, 14>
<6, 12, 0>
<6, 13, 18>
<7, 24, 19>
<8, 14, 18>
<8, 14, 4>
<8, 16, 15>
<13, 6, 12>
<13, 18, 14>
<16, 15, 23>
<16, 29, 13>
<17, 28, 18>
