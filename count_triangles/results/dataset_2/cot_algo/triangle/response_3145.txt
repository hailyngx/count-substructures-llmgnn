Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 19) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 19) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 6) (2, 13) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 7) (4, 9) (4, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 19) (7, 18) (7, 0) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 6) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 3) (16, 14) (16, 12) (3, 5) (3, 12) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 11) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 0) (15, 13) (15, 0) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) 

Response:
The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
0: 5
1: 4
2: 3
3: 3
4: 3
5: 3
6: 4
7: 3
8: 3
9: 4
10: 4
11: 3
12: 3
13: 4
14: 5
15: 2
16: 3
17: 4
18: 2
19: 5

The vertices sorted by their degrees are:
15, 18
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16
0, 6, 9, 17
14, 19

The triangles formed are:
<0, 5, 10>
<0, 5, 19>
<0, 6, 10>
<0, 6, 19>
<0, 9, 14>
<0, 10, 19>
<1, 8, 13>
<4, 9, 11>
<6, 10, 11>
<6, 10, 17>
<6, 11, 17>
<9, 14, 19>

The total number of triangles is [12].
