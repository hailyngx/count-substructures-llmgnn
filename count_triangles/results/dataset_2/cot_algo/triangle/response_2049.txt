Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 4), (6, 1), (6, 0), (4, 8), (8, 1), (2, 4), (0, 7), (7, 1), (3, 9), (2, 8), (4, 6), (8, 3), (3, 0)}

Next, let's sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:

Nodes by degree: [0, 7, 1, 2, 8, 3, 6, 4, 9, 5]

Now, we will proceed through the given edges and count the triangles formed:

1. Edge (5, 9): Both nodes have 4 connections. No triangle.
2. Edge (5, 2): Node 2 has 3 connections. No triangle.
3. Edge (5, 3): Node 3 has 3 connections. Triangle <3, 5, 2>.
4. Edge (5, 7): Node 7 has 2 connections. No triangle.
5. Edge (9, 6): Node 6 has 3 connections. Triangle <6, 9, 4>.
6. Edge (9, 4): Node 4 has 5 connections. No triangle.
7. Edge (6, 1): Node 1 has 3 connections. Triangle <1, 6, 4>.
8. Edge (6, 0): Node 0 has 3 connections. Triangle <0, 6, 4>.
9. Edge (4, 8): Node 8 has 4 connections. Triangle <8, 4, 2>.
10. Edge (8, 1): Node 1 has 3 connections. Triangle <1, 8, 2>.
11. Edge (2, 4): Node 4 has 5 connections. No triangle.
12. Edge (0, 7): Node 7 has 2 connections. No triangle.
13. Edge (7, 1): Node 1 has 3 connections. Triangle <1, 7, 0>.
14. Edge (3, 9): Node 9 has 4 connections. No triangle.
15. Edge (2, 8): Node 8 has 4 connections. No triangle.
16. Edge (4, 6): Node 6 has 3 connections. Triangle <6, 4, 1>.
17. Edge (8, 3): Node 3 has 3 connections. Triangle <3, 8, 4>.
18. Edge (3, 0): Node 0 has 3 connections. Triangle <0, 3, 7>.

Finally, we found 7 triangles in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
