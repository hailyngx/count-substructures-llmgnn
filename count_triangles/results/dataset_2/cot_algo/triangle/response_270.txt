Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will now be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph. 

Nodes and their respective degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: Degree 5
- Node 1: Degree 4
- Node 2: Degree 4
- Node 3: Degree 3
- Node 4: Degree 4
- Node 5: Degree 6
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 3
- Node 8: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 3

Sorting nodes based on degree:
1. Node 3, Node 7, Node 9
2. Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 6, Node 8
3. Node 0
4. Node 5

Triangles found using the given edges:
- Triangle <0, 1, 7>
- Triangle <0, 1, 2>
- Triangle <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle <1, 2, 8>
- Triangle <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle <5, 6, 8>
- Triangle <5, 6, 9>
- Triangle <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle <1, 4, 8>
- Triangle <2, 4, 1>
- Triangle <6, 7, 1>

Number of triangles in the graph: [14]
