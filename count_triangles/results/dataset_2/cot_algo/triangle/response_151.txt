Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph based on the provided edges:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: 
    - 0: (7, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0)
    - 1: (9, 1), (4, 1), (6, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (0, 1)
    - 2: (9, 2), (4, 2), (1, 2), (8, 2)
    - 3: (5, 3), (7, 3), (1, 3)
    - 4: (7, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4)
    - 5: (9, 5), (6, 5), (3, 5), (7, 5)
    - 6: (5, 6), (7, 6), (1, 6)
    - 7: (5, 7), (4, 7), (0, 7), (3, 7), (6, 7), (8, 7)
    - 8: (9, 8), (7, 8), (2, 8), (0, 8)
    - 9: (5, 9), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 1)

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Vertices sorted by degree: (0, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (8, 4), (4, 5), (6, 5), (9, 5), (1, 6), (5, 6), (7, 6)

Number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
