Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 12) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 13) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (3, 9) (3, 13) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 14) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (7, 10) (7, 12) (8, 11) (8, 4) (9, 11) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 12)

Next, we will count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Sorted Nodes based on their degree:
Degree 1: 0, 7
Degree 2: 1, 3, 5, 8, 13
Degree 3: 2, 10, 14
Degree 4: 4, 9
Degree 5: 6, 11, 12

Triangles:
Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: 
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 9, 14>
<3, 0, 9>
<4, 8, 11>
<4, 13, 5>
<5, 12, 13>
