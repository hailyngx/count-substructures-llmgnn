Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 14) (16, 10) (3, 15) (3, 1) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 7) (8, 11) (8, 19) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 14) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (17, 19) (17, 18) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 0) (18, 17) (18, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 0) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 9) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 13) (12, 10) (2, 0) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 19) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps to efficiently count the number of triangles in the graph.

First, let's sort the vertices by their degree (number of connections):
Nodes sorted by degree:
```
2: 1 connections
3: 2 connections
12: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
17: 2 connections
18: 2 connections
5: 3 connections
1: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
13: 4 connections
10: 4 connections
4: 5 connections
7: 5 connections
0: 5 connections
19: 5 connections
14: 5 connections
16: 5 connections
11: 6 connections
15: 6 connections
9: 6 connections
```

Now, we'll go through each edge starting from the one with the vertex having the lower label and count the triangles:
```
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 15>
<1, 7, 14>
<4, 10, 16>
<4, 10, 19>
<4, 18, 19>
<5, 7, 15>
<5, 9, 15>
<7, 9, 19>
```

Total number of triangles: `[11]`
