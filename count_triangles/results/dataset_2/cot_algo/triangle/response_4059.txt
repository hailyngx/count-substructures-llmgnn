Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and the given 40 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 7),
(9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 0),
(6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4),
(4, 6), (4, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2),
(8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 1),
(2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 3),
(0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 3),
(7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 0),
(1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 4), (1, 8),
(3, 6), (3, 4), (3, 2), (3, 0)

Next, let's relabel the vertices based on their degree:
Nodes sorted by degree: 8, 5, 7, 6, 4, 1, 0, 9, 2, 3
Relabeled nodes: 
0 (degree 3), 1 (degree 5), 2 (degree 4), 3 (degree 4), 4 (degree 4), 5 (degree 3), 6 (degree 4), 7 (degree 3), 8 (degree 3), 9 (degree 5)

Now, let's count the number of triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Number of triangles: [18]
Unique triangles: <1, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 8, 2>, <1, 8, 0>, <2, 9, 1>, <2, 9, 6>, <2, 9, 3>, <2, 9, 4>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 1>, <3, 4, 2>, <3, 0, 8>, <3, 0, 7>, <4, 6, 1>, <4, 6, 3>, <5, 9, 1>
