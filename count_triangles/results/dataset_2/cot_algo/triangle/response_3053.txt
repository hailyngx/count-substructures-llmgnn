Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree in increasing order, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 4: 7 connections

Considering only the edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:
- Edge: (4, 7) forms triangle with: (4, 9, 7)
- Edge: (4, 9) forms triangle with: (4, 7, 9)
- Edge: (4, 5) does not form a triangle as node 4 has more connections.
- Edge: (4, 6) forms triangle with: (4, 7, 6)
- Edge: (4, 3) does not form a triangle as node 4 has more connections.
- Edge: (0, 7) does not form a triangle as node 7 has more connections.
- Edge: (0, 5) forms triangle with: (0, 4, 5)
- Edge: (0, 1) does not form a triangle as node 0 has more connections.
- Edge: (0, 6) forms triangle with: (0, 4, 6)
- Edge: (0, 9) does not form a triangle as node 9 has more connections.
- Edge: (3, 8) forms triangle with: (3, 6, 8)
- Edge: (3, 9) does not form a triangle as node 3 has more connections.
- Edge: (2, 9) forms triangle with: (2, 4, 9)
- Edge: (2, 3) does not form a triangle as node 2 has more connections.
- Edge: (1, 5) does not form a triangle as node 1 has more connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6] and the unique triangles found are:
<4, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 0>, <4, 7, 6>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 9>.
