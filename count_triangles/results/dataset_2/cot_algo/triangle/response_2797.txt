Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 11) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 8) (14, 12) (14, 9) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 18) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 18) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 13) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (5, 2) (5, 16) (6, 13) (6, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 16) (15, 7) (15, 13) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 13) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 18) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 10) 

Response:
The graph with nodes and edges can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:  
(4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 11)  
(8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0)  
(7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 9)  
(12, 7) (12, 14)  
(0, 8)  
(14, 12) (14, 9)  
(3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 18)  
(1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 18)  
(17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 13)  
(13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 6)  
(2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9)  
(5, 2) (5, 16)  
(6, 13) (6, 10)  
(9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 16)  
(15, 7) (15, 13)  
(19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 13)  
(16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 10)  
(10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 18)  
(18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 10)  

Now, let's label the nodes based on their degree from lowest to highest:

Nodes: 5, 0, 6, 12, 14, 3, 4, 7, 15, 2, 13, 10, 19, 16, 18, 1, 11, 17, 8, 9

Next, we count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles found: 
<3, 9, 16>
<1, 17, 18>
<0, 10, 16>
<9, 13, 16>
<1, 10, 18>
<3, 11, 18>
<9, 13, 7>
<4, 9, 14>
<2, 3, 9>
<9, 11, 18>
