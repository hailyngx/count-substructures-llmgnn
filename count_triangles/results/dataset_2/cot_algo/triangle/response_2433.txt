Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 6) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by the number of connections are:

0 - 4 connections
3 - 2 connections
10 - 2 connections
12 - 4 connections
13 - 3 connections
2 - 4 connections
5 - 5 connections
8 - 5 connections
6 - 4 connections
11 - 3 connections
9 - 5 connections
1 - 4 connections
7 - 5 connections
4 - 5 connections
14 - 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles by considering the edges in the specified order.

Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles found: <1, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 14>, <6, 9, 14>, <8, 9, 12>, <8, 9, 14>
