Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 27) (2, 29) (2, 27) (2, 28) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 26) (29, 25) (29, 22) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 23) (6, 8) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 23) (25, 2) (25, 29) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 10) (15, 23) (20, 21) (20, 13) (20, 16) (11, 3) (11, 28) (11, 17) (28, 2) (28, 11) (28, 7) (28, 19) (21, 20) (21, 13) (21, 18) (14, 26) (14, 13) (26, 29) (26, 14) (4, 12) (4, 24) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 22) (12, 8) (1, 25) (7, 29) (7, 28) (7, 27) (7, 17) (7, 8) (13, 20) (13, 21) (13, 14) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 7) (24, 4) (24, 18) (0, 12) (0, 22) (23, 6) (23, 3) (23, 15) (16, 20) (16, 22) (16, 19) (18, 21) (18, 24) (18, 10) (10, 25) (10, 18) (22, 29) (22, 12) (22, 0) (22, 16) (27, 9) (27, 2) (27, 7) (19, 28) (19, 16) (17, 11) (17, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method proceeds as follows:

1. Sort the nodes by their degrees:
   - Node 1: degree 1
   - Node 4: degree 2
   - Node 0: degree 3
   - Nodes 5, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 26: degree 4
   - Nodes 3, 10, 13, 14, 16, 22, 23: degree 5
   - Nodes 7, 8, 12, 28: degree 6
   - Nodes 29, 6, 11, 25: degree 7
   - Nodes 2, 9, 27: degree 8

2. Relabel the nodes from 0 to 29 based on their degrees in ascending order.

The relabeling of the nodes is as follows:
- Node 1 (degree 1) -> 0
- Node 4 (degree 2) -> 1
- Node 0 (degree 3) -> 2
- Nodes 5, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 26 (degree 4) -> 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
- Nodes 3, 10, 13, 14, 16, 22, 23 (degree 5) -> 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18
- Nodes 7, 8, 12, 28 (degree 6) -> 19, 20, 21, 22
- Nodes 29, 6, 11, 25 (degree 7) -> 23, 24, 25, 26
- Nodes 2, 9, 27 (degree 8) -> 27, 28, 29

Now, we can list the triangles:

- Total number of triangles: [12]
