Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 15) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 19) (3, 12) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 2) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 18) (1, 8) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 19) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 9) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 7) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 10) (7, 4) (5, 15) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 18) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 4) (12, 3) (12, 14) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 0) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 13) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 18) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph based on the provided edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: 11, 4, 18
- 1: 3, 5, 8, 18
- 2: 4, 13, 15
- 3: 1, 10, 12, 19
- 4: 0, 2, 7, 8
- 5: 1, 13, 15, 18
- 6: 
- 7: 4, 10
- 8: 1, 4, 13, 18
- 9: 16, 17, 19
- 10: 3, 7, 13, 16
- 11: 0
- 12: 3, 14
- 13: 2, 5, 10, 19
- 14: 12, 18
- 15: 2, 5, 16
- 16: 9, 10, 15
- 17: 9
- 18: 1, 4, 5, 8, 14, 0
- 19: 3, 9, 13

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree from least to most:

Nodes in Degree-Based Ordering: 6, 11, 17, 14, 7, 12, 0, 2, 16, 5, 17, 6, 8, 1, 9, 13, 10, 18, 3, 4, 19

Now, we count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 16]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 1, 3>, 
<0, 1, 4>, 
<0, 1, 8>, 
<0, 4, 7>, 
<0, 4, 8>, 
<1, 3, 10>, 
<1, 5, 13>, 
<1, 5, 18>, 
<2, 4, 13>, 
<3, 10, 13>, 
<3, 12, 14>, 
<5, 13, 18>, 
<9, 16, 17>, 
<9, 16, 15>, 
<10, 13, 19>, 
<14, 18, 5>
