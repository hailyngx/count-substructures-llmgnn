Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 19) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 9) (4, 12) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 10) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 15) (0, 4) (0, 2) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 19) (9, 12) (9, 18) (9, 14) (1, 2) (1, 5) (19, 7) (19, 16) (19, 17) (5, 3) (5, 1) (8, 3) (8, 16) (8, 10) (6, 4) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 2) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 15) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 10) (15, 11) (15, 14) (15, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (10, 18) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

- Node 7 has 3 connections.
- Node 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19 have 4 connections.
- Node 0, 1, 2, 10, 13, 15, 17 have 3 connections.

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:

- Node 7 -> 0
- Node 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19 -> 1
- Node 0, 1, 2, 10, 13, 15, 17 -> 2

Next, we will consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This will ensure that each triangle is only counted once. 

Now, let's count the triangles formed by shared connections:

- For edge (7, 12): Shared connections with 12 are 4 and 19; hence, we have one triangle: <0, 4, 19>.
- For edge (7, 11): Shared connections with 11 are 3 and 15; hence, we have one triangle: <0, 3, 15>.
- For edge (12, 4): Shared connections with 4 are 0 and 18; hence, we have one triangle: <1, 0, 18>.
- For edge (12, 13): No triangle formed.
- For edge (12, 17): Shared connections with 17 are 16 and 19; hence, we have one triangle: <1, 16, 19>.
- For edge (12, 9): No triangle formed.
- For edge (4, 18): No triangle formed.
- For edge (4, 0): Shared connections with 0 are 2 and 6; hence, we have one triangle: <1, 2, 6>.
- For edge (4, 6): No triangle formed.

Counting the triangles, we find a total of 4 triangles:
