Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 14) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 6) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 8) 

Response:
The given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be presented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 2), (5, 11), (5, 4), (5, 10), (9, 2), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 13), (7, 1), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 11), (1, 10), (3, 8), (8, 6), (8, 12), (0, 14), (14, 11), (14, 2), (13, 12), (6, 12), (11, 14)

To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method. The vertices are relabeled based on their degree in ascending order.

Node Degrees:
0: 1
1: 4
2: 4
3: 2
4: 5
5: 6
6: 3
7: 2
8: 4
9: 4
10: 2
11: 4
12: 5
13: 3
14: 3

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes sorted by degree: 0, 3, 7, 10, 13, 14, 6, 1, 2, 8, 9, 11, 4, 12, 5

Triangles found (listed uniquely):
<1, 10, 14>, <3, 1, 4>, <10, 1, 4>, <13, 12, 4>, <13, 4, 5>, <14, 11, 5>, <14, 2, 5>

Total number of triangles: [7]
