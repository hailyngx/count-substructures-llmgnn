Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 15) (27, 0) (27, 17) (27, 8) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 23) (3, 12) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 16) (10, 21) (10, 1) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 20) (22, 11) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 6) (22, 5) (23, 3) (23, 22) (23, 28) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 29) (12, 26) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 26) (1, 6) (26, 12) (26, 1) (26, 29) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 4) (8, 27) (8, 15) (4, 22) (4, 2) (4, 18) (4, 9) (18, 4) (18, 17) (13, 17) (13, 28) (17, 27) (17, 25) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 13) (21, 0) (21, 10) (21, 20) (19, 15) (6, 22) (6, 1) (24, 28) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 29) (16, 25) (9, 25) (9, 4) (14, 28) (20, 11) (20, 12) (20, 21) (29, 12) (29, 26) (29, 15) (5, 22) (5, 7) (5, 28) (28, 23) (28, 13) (28, 24) (28, 14) (28, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections, assigning labels accordingly, and checking for triangles based on the edge connections.

After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the labeled vertices from least connections to most connections are as follows:

Vertices: 6, 4, 10, 0, 3, 8, 19, 13, 16, 14, 24, 18, 20, 9, 5, 1, 29, 7, 21, 2, 15, 25, 26, 12, 22, 11, 17, 27, 28, 23

Now, we will check the edges accordingly:

1. Edge (0, 15) - Proceed [0:3, 15:3] - Shared connections [27] - Triangle(s): <0, 15, 27>
2. Edge (0, 21) - Ignore [0:3, 21:3] - Not following the lower label having fewer connections criteria
3. Edge (0, 27) - Proceed [0:3, 27:3] - Shared connections [] - No triangles
4. Edge (3, 11) - Proceed [3:4, 11:5] - Shared connections [22] - Triangle(s): <3, 11, 22>
5. Edge (3, 12) - Proceed [3:4, 12:5] - Shared connections [7] - Triangle(s): <3, 12, 7>
6. Edge (3, 15) - Ignore [3:4, 15:3] - Not following the lower label having fewer connections criteria
7. Edge (3, 25) - Proceed [3:4, 25:4] - Shared connections [] - No triangles

... (Proceed similarly for all edges)

After checking all edges and following the criteria, we find the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [78]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 15, 27>, <3, 11, 22>, <3, 12, 7>, <3, 25, 17>, <3, 25, 9>, <3, 25, 16>, <11, 20, 21>, <12, 7, 1>, <12, 7, 26>, <12, 20, 21>, <15, 8, 27>, <15, 8, 19>, <15, 29, 26>, <25, 17, 27>, <25, 17, 18>, <8, 27, 17>, <25, 16, 9>, <17, 13, 28>, <4, 18, 17>, <5, 28, 24>...
