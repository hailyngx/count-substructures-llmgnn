Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 3) 

Response:
The nodes and their connections are as follows:
0: 6, 8, 9
1: 4, 6, 8
2: 3, 4, 6, 7
3: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
4: 1, 2, 3, 8
5: 9
6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
7: 2, 3, 6, 9
8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
9: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted nodes are:
0: 3 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 5 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 1 connection
6: 6 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 5 connections
9: 5 connections

The triangles formed by the shared connections are:
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
