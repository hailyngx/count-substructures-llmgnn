Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 3) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 5) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 14) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 10) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows:
Node 10: degree 1
Node 9: degree 2
Node 8: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 1: degree 5
Node 12: degree 5
Node 13: degree 5
Node 4: degree 6
Node 7: degree 6
Node 11: degree 6
Node 14: degree 6
Node 5: degree 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

1. Checking edge (4, 7): Node 4 has 6 connections, and Node 7 has 6 connections. Since Node 7 has the lower label, proceed.
2. Shared connections between Node 4 and Node 7 are: 8, 0. Therefore, triangle <4, 7, 8> and <4, 7, 0> are found.

3. Checking edge (4, 8): Node 4 has 6 connections, and Node 8 has 3 connections. Since Node 8 has the lower label, proceed.
4. Shared connections between Node 4 and Node 8 are: 7. Therefore, triangle <4, 8, 7> is found.

5. Checking edge (4, 0): Node 4 has 6 connections, and Node 0 has 4 connections. Since Node 0 has the lower label, proceed.
6. Shared connections between Node 4 and Node 0 are: 12. Therefore, triangle <4, 0, 12> is found.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 8, 7>, <4, 0, 12>
