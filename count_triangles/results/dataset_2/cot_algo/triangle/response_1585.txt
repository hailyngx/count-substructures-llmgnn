Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in non-decreasing order. Let's label the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 6 (Degree: 2)
Node 8 (Degree: 3)
Node 5 (Degree: 4)
Node 3 (Degree: 4)
Node 7 (Degree: 4)
Node 1 (Degree: 5)
Node 0 (Degree: 5)
Node 9 (Degree: 5)
Node 4 (Degree: 5)
Node 2 (Degree: 5)

Now, we will consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (6, 1) - Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 1, 6>
2. Edge (6, 3) - Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 3, 6>
3. Edge (8, 3) - Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 3, 8>
4. Edge (5, 4) - Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 7: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 7>
5. Edge (3, 2) - Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 2, 3>
6. Edge (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
7. Edge (0, 2) - Forms a triangle with node 1: <0, 1, 2>
8. Edge (0, 1) - Forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 7: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>
9. Edge (0, 7) - Forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 4: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 1>
10. Edge (0, 4) - No triangle formed.

Thus, the total number of triangles is [6] and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 2, 3>.
