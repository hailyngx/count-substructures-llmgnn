Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 24) (11, 0) (16, 15) (16, 2) (15, 16) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 7) (15, 6) (27, 15) (27, 7) (2, 16) (2, 20) (2, 3) (29, 28) (29, 19) (3, 2) (3, 25) (3, 4) (25, 3) (25, 24) (20, 2) (20, 14) (5, 24) (6, 15) (6, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (26, 19) (26, 22) (26, 17) (28, 11) (28, 29) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 23) (19, 29) (19, 26) (19, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 18) (4, 23) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 21) (22, 26) (22, 10) (22, 12) (0, 11) (0, 28) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 20) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (10, 6) (10, 22) (21, 18) (8, 28) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 12) (24, 11) (24, 25) (24, 5) (17, 26) (17, 12) (17, 23) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 12) (23, 15) (23, 28) (23, 4) (23, 17) (23, 13) (7, 15) (7, 27) (7, 18) (12, 22) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 9) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 23) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows a systematic approach to count the triangles in the given graph. 

Here is the list of vertices sorted by their number of connections (degree) in ascending order:
Vertex 5: degree 1
Vertex 27: degree 2
Vertex 21: degree 2
Vertex 5: degree 2
Vertex 16: degree 2
Vertex 25: degree 2
Vertex 29: degree 2
Vertex 9: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 3
Vertex 18: degree 3
Vertex 22: degree 3
Vertex 10: degree 3
Vertex 17: degree 3
Vertex 26: degree 3
Vertex 0: degree 4
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 3: degree 4
Vertex 20: degree 4
Vertex 15: degree 5
Vertex 28: degree 5
Vertex 4: degree 5
Vertex 13: degree 5
Vertex 11: degree 5
Vertex 24: degree 5
Vertex 2: degree 5
Vertex 14: degree 5
Vertex 19: degree 5
Vertex 8: degree 5
Vertex 12: degree 5
Vertex 23: degree 6

By selecting only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can examine the triangles. 

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [34].
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 14, 20>
<0, 14, 8>
<11, 24, 28>
<0, 8, 12>
<1, 4, 9>
