Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 4) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 2) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their degrees. The vertices are relabeled accordingly:

0 (degree 4), 1 (degree 5), 2 (degree 5), 3 (degree 5), 4 (degree 5), 5 (degree 4), 6 (degree 4), 7 (degree 2), 8 (degree 4), 9 (degree 3), 10 (degree 2), 11 (degree 5), 12 (degree 3), 13 (degree 5), 14 (degree 4)

Now, let's check the edges in increasing order of the vertex labels:

Edges to consider: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 7), (1, 12), (1, 14), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 14), (3, 12), (3, 13), (4, 6), (4, 13), (5, 8), (5, 14), (6, 8), (6, 11), (7, 11), (8, 12), (8, 13), (9, 10), (10, 13), (11, 13)

Triangles found: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 14>, <1, 3, 12>, <1, 3, 13>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 14>, <3, 12, 13>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 13, 5>, <5, 8, 13>, <6, 8, 13>, <11, 13, 3>

Total number of triangles: [12]
