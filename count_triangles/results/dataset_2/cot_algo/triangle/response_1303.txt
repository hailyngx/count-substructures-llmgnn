Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 17) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 0) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 18) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 15) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 14) (11, 9) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 2) (16, 17) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 19) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 3) (19, 9) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 19) (17, 4) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 18) (9, 11) (9, 19) (9, 2) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 17) (1, 8) (1, 10) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree centrality are: 
Vertex 4 (degree 4) < Vertex 8 (degree 3) < Vertex 0 (degree 5) < Vertex 7 (degree 5) < Vertex 6 (degree 3) < Vertex 10 (degree 3) < Vertex 19 (degree 5) < Vertex 15 (degree 4) < Vertex 12 (degree 3) < Vertex 14 (degree 3) < Vertex 2 (degree 3) < Vertex 9 (degree 3) < Vertex 17 (degree 4) < Vertex 18 (degree 3) < Vertex 1 (degree 2) < Vertex 5 (degree 2) < Vertex 11 (degree 2) < Vertex 3 (degree 2) < Vertex 16 (degree 1) < Vertex 13 (degree 0)

The triangles formed in this graph and their counts based on the Degree-Based Ordering method are:
