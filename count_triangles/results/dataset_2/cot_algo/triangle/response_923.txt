Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective connections are as follows:
Node 0: 1, 3, 9, 2
Node 1: 4, 3, 2, 5, 0, 8
Node 2: 4, 1, 3, 5, 0
Node 3: 1, 0, 9, 2
Node 4: 7, 8, 9, 1, 2
Node 5: 1, 6, 2
Node 6: 5, 8
Node 7: 4, 8
Node 8: 4, 7, 1, 6, 9
Node 9: 4, 3, 8, 0

Following the degree-based ordering, we will start counting triangles with edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 3>
3. <0, 1, 5>
4. <0, 2, 4>
5. <0, 2, 5>
6. <0, 3, 9>
7. <1, 4, 8>
8. <1, 5, 2>
9. <2, 4, 8>
10. <3, 9, 0>
11. <4, 7, 8>
12. <4, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [12]
