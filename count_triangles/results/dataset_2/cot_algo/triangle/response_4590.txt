Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 26) (16, 11) (16, 24) (2, 29) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 5) (1, 26) (1, 25) (1, 19) (1, 22) (26, 11) (26, 1) (26, 0) (17, 29) (17, 7) (5, 29) (5, 24) (6, 24) (6, 19) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 21) (21, 3) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 12) (21, 18) (10, 21) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 14) (8, 11) (8, 27) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 23) (25, 1) (25, 27) (25, 4) (25, 22) (25, 14) (27, 21) (27, 8) (27, 25) (24, 16) (24, 5) (24, 6) (24, 22) (24, 20) (4, 2) (4, 25) (4, 22) (22, 1) (22, 25) (22, 24) (22, 4) (7, 17) (7, 20) (7, 18) (20, 24) (20, 7) (9, 2) (9, 28) (9, 12) (28, 9) (28, 14) (0, 26) (0, 15) (0, 12) (18, 21) (18, 7) (18, 12) (13, 11) (23, 19) (12, 21) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 18) (14, 15) (14, 25) (14, 28) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method aims to count the number of triangles efficiently by using the least connected nodes first. 

Here is the list of vertices with their degrees sorted in increasing order:

Vertices:
(13) - degree: 1
(16) - degree: 1
(23) - degree: 1
(27) - degree: 3
(7) - degree: 3
(9) - degree: 3
(5) - degree: 3
(6) - degree: 3
(17) - degree: 3
(29) - degree: 4
(0) - degree: 4
(10) - degree: 4
(14) - degree: 4
(15) - degree: 4
(18) - degree: 4
(1) - degree: 4
(3) - degree: 4
(2) - degree: 4
(8) - degree: 4
(24) - degree: 5
(4) - degree: 5
(26) - degree: 5
(25) - degree: 6
(20) - degree: 2
(21) - degree: 6
(28) - degree: 2
(19) - degree: 3
(11) - degree: 6
(22) - degree: 5

After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This helps us avoid counting triangles multiple times. 

By following this approach, the total number of triangles in the provided graph is: [26]

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
