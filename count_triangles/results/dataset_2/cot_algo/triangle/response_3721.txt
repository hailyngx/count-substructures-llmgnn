Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 29) (2, 29) (2, 15) (29, 22) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 18) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 16) (8, 25) (8, 17) (23, 8) (23, 20) (23, 12) (12, 23) (12, 27) (12, 10) (27, 12) (27, 7) (27, 9) (27, 1) (1, 27) (1, 26) (1, 11) (26, 1) (26, 10) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 3) (18, 29) (18, 4) (18, 11) (6, 15) (28, 16) (28, 24) (17, 29) (17, 8) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 21) (9, 22) (9, 27) (9, 17) (9, 3) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 5) (16, 8) (16, 28) (16, 10) (7, 27) (7, 3) (7, 14) (10, 12) (10, 26) (10, 16) (10, 25) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 7) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 17) (20, 23) (20, 24) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 21) (0, 5) (0, 21) (21, 17) (21, 14) (21, 0) (15, 2) (15, 6) (15, 25) (24, 28) (24, 20) (25, 8) (25, 10) (25, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method proceeds as follows:

1. Identify the number of connections each node has:
   - Node 0: 2 connections
   - Node 1: 3 connections
   - Node 2: 2 connections
   - Node 3: 3 connections
   - Node 4: 4 connections
   - Node 5: 2 connections
   - Node 6: 2 connections
   - Node 7: 3 connections
   - Node 8: 5 connections
   - Node 9: 4 connections
   - Node 10: 4 connections
   - Node 11: 4 connections
   - Node 12: 3 connections
   - Node 13: 3 connections
   - Node 14: 3 connections
   - Node 15: 3 connections
   - Node 16: 3 connections
   - Node 17: 5 connections
   - Node 18: 4 connections
   - Node 19: 2 connections
   - Node 20: 3 connections
   - Node 21: 3 connections
   - Node 22: 4 connections
   - Node 23: 3 connections
   - Node 24: 2 connections
   - Node 25: 3 connections
   - Node 26: 2 connections
   - Node 27: 4 connections
   - Node 28: 2 connections
   - Node 29: 4 connections

2. Arrange the nodes in increasing order based on their connections:
   Node 0, 2, 5, 6, 19, 1, 3, 7, 12, 23, 24, 26, 28, 15, 16, 20, 14, 21, 13, 22, 4, 9, 10, 18, 11, 25, 17, 8, 27, 29

3. Count the triangles by examining each edge. Proceed only if the lower labeled node has fewer connections:
   - <1, 27, 9>
   - <1, 27, 7>
   - <3, 4, 18>
   - <3, 7, 27>
   - <3, 7, 14>
   - <3, 9, 22>
   - <3, 9, 17>
   - <7, 14, 21>
   - <8, 13, 22>
   - <8, 16, 28>
   - <8, 16, 10>
   - <8, 16, 25>
   - <8, 17, 29>
   - <8, 17, 11>
   - <8, 17, 9>
   - <8, 17, 21>
   - <11, 1, 27>
   - <11, 13, 22>
   - <11, 13, 8>
   - <11, 17, 21>
   - <13, 8, 17>
   - <13, 22, 9>
   - <27, 1, 26>
   - <29, 2, 15>
   - <29, 2, 17>
   - <29, 2, 18>
   - <29, 4, 18>
   - <29, 4, 22>
   - <29, 18, 11>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [27].
