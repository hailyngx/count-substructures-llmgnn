Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:  
Node 1: 2 connections  
Node 0: 3 connections  
Node 7: 3 connections  
Node 8: 3 connections  
Node 6: 3 connections  
Node 4: 4 connections  
Node 3: 4 connections  
Node 2: 5 connections    
Node 9: 5 connections  
Node 5: 5 connections  

Identifying triangles based on the ordering we have:  
1. Triangle <1, 0, 2>  
2. Triangle <1, 0, 9>  
3. Triangle <1, 2, 3>  
4. Triangle <1, 2, 9>  
5. Triangle <0, 2, 3>  
6. Triangle <7, 8, 4>  
7. Triangle <7, 8, 5>  
8. Triangle <7, 4, 5>  
9. Triangle <8, 4, 5>  
10. Triangle <8, 5, 9>  
11. Triangle <4, 5, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
