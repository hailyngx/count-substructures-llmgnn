Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 6) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 2) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort the nodes by the number of connections from least to most:
Node 5 - 4 connections
Node 9 - 5 connections
Node 4 - 4 connections
Node 8 - 5 connections
Node 7 - 4 connections
Node 12 - 5 connections
Node 3 - 2 connections
Node 11 - 3 connections
Node 0 - 6 connections
Node 10 - 3 connections
Node 2 - 4 connections
Node 6 - 3 connections
Node 14 - 3 connections
Node 13 - 5 connections
Node 1 - 4 connections

2. Relabel the nodes in increasing order: 
Node 3 - 1 connection
Node 11 - 2 connections
Node 10 - 3 connections
Node 6 - 4 connections
Node 14 - 5 connections
Node 2 - 6 connections
Node 1 - 7 connections
Node 7 - 8 connections
Node 5 - 9 connections
Node 8 - 10 connections
Node 4 - 11 connections
Node 13 - 12 connections
Node 0 - 13 connections
Node 12 - 14 connections
Node 9 - 15 connections

3. Count the triangles:
After checking all the edges and shared connections between the lower labeled nodes, we find the following triangles:
<3, 4, 11>, <0, 10, 13>, <0, 6, 12>, <0, 1, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
