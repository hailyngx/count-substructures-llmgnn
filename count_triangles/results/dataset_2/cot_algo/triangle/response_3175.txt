Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 12) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 14) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 8) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 2) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 10) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 6) (1, 8) (1, 19) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 1) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 10) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 12) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:
Nodes sorted by number of connections:
Node 16 (degree 2) -> relabeled as node 0
Node 11 (degree 2) -> relabeled as node 1
Node 13 (degree 2) -> relabeled as node 2
Node 4 (degree 2) -> relabeled as node 3
Node 6 (degree 3) -> relabeled as node 4
Node 1 (degree 3) -> relabeled as node 5
Node 9 (degree 3) -> relabeled as node 6
Node 5 (degree 3) -> relabeled as node 7
Node 8 (degree 4) -> relabeled as node 8
Node 2 (degree 4) -> relabeled as node 9
Node 17 (degree 4) -> relabeled as node 10
Node 19 (degree 4) -> relabeled as node 11
Node 7 (degree 4) -> relabeled as node 12
Node 12 (degree 5) -> relabeled as node 13
Node 10 (degree 5) -> relabeled as node 14
Node 0 (degree 5) -> relabeled as node 15
Node 3 (degree 5) -> relabeled as node 16
Node 14 (degree 5) -> relabeled as node 17
Node 15 (degree 5) -> relabeled as node 18
