Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 11) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 8) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 12) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 12) 

Response:
The given graph with nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: 9, 4, 7, 8
- 1: 11
- 2: 9, 13
- 3: 5, 6, 14, 12
- 4: 5, 7, 0, 14
- 5: 9, 11, 4, 3, 10
- 6: 7, 3, 12
- 7: 4, 0, 6, 10, 14
- 8: 10, 11, 0, 12
- 9: 5, 2, 14, 10, 13, 0
- 10: 5, 9, 7, 8
- 11: 5, 8, 1, 13, 12
- 12: 8, 6, 11, 3, 13
- 13: 9, 2, 11, 12
- 14: 9, 4, 7, 3

After sorting vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are:
Nodes: 1, 2, 0, 6, 8, 3, 13, 7, 12, 11, 10, 4, 14, 9, 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:
- <1, 2, 9>
- <1, 2, 13>
- <1, 11, 13>
- <2, 9, 13>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <0, 6, 12>
- <3, 6, 12>
- <4, 7, 14>
- <2, 9, 14>
- <4, 7, 10>
- <4, 7, 0>
- <5, 9, 10>
- <5, 9, 14>
- <5, 3, 12>
- <5, 11, 13>
- <9, 8, 10>
- <9, 8, 11>
- <10, 8, 11>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [18].
