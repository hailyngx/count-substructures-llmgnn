Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 9) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are:
Vertex 3 has degree 3.
Vertex 5 has degree 2.
Vertices 2, 5, and 6 have degree 4.
Vertices 11, 1, and 9 have degree 5.
Vertices 8 and 13 have degree 6.
Vertices 0, 10, and 12 have degree 7.
Vertex 4 has degree 8.
Vertex 7 has degree 9.
Vertex 14 has degree 3.
