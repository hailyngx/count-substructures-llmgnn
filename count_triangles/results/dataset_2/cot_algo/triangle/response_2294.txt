Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 1) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 13), (4, 14), (7, 4), (7, 11), (7, 9), (7, 2), (7, 1), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 14), (1, 13), (3, 1), (3, 11), (3, 10), (3, 9), (3, 5), (3, 12), (10, 3), (10, 11), (10, 0), (10, 8), (11, 7), (11, 3), (11, 10), (11, 5), (11, 12), (8, 4), (8, 10), (8, 9), (8, 5), (8, 0), (8, 12), (5, 3), (5, 11), (5, 8), (13, 4), (13, 1), (13, 2), (13, 14), (0, 10), (0, 8), (9, 7), (9, 3), (9, 8), (9, 14), (6, 1), (14, 4), (14, 1), (14, 13), (14, 9), (2, 7), (2, 1), (2, 13), (12, 3), (12, 11), (12, 8)

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes by degree: [0<2<6<12<9<5<10<13<14<2<4<6<8<1<3]

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 8, 12>, <0, 8, 14>, <6, 1, 8>, <8, 9, 14>, <9, 3, 11>, <5, 3, 11>
