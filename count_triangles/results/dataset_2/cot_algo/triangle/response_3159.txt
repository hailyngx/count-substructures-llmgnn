Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 1) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 12) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 7), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 11), (9, 1), (6, 9), (6, 14), (6, 4), (6, 13), (4, 9), (4, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (8, 10), (8, 3), (0, 4), (0, 14), (0, 10), (0, 12), (0, 1), (14, 6), (14, 0), (14, 3), (14, 7), (13, 6), (13, 10), (10, 8), (10, 0), (10, 13), (10, 12), (10, 1), (10, 2), (2, 4), (2, 10), (2, 12), (2, 3), (2, 7), (12, 0), (12, 10), (12, 2), (12, 11), (12, 1), (3, 8), (3, 14), (3, 2), (3, 7), (7, 5), (7, 14), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 11), (11, 9), (11, 12), (11, 7), (1, 9), (1, 0), (1, 10), (1, 12)

Now, we will perform the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

Degree of each node:
Node 0: 6, Node 1: 5, Node 2: 5, Node 3: 5, Node 4: 5, Node 5: 2, Node 6: 5, Node 7: 5, Node 8: 2, Node 9: 5, Node 10: 6, Node 11: 3, Node 12: 5, Node 13: 2, Node 14: 5

Relabeled vertices based on degree (from lowest degree to highest degree):
Nodes: 5, 8, 13, 0, 11, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 10

Triangles found (in the format <vertex1, vertex2, vertex3>):
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 4, 10>
<0, 4, 14>
<0, 10, 12>
<0, 10, 1>
<0, 10, 2>
<1, 10, 12>
<2, 4, 10>
<2, 4, 12>

<3, 7, 2>
<3, 8, 10>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 13>
<6, 9, 13>
<7, 11, 14>
<10, 12, 1>

Total number of triangles: [22]
