Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps us count the number of triangles. Let's follow the steps outlined earlier.

First, let's list the nodes and their respective degree:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, we'll relabel the nodes based on their degree starting with the node with the lowest degree:
- Node 0 -> Node A
- Node 3 -> Node B
- Node 2 -> Node C
- Node 6 -> Node D
- Node 7 -> Node E
- Node 8 -> Node F
- Node 9 -> Node G
- Node 5 -> Node H
- Node 4 -> Node I
- Node 1 -> Node J

After relabeling, the edges become:
- (A, D) (A, B) (A, F)
- (B, A) (B, J) (B, I)
- (C, H) (C, D) (C, E)
- (D, C) (D, J) (D, F)
- (E, C) (E, G) (E, I)
- (F, A) (F, D) (F, J) (F, I)
- (G, E) (G, J)
- (H, G) (H, I)
- (I, H) (I, E) (I, F) (I, B)
- (J, G) (J, I)

Now we'll count the triangles:
- Triangle <D, A, J>
- Triangle <D, F, J>
- Triangle <F, A, J>
- Triangle <F, D, J>
- Triangle <D, A, F>

There are [5] triangles in total.
