Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 5: degree 4  
Node 8: degree 4  
Node 9: degree 3  
Node 4: degree 4  
Node 7: degree 4  
Node 2: degree 6  
Node 1: degree 4  
Node 6: degree 4  
Node 3: degree 4  
Node 0: degree 4  

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 9: degree 3  
Node 5: degree 4  
Node 8: degree 4  
Node 4: degree 4  
Node 7: degree 4  
Node 1: degree 4  
Node 6: degree 4  
Node 0: degree 4  
Node 3: degree 4  
Node 2: degree 6  

Now, let's count the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 7>
4. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
5. Triangle <1, 2, 9>
6. Triangle <1, 5, 9>
7. Triangle <1, 2, 6>
8. Triangle <3, 7, 4>
9. Triangle <3, 0, 7>
10. Triangle <3, 2, 8>
11. Triangle <4, 2, 7>
12. Triangle <4, 6, 7>
13. Triangle <5, 1, 9>
14. Triangle <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
