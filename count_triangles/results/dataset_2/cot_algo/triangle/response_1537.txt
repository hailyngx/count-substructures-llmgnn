Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 10: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 12: 5 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 4: 3 connections

Using the degree-based ordering, we will go through the edges to count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 13, 7>
<4, 9, 13>
<2, 7, 12>
<0, 10, 11>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2,  14>
<4, 6, 12>
<6, 10, 12>
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 10>
