Node 5: Degree 1
Node 15: Degree 2
Node 16: Degree 2
Node 11: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 21: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 13: Degree 3
Node 17: Degree 3
Node 25: Degree 2
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 23: Degree 3
Node 12: Degree 4
Node 27: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 22: Degree 3
Node 29: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 20: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 26: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 5
Node 14: Degree 4
Node 28: Degree 4
Node 19: Degree 4
Node 24: Degree 2

Considering the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections, we can count the triangles in the graph:

[Total number of triangles: 53]
