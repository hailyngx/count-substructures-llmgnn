Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 15) (16, 28) (16, 22) (16, 20) (2, 3) (29, 1) (29, 26) (29, 3) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 24) (21, 7) (21, 0) (21, 22) (21, 24) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 24) (10, 20) (3, 2) (3, 29) (3, 6) (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 9) (0, 18) (0, 23) (18, 0) (18, 26) (26, 29) (26, 18) (26, 27) (26, 17) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 23) (15, 17) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 6) (17, 26) (17, 15) (17, 13) (17, 12) (28, 16) (28, 8) (28, 23) (8, 28) (8, 24) (8, 20) (8, 12) (8, 1) (1, 29) (1, 8) (24, 7) (24, 21) (24, 10) (24, 8) (24, 25) (23, 0) (23, 15) (23, 28) (23, 4) (4, 23) (4, 9) (4, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 27) (19, 13) (22, 16) (22, 21) (22, 6) (27, 26) (27, 9) (27, 14) (14, 27) (14, 5) (12, 17) (12, 8) (25, 24) (20, 16) (20, 10) (20, 8) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 22) (5, 4) (5, 14) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is as follows:
Vertices: 19 < 18 < 2 < 5 < 7 < 11 < 12 < 25 < 1 < 13 \
         < 16 < 17 < 10 < 20 < 21 < 22 < 23 < 26 < 28 < 29 \
         < 3 < 4 < 6 < 8 < 14 < 15 < 0 < 9 < 24 < 27

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph.

There are a total of 16 triangles in this graph.

[16]  

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 7, 21>
<0, 7, 24>
<0, 9, 4>
<0, 9, 27>
<0, 21, 22>
<0, 21, 24>
<0, 21, 7>
<0, 9, 27>
<0, 24, 8>
<1, 8, 28>
<1, 29, 3>
<4, 9, 27>
<5, 4, 9>
<6, 13, 17>
<10, 15, 11>
<10, 15, 17>
