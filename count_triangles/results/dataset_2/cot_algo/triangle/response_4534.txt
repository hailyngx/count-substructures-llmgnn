Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 2, 7, 6
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 2, 6
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 1, 3, 0
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 8, 2
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 1, 6
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 0, 3
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 0, 7, 1
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 0, 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 0, 6, 3
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 7

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees from least to most:

Nodes in order of degree: 5, 7, 1, 9, 2, 4, 8, 6, 0, 3

Now, let's count the triangles using the degree-based ordering method:

Triangles:
- <5, 0, 3>
- <5, 1, 6>
- <7, 0, 6>

Total number of triangles: [3]
