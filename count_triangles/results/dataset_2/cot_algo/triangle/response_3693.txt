Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 28) (27, 26) (20, 15) (20, 8) (20, 9) (25, 13) (25, 2) (15, 20) (15, 26) (15, 8) (28, 0) (28, 27) (28, 29) (28, 2) (29, 28) (29, 18) (29, 3) (22, 24) (26, 27) (26, 15) (9, 20) (9, 13) (9, 23) (3, 29) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 19) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 18) (23, 17) (23, 13) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 1) (16, 3) (16, 21) (16, 8) (21, 0) (21, 27) (21, 16) (17, 23) (18, 29) (18, 3) (18, 23) (18, 19) (18, 24) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 10) (19, 6) (1, 12) (1, 24) (2, 25) (2, 28) (8, 20) (8, 15) (8, 16) (8, 24) (24, 22) (24, 18) (24, 1) (24, 8) (24, 7) (7, 24) (13, 25) (13, 9) (13, 23) (5, 4) (5, 10) (10, 19) (10, 5) (10, 14) (14, 19) (14, 10) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their degree:

Vertices by degree (ascending order):
0, 1, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 17, 20, 22, 10, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21, 25, 3, 8, 9, 12, 13, 19, 23, 26, 11, 27, 24, 29, 28

Now, we will relabel the vertices according to their degree (starting from 0 for the lowest degree vertex 0):

0 -> 0, 1 -> 1, 5 -> 2, 7 -> 3, 2 -> 4, 4 -> 5, 6 -> 6, 17 -> 7, 20 -> 8, 22 -> 9, 10 -> 10, 14 -> 11, 15 -> 12, 16 -> 13, 18 -> 14, 21 -> 15, 25 -> 16, 3 -> 17, 8 -> 18, 9 -> 19, 12 -> 20, 13 -> 21, 19 -> 22, 23 -> 23, 26 -> 24, 11 -> 25, 27 -> 26, 24 -> 27, 29 -> 28, 28 -> 29

Now, we will consider each edge to count the triangles:
Total triangles: [48]
