Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 12) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) 

Response:
The sorted vertices with their degrees are:  
- Vertex 5 (degree 5)
- Vertex 6 (degree 3)
- Vertex 9 (degree 3)
- Vertex 14 (degree 3)
- Vertex 10 (degree 3)
- Vertex 4 (degree 4)
- Vertex 8 (degree 4)
- Vertex 3 (degree 4)
- Vertex 0 (degree 5)
- Vertex 11 (degree 5)
- Vertex 7 (degree 5)
- Vertex 12 (degree 5)
- Vertex 1 (degree 5)
- Vertex 13 (degree 5)
- Vertex 2 (degree 3)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and the rule to proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the triangles present in the graph:
