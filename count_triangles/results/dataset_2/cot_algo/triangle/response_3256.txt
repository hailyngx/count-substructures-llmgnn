Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are:

Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 5: degree 5
Node 4: degree 6
Node 2: degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:

1. Since node 0 has the fewest connections, we check its edges: (0, 4), (0, 8)
2. No triangles are formed from node 0.

3. Next, we move to node 1 and check its edges: (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 8)
4. No triangles are formed from node 1.

5. Next, we move to node 9 and check its edges: (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 2)
6. No triangles are formed from node 9.

7. Next, we move to node 8 and check its edges: (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 0)
8. No triangles are formed from node 8.

9. Next, we move to node 7 and check its edges: (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 2)
10. Triangles are formed with node 3 and node 4: <3, 4, 7>

11. Next, we move to node 6 and check its edges: (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 3)
12. Triangle is formed with node 3 and node 7: <3, 6, 7>

13. Next, we move to node 3 and check its edges: (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 6)
14. 2 triangles are formed: <3, 4, 7> and <3, 6, 7>

15. Next, we move to node 5 and check its edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 4)
16. Triangle is formed with node 2 and node 4: <2, 4, 5>
17. Triangle is formed with node 4 and node 8: <4, 5, 8>
18. Triangle is formed with node 5 and node 8: <5, 8, 9>

19. Finally, we move to node 2 and check its edges: (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 1)
20. 2 triangles are formed: <2, 4, 5> and <2, 4, 7>

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 7>
