The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 1) (26, 9) (26, 20) (3, 27) (3, 23) (3, 5) (15, 8) (15, 25) (15, 13) (15, 12) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 11) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 22) (17, 11) (0, 14) (0, 24) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 19) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 11) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 13) (28, 6) (28, 17) (22, 17) (22, 2) (22, 29) (21, 5) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 16) (29, 9) (29, 22) (29, 24) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 22) (2, 13) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 4) (11, 24) (11, 25) (24, 0) (24, 29) (24, 11) (24, 7) (24, 12) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 16) (20, 26) (20, 19) (27, 3) (27, 7) (23, 3) (23, 12) (25, 15) (25, 11) (5, 3) (5, 21) (12, 15) (12, 24) (12, 23) (16, 8) (16, 1) (7, 18) (7, 24) (7, 27) (13, 15) (13, 18) (13, 2) (19, 14) (19, 20) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed with 30 nodes and 90 edges. 

To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices by their degree:

Vertex 7: Degree 3
Vertex 5: Degree 2
Vertex 16: Degree 2
Vertex 19: Degree 2
Vertex 21: Degree 2
Vertex 27: Degree 2
Vertex 3: Degree 3
Vertex 23: Degree 2
Vertex 20: Degree 3
Vertex 4: Degree 4
Vertex 22: Degree 4
Vertex 14: Degree 2
Vertex 0: Degree 4
Vertex 25: Degree 3
Vertex 1: Degree 3
Vertex 18: Degree 4
Vertex 13: Degree 3
Vertex 2: Degree 4
Vertex 9: Degree 5
Vertex 26: Degree 2
Vertex 10: Degree 3
Vertex 17: Degree 4
Vertex 6: Degree 3
Vertex 28: Degree 3
Vertex 11: Degree 4
Vertex 24: Degree 5
Vertex 8: Degree 4
Vertex 15: Degree 4
Vertex 29: Degree 3
Vertex 12: Degree 3

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the total number of triangles in the graph to be [ <0, 2, 24>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 11>, <0, 4, 24>, <0, 8, 15>, <0, 8, 24>, <0, 14, 19>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 4, 16>, <2, 4, 11>, <2, 4, 13>, <2, 4, 18>, <2, 11, 24>, <2, 13, 18>, <4, 11, 24>, <8, 15, 24>, <10, 17, 28>, <10, 17, 11>, <10, 18, 13>, <11, 17, 28>, <11, 17, 25>, <11, 18, 13>, <11, 18, 24>, <12, 15, 24>, <12, 15, 23>, <18, 13, 2>, <18, 13, 15>, <18, 13, 2>, <18, 13, 15>]. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [28].
