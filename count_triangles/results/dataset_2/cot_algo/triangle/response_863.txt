Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 10) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 11) (6, 13) (6, 10) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 9) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. The sorted order of vertices with their corresponding connections is as follows:

0: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
14: 3 connections
9: 4 connections
3: 5 connections
7: 5 connections
8: 5 connections
1: 6 connections
5: 6 connections
13: 6 connections
12: 6 connections
11: 6 connections
10: 8 connections
4: 8 connections
2: 8 connections

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles.

Total number of triangles: [37]

Unique triangles:

<0, 5, 9>
