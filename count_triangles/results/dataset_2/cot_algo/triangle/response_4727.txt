Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 16) (17, 6) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 3) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 4) (3, 18) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 13) (9, 8) (9, 3) (19, 15) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 13) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 13) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 16) (16, 10) (16, 5) (16, 4) (13, 11) (13, 15) (13, 6) (13, 1) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 16) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
(10, 4), (10, 5), (10, 16), (17, 6), (2, 18), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 15), (18, 3), (7, 12), (12, 11), (8, 9), (0, 3), (14, 1), (3, 9), (11, 13), (19, 15), (6, 14)

After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labeling is: 
{4, 0, 5, 17, 18, 19, 6, 7, 16, 2, 1, 15, 13, 14, 8, 9, 10, 11, 3, 12}

Upon examining the edges that meet the condition "the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections," we find the triangles: 
[23]

The unique triangles are: 
<1, 3, 9>
