Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Constructing the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges based on the provided information:

Node 0: Connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 2
Node 1: Connected to nodes 5, 3, 2
Node 2: Connected to nodes 6, 1, 3, 4, 0
Node 3: Connected to nodes 5, 6, 1, 2, 8
Node 4: Connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, 0, 2
Node 5: Connected to nodes 9, 1, 4, 0, 3, 7
Node 6: Connected to nodes 9, 3, 2
Node 7: Connected to nodes 5, 4
Node 8: Connected to nodes 9, 3, 4
Node 9: Connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, 0

Now, let's list the nodes in Degree-Based Ordering (from least connections to most):
Nodes in order: 7, 1, 6, 8, 9, 0, 4, 2, 3, 5

Checking the edges based on the order and identifying triangles:

1. Edge (7, 4) [Node 7 < Node 4]
   Shared connections: 5
   Triangle: <4, 5, 7>

2. Edge (1, 3) [Node 1 < Node 3]
   Shared connections: 5
   Triangle: <1, 3, 5>

3. Edge (6, 2) [Node 6 < Node 2]
   Shared connections: None

4. Edge (8, 9) [Node 8 < Node 9]
   Shared connections: None

5. Edge (9, 6) [Node 6 < Node 9]
   Shared connections: None

6. Edge (0, 2) [Node 0 < Node 2]
   Shared connections: 4
   Triangle: <0, 2, 4>

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <4, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 5>
