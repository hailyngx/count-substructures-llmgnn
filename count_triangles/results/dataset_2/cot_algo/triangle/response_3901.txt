Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) 

Response:
Nodes with their corresponding edges:
0: 7, 1, 2, 8, 9
1: 7, 9, 0
2: 4, 6, 8, 0
3: 6, 9, 8
4: 7, 2, 9, 6
6: 4, 7, 3, 2
7: 4, 0, 6, 9, 1, 8
8: 7, 3, 2, 9, 0
9: 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, 0

Considering the degree-based ordering method:
Nodes sorted by degree: 1, 3, 2, 8, 6, 0, 4, 9, 7
