Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 14) (9, 7) (9, 11) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 6) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 4) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Let's relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertices sorted by degree:
0 (degree 4)
9 (degree 2)
1 (degree 3)
6 (degree 4)
12 (degree 3)
5 (degree 4)
4 (degree 3)
8 (degree 3)
11 (degree 4)
10 (degree 4)
13 (degree 5)
2 (degree 5)
7 (degree 6)
14 (degree 5)
3 (degree 5)

Now, we will check each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Triangles:
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 6, 2>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 6, 11>
<9, 11, 7>
<9, 11, 1>
<1, 7, 2>
