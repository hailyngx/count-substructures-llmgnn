Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 15) (16, 4) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 12) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 13) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 5) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 4) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 13) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 2) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 8) (10, 4) (8, 6) (8, 10) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 12) (4, 16) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 12) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 4) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 7), (0, 19), (1, 4), (1, 11), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 17), (3, 9), (3, 12), (3, 15), (4, 10), (4, 12), (4, 16), (4, 17), (5, 13), (5, 14), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 13), (8, 10), (9, 13), (9, 15), (10, 13), (10, 15), (11, 15), (12, 19), (13, 15), (14, 16), (14, 19), (15, 3), (15, 10), (15, 13), (16, 4), (16, 14), (17, 2), (17, 4), (17, 19)

Next, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

Vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most:
Sorted: 18, 16, 0, 6, 8, 5, 7, 12, 18, 2, 11, 1, 3, 6, 13, 7, 11, 4, 14, 4

Now, we can list the triangles found:
Triangles: <6, 9, 13>, <4, 10, 17>, <4, 12, 19>, <13, 15, 10>, <9, 15, 3>, <9, 15, 13>, <2, 5, 13>, <1, 4, 17>

The total number of triangles is [8].
