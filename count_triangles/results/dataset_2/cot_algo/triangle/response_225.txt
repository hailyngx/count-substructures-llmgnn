Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 9) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (10, 8) (10, 6) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph. 

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and relabeling them accordingly, the new edges are:
(0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (7, 14) (8, 10) (12, 14)

Using these new edges and checking for shared connections, we find the triangles:
<0, 7, 14> 
<0, 10, 8>
<0, 11, 1>
<0, 11, 13>
<0, 13, 9>
<0, 14, 12>
<1, 5, 4>
<2, 6, 4>
<3, 9, 0>
<4, 5, 1>
<7, 14, 12>
<8, 10, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
