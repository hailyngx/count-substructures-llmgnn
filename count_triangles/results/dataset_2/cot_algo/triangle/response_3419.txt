Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 5) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 5) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and connections based on the provided edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Connections:
0: 11, 13, 5, 1, 6
1: 10, 8, 0
2: 10, 13, 4, 14
3: 10, 6, 9
4: 12, 14, 6, 2
5: 10, 13, 7, 12, 0
6: 11, 4, 7, 0, 3
7: 11, 6, 5
8: 11, 13, 12, 1
9: 10, 3
10: 11, 3, 9, 1, 2, 5
11: 10, 7, 0, 6, 8
12: 8, 4, 5
13: 8, 5, 10, 0, 14, 2
14: 13, 4, 2

Considering the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Nodes by degree: 
1. 9, 1
2. 4, 7, 8, 14
3. 0, 3, 6, 12
4. 2, 5
5. 10, 13
6. 11

With the above ordering, we consider the edges based on vertices with lower labels having fewer connections:
Triangles found:
1. <6, 11, 0>
2. <0, 13, 5>
3. <0, 7, 11>
4. <4, 2, 13>
5. <4, 6, 0>
6. <4, 6, 7>
7. <4, 6, 11>
8. <4, 12, 5>
9. <4, 12, 8>
10. <4, 14, 2>
11. <5, 10, 13>
12. <5, 12, 8>
13. <5, 12, 4>
14. <8, 12, 4>
15. <13, 0, 11>
