Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 1) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 12), (0, 2), (0, 14),
(1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 10), (1, 12),
(2, 3), (2, 14), (2, 0),
(3, 4), (3, 1), (3, 11), (3, 2), (3, 8),
(4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 13), (4, 0), (4, 3),
(5, 1), (5, 12), (5, 10),
(6, 1),
(7, 4), (7, 12), (7, 0), (7, 9), (7, 13),
(8, 3), (8, 13), (8, 11),
(9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 13), (9, 11),
(10, 1), (10, 13), (10, 14), (10, 5),
(11, 3), (11, 8), (11, 14), (11, 9),
(12, 7), (12, 1), (12, 5), (12, 0),
(13, 4), (13, 7), (13, 8), (13, 10), (13, 9),
(14, 2), (14, 0), (14, 11), (14, 10)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

0: 5, 1: 5, 2: 3, 3: 5, 4: 5, 5: 3, 6: 1, 7: 5, 8: 3, 9: 4, 10: 4, 11: 4, 12: 4, 13: 5, 14: 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will find the number of triangles:

[9]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 3, 12>, <1, 5, 12>, <1, 5, 10>, <1, 10, 13>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 7, 13>, <4, 9, 13>, <9, 10, 13>
