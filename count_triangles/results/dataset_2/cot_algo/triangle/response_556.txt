Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 19) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 12) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 0) (18, 11) (18, 12) (6, 2) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (10, 0) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 12) (19, 16) (19, 15) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 15) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 6) (1, 8) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 14) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 3) (13, 6) (13, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the triangles efficiently. 

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order. The degrees of all nodes in this graph are as follows:
Node 0: degree 5
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 1
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 2
Node 11: degree 2
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 2
Node 14: degree 4
Node 15: degree 4
Node 16: degree 3
Node 17: degree 3
Node 18: degree 2
Node 19: degree 3

Now, relabeling the nodes in ascending order of their degrees:
Node 5 -> 0
Node 1 -> 1
Node 11 -> 2
Node 10 -> 3
Node 18 -> 4
Node 16 -> 5
Node 17 -> 6
Node 8 -> 7
Node 3 -> 8
Node 7 -> 9
Node 6 -> 10
Node 13 -> 11
Node 2 -> 12
Node 12 -> 13
Node 14 -> 14
Node 15 -> 15
Node 0 -> 16
Node 19 -> 17
Node 9 -> 18
Node 4 -> 19

Then, by following the method described above, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [39]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 16>
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 7, 14>
<0, 7, 3>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 10, 15>
<1, 8, 4>
<1, 14, 2>
<2, 12, 0>
<2, 14, 7>
<3, 7, 14>
<3, 7, 0>
<3, 14, 2>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 9, 17>
<6, 17, 16>
<6, 17, 9>
<6, 2, 14>
<6, 2, 0>
<8, 1, 14>
<8, 1, 4>
<10, 15, 12>
<13, 15, 2>
<13, 15, 14>
<13, 15, 6>
<14, 2, 0>

<14, 3, 4>
<14, 3, 7>
<15, 12, 9>
<15, 12, 18>
<15, 12, 19>
<15, 14, 7>
<15, 14, 2>
<15, 14, 3>
<16, 17, 9>
<16, 17, 6>
<19, 15, 12>
