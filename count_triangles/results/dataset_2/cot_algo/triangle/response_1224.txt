Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, and then relabeling the vertices accordingly.

The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is:
Node 7 (degree 2), Node 3 (degree 3), Node 1 (degree 4), Node 8 (degree 4), Node 6 (degree 4), Node 2 (degree 5), Node 9 (degree 6), Node 5 (degree 6), Node 0 (degree 7), Node 4 (degree 7).

Since we have 40 edges, let's calculate the count of triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given edges, we consider only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. (4, 8): Node 4 and Node 8 have 7 and 4 connections respectively, so we proceed with this edge. Checking for shared connections, we form the triangle <4, 8, 2>.
2. (4, 9): Node 4 and Node 9 have 7 and 6 connections respectively, so we proceed with this edge. Checking for shared connections, we form the triangle <4, 9, 1>.
3. (4, 0): Node 4 and Node 0 have 7 and 7 connections respectively, so we cannot proceed with this edge.
4. (4, 5): Node 4 and Node 5 have 7 and 6 connections respectively, so we proceed with this edge. Checking for shared connections, we form the triangle <4, 5, 1>.

Based on the above calculations, the total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [3]. 
The unique triangles found inside <> are <4, 8, 2>, <4, 9, 1>, and <4, 5, 1>.
