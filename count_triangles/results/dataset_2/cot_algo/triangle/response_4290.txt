Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 20) (16, 6) (18, 11) (18, 22) (18, 24) (18, 7) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 4) (7, 18) (7, 21) (7, 27) (21, 7) (21, 27) (21, 25) (21, 24) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 8) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 28) (8, 18) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 29) (13, 15) (2, 22) (2, 8) (2, 14) (29, 17) (29, 13) (29, 26) (29, 0) (19, 25) (26, 29) (26, 14) (26, 12) (15, 13) (28, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 26) (14, 20) (0, 29) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 24) (9, 4) (9, 27) (25, 21) (25, 19) (25, 6) (4, 23) (4, 5) (4, 9) (27, 7) (27, 21) (27, 9) (27, 6) (20, 16) (20, 14) (20, 6) (12, 22) (12, 26) (12, 24) (24, 18) (24, 21) (24, 5) (24, 12) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 25) (6, 27) (6, 20) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Node 0 has degree 1
2. Node 3 has degree 1
3. Node 9 has degree 2
4. Node 10 has degree 3
5. Node 1 has degree 3
6. Node 19 has degree 1
7. Node 5 has degree 3
8. Node 28 has degree 1
9. Node 15 has degree 1
10. Node 11 has degree 2
11. Node 16 has degree 2
12. Node 17 has degree 4
13. Node 29 has degree 4
14. Node 13 has degree 3
15. Node 18 has degree 5
16. Node 8 has degree 5
17. Node 7 has degree 3
18. Node 21 has degree 4
19. Node 25 has degree 3
20. Node 4 has degree 3
21. Node 23 has degree 2
22. Node 27 has degree 4
23. Node 12 has degree 3
24. Node 22 has degree 4
25. Node 2 has degree 3
26. Node 26 has degree 3
27. Node 14 has degree 4
28. Node 24 has degree 4
29. Node 6 has degree 5
30. Node 20 has degree 3

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles:

1. Triangle <2, 18, 22>
2. Triangle <2, 14, 26>
3. Triangle <2, 14, 20>
4. Triangle <2, 26, 12>
5. Triangle <5, 21, 24>
6. Triangle <5, 24, 12>
7. Triangle <7, 18, 22>
8. Triangle <7, 18, 24>
9. Triangle <7, 21, 25>
10. Triangle <7, 21, 27>
11. Triangle <8, 18, 22>
12. Triangle <8, 18, 24>
13. Triangle <8, 6, 20>
14. Triangle <8, 6, 27>

There are a total of 14 triangles in the graph [14].
