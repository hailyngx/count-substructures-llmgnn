Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 19) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 18) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 9) (16, 12) (16, 14) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 1) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 15) (0, 2) (0, 11) (15, 14) (15, 9) (15, 18) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 15) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 19) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 18) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 7) (7, 18) (19, 6) (19, 13) 

Response:
The graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be visually represented as follows:

```
0 -- 2 -- 4 -- 5 -- 6 -- 1 -- 14 -- 16 -- 12 -- 9
 \         |         |           |         |       |
  \        |         |           |         |       |
   11     8         6           17        10     15
    |     |         |           |         |       |
    0     2         19         1         13 -- 18
```

By sorting the vertices by their degrees from least to most, we can relabel the vertices as follows:
Degree: 2 - Vertices: 0, 8, 5
Degree: 3 - Vertices: 4, 11, 10, 18, 7, 19
Degree: 4 - Vertices: 2, 1, 16
Degree: 5 - Vertices: 6, 12, 9
Degree: 6 - Vertex: 14
Degree: 7 - Vertex: 13
Degree: 8 - Vertex: 17
Degree: 9 - Vertex: 15

Now, considering each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles:

1. Triangle: <1, 6, 17>
2. Triangle: <0, 2, 4>
3. Triangle: <13, 18, 11>

Total number of triangles: [3]
