Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 14) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 18) (15, 11) (15, 0) (15, 6) (4, 18) (4, 5) (18, 11) (18, 3) (18, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 9) (19, 7) (19, 17) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 0) (17, 19) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 5) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 7) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 7) (0, 15) (0, 6) (0, 17) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort the vertices based on the number of connections (degrees):
   - Vertex 16: 2 connections
   - Vertex 1: 3 connections
   - Vertex 3: 3 connections
   - Vertex 15: 3 connections
   - Vertex 4: 3 connections
   - Vertex 8: 2 connections
   - Vertex 9: 3 connections
   - Vertex 12: 2 connections
   - Vertex 19: 2 connections
   - Vertex 7: 5 connections
   - Vertex 6: 3 connections
   - Vertex 17: 4 connections
   - Vertex 14: 4 connections
   - Vertex 2: 3 connections
   - Vertex 0: 3 connections
   - Vertex 10: 2 connections
   - Vertex 5: 4 connections
   - Vertex 13: 1 connection
   - Vertex 11: 6 connections
   - Vertex 18: 4 connections

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degree ordering:
   - Node 16 -> Node 0
   - Node 1 -> Node 1
   - Node 3 -> Node 2
   - Node 15 -> Node 3
   - Node 4 -> Node 4
   - Node 8 -> Node 5
   - Node 9 -> Node 6
   - Node 12 -> Node 7
   - Node 19 -> Node 8
   - Node 7 -> Node 9
   - Node 6 -> Node 10
   - Node 17 -> Node 11
   - Node 14 -> Node 12
   - Node 2 -> Node 13
   - Node 0 -> Node 14
   - Node 10 -> Node 15
   - Node 5 -> Node 16
   - Node 13 -> Node 17
   - Node 11 -> Node 18
   - Node 18 -> Node 19

3. Proceed with checking shared connections and count the number of triangles. 

After carefully examining the graph and identifying the triangles formed, the total number of triangles found is [21].

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 0, 6>, <3, 0, 15>, <3, 6, 17>, <11, 18, 4>, <11, 18, 5>, <11, 5, 4>, <11, 16, 1>, <11, 16, 14>, <11, 16, 3>, <11, 16, 7>, <11, 16, 14>, <11, 16, 8>, <3, 14, 7>, <5, 4, 17>, <5, 4, 1>, <5, 17, 6>, <5, 17, 0>, <17, 0, 6>, <7, 19, 2>, <7, 19, 9>, <7, 19, 12>.
