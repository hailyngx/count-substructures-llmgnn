Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
(5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) 
(9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
(4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) 
(7, 8) (7, 0) 
(6, 8) 
(8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) 
(2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 
(0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) 
(3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
(1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes sorted by the number of connections:
{5, 7} -> 1 connection
{6, 7} -> 2 connections
{0, 1, 2, 3} -> 3 connections
{4, 8} -> 4 connections
{9} -> 5 connections

Triangles:
[9]

Unique triangles:
<4, 0, 1>
