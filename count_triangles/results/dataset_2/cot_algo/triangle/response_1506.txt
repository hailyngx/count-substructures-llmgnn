Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 12) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 5) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 4) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 16) (13, 16) (13, 18) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 13) (18, 2) (5, 15) (5, 8) (6, 12) (6, 19) (11, 14) (11, 7) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 19) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 10) (16, 8) (16, 13) (19, 17) (19, 6) (19, 0) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 6) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 10) 

Response:
The sorted nodes based on their degrees are as follows:
Node 16 - 1 connection
Node 6 - 2 connections
Node 5 - 2 connections
Node 13 - 2 connections
Node 18 - 3 connections
Node 11 - 3 connections
Node 8 - 3 connections
Node 0 - 4 connections
Node 1 - 4 connections
Node 7 - 4 connections
Node 12 - 4 connections
Node 19 - 4 connections
Node 10 - 4 connections
Node 17 - 4 connections
Node 14 - 5 connections
Node 4 - 5 connections
Node 2 - 5 connections
Node 3 - 5 connections
Node 9 - 5 connections

Now, considering the edges, we count the triangles formed:
- Triangle <1, 4, 14>
- Triangle <1, 4, 17>
- Triangle <1, 10, 0>
- Triangle <1, 7, 11>
- Triangle <2, 9, 10>
- Triangle <2, 9, 12>
- Triangle <2, 13, 16>
- Triangle <2, 18, 13>
- Triangle <2, 18, 14>
- Triangle <3, 9, 15>
- Triangle <4, 14, 17>
- Triangle <4, 17, 14>
- Triangle <5, 8, 15>
- Triangle <6, 12, 2>
- Triangle <6, 12, 19>
- Triangle <7, 0, 10>
- Triangle <7, 0, 11>
- Triangle <8, 2, 18>
- Triangle <8, 5, 15>
- Triangle <10, 0, 1>
- Triangle <11, 14, 17>
- Triangle <12, 2, 9>
- Triangle <14, 17, 4>
- Triangle <17, 14, 4>
- Triangle <18, 13, 2>
- Triangle <19, 0, 7>

There are a total of [27] triangles in the given graph.
