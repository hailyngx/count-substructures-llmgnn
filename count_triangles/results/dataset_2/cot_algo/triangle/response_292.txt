Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- 0: {9, 4, 3, 2}
- 1: {9, 3, 6}
- 2: {5, 8, 3, 0}
- 3: {1, 0, 6, 2, 8}
- 4: {5, 9, 8, 0}
- 5: {9, 2, 8, 4}
- 6: {1, 3, 8}
- 7: {9}
- 8: {5, 9, 4, 3, 2, 6}
- 9: {5, 8, 4, 1, 7, 0}

Now, we'll list the nodes based on their degree in increasing order:
Nodes ranked by degree: [7, 1, 6, 0, 2, 4, 3, 5, 8, 9]

Now, we'll count the triangles. 
Triangles: [29]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<8, 9, 5>
