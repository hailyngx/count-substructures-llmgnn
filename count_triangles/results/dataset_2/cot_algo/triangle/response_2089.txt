Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

    0 -- 2 -- 8 -- 9
    |    |    |    |
    5 -- 6 -- 7    3
    | /  | /  | /  |  
    4 -- 1 -- 3   

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

    Node 0: Degree 2
    Node 9: Degree 2
    Node 7: Degree 3
    Node 7: Degree 3
    Node 9: Degree 3
    Node 1: Degree 4
    Node 1: Degree 4
    Node 8: Degree 4
    Node 8: Degree 4
    Node 2: Degree 4
    Node 2: Degree 4
    Node 6: Degree 4
    Node 6: Degree 4
    Node 3: Degree 5
    Node 3: Degree 5
    Node 5: Degree 5
    Node 5: Degree 5
    Node 4: Degree 5
    Node 4: Degree 5
