Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 12) (4, 12) (4, 9) (18, 16) (17, 3) (17, 8) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 14) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 16) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 6) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 11) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 19) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 9) (16, 6) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (11, 15) (11, 5) (11, 6) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 13) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 12) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 14) (5, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by degree are:  

Node 5 has degree 1  
Node 18 has degree 1  
Node 1 has degree 2  
Node 4 has degree 2  
Node 18 has degree 2  
Node 11 has degree 3  
Node 17 has degree 3  
Node 19 has degree 3  
Node 0 has degree 4  
Node 8 has degree 4  
Node 9 has degree 4  
Node 3 has degree 5  
Node 2 has degree 5  
Node 12 has degree 5  
Node 10 has degree 5  
Node 5 has degree 5  
Node 14 has degree 5  
Node 6 has degree 6  
Node 16 has degree 6  
Node 15 has degree 6  
Node 7 has degree 7  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start evaluating the edges.
