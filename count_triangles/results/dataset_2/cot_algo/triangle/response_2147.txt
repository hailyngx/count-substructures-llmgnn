Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 17) (1, 6) (1, 18) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 11) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 3) (15, 10) (15, 6) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 16) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 19) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 18) (18, 1) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 3) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 19) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 11) (19, 4) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 4) (14, 8) (8, 14) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 3) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections (degree-based ordering):
Node 14: 1 connection
Nodes 1, 2, 5, 8: 2 connections
Nodes 0, 9, 11, 15, 18 : 3 connections
Nodes 3, 10, 16: 4 connections
Nodes 6, 13, 17: 5 connections
Nodes 4, 7, 12, 19: 6 connections
