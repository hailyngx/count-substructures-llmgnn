Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 17) (4, 1) (4, 6) (18, 11) (18, 0) (1, 4) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 16) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 11) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 10) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 12) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 6) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 12) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 14) (11, 18) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 8) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 15) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 7) (13, 2) (13, 0) (7, 8) (7, 10) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 5: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 19: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 3
Node 6: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 16: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5
Node 11: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 0: degree 5
Node 18: degree 5
Node 10: degree 5

Based on the degrees, we can start building the triangles: 

- Triangle <5, 2, 19>
- Triangle <6, 4, 1>
- Triangle <4, 1, 16>
- Triangle <5, 10, 2>
- Triangle <5, 10, 7>
- Triangle <9, 15, 17>
- Triangle <14, 3, 16>
- Triangle <13, 0, 6>
- Triangle <13, 0, 8>
- Triangle <14, 2, 8>
- Triangle <19, 2, 14>
- Triangle <12, 16, 1>
- Triangle <12, 16, 3>
- Triangle <18, 11, 1>
- Triangle <18, 11, 17>
- Triangle <11, 1, 17>
- Triangle <11, 8, 14>
- Triangle <0, 8, 13>
- Triangle <0, 8, 7>
- Triangle <0, 6, 13>
- Triangle <0, 6, 18>

Therefore, there are a total of [20] triangles in the given graph.
