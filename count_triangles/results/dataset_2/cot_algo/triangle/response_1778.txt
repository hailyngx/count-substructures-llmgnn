Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 0) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 0) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their respective connections:

0: 4, 7, 14, 1, 3  
1: 0, 4, 5, 6, 13  
2: 0  
3: 0, 5, 9, 10  
4: 0, 1, 8, 10  
5: 1, 3, 6, 8, 14  
6: 1, 5, 7, 10, 11  
7: 0, 6, 9, 14  
8: 4, 5, 10, 12  
9: 3, 7, 11, 12  
10: 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13  
11: 6, 9, 10, 12  
12: 8, 9, 11  
13: 1, 10  
14: 0, 5, 7  

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
<1, 3, 10>
<1, 4, 10>
<1, 6, 10>
<0, 4, 10>
<1, 5, 10>
<5, 6, 10>
<5, 8, 10>
<5, 8, 12>
<7, 9, 14>
<0, 7, 14>
<0, 3, 5>
<3, 9, 10>
<6, 7, 14>
<8, 12, 9>
<8, 11, 12>

Total number of triangles: [15]
