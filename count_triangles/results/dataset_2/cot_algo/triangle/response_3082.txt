Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 20) (26, 17) (26, 3) (3, 26) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 19) (25, 23) (25, 29) (25, 14) (10, 17) (10, 22) (17, 26) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 23) (8, 27) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 24) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 16) (29, 25) (29, 17) (29, 18) (21, 6) (21, 28) (21, 13) (28, 21) (28, 20) (22, 9) (22, 10) (22, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (0, 1) (0, 13) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 24) (16, 6) (16, 23) (18, 29) (18, 19) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 15) (19, 25) (19, 18) (19, 24) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 22) (12, 2) (12, 20) (12, 15) (14, 25) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 15) (13, 21) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 2) (27, 8) (23, 25) (23, 17) (23, 16) (23, 18) (23, 20) (20, 9) (20, 28) (20, 12) (20, 23) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 14) (24, 5) (24, 7) (24, 19) 

Response:
The graph has now been constructed with the provided nodes and edges. 
Next, we will list the nodes by their degree in increasing order and relabel them accordingly:

Nodes by degree:
0: 4 connections
1: 4 connections
26: 4 connections
16: 4 connections
18: 5 connections
27: 5 connections
28: 5 connections
29: 5 connections
10: 5 connections
12: 5 connections
13: 5 connections
20: 5 connections
21: 5 connections
2: 5 connections
15: 5 connections
17: 5 connections
9: 6 connections
3: 6 connections
5: 6 connections
7: 6 connections
6: 6 connections
24: 6 connections
25: 7 connections
14: 7 connections
11: 7 connections
8: 7 connections
22: 7 connections
23: 7 connections
19: 7 connections
4: 0 connections

By sorting the nodes (vertices) by their degree, we can now move on to count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
