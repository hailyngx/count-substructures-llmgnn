Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 6) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 0) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 2) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 5) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 2) 

Response:
By arranging the nodes based on their degrees, we get the following order:   
Nodes: 13, 4, 7, 1, 9, 14, 8, 12, 6, 3, 10, 0, 5, 11, 2       

Now, we will use this ordering to count the number of triangles in the graph:   

- For the edge (4, 8): Node 4 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Node 8 (degree 4).  
    Shared connections for nodes 4 and 8: (1)  
    Triangle formed: <1, 4, 8>  
- For the edge (4, 1):   
    Shared connections for nodes 4 and 1:  
    Triangle formed:    
- For the edge (4, 11):    
    Shared connections for nodes 4 and 11:  
    Triangle formed:  
- For the edge (7, 10): Node 7 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Node 10 (degree 4).  
    Shared connections for nodes 7 and 10: (6)  
    Triangle formed: <6, 7, 10>  
- For the edge (7, 9):   
    Shared connections for nodes 7 and 9:  
    Triangle formed:    
- For the edge (7, 8):   
    Shared connections for nodes 7 and 8:  
    Triangle formed:  
- For the edge (1, 3): Node 1 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Node 3 (degree 5).  
    Shared connections for nodes 1 and 3: (6)  
    Triangle formed: <1, 3, 6>  
- For the edge (3, 11):   
    Shared connections for nodes 3 and 11:  
    Triangle formed:  
- For the edge (3, 10): Node 3 (degree 5) has fewer connections than Node 10 (degree 4).  
    Shared connections for nodes 3 and 10: (0, 6)  
    Triangle formed: <0, 3, 10>  

Count of triangles:  
[2]  

Unique triangles:  
<1, 4, 8>, <6, 7, 10>
