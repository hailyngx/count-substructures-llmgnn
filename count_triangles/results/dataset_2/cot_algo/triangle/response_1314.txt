Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 4) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 6) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 6) 

Response:
The vertices are sorted based on their number of connections:

1. Vertex 11: 4 connections
2. Vertex 6: 3 connections
3. Vertex 3: 3 connections
4. Vertex 12: 3 connections
5. Vertex 13: 3 connections
6. Vertex 0: 3 connections
7. Vertex 5: 3 connections
8. Vertex 2: 3 connections
9. Vertex 7: 3 connections
10. Vertex 10: 3 connections
11. Vertex 14: 3 connections
12. Vertex 4: 4 connections
13. Vertex 9: 5 connections
14. Vertex 1: 6 connections
15. Vertex 8: 6 connections
