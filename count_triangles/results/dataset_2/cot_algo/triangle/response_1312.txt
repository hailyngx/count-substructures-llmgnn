Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their number of connections and labeling them accordingly. Let's construct the graph with the nodes and edges first:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: (6, 2, 7)
- 1: (6, 4)
- 2: (9, 3, 0, 8, 7, 4)
- 3: (2, 8, 4)
- 4: (5, 6, 1, 3, 2)
- 5: (9, 6, 4, 7)
- 6: (5, 1, 4, 0)
- 7: (5, 9, 0, 2, 8)
- 8: (9, 3, 2, 7)
- 9: (5, 8, 2, 7)

Now, let's count the triangles:

Triangles: [<0, 6, 2>, <0, 7, 2>, <1, 6, 4>, <2, 7, 8>]

Total number of triangles: [4]
