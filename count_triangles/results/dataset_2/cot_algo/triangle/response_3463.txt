Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 29) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 23) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (18, 5) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 20) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 16) (22, 21) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 24) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 24) (0, 15) (0, 27) (27, 0) (27, 10) (27, 17) (20, 18) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 14) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 19) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 25) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 20) (13, 17) (26, 18) (21, 22) (11, 22) (11, 8) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 17) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 29) (17, 27) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 11) (14, 20) (14, 28) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 19) (28, 24) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 16) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 28) (19, 29) (29, 5) (29, 23) (29, 19) (24, 3) (24, 15) (24, 28) (16, 22) (16, 1) (10, 27) (25, 8) (25, 4) (4, 25) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to efficiently count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 26: degree 1
- Node 10: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 21: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 27: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 25: degree 4
- Node 22: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 20: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 28: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 23: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 29: degree 4

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

Triangles: [216]
Unique triangles: <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 16>, <1, 9, 2>, <1, 9, 6>, <1, 9, 7>, <1, 9, 8>, <2, 8, 11>, <3, 15, 20>, <3, 15, 24>, <3, 15, 28>, <3, 15, 0>, <3, 20, 13>, <3, 20, 17>, <3, 20, 14>, <3, 20, 15>, <3, 24, 28>, <3, 24, 19>, <3, 24, 15>...
