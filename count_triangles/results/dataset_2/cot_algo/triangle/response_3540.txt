Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can find the triangles. Calculating the triangles will return:

Total number of triangles: [17]
Unique triangles found: 
<0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 11>, <0, 2, 12>, <0, 3, 12>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 12>, <0, 7, 12>, <0, 10, 14>, <2, 7, 11>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 11, 12>, <3, 7, 12>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 8, 10>, <7, 11, 12>, <8, 10, 13>, <10, 13, 14>
