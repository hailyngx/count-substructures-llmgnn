Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 13) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 6) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 12) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 14) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 12) 

Response:
The graph can be constructed as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 14), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 11), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 11), (2, 12), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 6), (4, 9), (4, 14), (5, 7), (5, 9), (5, 13), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 13), (6, 14), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 12), (8, 13), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 7), (9, 12), (10, 0), (10, 7), (10, 11), (11, 0), (11, 1), (11, 2), (11, 13), (12, 2), (12, 7), (12, 9), (12, 13), (12, 14), (13, 5), (13, 6), (13, 11), (13, 12), (13, 8), (14, 0), (14, 4), (14, 6), (14, 12)

After relabeling the nodes based on their degrees from least to most connections, we have:
Nodes: 8, 10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14

Now, we can count the number of triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 41]
<0, 1, 11>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 12>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 14>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 10, 7>, <0, 10, 11>, <0, 10, 14>, <2, 3, 11>, <2, 3, 1>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 6, 14>, <2, 6, 13>, <2, 7, 12>, <3, 1, 6>, <4, 6, 14>, <4, 6, 13>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 13, 11>, <5, 13, 6>, <6, 13, 14>, <7, 5, 9>, <7, 10, 0>, <7, 12, 9>, <8, 13, 12>, <9, 2, 3>, <9, 4, 6>, <9, 4, 14>, <9, 5, 7>, <9, 10, 0>, <9, 10, 7>, <9, 10, 11>, <9, 12, 7>, <11, 1, 3>, <11, 13, 5>, <11, 13, 6>, <13, 12, 14>
