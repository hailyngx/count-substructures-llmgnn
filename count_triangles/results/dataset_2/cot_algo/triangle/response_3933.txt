Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (15, 3) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 19) (4, 15) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 19) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (18, 19) (18, 5) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 17) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 13) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 16) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 18) (7, 10) (7, 2) (13, 14) (13, 16) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

- Vertex 0 has degree 1.
- Vertex 3 has degree 2.
- Vertex 5 has degree 3.
- Vertices 7, 8, and 13 have degree 4.
- Vertices 1, 6, and 18 have degree 5.
- Vertices 4 and 16 have degree 6.
- Vertices 12, 14, and 17 have degree 7.
- Vertices 9 and 19 have degree 8.
- Vertex 11 has degree 9.
- Vertex 2 has degree 10.
- Vertex 15 has degree 11.
- Vertex 10 has degree 12.

By following the method, we will only consider the following edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(1,8), (13,16), (5,18), (1,5), (1,9), (1,9), (1,9), (1,8), (5,8).

By checking for shared connections between these edges, we find the following triangles:
<1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
