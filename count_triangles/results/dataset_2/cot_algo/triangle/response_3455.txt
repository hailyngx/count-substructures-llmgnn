Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 4) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 10) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 6) (10, 5) (10, 7) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections. 

The sorted vertices with their degrees are as follows:
(1: 4), (2: 4), (3: 6), (4: 6), (5: 5), (6: 4), (7: 4), (8: 4), (9: 4), (10: 2), (11: 4), (12: 6), (13: 3), (14: 4)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed based on the method described earlier. 

The total number of triangles is [17].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 12, 3>
<0, 12, 6>
<1, 11, 4>
<4, 6, 11>
<4, 6, 12>
<4, 11, 12>
<5, 7, 10>
<5, 7, 13>
<5, 10, 7>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 12, 3>
<6, 12, 4>
<7, 10, 5>
<9, 11, 12>
<9, 12, 3>
<11, 12, 3>
