Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given edges:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: (6, 9), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 8), (9, 3), (9, 0), (2, 8), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 4), (8, 7), (8, 3), (0, 7), (7, 1), (3, 5)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):

1. Node 1: 2 connections
2. Node 5: 2 connections
3. Node 9: 3 connections
4. Node 4: 3 connections
5. Node 2: 4 connections
6. Node 7: 4 connections
7. Node 0: 6 connections
8. Node 8: 6 connections
9. Node 3: 6 connections
10. Node 6: 7 connections

Now, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles:
- (2, 8): No triangle
- (2, 0): <0, 2, 5>
- (2, 5): No triangle
- (2, 4): No triangle
- (8, 7): <0, 7, 8>
- (8, 3): No triangle
- (0, 7): <0, 7, 1>
- (7, 1): No triangle
- (3, 5): No triangle

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 1>.
