Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:
```
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 21 has 3 connections.
Node 26 has 3 connections.
Node 5 has 1 connection.
Node 28 has 2 connections.
Node 6 has 3 connections.
Node 14 has 2 connections.
Node 15 has 2 connections.
Node 10 has 4 connections.
Node 16 has 3 connections.
Node 22 has 4 connections.
Node 23 has 2 connections.
Node 0 has 5 connections.
Node 20 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 25 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 3 connections.
Node 19 has 3 connections.
Node 17 has 5 connections.
Node 18 has 3 connections.
Node 13 has 2 connections.
Node 24 has 3 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 12 has 3 connections.
Node 27 has 3 connections.
Node 29 has 4 connections.
Node 11 has 3 connections.
```

2. Relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
```
Node 5 has 1 connection.
Node 28 has 2 connections.
Node 15 has 2 connections.
Node 14 has 2 connections.
Node 23 has 2 connections.
Node 20 has 2 connections.
Node 6 has 3 connections.
Node 23 has 2 connections.
Node 21 has 3 connections.
Node 10 has 4 connections.
Node 16 has 3 connections.
Node 26 has 3 connections.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 23 has 2 connections.
Node 26 has 3 connections.
Node 0 has 5 connections.
Node 21 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 25 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 3 connections.
Node 19 has 3 connections.
Node 17 has 5 connections.
Node 18 has 3 connections.
Node 13 has 2 connections.
Node 24 has 3 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 12 has 3 connections.
Node 27 has 3 connections.
Node 29 has 4 connections.
Node 11 has 3 connections.
```

3. Count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
   - There are 10 triangles in total inside brackets [].
   - Unique triangles found are: 
     - <7, 0, 22>
     - <0, 7, 1>
     - <0, 14, 21>
     - <10, 4, 25>
     - <10, 4, 2>
     - <10, 25, 19>
     - <6, 11, 19>
     - <7, 21, 16>
     - <14, 21, 16>
     - <17, 25, 19>
