Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following structure:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 7), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 1), (4, 6), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 6), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 0), (3, 9), (3, 0), (3, 8), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 0), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 2), (6, 0), (0, 9), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 6)

To count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the nodes by their degree:

Nodes by degree: (1: 3), (2: 3), (3: 3), (5: 3), (7: 3), (0: 4), (6: 4), (8: 4), (9: 5), (4: 6)

Now, we relabel the nodes accordingly:

Nodes by sorted degree: (1: 0), (2: 1), (3: 2), (5: 3), (7: 4), (0: 5), (6: 6), (8: 7), (9: 8), (4: 9)

We will now go through each edge and count the triangles formed by shared connections. After counting, we obtain the following unique triangles:

<0, 3, 5>
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
