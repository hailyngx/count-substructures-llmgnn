Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 10) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (6, 17) (6, 7) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 18) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (10, 16) (10, 8) (17, 6) (17, 15) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 15) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 2) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 15) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 14) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 15) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with 20 nodes and the given 60 edges:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
- Edges:
  - (11, 16), (11, 7), (16, 11), (16, 19), (16, 10), (5, 9), (5, 19), (5, 8), (5, 12), (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 18), (6, 17), (6, 7), (1, 19), (1, 0), (3, 0), (3, 18), (4, 7), (4, 13), (7, 11), (7, 6), (7, 4), (7, 2), (10, 16), (10, 8), (17, 6), (17, 15), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 14), (0, 18), (0, 12), (14, 0), (14, 12), (14, 2), (14, 13), (19, 16), (19, 5), (19, 1), (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 10), (18, 9), (18, 3), (18, 0), (18, 15), (15, 17), (15, 18), (15...

Now, let's apply Degree-Based Ordering to count the number of triangles in this graph. 

After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following labels: 
Nodes with labels in increasing order of degrees: 16, 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 13, 17, 3, 7, 9, 18, 5, 8, 11, 0, 14, 15, 19

Triangles found (formatted as <vertex1, vertex2, vertex3>):
<7, 4, 13>, <7, 2, 14>, <10, 16, 19>, <0, 18, 15>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
