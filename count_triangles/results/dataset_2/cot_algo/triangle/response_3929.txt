Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 9) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 10) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort the vertices by their degree (number of connections) from least to most. 

The degree of each node is as follows:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 9
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 6
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 5
Node 12: degree 5
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4

We will proceed by relabeling the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 0 -> node A
Node 1 -> node B
Node 2 -> node C
Node 3 -> node D
Node 4 -> node E
Node 5 -> node F
Node 6 -> node G
Node 7 -> node H
Node 8 -> node I
Node 9 -> node J
Node 10 -> node K
Node 11 -> node L
Node 12 -> node M
Node 13 -> node N
Node 14 -> node O

Now, we will consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
