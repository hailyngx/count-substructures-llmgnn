Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 6), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 8), (9, 7), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 7), (3, 5), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 2), (3, 8), (4, 5), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 2), (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 7), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 0), (0, 6), (0, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 0), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 1), (7, 8), (7, 6)

Now, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices by degree: 9(3), 0(3), 2(4), 4(4), 6(4), 1(5), 7(5), 8(5), 3(6), 5(6)

We will now relabel the vertices:
Labels: 0 → 9, 1 → 0, 2 → 2, 3 → 4, 4 → 6, 5 → 1, 6 → 7, 7 → 8, 8 → 3, 9 → 5

Now, we will list the unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 1>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 1>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 8, 4>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 1>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 6, 1>, <6, 7, 5>, <6, 7, 5>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 5>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 1>, <6, 7, 5>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 1>, <7, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 5>, <7, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 5>, <7, 8, 1>, <7, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 5>, <7, 8, 1>, <8, 9, 5>, <8, 9, 5>

There are a total of 41 triangles.
