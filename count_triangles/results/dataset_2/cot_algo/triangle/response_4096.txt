Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 14) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 3) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 3) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 14) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to efficiently count the number of triangles in the given graph. Let's follow the steps as described:

### Step 1: Construct the Graph with Nodes and Edges
The given graph can be constructed as follows:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
- Edges: (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 13), (9, 11), (9, 10), (9, 1), (9, 0), (9, 12), (8, 4), (8, 11), (8, 0), (13, 2), (13, 14), (4, 5), (4, 14), (7, 2), (7, 1), (5, 3), (5, 10), (0, 3)

### Step 2: Sort Vertices by Number of Connections
In this case:
- Node 3 has 2 connections.
- Node 10, 11, 12, 14 have 3 connections.
- Node 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13 have 4 connections.
- Node 0, 6, 9 have 5 connections.

### Step 3: Relabel the Vertices
New labels based on the number of connections (from least to most): 
- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

### Step 4: Count Triangles
By following the edge rule (lower label vertex should have fewer connections), we can count the triangles formed by shared connections:

- Triangles found: 
  - <0, 5, 3>
  - <1, 7, 2>
  - <1, 7, 12>
  - <2, 10, 13>
  - <3, 5, 0>
  - <4, 5, 7>
  - <4, 5, 14>
  - <4, 8, 0>
  - <4, 8, 11>
  - <4, 8, 12>
  - <4, 14, 13>

### Final Output
The total number of triangles identified is [11].
