Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 12) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 19) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 18) (2, 18) (2, 3) (2, 15) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 13) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 15) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 18) (13, 1) (17, 11) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 0) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (15, 2) (15, 5) 

Response:
The given graph can be constructed as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: (11, 16), (11, 0), (11, 18), (11, 17), (16, 11), (16, 7), (16, 0), (16, 12)
- 1: (6, 5), (6, 10), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 15), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 13), (1, 10)
- 2: (9, 8), (9, 14), (9, 19), (8, 9), (8, 14), (8, 3), (8, 1), (3, 2), (3, 8), (3, 12), (2, 18), (2, 3), (2, 15), (15, 2), (15, 5)
- 3: (4, 12), (4, 14), (12, 16), (12, 4), (12, 3), (13, 18), (13, 1), (17, 11), (7, 16), (7, 19), (7, 18), (18, 11), (18, 7), (18, 2), (18, 13), (3, 2), (3, 8), (3, 12)
- 4: (0, 11), (0, 16), (0, 10), (0, 19), (10, 6), (10, 1), (10, 0), (19, 9), (19, 7), (19, 0), (9, 8), (9, 14), (9, 19), (14, 9), (14, 4), (14, 8)

After relabeling based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Nodes: <0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19>

Triangles found in the graph are:
- Total triangles: [20]
- Unique triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 10>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 12>, <3, 8, 9>, <3, 8, 14>, <4, 9, 14>, <11, 16, 18>, <11, 16, 7>, <11, 18, 2>, <12, 16, 4>, <12, 16, 3>, <13, 1, 8>, <14, 4, 12>, <14, 4, 9>, <15, 2, 5>, <19, 0, 11>
