Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 10) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their connections:

0: 11, 12  
1: 2, 3, 6, 7, 12  
2: 1, 6, 9  
3: 1, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14  
4: 6, 9, 10, 12  
5: 3, 5, 8, 11, 13  
6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 14  
7: 1, 10, 14  
8: 5, 8, 10, 13  
9: 2, 4, 10, 11  
10: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12  
11: 0, 5, 9  
12: 1, 3, 4, 10  
13: 3, 5, 8  
14: 3, 6, 7  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the nodes are sorted as follows:  
0: 2 connections  
2: 3 connections  
9: 4 connections  
7: 3 connections  
8: 4 connections  
11: 3 connections  
5: 5 connections  
14: 3 connections  
4: 4 connections  
13: 4 connections  
10: 6 connections  
6: 6 connections  
1: 5 connections  
3: 6 connections  
12: 5 connections  

Now, let's count the triangles using the sorted labels.  

Triangles:  
[18]  
<0, 11, 12>  
<5, 8, 13>  
<5, 11, 13>  
<1, 3, 6>  
<1, 3, 12>  
<1, 3, 13>  
<1, 6, 12>  
<1, 6, 14>  
<1, 7, 14>  
<2, 6, 9>  
<2, 6, 1>  
<2, 9, 11>  
<4, 6, 10>  
<4, 10, 12>  
<5, 8, 10>  
<5, 13, 8>  
<6, 10, 12>  
<10, 6, 14>
