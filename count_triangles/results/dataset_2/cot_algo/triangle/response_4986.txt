Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 17) (16, 4) (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 19) (10, 11) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 17) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 18) (13, 14) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 6) (2, 15) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (15, 11) (15, 14) (15, 2) (6, 19) (6, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the nodes by their degree of connectivity. 

Here is the list of nodes and their degrees:
0: 2
1: 3
2: 1
3: 3
4: 4
5: 4
6: 2
7: 3
8: 4
9: 5
10: 4
11: 4
12: 3
13: 1
14: 4
15: 3
16: 2
17: 3
18: 3
19: 3

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted list of nodes is as follows:
2, 0, 6, 16, 13, 1, 3, 17, 18, 19, 7, 12, 8, 15, 5, 4, 14, 10, 11, 9

Now, let's start counting the triangles using the sorted list of nodes:
Triangles: [<0, 11, 15>, <1, 17, 9>]

Total number of triangles: [2]
