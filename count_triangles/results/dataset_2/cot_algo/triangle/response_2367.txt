Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 28) (5, 3) (9, 11) (9, 13) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 26) (3, 29) (25, 26) (25, 28) (25, 22) (20, 15) (20, 17) (20, 29) (15, 20) (15, 29) (15, 24) (21, 19) (28, 5) (28, 25) (28, 24) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 7) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 7) (29, 3) (29, 20) (29, 15) (11, 9) (11, 23) (11, 0) (23, 11) (23, 24) (8, 19) (8, 12) (8, 22) (19, 21) (19, 8) (19, 12) (4, 13) (4, 24) (4, 14) (4, 6) (22, 25) (22, 8) (22, 16) (22, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 16) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 26) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 27) (16, 17) (16, 22) (16, 2) (16, 26) (24, 15) (24, 28) (24, 23) (24, 4) (6, 4) (7, 13) (7, 17) (7, 1) (27, 1) (14, 4) (26, 3) (26, 25) (26, 12) (26, 16) (18, 12) (18, 0) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph first by listing down the nodes and their connections based on the given edges:

Node 0: 11, 22, 10, 18
Node 1: 2, 7, 27
Node 2: 1, 12, 16
Node 3: 5, 10, 26, 29
Node 4: 13, 24, 14, 6
Node 5: 13, 28, 3
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 13, 17, 1
Node 8: 19, 12, 22
Node 9: 11, 13
Node 10: 9, 3, 0
Node 11: 9, 23, 0
Node 12: 8, 19, 2, 18, 26
Node 13: 5, 9, 4, 10, 7
Node 14: 4
Node 15: 20, 29, 24
Node 16: 17, 22, 2, 26
Node 17: 20, 16, 7
Node 18: 12, 0
Node 19: 21, 8, 12
Node 20: 15, 17, 29
Node 21: 19
Node 22: 25, 28, 25, 8, 16, 0
Node 23: 11, 24
Node 24: 15, 28, 23, 4
Node 25: 26, 28, 22
Node 26: 25, 3, 12, 16
Node 27: 1
Node 28: 25, 5, 24
Node 29: 3, 20, 15

After sorting the nodes by their degrees in non-increasing order, we have:
Nodes: 6 1 27 14 21 23 10 18 7 2 17 20 19 8 9 11 0 5 12 4 22 16 3 25 28 6

Now, let's count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [18]

Unique triangles:
<0, 10, 11>
<0, 10, 18>
<0, 10, 22>
<0, 10, 3>
<0, 11, 22>
<0, 11, 23>
<0, 22, 10>
<0, 22, 12>
<0, 22, 16>
<0, 22, 18>
<10, 13, 3>
<10, 0, 11>
<10, 0, 22>
<10, 3, 5>
<10, 3, 29>
<11, 0, 22>
<12, 16, 26>
<13, 4, 24>
