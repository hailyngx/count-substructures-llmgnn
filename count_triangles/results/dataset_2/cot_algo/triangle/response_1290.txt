Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, construct the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0: (4), (6)
- Node 1: (3), (2)
- Node 2: (4), (1), (3), (8), (5)
- Node 3: (1), (6), (9), (2), (5), (8)
- Node 4: (7), (8), (9), (0), (5), (2)
- Node 5: (4), (7), (3), (6), (2)
- Node 6: (7), (3), (9), (5), (0)
- Node 7: (4), (6), (5)
- Node 8: (4), (3), (2)
- Node 9: (4), (3), (6)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

Nodes in increasing order of degrees:
1. Node 0 - Degree: 2
2. Node 1 - Degree: 2
3. Node 8 - Degree: 2
4. Node 7 - Degree: 3
5. Node 9 - Degree: 3
6. Node 5 - Degree: 5
7. Node 6 - Degree: 5
8. Node 3 - Degree: 6
9. Node 2 - Degree: 5
10. Node 4 - Degree: 6

Now, starting from the node with the smallest degree, we will count the triangles:

Triangles:
[16]
<0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 5, 2>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 7>
