Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 2), (6, 1), (6, 8), (8, 0), (2, 0)

Now, let's determine the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections:
{1}, {5, 6, 7, 8}, {0, 2, 4, 9}, {3}, {}

2. Relabel the vertices:
1 -> 0, 5, 6, 7 -> 1, 0, 2, 3 -> 2, 4, 8, 9 -> 3, 5

3. Count the triangles:
- For edge (5, 9): No shared connections, no triangle.
- For edge (5, 4): No shared connections, no triangle.
- For edge (5, 0): Shared connection with vertex 9 -> Triangle <0, 4, 9>.
- For edge (5, 3): Shared connection with vertex 7 -> Triangle <3, 5, 7>.
- For edge (5, 7): No shared connections, no triangle.
- For edge (9, 6): No shared connections, no triangle.
- For edge (9, 8): No shared connections, no triangle.
- For edge (9, 2): No shared connections, no triangle.
- For edge (9, 7): Shared connection with vertex 5 -> Triangle <5, 7, 9>.
- For edge (4, 7): Shared connection with vertex 5 -> Triangle <4, 5, 7>.
- For edge (4, 8): No shared connections, no triangle.
- For edge (4, 2): No shared connections, no triangle.
- For edge (4, 3): Shared connection with vertex 5 -> Triangle <3, 4, 5>.
- For edge (3, 7): No shared connections, no triangle.
- For edge (3, 6): No shared connections, no triangle.
- For edge (3, 2): No shared connections, no triangle.
- For edge (6, 1): No shared connections, no triangle.
- For edge (6, 8): No shared connections, no triangle.
- For edge (8, 0): No shared connections, no triangle.
- For edge (2, 0): No shared connections, no triangle.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles found: <0, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7>
