Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 0) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 0) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 13) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 13) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: [3, 6, 13]
- 1: [3, 4, 8, 12, 14]
- 2: [5, 11, 12, 13]
- 3: [0, 1, 6, 7]
- 4: [1, 7, 9, 13]
- 5: [2, 6, 9]
- 6: [0, 3, 5, 8, 12]
- 7: [1, 4, 9, 12, 14]
- 8: [1, 6, 12]
- 9: [4, 5, 7]
- 10: [11, 12, 14]
- 11: [2, 10, 13]
- 12: [1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 10]
- 13: [0, 2, 4, 11, 14]
- 14: [1, 7, 10, 13]

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices by degree: 
0: 3
1: 5
2: 4
3: 4
4: 4
5: 3
6: 5
7: 5
8: 3
9: 3
10: 3
11: 3
12: 6
13: 5
14: 4

Note: The vertices will be relabeled based on their degrees in ascending order.

Revised vertex labels: 
0 -> 0
5 -> 1
9 -> 2
4 -> 3
7 -> 4
1 -> 5
3 -> 6
2 -> 7
8 -> 8
6 -> 9
13 -> 10
11 -> 11
12 -> 12
10 -> 13
14 -> 14

Now, following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we identify the triangles formed by the shared connections:

Total number of triangles: [27]

Unique triangles: 
<2, 3, 4>
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 10>
<0, 6, 13>
<0, 9, 13>
<1, 5, 12>
<2, 4, 12>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 7, 14>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 6, 10>
<3, 6, 13>
<3, 8, 12>
<4, 7, 14>
<5, 6, 12>
<5, 7, 12>
<5, 9, 12>
<6, 10, 13>
<6, 12, 14>
<6, 12, 13>
<7, 10, 14>
<7, 12, 14>
<8, 12, 14>
<10, 12, 13>
