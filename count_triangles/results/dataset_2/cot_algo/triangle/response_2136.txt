Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 0) (14, 4) (14, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (2, 8) (18, 17) (18, 13) (18, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 17) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 19) (12, 9) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 12) (16, 19) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 4) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 0) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 16) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 13) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 4) (10, 14) (10, 6) (13, 18) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 9)
