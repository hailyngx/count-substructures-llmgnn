Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 10) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 10) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their number of connections. The sorted vertices with the respective number of connections are as follows:
(5: 3), (1: 4), (8: 4), (6: 4), (7: 4), (4: 5), (10: 3), (11: 4), (14: 3), (0: 5), (2: 4), (12: 4), (3: 4), (13: 4), (9: 4)

Now, examining each edge in the graph, we consider only pairs where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- <5, 9> forms 1 triangle: {5, 9, 6}
- <5, 8> forms 1 triangle: {5, 8, 13}
- <5, 3> forms 1 triangle: {5, 3, 6}
- <9, 6> does not form a triangle as both have the same number of connections.
- <6, 3> forms 2 triangles: {6, 3, 5} and {6, 3, 14}
- <1, 11> forms 1 triangle: {1, 11, 0}
- <1, 10> forms 1 triangle: {1, 10, 2}
- <1, 4> forms 2 triangles: {1, 4, 8} and {1, 4, 7}
- <3, 14> forms 1 triangle: {3, 14, 4}
- <8, 13> forms 1 triangle: {8, 13, 9}
- <13, 7> forms 1 triangle: {13, 7, 4}
- <13, 0> forms 1 triangle: {13, 0, 6}
- <4, 7> forms 2 triangles: {4, 7, 0} and {4, 7, 13}
- <7, 0> does not form a triangle as both have the same number of connections.
- <0, 6> forms 2 triangles: {0, 6, 3} and {0, 6, 11}
- <2, 10> forms 1 triangle: {2, 10, 14}
- <12, 11> forms 1 triangle: {12, 11, 1}

Counting all the triangles found, we have a total of [16] triangles. 

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 9, 6>, <5, 8, 13>, <5, 3, 6>, <6, 3, 5>, <6, 3, 14>, <1, 11, 0>, <1, 10, 2>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <3, 14, 4>, <8, 13, 9>, <13, 7, 4>, <13, 0, 6>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 7, 13>, <0, 6, 3>, <0, 6, 11>, <2, 10, 14>, <12, 11, 1>.
