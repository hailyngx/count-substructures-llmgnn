Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 2) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

After sorting the nodes based on their degree in increasing order, the new labels assigned to the nodes are: 
0(2), 2(2), 5(2), 3(2), 7(2), 10(3), 1(3), 13(3), 11(4), 14(4), 6(5), 12(5), 9(6), 8(7), 4(8)

Now, we will count the triangles:
Triangles: [50] 
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 14>, <0, 4, 12>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 6, 0>, <1, 10, 11>, <2, 7, 14>, <3, 7, 10>, <4, 9, 13>, <4, 11, 12>, <6, 10, 11>, <6, 10, 7>, <6, 11, 4>, <7, 10, 11>, <10, 11, 4>
