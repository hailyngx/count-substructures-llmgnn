Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows: 

0 (degree 5)  
3 (degree 3)  
5 (degree 5)  
6 (degree 4)  
9 (degree 3)  
1 (degree 5)  
8 (degree 5)  
4 (degree 4)  
7 (degree 5)  
2 (degree 5)  

Let's find the triangles:  
Triangles with vertex 0:  
- (0, 1, 8)  
- (0, 4, 2)  
- (0, 4, 5)  
- (0, 6, 1)  

Triangles with vertex 3:  
- (3, 1, 5)  

Triangles with vertex 5:  
- (5, 1, 8)  

Triangles with vertex 6:  
- (6, 1, 7)  

Triangles with vertex 9:  
No triangles  

Triangles with vertex 1:  
- (1, 7, 9)  
- (1, 8, 5)  

Triangles with vertex 8:  
- (8, 1, 5)  

Triangles with vertex 4:  
- (4, 0, 2)  
- (4, 7, 5)  

Triangles with vertex 7:  
Triangles already counted  

Triangles with vertex 2:  
- (2, 4, 7)  
- (2, 8, 1)  
- (2, 3, 5)  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].  
The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 6, 1>, <3, 1, 5>, <5, 1, 8>, <6, 1, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 8, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 8, 1>, <2, 3, 5>.
