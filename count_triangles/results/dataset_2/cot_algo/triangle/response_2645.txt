Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in the graph more efficiently. 

First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:
- Node 4 has degree 5
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 6
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 3

Let's assign new labels to the nodes according to their degrees:
- Label 0: Node 7
- Label 1: Node 5
- Label 2: Node 0
- Label 3: Node 8
- Label 4: Node 6
- Label 5: Node 1
- Label 6: Node 3
- Label 7: Node 4
- Label 8: Node 2
- Label 9: Node 9

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 3>
- Triangle 2: <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle 3: <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle 4: <0, 2, 9>
- Triangle 5: <0, 3, 6>
- Triangle 6: <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle 7: <0, 5, 3>
- Triangle 8: <0, 5, 4>
- Triangle 9: <0, 5, 1>
- Triangle 10: <0, 3, 8>
- Triangle 11: <2, 9, 4>
- Triangle 12: <2, 9, 8>
- Triangle 13: <2, 9, 3>
- Triangle 14: <2, 9, 6>
- Triangle 15: <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle 16: <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle 17: <2, 4, 1>
- Triangle 18: <2, 4, 5>
- Triangle 19: <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle 20: <1, 4, 5>
- Triangle 21: <1, 4, 6>
- Triangle 22: <4, 7, 9>
- Triangle 23: <4, 7, 8>
- Triangle 24: <4, 9, 8>
- Triangle 25: <4, 6, 9>
- Triangle 26: <5, 4, 1>
- Triangle 27: <5, 4, 7>
- Triangle 28: <5, 4, 6>
- Triangle 29: <6, 4, 9>
- Triangle 30: <6, 4, 7>
- Triangle 31: <9, 4, 7>
- Triangle 32: <9, 4, 6>
- Triangle 33: <4, 5, 6>
- Triangle 34: <4, 5, 1>
- Triangle 35: <8, 2, 9>
- Triangle 36: <8, 2, 1>
- Triangle 37: <8, 9, 7>
- Triangle 38: <8, 9, 4>
- Triangle 39: <9, 2, 1>
  
The total number of triangles found in the graph is [39].
