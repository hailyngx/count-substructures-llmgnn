Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 7) (2, 13) (2, 20) (18, 27) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 17) (28, 8) (28, 6) (28, 1) (28, 12) (9, 22) (9, 12) (9, 24) (9, 14) (22, 9) (22, 0) (22, 25) (3, 27) (3, 5) (11, 13) (11, 19) (11, 15) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 21) (27, 18) (27, 3) (27, 21) (27, 5) (1, 28) (1, 25) (1, 24) (15, 8) (15, 11) (15, 10) (10, 15) (10, 23) (10, 5) (21, 6) (21, 4) (21, 27) (21, 23) (17, 6) (17, 0) (19, 11) (19, 4) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 29) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 20) (12, 28) (12, 9) (12, 16) (12, 29) (29, 7) (29, 12) (29, 25) (0, 22) (0, 17) (0, 25) (0, 23) (20, 2) (20, 16) (23, 10) (23, 21) (23, 0) (25, 13) (25, 22) (25, 1) (25, 29) (25, 0) (14, 9) (14, 24) (24, 9) (24, 4) (24, 1) (24, 14) (5, 3) (5, 27) (5, 10) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. Then, we assign new labels to the vertices based on their sorted order.

After sorting the vertices and assigning new labels, the degrees of the vertices are as follows:
- Vertex 0 has degree 4
- Vertex 1 has degree 3
- Vertex 2 has degree 3
- Vertex 3 has degree 2
- Vertex 4 has degree 4
- Vertex 5 has degree 4
- Vertex 6 has degree 4
- Vertex 7 has degree 4
- Vertex 8 has degree 4
- Vertex 9 has degree 4
- Vertex 10 has degree 3
- Vertex 11 has degree 4
- Vertex 12 has degree 4
- Vertex 13 has degree 6
- Vertex 14 has degree 2
- Vertex 15 has degree 3
- Vertex 16 has degree 3
- Vertex 17 has degree 3
- Vertex 18 has degree 1
- Vertex 19 has degree 3
- Vertex 20 has degree 2
- Vertex 21 has degree 4
- Vertex 22 has degree 3
- Vertex 23 has degree 3
- Vertex 24 has degree 4
- Vertex 25 has degree 5
- Vertex 26 has degree 0
- Vertex 27 has degree 4
- Vertex 28 has degree 5
- Vertex 29 has degree 4

Following the edge information given, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- <18, 27>
- <1, 28>
- <3, 27>
- <0, 22>
- <4, 24>
- <5, 10>
- <5, 27>
- <2, 20>
- <0, 23>
- <2, 13>
- <17, 21>
- <4, 19>
- <0, 25>
- <1, 25>
- <12, 29>
- <7, 16>
- <7, 29>
- <6, 28>
- <6, 17>
- <6, 21>
- <9, 22>
- <10, 23>
- <15, 8>
- <15, 11>
- <11, 19>
- <25, 29>
- <1, 24>
- <12, 16>
- <12, 28>
- <13, 25>
- <7, 13>

- <16, 20>
- <12, 16>
- <12, 29>
- <7, 16>
- <7, 29>
- <9, 14>
