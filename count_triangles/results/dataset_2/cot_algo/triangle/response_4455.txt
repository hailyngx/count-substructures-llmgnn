Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 12) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 1) (4, 2) (4, 1) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 14) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles in a graph efficiently. Let's apply this method to the given graph:

1. Sort the vertices by the number of connections:
- Node 4 and Node 8 have degree 1.
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, Node 7, Node 10, and Node 11 have degree 2.
- Node 1, Node 3, Node 6, Node 9, and Node 14 have degree 3.
- Node 12 and Node 13 have degree 6.

2. Relabel the vertices in ascending order based on their degrees:
- Label 0: Node 4, Node 8
- Label 2: Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, Node 7, Node 10, Node 11
- Label 3: Node 1, Node 3, Node 6, Node 9, Node 14
- Label 6: Node 12, Node 13

3. Count the triangles by considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Looking at the edges involving vertices with labels: (0, 2, 3, 6)
  - Triangle: <9, 1, 12>
  - Triangle: <11, 10, 0>
  - Triangle: <13, 1, 5>

4. Output the total number of triangles: [3]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 3.
