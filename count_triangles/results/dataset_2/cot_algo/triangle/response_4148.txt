Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes: 0, 6, 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes: 0, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes: 3, 4, 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes: 2, 5, 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 9 is connected to nodes: 3, 4, 6, 7

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes Degree:
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 6

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

Triangles: [12]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 9>
