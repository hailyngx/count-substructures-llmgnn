Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 5) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (9, 1) (9, 8) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 14) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 10) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 6) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Vertex 8 (degree 3)
Vertex 9 (degree 2)
Vertex 5 (degree 2)
Vertex 10 (degree 3)
Vertex 13 (degree 3)
Vertex 7 (degree 4)
Vertex 4 (degree 4)
Vertex 2 (degree 4)
Vertex 6 (degree 6)
Vertex 14 (degree 4)
Vertex 0 (degree 6)
Vertex 11 (degree 6)
Vertex 1 (degree 6)
Vertex 3 (degree 6)

After relabeling the vertices, the graph becomes:
```
0------1
 \    /|\
  \  / | 3 6
   \/  | /|\
    8  2 11 |
        |__| 12
        13 4 14
             | |
             9 5
             
```

The triangles in the graph are:
[40]

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 12>
<0, 6, 10>
<0, 6, 11>
<0, 7, 12>
<0, 13, 1>
<0, 13, 2>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 6, 11>
<2, 6, 10>
<2, 6, 11>
<2, 7, 13>
<4, 3, 12>
