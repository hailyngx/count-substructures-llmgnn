Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 12) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 13) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 13) (18, 22) (18, 28) (18, 29) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 14) (22, 7) (2, 11) (2, 4) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 9) (6, 28) (6, 17) (28, 18) (28, 6) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 26) (29, 18) (29, 23) (26, 22) (26, 17) (26, 13) (26, 5) (13, 25) (13, 20) (13, 26) (13, 19) (13, 27) (8, 21) (8, 12) (21, 8) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 24) (10, 15) (10, 21) (10, 9) (11, 2) (11, 23) (11, 4) (23, 29) (23, 11) (23, 4) (27, 25) (27, 13) (27, 5) (16, 17) (16, 21) (16, 14) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 23) (4, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 0) (5, 26) (5, 27) (7, 3) (7, 22) (7, 1) (19, 15) (19, 13) (14, 22) (14, 16) (14, 9) (24, 21) (24, 0) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 14) (1, 7) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 24) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Nodes sorted by degrees:  
Node 1: 1  
Node 5: 1  
Node 8: 2  
Node 2: 2  
Node 3: 2  
Node 18: 3  
Node 10: 3  
Node 23: 3  
Node 9: 3  
Node 4: 4  
Node 6: 4  
Node 27: 4  
Node 26: 5  
Node 28: 5  
Node 7: 5  
Node 24: 5  
Node 11: 5  
Node 21: 5  
Node 16: 5  
Node 14: 5  
Node 19: 5  
Node 29: 5  
Node 17: 6  
Node 12: 6  
Node 25: 6  
Node 20: 6  
Node 13: 6  
Node 0: 6  
Node 22: 7  
Node 15: 7  

Now we can begin counting the triangles by examining each edge:

[Number of triangles]: [Total count]

<14, 16, 22>  
<11, 4, 23>

<6, 13, 20>  
<16, 17, 21>  
<9, 14, 16>

<8, 12, 0>  
<12, 3, 7>  
<12, 3, 8>  
<12, 0, 24>
