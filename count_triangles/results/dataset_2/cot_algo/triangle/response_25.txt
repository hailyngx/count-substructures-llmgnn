Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
Following are the nodes sorted by their degrees from least to most:
Nodes: 0, 4, 5, 1, 7, 9, 8, 2, 6, 3

The total number of triangles is [8].  
The unique triangles found are: <5, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <0, 2, 7>.
