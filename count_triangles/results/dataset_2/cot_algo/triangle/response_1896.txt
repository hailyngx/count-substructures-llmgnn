Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 8) (0, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 3), (9, 8), (9, 10), (9, 13), (1, 3), (1, 8), (1, 7), (3, 4), (10, 11), (10, 6), (10, 12), (11, 7), (11, 13), (8, 0), (13, 12), (13, 2), (13, 7), (7, 0), (12, 14), (0, 7), (14, 2), (6, 2), (2, 14), (2, 4)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

The sorted vertices based on the number of connections are:
{0, 6, 14, 5, 11, 12, 9, 3, 6, 1, 7, 10, 13, 4, 2}

The triangles in the graph are:
[18]
<0, 8, 7>
<0, 8, 11>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 11>
<0, 7, 12>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 5, 4>
<1, 3, 4>
<2, 5, 4>
<2, 13, 4>
<2, 13, 14>
<2, 4, 10>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 4>
<6, 10, 2>
<7, 11, 8>
<7, 11, 13>
<11, 13, 12>
