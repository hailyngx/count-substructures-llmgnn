Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 1) (14, 4) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 3) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 19) (10, 8) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 15) (6, 3) (6, 0) (3, 17) (3, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 18) (9, 4) (9, 12) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 12) (16, 7) (16, 8) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 12) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 11) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 18) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Based on the given graph, the vertices can be relabeled with the following connections:
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 1: 5 connections
- Node 2: 0 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 5 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections
- Node 10: 2 connections
- Node 11: 3 connections
- Node 12: 4 connections
- Node 13: 5 connections
- Node 14: 3 connections
- Node 15: 4 connections
- Node 16: 2 connections
- Node 17: 2 connections
- Node 18: 4 connections
- Node 19: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method mentioned earlier, we only consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. By examining each such edge, we find the triangles in the given graph. 

After counting the total number of triangles, we find there are 7 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are:
<1, 4, 11>
<1, 4, 13>
<0, 7, 18>
<0, 15, 18>
<0, 6, 18>
<1, 11, 5>
<8, 13, 19> 

Thus, the output for the total number of triangles and the unique triangles will be:
[7]
<1, 4, 11> <1, 4, 13> <0, 7, 18> <0, 15, 18> <0, 6, 18> <1, 11, 5> <8, 13, 19>
