Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 25) (1, 24) (21, 28) (21, 25) (21, 15) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (0, 10) (0, 8) (27, 12) (27, 9) (12, 4) (12, 27) (12, 10) (12, 23) (20, 3) (26, 28) (26, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 15) (8, 0) (8, 24) (8, 15) (28, 21) (28, 26) (28, 10) (22, 15) (29, 19) (18, 6) (18, 13) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 24) (5, 14) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 28) (10, 3) (16, 2) (16, 24) (24, 1) (24, 8) (24, 5) (24, 16) (3, 20) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 9) (3, 19) (17, 3) (17, 23) (17, 11) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 19) (19, 29) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 23) (6, 18) (6, 11) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 6) (9, 7) (9, 27) (9, 3) (23, 12) (23, 17) (23, 19) (15, 21) (15, 2) (15, 8) (15, 22) (15, 13) (14, 7) (14, 5) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 15) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the number of triangles. 
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree = 2
- Node 1: degree = 2
- Node 2: degree = 5
- Node 3: degree = 5
- Node 4: degree = 4
- Node 5: degree = 5
- Node 6: degree = 2
- Node 7: degree = 4
- Node 8: degree = 3
- Node 9: degree = 3
- Node 10: degree = 4
- Node 11: degree = 4
- Node 12: degree = 4
- Node 13: degree = 3
- Node 14: degree = 2
- Node 15: degree = 5
- Node 16: degree = 2
- Node 17: degree = 3
- Node 18: degree = 2
- Node 19: degree = 4
- Node 20: degree = 2
- Node 21: degree = 3
- Node 22: degree = 1
- Node 23: degree = 3
- Node 24: degree = 5
- Node 25: degree = 3
- Node 26: degree = 3
- Node 27: degree = 2
- Node 28: degree = 4
- Node 29: degree = 2

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degree in ascending order. Nodes with the same degree will be labeled in increasing order of their ID.
- Node 22 (degree 1)
- Node 0, 1, 6, 14, 20, 27, 29 (degree 2)
- Node 17, 18, 9, 13 (degree 3)
- Node 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 25, 26, 28 (degree 4)
- Node 2, 3, 5, 8, 15, 19, 23, 24 (degree 5)

Next, we will check each edge, making sure to consider only the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.
After checking, we find that there are 46 triangles in the graph.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [46].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 10>, <0, 3, 19>, <0, 8, 15>, <1, 24, 25>, <2, 4, 11>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 12>, <2, 5, 11>, <2, 5, 24>, <2, 8, 15>, <3, 9, 23>, <3, 10, 12>, <3, 10, 19>, <3, 10, 28>, <3, 11, 17>, <3, 13, 15>, <3, 19, 23>, <4, 7, 11>, <4, 7, 12>, <4, 11, 6>, <4, 12, 23>, <5, 11, 17>, <5, 14, 24>, <5, 24, 16>, <8, 15, 22>, <10, 28, 21>, <10, 28, 26>, <11, 6, 18>, <12, 10, 28>, <12, 23, 17>, <13, 15, 18>, <15, 13, 7>, <15, 19, 23>, <15, 21, 28>, <16, 2, 24>, <17, 11, 6>, <17, 19, 23>, <19, 23, 12>, <23, 17, 11>, <24, 1, 25>, <24, 16, 5>, <24, 5, 2>, <28, 21, 25>, <28, 26, 5>.
