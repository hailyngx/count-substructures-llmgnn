Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method has the following steps:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections):
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 2

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Node 3 -> Node 0 (degree: 2)
- Node 5 -> Node 1 (degree: 4)
- Node 6 -> Node 2 (degree: 4)
- Node 7 -> Node 3 (degree: 4)
- Node 8 -> Node 4 (degree: 4)
- Node 9 -> Node 5 (degree: 4)
- Node 1 -> Node 6 (degree: 4)
- Node 4 -> Node 7 (degree: 4)
- Node 0 -> Node 8 (degree: 4)
- Node 2 -> Node 9 (degree: 5)

3. Count the triangles by examining the edges based on the new labels:
- <2, 9, 6>
- <2, 6, 0>
- <2, 6, 1>
- <2, 6, 4>
- <0, 6, 1>
- <0, 6, 4>
- <0, 6, 2>
- <0, 6, 3>
- <6, 1, 4>
- <6, 1, 7>
- <6, 4, 7>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <6, 2, 9>
- <6, 2, 4>
- <6, 4, 7>
- <6, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <4, 7, 5>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 1>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <7, 5, 8>
- <7, 5, 1>
- <7, 5, 9>
- <7, 1, 8>
- <7, 1, 9>
- <7, 1, 5>
- <5, 9, 1>
- <5, 9, 8>
- <5, 9, 7>
- <9, 1, 8>
- <9, 1, 7>
- <9, 8, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [39].
