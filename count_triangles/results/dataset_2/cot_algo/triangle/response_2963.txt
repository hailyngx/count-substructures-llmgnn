Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 11) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (5, 7) (5, 3) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 9) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]

Edges:
- 0: [13, 9, 14]
- 1: [3, 11, 2, 9, 8]
- 2: [1, 3, 13, 9]
- 3: [1, 2, 5, 12]
- 4: [7, 8, 14, 6]
- 5: [7, 3]
- 6: [4, 7, 9, 10, 11]
- 7: [4, 12, 11, 6, 5]
- 8: [4, 1, 13, 14, 12]
- 9: [1, 6, 2, 11, 0]
- 10: [6, 11]
- 11: [7, 1, 6, 9, 10]
- 12: [7, 3, 8, 13]
- 13: [8, 12, 2, 0]
- 14: [4, 8, 0]

Applying the degree-based ordering method:
Nodes ordered by degree: [0, 5, 10, 2, 14, 13, 12, 9, 3, 1, 8, 6, 11, 4, 7]
