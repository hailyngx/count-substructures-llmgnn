Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 0) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 19) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 7) (7, 17) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 15) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (18, 6) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 0) (15, 9) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 14) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 19) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 8) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (3, 10) (14, 4) (14, 15) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (5, 17) (5, 12) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in the graph efficiently by following a systematic approach:

1. Count the degree of each vertex (number of connections each node has):
   - Vertex 0: degree 4
   - Vertex 1: degree 3
   - Vertex 2: degree 4
   - Vertex 3: degree 1
   - Vertex 4: degree 3
   - Vertex 5: degree 2
   - Vertex 6: degree 4
   - Vertex 7: degree 2
   - Vertex 8: degree 3
   - Vertex 9: degree 5
   - Vertex 10: degree 4
   - Vertex 11: degree 3
   - Vertex 12: degree 3
   - Vertex 13: degree 3
   - Vertex 14: degree 2
   - Vertex 15: degree 4
   - Vertex 16: degree 2
   - Vertex 17: degree 4
   - Vertex 18: degree 1
   - Vertex 19: degree 4

2. Sort the vertices based on degrees in ascending order:
   - Vertex 3, 5, 18 (Degree 1)
   - Vertex 1, 7, 12, 11, 14 (Degree 2)
   - Vertex 0, 4, 8, 16 (Degree 3)
   - Vertex 10, 13, 17, 19, 6 (Degree 4)
   - Vertex 2, 9, 15 (Degree 5)

3. Count the triangles by examining each edge in the sorted order:
   - Count the triangles that form between each pair of edges and the shared connections.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [21].
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 15>, <4, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 11>, <1, 2, 15>, <1, 12, 15>, <8, 15, 19>, <10, 17, 19>, <6, 9, 15>, <12, 11, 15>, <0, 9, 13>, <7, 8, 17>, <8, 10, 19>, <0, 9, 16>, <10, 3, 17>, <2, 4, 6>, <9, 13, 15>, <6, 2, 9>, <1, 11, 15>, <6, 13, 4>, <8, 17, 19>, <4, 13, 0>.
