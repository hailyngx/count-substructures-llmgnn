Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 12) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 7) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- 0: (1, 5), (7, 10), (8, 14)
- 1: (3, 1), (5, 9), (6, 1), (7, 1), (9, 1)
- 2: (3, 2), (6, 2), (8, 2), (13, 2)
- 3: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 12)
- 4: (4, 6), (4, 12), (12, 4)
- 5: (1, 5), (5, 9)
- 6: (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (6, 1), (6, 9), (6, 10)
- 7: (0, 7), (1, 7), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 12)
- 8: (0, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (8, 10), (8, 13), (8, 14)
- 9: (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (9, 1), (9, 11), (9, 12)
- 10: (7, 10), (8, 10), (10, 6), (10, 8), (10, 11)
- 11: (9, 11), (10, 11), (11, 14)
- 12: (3, 12), (4, 12), (7, 12), (9, 12), (12, 4)
- 13: (2, 13), (8, 13), (13, 14)
- 14: (8, 14), (11, 14), (13, 14)

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices by degree: 0 < 5 < 13 < 4 < 2 < 12 < 11 < 10 < 14 < 7 < 3 < 1 < 6 < 9 < 8

Counting triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Triangles: [4]

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
Unique triangles: <7, 9, 12>, <6, 3, 1>, <6, 3, 2>, <8, 13, 2>
