Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 18) (16, 14) (16, 15) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 17) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 14) (17, 18) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 10) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 13) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 15) (12, 8) (12, 18) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows with the stated edges: 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
(0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 8)
(1, 4), (1, 9), (1, 14)
(2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 13)
(3, 10), (3, 14), (3, 19)
(4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 8), (4, 18)
(5, 6), (5, 10), (5, 19)
(6, 0), (6, 5)
(7, 11), (7, 15), (7, 19)
(8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 12)
(9, 1), (9, 13)
(10, 3), (10, 5), (10, 14)
(11, 7), (11, 18), (11, 19)
(12, 8), (12, 18)
(13, 2), (13, 9), (13, 15)
(14, 1), (14, 3), (14, 10), (14, 16)
(15, 7), (15, 13), (15, 16)
(16, 14), (16, 15)
(17, 18)
(18, 4), (18, 11), (18, 12), (18, 17)
(19, 3), (19, 5), (19, 7), (19, 11)

Now, let's count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by degrees (connections):
0 (degree: 3), 1 (degree: 3), 2 (degree: 3), 3 (degree: 3), 6 (degree: 2), 12 (degree: 2), 13 (degree: 3), 16 (degree: 2), 17 (degree: 1), 7 (degree: 3), 5 (degree: 3), 9 (degree: 2), 15 (degree: 3), 10 (degree: 3), 14 (degree: 4), 18 (degree: 4), 4 (degree: 5), 8 (degree: 4), 11 (degree: 3), 19 (degree: 4)

Now, we will count the triangles and provide the final answer in brackets []:

The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<9, 13, 15>, <5, 6, 0>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 14, 3>, <14, 16, 15>, <4, 18, 11>, <4, 8, 2>, <7, 11, 19>
