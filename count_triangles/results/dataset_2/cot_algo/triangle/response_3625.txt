Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 2) (8, 3) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 1) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 2) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 13) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the total number of triangles in the graph. 

Let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
1. Vertex 8: Degree 1
2. Vertex 12: Degree 2
3. Vertex 14: Degree 2
4. Vertex 2: Degree 3
5. Vertex 5: Degree 4
6. Vertex 3: Degree 4
7. Vertex 0: Degree 4
8. Vertex 1: Degree 4
9. Vertex 9: Degree 4
10. Vertex 10: Degree 4
11. Vertex 13: Degree 4
12. Vertex 11: Degree 4
13. Vertex 6: Degree 5
14. Vertex 7: Degree 5
15. Vertex 4: Degree 5

Now, analyze the edges by considering only pairs where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (4, 9) ➡ Shared connections: 6
2. Edge (4, 10) ➡ Shared connections: 6
3. Edge (4, 11) ➡ Shared connections: 6
4. Edge (4, 6) ➡ Shared connections: 7
5. Edge (7, 0) ➡ Shared connections: 3
6. Edge (7, 3) ➡ Shared connections: 3
7. Edge (7, 6) ➡ Shared connections: 6
8. Edge (10, 6) ➡ Shared connections: 5
9. Edge (10, 1) ➡ Shared connections: 4
10. Edge (11, 4) ➡ Shared connections: 6

Therefore, based on the shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we find that there are:
- 3 triangles involving vertices 4, 6, and 9
- 2 triangles involving vertices 4, 6, and 10
- 2 triangles involving vertices 4, 6, and 11
- 1 triangle involving vertices 0, 3, and 7
- 1 triangle involving vertices 6, 7, and 10

Counting all these unique triangles, we find the total number of triangles in the graph: [7]

The unique triangles found are: <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 10>, <4, 6, 11>, <0, 3, 7>, <6, 7, 10>
