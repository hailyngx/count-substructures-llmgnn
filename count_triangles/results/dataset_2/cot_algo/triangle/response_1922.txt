Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 13) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (12, 4) (12, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 14) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is as described. 

Let's label the nodes based on their number of connections in ascending order: 
Node 8 (Degree 1): Connected to nodes {8}
Node 10 (Degree 1): Connected to nodes {10}
Node 12 (Degree 1): Connected to nodes {12}
Node 0 (Degree 2): Connected to nodes {0, 5}
Node 1 (Degree 2): Connected to nodes {1, 6}
Node 11 (Degree 2): Connected to nodes {11, 12}
Node 2 (Degree 3): Connected to nodes {2, 7, 10}
Node 13 (Degree 3): Connected to nodes {3, 8, 13}
Node 3 (Degree 4): Connected to nodes {4, 9, 14}
Node 9 (Degree 4): Connected to nodes {15, 16, 17}
Node 5 (Degree 6): Connected to nodes {18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23}
Node 14 (Degree 6): Connected to nodes {24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}
Node 4 (Degree 8): Connected to nodes {30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37}
Node 6 (Degree 8): Connected to nodes {38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45}
Node 7 (Degree 8): Connected to nodes {46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53}
