Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 8) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 10) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 18) (6, 13) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 18) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 2) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 0) (7, 14) (7, 4) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 8) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 19) (5, 17) (1, 18) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 8) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree of connectivity. Let's list all the nodes and their degrees:

Node 0: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 1
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 1
Node 6: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 10: Degree 4
Node 11: Degree 3
Node 12: Degree 2
Node 13: Degree 4
Node 14: Degree 4
Node 15: Degree 3
Node 16: Degree 4
Node 17: Degree 4
Node 18: Degree 4
Node 19: Degree 5

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:

Node 1 (Degree 1): Relabeled as 0
Node 5 (Degree 1): Relabeled as 1
Node 6 (Degree 1): Relabeled as 2
Node 3 (Degree 2): Relabeled as 3
Node 12 (Degree 2): Relabeled as 4
Node 11 (Degree 3): Relabeled as 5
Node 7 (Degree 3): Relabeled as 6
Node 15 (Degree 3): Relabeled as 7
Node 2 (Degree 3): Relabeled as 8
Node 18 (Degree 4): Relabeled as 9
Node 13 (Degree 4): Relabeled as 10
Node 14 (Degree 4): Relabeled as 11
Node 16 (Degree 4): Relabeled as 12
Node 17 (Degree 4): Relabeled as 13
Node 0 (Degree 4): Relabeled as 14
Node 4 (Degree 4): Relabeled as 15
Node 10 (Degree 4): Relabeled as 16
Node 9 (Degree 4): Relabeled as 17
Node 8 (Degree 5): Relabeled as 18
Node 19 (Degree 5): Relabeled as 19

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles by examining each edge:

[Total number of triangles: 6]
<11, 8, 16>
<16, 9, 13>
<16, 2, 10>
<4, 7, 14>
<4, 0, 17>
<0, 13, 14>
