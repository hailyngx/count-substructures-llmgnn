Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 12) (15, 4) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 17) (1, 14) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 18) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 14) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 19) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 4) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 16) (4, 15) (4, 16) (4, 9) (9, 19) (9, 4) (9, 12) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 9) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 5) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 7) 

Response:
Vertices with their connections:
0: 7, 18, 8, 6
1: 14
2: 5, 6
3: 7
4: 15, 16, 9
5: 13, 2, 8, 12, 18
6: 17, 0, 2
7: 3, 0, 16, 14
8: 0, 5, 16
9: 19, 4, 12
10: 11
11: 10, 19, 17
12: 15, 5, 9
13: 15, 17, 5, 19
14: 15, 1, 7
15: 13, 14, 12, 4
16: 7, 8, 4
17: 11, 13, 6, 18
18: 17, 0, 5
19: 11, 13, 9

With the above ordering, we start counting the triangles:

Number of triangles: [33]
Unique triangles: <0, 7, 14>, <0, 5, 18>, <0, 6, 17>, <0, 8, 16>, <2, 5, 6>, <4, 9, 12>, <7, 14, 15>, <7, 14, 15>, <7, 16, 4>, <9, 12, 15>, <10, 11, 19>, <11, 13, 19>, <13, 17, 19>, <13, 17, 5>, <5, 13, 15>, <5, 13, 19>, <5, 8, 16>, <5, 12, 9>, <6, 17, 18>, <14, 15, 1>, <14, 15, 1>, <16, 7, 3>, <16, 7, 3>, <16, 8, 0>, <16, 8, 0>, <16, 4, 15>, <17, 11, 10>, <17, 13, 15>, <17, 18, 0>, <18, 5, 13>, <18, 5, 0>, <19, 11, 10>, <19, 13, 15>
