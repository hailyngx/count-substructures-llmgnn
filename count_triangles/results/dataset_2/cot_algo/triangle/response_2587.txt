Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 15) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 7) (8, 11) (8, 18) (13, 3) (13, 19) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 16) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 6) (0, 3) (0, 11) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 12) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 4) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 1) (3, 13) (3, 0) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 15) (7, 17) (4, 2) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 10) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 18) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be used to count the number of triangles in the graph you provided.

Based on the given edges, the number of connections for each node (or vertex) is as follows:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 1 connection
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections
- Node 10: 4 connections
- Node 11: 4 connections
- Node 12: 4 connections
- Node 13: 2 connections
- Node 14: 4 connections
- Node 15: 4 connections
- Node 16: 3 connections
- Node 17: 5 connections
- Node 18: 3 connections
- Node 19: 4 connections

Sorted by the number of connections in ascending order, the relabeled nodes are:
- Node 7 (1 connection)
- Node 4 (2 connections)
- Node 3 (2 connections)
- Node 9 (2 connections)
- Node 8 (2 connections)
- Node 0 (3 connections)
- Node 5 (3 connections)
- Node 16 (3 connections)
- Node 13 (2 connections)
- Node 1 (4 connections)
- Node 10 (4 connections)
- Node 19 (4 connections)
- Node 14 (4 connections)
- Node 6 (4 connections)
- Node 15 (4 connections)
- Node 2 (4 connections)
- Node 12 (4 connections)
- Node 11 (4 connections)
- Node 17 (5 connections)
- Node 18 (3 connections)

Now, we will count the number of triangles by going through the edges:
1. (5, 9) forms a triangle with (9, 15) and (15, 5) 
2. (5, 1) forms a triangle with (1, 10) and (10, 5)
