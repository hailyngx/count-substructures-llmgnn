Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: 
(22, 27), (22, 17), (23, 26), (23, 14), (23, 28), (23, 19), (2, 18), (2, 9), (2, 11), (18, 4), (18, 9), (18, 17), (18, 25), (1, 26), (1, 25), (26, 10), (4, 19), (4, 24), (21, 24), (28, 9), (28, 14), (28, 25), (27, 11), (7, 6), (1, 25), (10, 26), (20, 6), (29, 12), (15, 13), (16, 12)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Vertices sorted by the number of connections (ascending order):
Degree 1: {3, 5, 7, 8, 13, 20, 21, 22, 27}
Degree 2: {0, 12, 15, 16}
Degree 3: {10, 18, 24, 29}
Degree 4: {1, 11, 19}
Degree 5: {4, 28}
Degree 6: {6, 14}
Degree 7: {9, 25}
Degree 8: {2, 26}
Degree 9: {17}
Degree 10: {23}
