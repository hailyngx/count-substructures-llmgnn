Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 4), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 0), (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 2), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 1), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 1), (0, 2), (8, 9), (8, 3), (8, 1), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 0), (1, 8), (1, 2), (3, 9), (3, 0), (3, 8), (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:

Nodes by degrees: 7, 2, 8, 3, 0, 5, 6, 1, 4, 9

Next, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

[Result]
Total number of triangles: [4]

<1, 5, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
