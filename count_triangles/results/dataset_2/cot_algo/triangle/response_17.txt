Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 29) (7, 14) (7, 17) (3, 25) (25, 3) (25, 16) (25, 23) (25, 15) (1, 26) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 10) (2, 17) (18, 19) (18, 20) (18, 12) (15, 25) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 21) (20, 18) (20, 15) (20, 16) (20, 24) (26, 1) (26, 17) (8, 0) (8, 22) (8, 27) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (19, 18) (19, 0) (5, 10) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 24) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 21) (21, 15) (21, 13) (21, 27) (21, 9) (14, 7) (14, 22) (14, 23) (22, 8) (22, 14) (22, 16) (22, 6) (22, 28) (27, 8) (27, 21) (27, 23) (9, 21) (12, 18) (12, 24) (12, 28) (16, 25) (16, 20) (16, 29) (16, 22) (24, 20) (24, 29) (24, 12) (24, 28) (24, 23) (23, 25) (23, 14) (23, 27) (23, 24) (17, 7) (17, 2) (17, 26) (6, 22) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 28) (28, 22) (28, 12) (28, 24) (28, 10) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) from least to most. 
Here is the list of vertices sorted by degree:

Vertices: 4, 3, 5, 6, 9, 11, 30, 7, 26, 2, 19, 13, 9, 1, 18, 12, 29, 0, 16, 8, 17, 22, 21, 15, 27, 25, 14, 20, 24, 23, 28

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
Please find the total number of triangles and the unique triangles below:
