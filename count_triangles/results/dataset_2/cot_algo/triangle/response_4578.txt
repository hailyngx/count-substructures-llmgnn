Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is: 

\[ 4 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 9 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 3 \]

Calculating the number of triangles: 

- For edge (1, 3):
    - Vertex 1 (degree 4) has connections with vertices 3, 5, 9, 8.
    - Vertex 3 (degree 5) has connections with vertices 1, 7, 0, 6, 9.
    - Shared connections: 1, 9.
    - Triangle found: <1, 3, 9>.

- For edge (1, 5):
    - Vertex 1 (degree 4) has connections with vertices 3, 5, 9, 8.
    - Vertex 5 (degree 4) has connections with vertices 1, 6, 7.
    - Shared connections: 1.
    - No triangles found.

- For edge (1, 9):
    - Vertex 1 (degree 4) has connections with vertices 3, 5, 9, 8.
    - Vertex 9 (degree 5) has connections with vertices 1, 3, 2, 7, 0.
    - Shared connections: 1, 3.
    - Triangle found: <1, 3, 9>.

- For edge (1, 8):
    - Vertex 1 (degree 4) has connections with vertices 3, 5, 9, 8.
    - Vertex 8 (degree 3) has connections with vertices 1, 7, 6.
    - Shared connections: 1.
    - No triangles found.

- For edge (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 6), (3, 9), (8, 1), (8, 6), (8, 7), (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 5), (6, 7), (2, 4), (2, 9), (2, 7), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 9), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 9), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 7), (9, 0) - No additional triangles found with these edges.

Total number of triangles: [2]
