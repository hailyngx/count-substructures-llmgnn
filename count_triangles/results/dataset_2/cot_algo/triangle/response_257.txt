Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by the number of their connections in ascending order:
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 6 connections
Vertex 4: 6 connections
Vertex 3: 6 connections

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 6 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 0
Vertex 5 (4 connections) becomes Vertex 1
Vertex 0 (4 connections) becomes Vertex 2
Vertex 2 (5 connections) becomes Vertex 3
Vertex 9 (5 connections) becomes Vertex 4
Vertex 1 (5 connections) becomes Vertex 5
Vertex 8 (5 connections) becomes Vertex 6
Vertex 7 (6 connections) becomes Vertex 7
Vertex 4 (6 connections) becomes Vertex 8
Vertex 3 (6 connections) becomes Vertex 9

3. Let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Checking the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
  1. Edge: (4, 7) -> Both have 6 connections, skip.
  2. Edge: (4, 8) -> Both have 5 connections, skip.
  3. Edge: (4, 1) -> Node 4 (Vertex 8) has 6 connections, Node 1 (Vertex 5) has 5 connections, proceed.
     Shared connections: 2 (Vertex 0) and 3 (Vertex 9)
  4. Edge: (4, 3) -> Node 4 (Vertex 8) has 6 connections, Node 3 (Vertex 9) has 6 connections, skip.
  5. Edge: (7, 6) -> Node 7 (Vertex 7) has 6 connections, Node 6 (Vertex 0) has 2 connections, proceed.
     Shared connections: None.
  6. Edge: (7, 9) -> Both have 5 connections, skip.
  7. Edge: (7, 2) -> Node 7 (Vertex 7) has 6 connections, Node 2 (Vertex 3) has 5 connections, proceed.
     Shared connections: 0 (Vertex 2)
  8. Edge: (7, 1) -> Node 7 (Vertex 7) has 6 connections, Node 1 (Vertex 5) has 5 connections, proceed.
     Shared connections: 2 (Vertex 0)
  9. Edge: (8, 5) -> Node 8 (Vertex 6) has 5 connections, Node 5 (Vertex 1) has 4 connections, proceed.
     Shared connections: None.
  10. Edge: (5, 6) -> Node 5 (Vertex 1) has 4 connections, Node 6 (Vertex 0) has 2 connections, proceed.
     Shared connections: None.
  11. Edge: (2, 7) -> Node 2 (Vertex 3) has 5 connections, Node 7 (Vertex 7) has 6 connections, proceed.
     Shared connections: 0 (Vertex 2)
  12. Edge: (9, 7) -> Both have 5 connections, skip.
  13. Edge: (9, 8) -> Both have 5 connections, skip.
  14. Edge: (1, 0) -> Node 1 (Vertex 5) has 5 connections, Node 0 (Vertex 2) has 4 connections, proceed.
     Shared connections: None.
  15. Edge: (0, 3) -> Node 0 (Vertex 2) has 4 connections, Node 3 (Vertex 9) has 6 connections, skip.
  16. Edge: (3, 4) -> Node 3 (Vertex 9) has 6 connections, Node 4 (Vertex 8) has 6 connections, skip.
  17. Edge: (3, 8) -> Node 3 (Vertex 9) has 6 connections, Node 8 (Vertex 6) has 5 connections, proceed.
     Shared connections: None.
  18. Edge: (3, 2) -> Node 3 (Vertex 9) has 6 connections, Node 2 (Vertex 3) has 5 connections, proceed.
     Shared connections: None.
  19. Edge: (3, 9) -> Both have 5 connections, skip.
  20. Edge: (3, 0) -> Node 3 (Vertex 9) has 6 connections, Node 0 (Vertex 2) has 4 connections, proceed.
     Shared connections: None.

The total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3> and <0, 5, 7>.
