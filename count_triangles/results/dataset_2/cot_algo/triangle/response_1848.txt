Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 12) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 17) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 7) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 17) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 19) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (16, 8) (18, 19) (18, 14) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 14) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 12) (14, 7) (4, 11) (7, 8) (7, 14) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 18: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 16: 2 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 10: 3 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 15: 3 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 19: 3 connections

Using the degree-based ordering, we will count the triangles in the graph:

1. Checking the edges with the lowest label first:
- Edge (3, 15): Node 3 has connections with nodes 6, 9, 17. Node 15 has connections with nodes 1, 12. Shared connection between 3 and 15 is node 1. Triangle <3, 15, 1>.
- Edge (3, 17): Node 3 has connections with nodes 6, 9, 15. Node 17 has connections with nodes 9, 1, 19. Shared connection between 3 and 17 is node 9. Triangle <3, 17, 9>.
- Edge (3, 6): Node 3 has connections with nodes 9, 15, 17. Node 6 has connections with nodes 5, 9, 13. Shared connection between 3 and 6 is node 9. Triangle <3, 6, 9>.
- Edge (3, 9): Node 3 has connections with nodes 6, 15, 17. Node 9 has connections with nodes 6, 11, 17. Shared connection between 3 and 9 is node 6. Triangle <3, 9, 6>.
