Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 13) (2, 17) (18, 0) (18, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (5, 8) (5, 19) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 9) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 12) (1, 11) (1, 10) (17, 2) (17, 6) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 9) (16, 7) (16, 4) (15, 0) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 12) (0, 18) (0, 11) (0, 15) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 14) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 4) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 9) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 14) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most are as follows:
Vertex 2 (degree = 2), Vertex 18 (degree = 2), Vertex 5 (degree = 2), Vertex 17 (degree = 2), Vertex 15 (degree = 2), Vertex 13 (degree = 3), Vertex 3 (degree = 3), Vertex 1 (degree = 3), Vertex 16 (degree = 3), Vertex 9 (degree = 3), Vertex 0 (degree = 4), Vertex 6 (degree = 4), Vertex 10 (degree = 4), Vertex 19 (degree = 4), Vertex 4 (degree = 4), Vertex 14 (degree = 4), Vertex 7 (degree = 5), Vertex 11 (degree = 5), Vertex 8 (degree = 5), and Vertex 12 (degree = 5).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles in the graph:

[Total number of triangles: 3]

Unique triangles:
<7, 11, 14>
<0, 11, 15>
<4, 12, 14>
