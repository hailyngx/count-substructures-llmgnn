Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:  
Nodes - Degree  
5 - 3  
9 - 3  
6 - 3  
4 - 5  
8 - 4  
2 - 4  
1 - 4  
3 - 4  
7 - 3  
0 - 4  

The triangles found in the graph are:  
<1, 4, 8>  
<1, 4, 5>  
<1, 4, 6>  
<1, 6, 3>  
<2, 4, 5>  
<2, 4, 7>  
<2, 3, 6>  
<2, 3, 4>  
<2, 0, 4>  
<2, 0, 8>  
<2, 7, 1>  
<3, 4, 8>  
<3, 4, 5>  
<3, 4, 6>  
<3, 6, 1>  
<7, 1, 5>  
<7, 1, 2>  
<7, 2, 5>  
<0, 4, 8>  
<0, 4, 5>  
<0, 4, 1>  
<0, 8, 1>  

There are a total of [22] triangles in the given graph.
