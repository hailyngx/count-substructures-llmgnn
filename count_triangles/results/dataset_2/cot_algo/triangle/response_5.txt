Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
The graph with the provided edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Edges:
(4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 2), (4, 9), (4, 0)
(7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 1), (7, 8)
(1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 9)
(3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 8)
(8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 3), (8, 5)
(5, 1), (5, 8), (5, 6), (5, 2)
(6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 0)
(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 0)
(9, 4), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 0)
(0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 2), (0, 9)

First, let's calculate the degrees of each node:

Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 5
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 3: 0
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 2
Node 7: 3
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 5
Node 0: 6
Node 1: 7
Node 2: 8
Node 4: 9

Now, we will list the triangles:
1. <5, 1, 7>
2. <8, 5, 2>
3. <7, 8, 4>
4. <7, 8, 5>
5. <7, 3, 6>
6. <5, 8, 4>
7. <9, 5, 2>
8. <9, 1, 7>
9. <4, 7, 3>
10. <4, 7, 8>
11. <4, 0, 6>
12. <0, 4, 9>
13. <0, 4, 2>
14. <2, 4, 9>
15. <2, 0, 6>
16. <0, 2, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [16].
