Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 10) (26, 13) (15, 27) (15, 7) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 18) (27, 10) (27, 5) (2, 6) (2, 11) (29, 28) (29, 17) (29, 5) (28, 29) (28, 19) (17, 29) (17, 25) (17, 24) (17, 7) (1, 14) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 10) (18, 27) (18, 4) (18, 23) (13, 26) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 21) (16, 24) (16, 22) (20, 21) (20, 23) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 28) (19, 8) (19, 14) (5, 27) (5, 29) (5, 3) (25, 17) (25, 14) (22, 4) (22, 16) (22, 10) (22, 21) (24, 17) (24, 16) (24, 21) (3, 5) (3, 12) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 25) (23, 18) (23, 20) (23, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 10) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 23) (7, 6) (0, 13) (0, 12) (21, 15) (21, 11) (21, 20) (21, 22) (21, 24) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 0) (10, 9) (10, 27) (10, 4) (10, 22) (10, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:

Nodes by degree:
Node 16: 0 connections
Node 20: 0 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 26: 1 connection
Node 25: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 19: 3 connections
Node 24: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 29: 3 connections
Node 22: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 21: 5 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 28: 5 connections
Node 17: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 23: 5 connections
Node 12: 5 connections
Node 13: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 10: 5 connections
Node 15: 5 connections
Node 27: 5 connections

Using this ordering, we analyze the edges with the condition that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

After analyzing all the edges with this condition, we find that the total number of triangles in the graph is [24].

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 27, 10>
<5, 17, 7>
<5, 29, 17>
<5, 29, 28>
<5, 29, 7>
<5, 25, 17>
<5, 3, 12>
<19, 8, 14>
<19, 8, 28>
<19, 14, 8>
<19, 14, 25>
<19, 14, 1>
<19, 14, 25>
<19, 28, 29>
