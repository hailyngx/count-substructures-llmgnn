Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) 

Response:
Let's start by sorting the vertices by their degree and assigning labels accordingly:
The degree of each node is as follows:
Node 0 - Degree = 4
Node 1 - Degree = 5
Node 2 - Degree = 5
Node 3 - Degree = 6
Node 4 - Degree = 3
Node 5 - Degree = 4
Node 6 - Degree = 5
Node 7 - Degree = 4
Node 8 - Degree = 4
Node 9 - Degree = 4

After sorting them by degree, we have the following label assignments:
Node 4 -> Label 0
Node 5 -> Label 1
Node 8 -> Label 2
Node 9 -> Label 3
Node 7 -> Label 4
Node 0 -> Label 5
Node 6 -> Label 6
Node 1 -> Label 7
Node 2 -> Label 8
Node 3 -> Label 9

Now, let's proceed with counting the triangles using the degree-based ordering method:
1. (4, 8) - No triangles
2. (4, 5) - No triangles
3. (4, 6) - No triangles
4. (7, 3) - No triangles
5. (7, 9) - No triangles
6. (7, 8) - No triangles
7. (1, 3) - Triangle <1, 3, 9>
8. (1, 6) - No triangles
9. (1, 2) - Triangle <1, 2, 8>
10. (1, 5) - No triangles
11. (1, 0) - No triangles
12. (3, 7) - No triangles
13. (3, 1) - Triangle <1, 3, 9>
14. (3, 0) - No triangles
15. (3, 2) - No triangles
16. (3, 8) - Triangle <1, 3, 9>
17. (6, 4) - No triangles
18. (6, 1) - No triangles
19. (6, 9) - No triangles
20. (6, 5) - No triangles
21. (6, 2) - Triangle <1, 2, 8>
22. (9, 7) - No triangles
23. (9, 6) - No triangles
24. (9, 2) - Triangle <1, 2, 8>
25. (9, 0) - No triangles
26. (8, 4) - No triangles
27. (8, 7) - No triangles
28. (8, 3) - Triangle <1, 3, 9>
29. (8, 2) - Triangle <1, 2, 8>
30. (5, 4) - No triangles
31. (5, 1) - No triangles
32. (5, 6) - No triangles
33. (2, 1) - Triangle <1, 2, 8>
34. (2, 3) - No triangles
35. (2, 6) - Triangle <1, 2, 8>
36. (2, 9) - Triangle <1, 2, 8>
37. (2, 8) - No triangles
38. (0, 1) - No triangles
39. (0, 3) - No triangles
40. (0, 9) - No triangles

As a result, we have found the following unique triangles:
<1, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 8>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
