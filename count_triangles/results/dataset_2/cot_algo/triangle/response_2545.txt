Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph can be represented as follows: 
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the nodes are: 
Vertex 0 -> 5 connections
Vertex 1 -> 3 connections
Vertex 2 -> 5 connections
Vertex 3 -> 3 connections
Vertex 4 -> 3 connections
Vertex 5 -> 6 connections
Vertex 6 -> 5 connections
Vertex 7 -> 4 connections
Vertex 8 -> 3 connections
Vertex 9 -> 3 connections
Vertex 10 -> 5 connections
Vertex 11 -> 4 connections
Vertex 12 -> 3 connections
Vertex 13 -> 4 connections
Vertex 14 -> 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Counting the triangles in the graph, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 13, 1>
<0, 13, 10>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 13, 11>
<2, 5, 14>
<2, 9, 6>
<2, 10, 14>
<3, 7, 11>
<3, 9, 6>
<4, 11, 13>
<4, 10, 2>
<5, 7, 0>
<5, 14, 6>
<6, 9, 2>
<6, 12, 3>
<6, 14, 2>
<7, 11, 3>
<8, 11, 13>
<10, 13, 1>
<10, 14, 2>
<11, 12, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [23].
