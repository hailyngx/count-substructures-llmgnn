Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 29) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 19) (9, 22) (9, 16) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 21) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 16) (21, 2) (20, 25) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 17) (25, 10) (25, 11) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 15) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 13) (4, 8) (4, 29) (4, 2) (12, 24) (0, 2) (2, 21) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (19, 9) (19, 20) (19, 28) (19, 14) (26, 23) (26, 13) (26, 28) (13, 23) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 27) (5, 13) (5, 16) (16, 9) (16, 21) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 17) (28, 19) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 3) (28, 18) (29, 6) (29, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 10) (15, 8) (18, 28) (27, 13) (27, 22) (27, 24) (27, 14) (10, 25) (10, 1) (3, 28) (3, 17) (17, 25) (17, 23) (17, 16) (17, 3) (22, 9) (22, 27) (24, 12) (24, 27) (14, 2) (14, 19) (14, 27) (11, 6) (11, 25) (11, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. Let's label the vertices according to their degree in increasing order.

The vertices and their degrees are as follows:
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 10: 3 connections
Vertex 12: 1 connection
Vertex 15: 1 connection
Vertex 18: 1 connection
Vertex 20: 2 connections
Vertex 24: 2 connections
Vertex 29: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 13: 4 connections
Vertex 22: 2 connections
Vertex 26: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 14: 3 connections
Vertex 21: 3 connections
Vertex 25: 4 connections
Vertex 27: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 11: 3 connections
Vertex 16: 5 connections
Vertex 19: 4 connections
Vertex 23: 4 connections
Vertex 17: 4 connections
Vertex 28: 5 connections

Following the degree-based ordering method, we will consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Now, let's count the triangles using the given edges and the information obtained above. 

The total number of triangles is [21].
The unique triangles found are:
<2, 4, 11>
<2, 4, 21>
<2, 4, 25>
<2, 11, 25>
<4, 11, 25>
<6, 9, 19>
<6, 9, 29>
<6, 11, 25>
<6, 19, 28>
<9, 19, 28>
<11, 25, 6>
<13, 16, 28>
<13, 16, 17>
<13, 28, 16>
<16, 17, 28>
<16, 28, 17>
<17, 28, 16>
<19, 28, 16>
