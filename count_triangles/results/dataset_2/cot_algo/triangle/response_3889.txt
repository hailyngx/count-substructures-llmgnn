Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method as described. 

The vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most are:
Node 10 (degree 2)
Node 4 (degree 2)
Node 8 (degree 2)
Node 5 (degree 3)
Node 0 (degree 3)
Node 9 (degree 4)
Node 12 (degree 4)
Node 14 (degree 5)
Node 6 (degree 5)
Node 1 (degree 5)
Node 11 (degree 5)
Node 2 (degree 5)
Node 3 (degree 5)
Node 7 (degree 8)
Node 13 (degree 8)

Now, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles formed:

1. For the edge (4, 7):
    - Node 4 has connections with nodes 1 and 7.
    - Node 7 has connections with nodes 12, 0, 10, 13, 1, 13, and 6.
    - Shared connections between nodes 4 and 7: Node 1 (Forming triangle 1-4-7).
  
2. For the edge (4, 1):
    - Node 4 has connections with nodes 1 and 7.
    - Node 1 has connections with nodes 7, 10, and 13.
    - Shared connections between nodes 4 and 1: Node 7 (Forming another triangle 1-4-7).

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 4, 7>.
