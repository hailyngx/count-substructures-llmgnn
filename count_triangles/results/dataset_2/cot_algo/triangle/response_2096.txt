Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 6) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 5) (2, 16) (2, 18) (2, 9) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 15) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 10) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 0) (1, 6) (1, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 17) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 7) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 8) (12, 13) (12, 1) (14, 3) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 9) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 19) (17, 15) (17, 9) (17, 3) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 8) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degrees is as follows: 

Nodes:
Node 11: degree 3
Node 16: degree 3
Node 10: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 18: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 2
Node 13: degree 3
Node 1: degree 2
Node 15: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3
Node 12: degree 2
Node 14: degree 1
Node 7: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 17: degree 3
Node 19: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4

Now, we will count the triangles by checking shared connections between vertices of each edge starting from the edge with the lower degree vertex.

Total number of triangles: [40]

Unique triangles:
