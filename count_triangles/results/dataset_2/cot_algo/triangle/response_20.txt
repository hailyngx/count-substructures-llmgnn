Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (26, 20) (26, 25) (18, 24) (18, 28) (18, 13) (22, 17) (22, 29) (22, 7) (22, 21) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 15) (0, 11) (0, 5) (20, 26) (20, 12) (20, 6) (6, 20) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 16) (28, 18) (28, 6) (28, 21) (21, 22) (21, 6) (21, 28) (21, 16) (21, 14) (14, 21) (13, 18) (13, 10) (1, 25) (1, 19) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 17) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 5) (4, 9) (4, 27) (4, 23) (27, 4) (27, 2) (27, 3) (27, 5) (29, 22) (29, 23) (29, 3) (16, 6) (16, 21) (16, 3) (7, 22) (7, 23) (7, 17) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 27) (5, 12) (2, 27) (24, 18) (24, 12) (19, 1) (19, 23) (25, 26) (25, 1) (12, 9) (12, 20) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 17) (3, 10) (3, 27) (3, 29) (3, 16) (23, 4) (23, 29) (23, 7) (23, 19) (17, 22) (17, 15) (17, 7) (17, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly. The sorted list of vertices and their degrees is as follows:

(1: 2), (2: 1), (3: 4), (4: 3), (5: 4), (6: 4), (7: 3), (8: 4), (9: 3), (10: 3), (11: 3), (12: 5), (13: 3), (14: 1), (15: 3), (16: 3), (17: 4), (18: 4), (19: 2), (20: 3), (21: 4), (22: 4), (23: 4), (24: 2), (25: 2), (26: 2), (27: 4), (28: 4), (29: 3), (30: 0)

Now, checking the edges while considering the condition where only edges with the vertex having the lower label having fewer connections are counted, we get the following triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 15]
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 12>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 12>
<1, 19, 23>
<3, 16, 21>
<3, 16, 6>
<3, 16, 21>
<3, 16, 29>
<3, 21, 22>
<3, 21, 16>
<3, 23, 19>
<6, 16, 21>
<10, 11, 15>
<17, 21, 22>
