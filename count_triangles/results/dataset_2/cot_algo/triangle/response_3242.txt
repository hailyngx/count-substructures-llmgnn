Following the given edges and nodes, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
- 0: (4, 7), (4, 19), (4, 17), (4, 2), (0, 7), (0, 21), (0, 29), (21, 28), (21, 27), (21, 23)
- 1: (7, 0), (10, 11), (10, 17), (10, 19), (1, 29), (1, 6), (1, 25), (29, 15)
- 2: (11, 10), (11, 9), (11, 18), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 19), (2, 20), (2, 24)
- 3: (10, 17), (26, 20), (26, 3), (3, 18)
- 4: (10, 19), (17, 4), (17, 7), (17, 10), (17, 9)
- 5: (2, 8), (5, 18), (5, 27), (5, 8)
- 6: (13, 28), (29, 1), (6, 1)
- 7: (21, 28), (22, 28), (22, 9), (22, 27)
- 8: (8, 2), (8, 5)
- 9: (9, 11), (9, 17), (9, 22)
- 10: (22, 28), (22, 27), (22, 25)
- 11: (24, 2), (24, 27), (24, 23)
- 12: (26, 3), (26, 12)
- 13: (5, 8), (13, 28), (13, 14)
- 14: (0, 21), (14, 13), (14, 23), (19, 4), (19, 10)
- 15: (14, 19), (15, 29), (15, 16)
- 16: (1, 29), (18, 11), (18, 3), (18, 16)
- 17: (21, 27), (27, 21), (27, 28), (27, 22), (27, 24), (27, 5)
- 18: (3, 26), (18, 5), (18, 3), (18, 16)
- 19: (29, 0), (19, 4), (19, 10), (19, 2), (19, 14)
- 20: (26, 20), (20, 2)
- 21: (0, 7)
- 22: (27, 21), (25, 22)
- 23: (23, 21)
- 24: (24, 2), (24, 27), (23, 24)
- 25: (1, 29), (25, 22)
- 26: (12, 26)
- 27: (28, 21), (27, 22), (27, 24)
- 28: (13, 28), (28, 27)
- 29: (15, 29)

Now, let's sort the vertices by their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes by degree: 6, 12, 16, 23, 25, 4, 10, 12, 15, 20, 26, 24, 27, 29, 2, 5, 8, 9, 11, 13, 17, 18, 21, 22, 28, 0, 1, 3, 7, 14

Next, we enumerate the vertices based on their degrees:
Nodes enumeration (degree): 0(6), 1(12), 2(16), 3(23), 4(25), 5(4), 6(10), 7(12), 8(15), 9(20), 10(26), 11(24), 12(27), 13(29), 14(2), 15(5), 16(8), 17(9), 18(11), 19(13), 20(17), 21(18), 22(21), 23(22), 24(28), 25(0), 26(1), 27(3), 28(7), 29(14)

Now we can start counting the triangles based on the process mentioned earlier. Let's proceed with the triangle counting process:

Triangles: 
[<5, 8, 27>, <5, 13, 28>, <9, 17, 22>, <19, 2, 24>, <19, 14, 23>, <21, 22, 27>]

Total number of triangles: [6]
