Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (6, 8, 7, 1)
- 1: (6, 4, 8, 0, 5)
- 2: (5, 6, 4, 8, 7)
- 3: (5, 4)
- 4: (6, 8, 1, 3, 2)
- 5: (9, 2, 1, 3)
- 6: (1, 2, 4, 0)
- 7: (9, 2, 0)
- 8: (9, 4, 2, 0, 1)
- 9: (5, 8, 7)

Next, we sort the nodes based on their degree in ascending order: 

Nodes by degree:
- 3: degree 2
- 7: degree 2
- 0: degree 4
- 9: degree 3
- 5: degree 4
- 6: degree 4
- 8: degree 5
- 1: degree 5
- 4: degree 5
- 2: degree 5

Now, we will count the triangles:

Triangles: 
[15]
  
The unique triangles found are:
<4, 8, 1>, <1, 8, 6>, <1, 8, 4>, <4, 8, 2>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 7, 2>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 2>, <5, 9, 2>
