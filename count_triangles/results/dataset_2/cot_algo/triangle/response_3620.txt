Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 4) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 9) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (14, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 14) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 14), (1, 4), (1, 8), (3, 11), (3, 13), (3, 9), (3, 2), (3, 5), (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 7), (6, 0), (8, 10), (8, 7), (13, 12), (11, 0), (4, 12), (0, 10), (14, 9)
