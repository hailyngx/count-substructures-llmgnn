Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 3) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 14) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 12) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 7) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 4) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 3) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 2) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 5) (16, 17) (16, 7) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 18) (18, 19) (18, 12) (18, 14) (11, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (14, 6) (14, 15) (14, 18) (4, 17) (4, 0) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 4) (5, 7) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- 0: (1, 15), (4, 12), (2, 12), (15, 1), (12, 4), (12, 2), (18, 12), (0, 4), (15, 0)
- 1: (15, 1), (7, 1), (0, 1)
- 2: (19, 12), (12, 2)
- 3: (9, 8), (8, 3), (9, 3)
- 4: (17, 0), (0, 12)
- 5: (7, 5)
- 6: (9, 17), (14, 6), (10, 6), (17, 6)
- 7: (1, 7), (13, 7), (16, 7), (7, 5)
- 8: (17, 8), (3, 8), (12, 8)
- 9: (6, 9), (9, 3)
- 10: (6, 10), (15, 10), (12, 10)
- 11: (13, 11)
- 12: (0, 12), (12, 2), (10, 12), (8, 12), (14, 12), (18, 12)
- 13: (17, 13), (7, 13), (11, 13), (19, 13)
- 14: (15, 14), (18, 14), (6, 14)
- 15: (1, 15), (0, 15), (14, 15), (10, 15)
- 16: (17, 16), (7, 16)
- 17: (6, 17), (13, 17), (16, 17), (4, 17), (8, 17)
- 18: (12, 18), (14, 18), (19, 18), (18, 12)
- 19: (13, 19), (2, 19), (18, 19)

Next, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles. Let's relabel the nodes according to their degrees.
