Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 3) 

Response:
The graph based on the given edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
0: (5), (6), (4), (8), (2)
1: (5), (9), (6)
2: (5), (9), (0), (7)
3: (5), (6), (4), (7)
4: (9), (0), (3)
5: (2), (8), (1), (0), (3)
6: (1), (7), (3), (8), (0)
7: (9), (6), (2), (3)
8: (5), (6), (0)
9: (4), (2), (1), (7)

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes in increasing order of degrees: 1, 4, 8, 9, 2, 7, 3, 6, 0, 5

Triangles counted using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
[15]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 9, 2>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 7, 3>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
