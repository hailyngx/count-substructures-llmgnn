Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 13) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 11) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 4) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 15 nodes and the given 60 edges:

Vertices:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) 
(3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) 
(5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) 
(6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) 
(13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 0) 
(7, 14) (7, 9) 
(8, 9) (8, 11) 
(9, 7) (9, 4) 
(10, 14) (10, 4) 
(11, 4) 
(14, 4) 

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:

Vertices by their degrees (number of connections):
0(1), 1(5), 2(4), 3(3), 4(6), 5(4), 6(5), 7(3), 8(3), 9(4), 10(2), 11(3), 12(3), 13(6), 14(4)

By comparing the degrees, we proceed for the following edges {(1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 12), (1, 8), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 12), (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 11), (6, 7), (6, 10), (6, 2), (6, 4), (13, 12), (13, 4), (13, 9), (13, 14), (13, 0), (7, 14), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 11), (9, 7), (9, 4), (10, 14), (10, 4), (11, 4), (14, 4)}:

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 12, 3>
<1, 5, 3>
<11, 5, 1>
<13, 4, 6>
<13, 14, 7>
