Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 2), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 2), (7, 5), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8)

Next, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph.

After sorting the nodes by their degree (number of edges connected to each node) from least to most, the new labeling is as follows:
Nodes: 1, 7, 5, 4, 0, 3, 7, 2, 9, 8

Now, let's count the triangles by inspecting the shared connections between vertices:

Total number of triangles: [12]
Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
