Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 19) (26, 28) (26, 20) (4, 7) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 21) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 15) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 27) (22, 10) (22, 0) (22, 12) (23, 2) (23, 21) (23, 27) (12, 7) (12, 22) (12, 29) (12, 8) (24, 14) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 10) (21, 4) (21, 23) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 15) (19, 9) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 13) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 25) (16, 2) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 20) (17, 4) (17, 19) (17, 20) (17, 0) (20, 26) (20, 11) (20, 17) (20, 14) (0, 22) (0, 17) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 5) (29, 12) (29, 16) (27, 3) (27, 23) (27, 2) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 18) (25, 16) (25, 14) (10, 22) (10, 28) (10, 2) (18, 5) (18, 13) (18, 8) (2, 23) (2, 16) (2, 27) (2, 10) (14, 24) (14, 20) (14, 25) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 11) (8, 18) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, we will construct a graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges as described. 

After constructing the graph, we will sort the nodes based on their degree for Degree-Based Ordering. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
