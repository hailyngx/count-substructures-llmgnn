Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 13) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 11) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 2) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 16) (7, 16) (7, 11) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 10) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 11) (18, 14) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 8) (11, 17) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 5) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 10) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 13) (4, 9) (4, 19) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 6) (12, 13) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 18) (13, 2) (13, 12) (5, 11) (8, 17) (8, 18) (10, 16) (10, 19) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices from least connected to most connected is as follows:
Nodes: 5, 8, 10, 12, 4, 7, 0, 6, 2, 9, 3, 18, 13, 19, 1, 15, 17, 14, 16, 11

Based on the given edges, the triangles found using the degree-based ordering method are: 
[<11, 1, 7>, <13, 0, 2>, <13, 12, 15>, <16, 1, 7>, <16, 7, 11>, <16, 19, 10>, <17, 14, 18>, <19, 10, 16>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
