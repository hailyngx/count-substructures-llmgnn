Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 12) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 27) (26, 7) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 24) (3, 11) (3, 27) (3, 22) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 21) (11, 15) (6, 21) (6, 27) (21, 11) (21, 6) (21, 27) (21, 12) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 19) (28, 1) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 23) (19, 22) (23, 19) (23, 7) (23, 10) (17, 9) (17, 25) (17, 27) (17, 15) (25, 26) (25, 17) (25, 15) (25, 18) (22, 3) (22, 19) (18, 25) (18, 20) (18, 12) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 24) (8, 29) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 10) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 0) (4, 29) (0, 4) (0, 2) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 25) (15, 14) (27, 26) (27, 3) (27, 6) (27, 21) (27, 17) (10, 23) (10, 14) (10, 1) (1, 28) (1, 14) (1, 10) (7, 26) (7, 23) (24, 13) (24, 5) (20, 18) (2, 16) (2, 0) (29, 8) (29, 4) (12, 9) (12, 21) (12, 18) 

Response:
First, let's organize the given edges into a more readable format by listing the connections for each node:

Node 0: 4
Node 1: 10, 14, 28
Node 2: 0, 16
Node 3: 11, 22, 27
Node 4: 0, 5, 9, 14, 29
Node 5: 4, 11, 24
Node 6: 21, 27
Node 7: 23, 26
Node 8: 29
Node 9: 4, 12, 17
Node 10: 1, 14, 23
Node 11: 3, 5, 15, 19, 21
Node 12: 9, 18, 21
Node 13: 16, 24, 26
Node 14: 1, 10, 15, 4
Node 15: 11, 14, 17, 25
Node 16: 2, 13, 19
Node 17: 15, 25, 27, 9
Node 18: 12, 18, 25
Node 19: 11, 16, 19, 22, 23
Node 20: 18
Node 21: 11, 12, 27, 6
Node 22: 19, 3
Node 23: 10, 19, 7
Node 24: 13, 5
Node 25: 15, 17, 18, 26
Node 26: 13, 17, 25, 27, 7
Node 27: 3, 6, 17, 21, 26
Node 28: 1
Node 29: 4, 8

Next, let's reorder the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:

Nodes with degree 1: 0, 2, 8, 28
Nodes with degree 2: 24, 7
Nodes with degree 3: 20
Nodes with degree 4: 10, 12, 18, 22, 23
Nodes with degree 5: 13, 16, 20, 24
Nodes with degree 6: 5, 6, 8
Nodes with degree 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 29

Now, we apply the Degree-Based Ordering method and count the triangles:

[30]

<3, 11, 21>
<3, 11, 27>
<3, 21, 27>
<4, 5, 11>
<4, 5, 14>
<4, 9, 17>
<4, 14, 15>
<4, 14, 17>
<5, 11, 21>
<9, 12, 21>
<11, 13, 16>
<11, 15, 17>
<11, 16, 19>
<11, 16, 22>
<11, 19, 23>
<13, 16, 24>
<15, 17, 25>
<17, 21, 27>
