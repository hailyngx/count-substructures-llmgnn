Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 0) (11, 2) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 12) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 10) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

1. Node 11: Degree 1
2. Node 12: Degree 2
3. Node 5: Degree 3
4. Node 9: Degree 4
5. Node 0: Degree 5
6. Node 6: Degree 5
7. Node 14: Degree 5
8. Node 13: Degree 5
9. Node 2: Degree 5
10. Node 3: Degree 5
11. Node 4: Degree 6
12. Node 7: Degree 6
13. Node 8: Degree 6
14. Node 1: Degree 6
15. Node 10: Degree 3

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

By following this rule, the triangles formed by the shared connections of the edges are:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 1, 9>
4. <0, 6, 10>
5. <0, 6, 4>
6. <2, 11, 14>
7. <4, 7, 8>
8. <3, 4, 6>
9. <3, 4, 8>
10. <3, 4, 7>
11. <5, 7, 14>
12. <5, 1, 3>
13. <9, 1, 7>
14. <9, 1, 8>
15. <9, 8, 4>
16. <13, 2, 14>
17. <13, 4, 8>
18. <13, 0, 1>
19. <14, 7, 8>
20. <14, 10, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
