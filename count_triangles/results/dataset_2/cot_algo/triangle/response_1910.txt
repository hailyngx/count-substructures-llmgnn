Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 0), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 3), (8, 5), 
(8, 7), (8, 3), (5, 6), (5, 4), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 3), (2, 9), (2, 3), (0, 6), (0, 9), 
(0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 3), (7, 6), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 1), (1, 9), 
(1, 5), (1, 7), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 5), (3, 2), (3, 0), (3, 7)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):

Nodes in decreasing order of degree:
2 (degree 2)
4 (degree 3)
1 (degree 3)
8 (degree 3)
6 (degree 3)
9 (degree 4)
5 (degree 5)
7 (degree 6)
0 (degree 6)
3 (degree 7)

Now, we will count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 17]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 3>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 7, 6>
