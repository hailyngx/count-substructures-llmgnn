Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 17) (6, 1) (9, 16) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 10) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 18) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 14) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 7) (18, 15) (18, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 7) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 19) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 19) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 7) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (4, 11) (4, 12) (14, 1) (14, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices: 
0 - 3 connections
1 - 4 connections
3 - 3 connections
4 - 2 connections
5 - 4 connections
6 - 2 connections
7 - 4 connections
8 - 5 connections
9 - 3 connections
10 - 5 connections
11 - 3 connections
12 - 3 connections
13 - 4 connections
14 - 2 connections
15 - 4 connections
16 - 4 connections
17 - 3 connections
18 - 2 connections
19 - 3 connections

Now, we will proceed with each edge, ensuring that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

After checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we find that the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 8, 10>
<1, 8, 13>
<1, 12, 4>
<1, 14, 10>
<4, 12, 9>
<8, 10, 15>
<8, 10, 17>
<10, 15, 17>
