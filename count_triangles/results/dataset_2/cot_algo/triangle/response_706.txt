Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 6) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 14) (2, 3) (2, 12) (8, 7) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 12) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 13) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 10), (4, 1), 
(7, 5), (7, 1), (7, 8),
(1, 3), (1, 9), (1, 0), (1, 8),
(3, 0), (3, 13), (3, 2),
(10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 13), (10, 9), (10, 14),
(11, 14), (11, 13), (11, 6),
(5, 13), (5, 12), (5, 0), (5, 14),
(6, 14),
(2, 12),
(13, 14), (13, 5),
(0, 5), (0, 3),
(9, 12),(9, 10),
(12, 2)

Now, we sort the nodes based on their degree:
Node 2 has degree 1
Nodes 6, 8, 0 have degree 2
Nodes 9, 12, 6, 8, 11, 2 have degree 3
Nodes 5, 7, 3, 13, 14 have degree 4
Nodes 1, 10, 4 have degree 5

Next, we check the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 3, 12>
<5, 6, 14>
<5, 9, 12>
<5, 10, 13>
<6, 11, 14>
<9, 10, 12>
<10, 11, 13>

There are a total of 10 triangles in the graph:
