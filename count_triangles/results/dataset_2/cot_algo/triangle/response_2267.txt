Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 26) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 2) (2, 21) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 16) (29, 3) (29, 2) (29, 0) (29, 22) (0, 29) (0, 17) (0, 13) (20, 9) (20, 23) (20, 11) (12, 7) (12, 25) (12, 1) (12, 9) (28, 21) (28, 1) (28, 22) (28, 14) (28, 24) (13, 0) (13, 26) (13, 18) (26, 15) (26, 13) (26, 5) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 20) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 25) (10, 18) (10, 23) (10, 16) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 27) (19, 2) (5, 26) (22, 29) (22, 28) (22, 16) (25, 12) (25, 9) (14, 3) (14, 28) (24, 28) (24, 8) (27, 18) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 10) (16, 22) (11, 4) (11, 20) (11, 17) (17, 0) (17, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 28) (1, 23) (6, 8) (6, 23) (23, 20) (23, 10) (23, 1) (23, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted list of vertices with the corresponding number of connections (degree) is as follows:

Vertex 26 - degree 3
Vertex 27 - degree 1
Vertex 25 - degree 2
Vertex 24 - degree 2
Vertex 22 - degree 3
Vertex 23 - degree 3
Vertex 20 - degree 3
Vertex 21 - degree 3
Vertex 19 - degree 1
Vertex 18 - degree 5
Vertex 17 - degree 2
Vertex 16 - degree 4
Vertex 15 - degree 2
Vertex 14 - degree 2
Vertex 13 - degree 3
Vertex 12 - degree 4
Vertex 11 - degree 3
Vertex 10 - degree 3
Vertex 9 - degree 5
Vertex 8 - degree 3
Vertex 7 - degree 3
Vertex 6 - degree 2
Vertex 5 - degree 1
Vertex 4 - degree 2
Vertex 3 - degree 6
Vertex 2 - degree 4
Vertex 1 - degree 4
Vertex 0 - degree 3
Vertex 29 - degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through the edges and count the number of triangles.
