Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 6) (4, 1) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 3) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges first:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 
- 0: (2, 12, 10, 3)
- 1: (4, 11, 14, 2)
- 2: (5, 8, 1, 10, 0)
- 3: (6, 13, 0, 10, 7)
- 4: (6, 1)
- 5: (13, 2, 7, 14)
- 6: (9, 7, 3, 4, 13, 0)
- 7: (5, 9, 6, 13, 3)
- 8: (2, 11, 12)
- 9: (6, 11, 7)
- 10: (2, 0, 3)
- 11: (9, 8, 14, 1)
- 12: (8, 14, 0)
- 13: (5, 6, 3, 14, 7)
- 14: (5, 13, 12, 11, 1)

Next, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes sorted by degree (starting from the one with the fewest connections): 
1. 4 (Degree: 2)
2. 1 (Degree: 4)
3. 8 (Degree: 3)
4. 9 (Degree: 3)
5. 10 (Degree: 3)
6. 12 (Degree: 3)
7. 0 (Degree: 5)
8. 11 (Degree: 4)
9. 3 (Degree: 5)
10. 7 (Degree: 5)
11. 13 (Degree: 5)
12. 2 (Degree: 5)
13. 14 (Degree: 5)
14. 6 (Degree: 6)
15. 5 (Degree: 4)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [60] 

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 2, 10>
<0, 2, 12>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 10>
<0, 10, 3>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 14>
<1, 11, 14>
<1, 14, 11>
<2, 5, 13>
<2, 5, 14>
<2, 8, 11>
<2, 8, 12>
<3, 7, 13>
<6, 7, 13>
