Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 5) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 8) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 4) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 1) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 12) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 13) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 9) (6, 8) (6, 13) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 16) (5, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (14, 2) (4, 17) (4, 19) (9, 16) (9, 2) (9, 1) (12, 11) (12, 15) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 0) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
1: [11,16,0,8,12,1,18,9,5]
2: [16,9,3,5,18,19,1,11]
3: [10,15,8,17]
4: [17,19]
5: [2,16,7]
6: [7,8,13]
7: [3,19,5,7]
8: [6,10,17,11,0,8]
9: [2,16,1]
10:[15,17,8]
11:[11,16,1,0,8,12]
12:[15,11]
13:[15,19,6]
14:[2]
15:[10,19,13,12]
16:[11,18,9,5,16]
17:[10,15,4,8]
18:[16,19,1]
19:[18,15,4,7,13]

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
There are [14] triangles in total.

The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 11, 8>
<1, 11, 0>
<1, 11, 18>
<1, 11, 12>
<1, 11, 16>
<0, 11, 8>
<0, 11, 16>
<8, 11, 12>
<8, 11, 16>
<8, 11, 1>
<8, 10, 17>
<8, 10, 15>
<8, 10, 11>
<8, 10, 16>
