Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 1) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 6) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 4) (18, 11) (18, 8) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 19) (13, 17) (13, 7) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 15) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 11) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 10) (3, 10) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 12) (19, 2) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 12) (15, 0) (15, 16) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 0) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 10) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 12) (8, 18) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph and sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices in ascending order of degree: 
Vertex 8: Degree 1
Vertex 3: Degree 1
Vertex 18: Degree 2
Vertex 7: Degree 3
Vertex 15: Degree 3
Vertex 13: Degree 3
Vertex 9: Degree 3
Vertex 5: Degree 4
Vertex 17: Degree 4
Vertex 1: Degree 4
Vertex 16: Degree 4
Vertex 6: Degree 4
Vertex 11: Degree 4
Vertex 19: Degree 4
Vertex 12: Degree 4
Vertex 0: Degree 5
Vertex 2: Degree 5
Vertex 14: Degree 5
Vertex 4: Degree 6
Vertex 10: Degree 6

Next, we will count the triangles in the graph by examining the edges and shared connections based on the sorted vertices. Only proceed with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

Triangles:
<7, 10, 16>
<1, 9, 4>
<0, 14, 4>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 6, 11>
<0, 13, 17>
<4, 5, 12>
<0, 15, 16>
<0, 19, 10>
<6, 11, 12>
<10, 12, 19>
<2, 6, 17>
<7, 10, 19>

Total number of triangles: [13]
