Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

After sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections), the new order is: {9, 5, 6, 2, 8, 0, 3, 1, 7, 4}

Now, counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (9, 8) -> Node 9 has 2 neighbors (8, 0) and Node 8 has 4 neighbors (7, 9, 1, 0), so we proceed. Shared neighbor: 8
2. Edge (9, 0) -> Node 9 has 2 neighbors (8, 0) and Node 0 has 5 neighbors (7, 3, 8, 5, 9), so we proceed. Shared neighbor: 0

[Total number of triangles: [2]]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 8, 9>
