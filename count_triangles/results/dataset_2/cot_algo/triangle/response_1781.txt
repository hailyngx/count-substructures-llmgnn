Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 29) (1, 28) (1, 8) (21, 20) (21, 23) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 17) (3, 4) (3, 24) (3, 16) (3, 2) (14, 25) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 11) (2, 3) (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 15) (29, 1) (29, 2) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 26) (27, 25) (27, 22) (27, 19) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 23) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 26) (8, 18) (23, 21) (23, 9) (24, 3) (24, 25) (22, 2) (22, 27) (22, 26) (26, 12) (26, 8) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 15) (5, 0) (5, 28) (5, 10) (13, 10) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 25) (20, 21) (10, 26) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 15) (15, 2) (15, 12) (15, 26) (15, 10) (16, 3) (16, 28) (16, 18) (28, 1) (28, 5) (28, 16) (11, 17) (11, 12) (11, 25) (25, 14) (25, 27) (25, 24) (25, 0) (25, 11) (19, 2) (19, 27) (18, 8) (18, 16) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most and then checking for shared connections between pairs of vertices. 

After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 1 - Degree 3
Node 2 - Degree 5
Node 3 - Degree 4
Node 4 - Degree 4
Node 5 - Degree 3
Node 6 - Degree 3
Node 7 - Degree 4
Node 8 - Degree 4
Node 9 - Degree 2
Node 10 - Degree 4
Node 11 - Degree 4
Node 12 - Degree 4
Node 13 - Degree 1
Node 14 - Degree 1
Node 15 - Degree 4
Node 16 - Degree 3
Node 17 - Degree 3
Node 18 - Degree 2
Node 19 - Degree 2
Node 20 - Degree 1
Node 21 - Degree 2
Node 22 - Degree 3
Node 23 - Degree 2
Node 24 - Degree 2
Node 26 - Degree 5
Node 25 - Degree 5
Node 27 - Degree 3
Node 28 - Degree 3
Node 29 - Degree 3

Next, we will list the triangles based on the shared connections between pairs of vertices:
