Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (17, 12) (17, 5) (17, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (5, 17) (5, 3) (5, 15) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 16) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 7) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 7) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 11) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 19) (2, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (16, 6) (16, 18) (19, 12) (19, 0) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 10) (7, 15) (13, 1) (13, 9) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 11) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 15) (11, 12) (11, 9) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degree, the vertices are relabeled as follows:  

Nodes:
- Node 0: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 3
- Node 2: Degree 1
- Node 3: Degree 3
- Node 4: Degree 1
- Node 5: Degree 4
- Node 6: Degree 3
- Node 7: Degree 5
- Node 8: Degree 6
- Node 9: Degree 4
- Node 10: Degree 4
- Node 11: Degree 5
- Node 12: Degree 3
- Node 13: Degree 2
- Node 14: Degree 3
- Node 15: Degree 6
- Node 16: Degree 3
- Node 17: Degree 3
- Node 18: Degree 4
- Node 19: Degree 3
