Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 18) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 2) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 12) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 18) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 12) (15, 6) (15, 17) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 17) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 14) (14, 11) (14, 16) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 17) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 19) (5, 8) (5, 4) (17, 15) (17, 0) (17, 19) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices from least connected to most connected is as follows:
Nodes: (2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 0, 1, 4, 16, 19, 6, 9, 8, 11, 13)

There are 19 distinct triangles in the given graph. The triangles are:
<2, 7, 19>
<2, 7, 16>
<2, 7, 13>
<2, 7, 3>
<2, 16, 19>
<2, 16, 13>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 0, 17>
<4, 0, 11>
<4, 5, 8>
<7, 18, 12>
<10, 11, 12>
<11, 0, 17>
<11, 14, 16>
<11, 14, 19>
<11, 12, 18>
<13, 6, 15>
<15, 17, 19>
<17, 0, 19>

The total number of triangles is [19].
