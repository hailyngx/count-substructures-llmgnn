Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort vertices based on their degree in increasing order:
   Nodes by their degrees: (7: 2), (2: 3), (5: 4), (8: 4), (3: 5), (1: 5), (0: 5), (9: 5), (4: 6), (6: 6)

2. Relabel the vertices according to their sorted order:
   New labels: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

3. Based on the new labels, the edges are:
   (0, 6), (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 7), (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 3), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 3), (2, 4), 
   (3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 9), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 1), (4, 0), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 5), (5, 0),
   (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 5), 
   (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 3)

Using this ordering, we can find the total number of triangles and list them:

Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 8>
