Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 20) (16, 2) (16, 10) (13, 22) (13, 21) (13, 2) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 5) (22, 25) (4, 7) (4, 28) (4, 21) (7, 4) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 24) (6, 17) (9, 22) (9, 14) (9, 3) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 5) (20, 11) (20, 0) (20, 29) (20, 26) (20, 23) (5, 22) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 15) (24, 6) (24, 26) (24, 27) (24, 19) (24, 15) (26, 20) (26, 24) (26, 18) (26, 23) (27, 24) (27, 25) (27, 28) (18, 26) (18, 1) (29, 20) (29, 8) (29, 3) (10, 16) (10, 21) (21, 13) (21, 4) (21, 10) (25, 22) (25, 27) (25, 12) (25, 14) (23, 20) (23, 26) (23, 14) (12, 25) (12, 28) (12, 14) (8, 29) (28, 4) (28, 27) (28, 12) (17, 6) (17, 0) (3, 9) (3, 29) (3, 14) (14, 9) (14, 25) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 3) (1, 7) (1, 18) (1, 2) (1, 19) (2, 16) (2, 13) (2, 1) (15, 5) (15, 24) (19, 24) (19, 1) 

Response:
The graph has been constructed based on the given information with 30 nodes and 90 edges.

Now, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most:
Node 11: 1 connection
Node 16: 2 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 21: 3 connections
Node 17: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 18: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 19: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 29: 5 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 15: 5 connections
Node 28: 5 connections
Node 20: 6 connections
Node 22: 6 connections
Node 5: 6 connections
Node 14: 6 connections
Node 23: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 25: 6 connections
Node 24: 7 connections
Node 13: 7 connections
Node 4: 7 connections
Node 26: 7 connections
Node 27: 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles found in the graph are:

<5, 22, 25>
<5, 6, 24>
<5, 0, 20>
<5, 0, 17>

<20, 29, 3>
<20, 29, 8>
<27, 25, 12>
<14, 9, 3>
<14, 9, 22>
<14, 9, 25>
<14, 9, 3>
<14, 9, 22>
<14, 9, 25>
<14, 25, 23>
<14, 25, 23>
<14, 25, 12>
<14, 25, 23>
<14, 25, 12>
<14, 23, 12>

<2, 16, 13>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [44].
