Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6

Now, let's order the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:  
Nodes in Degree-Based Ordering: 1, 2, 7, 9, 8, 4, 0, 6, 3, 5

Now, we will count the triangles by checking shared connections between nodes based on the order above:
- As per the given edges and the ordering constraint, we find the following triangles: 
  - <0, 3, 5>
  - <0, 3, 6>
  - <0, 5, 8>
  - <0, 6, 7>
  - <1, 3, 7>
  - <4, 5, 8>
  - <4, 6, 7>
  - <5, 6, 9>

Count of Triangles = [8]
