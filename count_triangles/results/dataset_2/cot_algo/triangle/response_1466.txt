Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (14, 19) (17, 11) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 1) (18, 13) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 9) (1, 0) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 11) (13, 18) (13, 12) (19, 3) (19, 14) (19, 5) (10, 15) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 7) (8, 9) (8, 16) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 16) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 12) (12, 3) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 16) (7, 11) (7, 9) (6, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the nodes by their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order.

Here is the list of nodes sorted by degrees (from least to most connections):
(20) Node 7 - Degree 2
(19) Node 6 - Degree 2
(18) Node 14 - Degree 2
(17) Node 0 - Degree 3
(16) Node 8 - Degree 3
(15) Node 10 - Degree 3
(14) Node 13 - Degree 3
(13) Node 5 - Degree 4
(12) Node 2 - Degree 4
(11) Node 19 - Degree 4
(10) Node 17 - Degree 4
(9) Node 15 - Degree 4
(8) Node 1 - Degree 4
(7) Node 18 - Degree 5
(6) Node 16 - Degree 5
(5) Node 9 - Degree 5
(4) Node 4 - Degree 5
(3) Node 11 - Degree 5
(2) Node 12 - Degree 6
(1) Node 3 - Degree 6

Now, starting from the edges with the lower labeled vertices, we will count the triangles:
1. Triangles containing Node 0: (0, 1, 9), (0, 16, 12)
2. Triangles containing Node 1: (1, 2, 18), (1, 4, 9), (1, 5, 11)
3. Triangles containing Node 9: (9, 4, 5), (9, 7, 11), (9, 8, 16)
4. Triangles containing Node 11: (11, 3, 5), (11, 7, 9)
5. Triangles containing Node 12: (12, 3, 18), (12, 4, 13), (12, 16, 0)
6. Triangles containing Node 3: (3, 7, 11), (3, 0, 1)
7. Triangles containing Node 2: (2, 1, 18)
8. Triangles containing Node 18: (18, 2, 13)
9. Triangles containing Node 4: (4, 12, 13), (4, 5, 19)
10. Triangles containing Node 5: (5, 11, 19)
11. Triangles containing Node 16: (16, 10, 0), (16, 8, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 9>, <0, 16, 12>, <1, 2, 18>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 11>, <9, 4, 5>, <9, 7, 11>, <9, 8, 16>, <11, 3, 5>, <11, 7, 9>, <16, 10, 0>.
