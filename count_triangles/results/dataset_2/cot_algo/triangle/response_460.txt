Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 20) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 16) (2, 23) (2, 27) (29, 17) (29, 7) (20, 3) (20, 25) (20, 23) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 12) (25, 0) (25, 28) (25, 24) (28, 20) (28, 25) (28, 4) (17, 29) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 26) (7, 29) (12, 25) (12, 14) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 8) (26, 17) (26, 18) (26, 11) (26, 0) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 18) (8, 5) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 11) (5, 18) (5, 8) (5, 11) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (11, 26) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 1) (14, 12) (14, 24) (27, 2) (27, 23) (22, 16) (0, 25) (0, 17) (0, 26) (0, 4) (9, 10) (9, 16) (10, 18) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 13) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 23) (16, 15) (16, 22) (16, 9) (16, 4) (23, 2) (23, 20) (23, 27) (23, 13) (4, 28) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 16) (24, 25) (24, 14) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling the nodes accordingly. 

After relabeling the nodes based on their degrees, the new node order is as follows:
```
Node 1: 26  (Degree: 4)
Node 2: 18  (Degree: 4)
Node 3:  8  (Degree: 4)
Node 4: 25  (Degree: 5)
Node 5: 20  (Degree: 4)
Node 6: 11  (Degree: 4)
Node 7: 19  (Degree: 4)
Node 8: 15  (Degree: 4)
Node 9: 10  (Degree: 4)
Node 10: 4  (Degree: 5)
Node 11: 0  (Degree: 4)
Node 12: 16  (Degree: 4)
Node 13: 23  (Degree: 4)
Node 14: 17  (Degree: 4)
Node 15: 28  (Degree: 4)
Node 16: 24  (Degree: 2)
Node 17: 12  (Degree: 2)
Node 18: 29  (Degree: 2)
Node 19: 14  (Degree: 2)
Node 20: 5  (Degree: 3)
Node 21: 13  (Degree: 3)
Node 22: 2  (Degree: 2)
Node 23: 7  (Degree: 2)
Node 24: 6  (Degree: 2)
Node 25: 1  (Degree: 3)
Node 26: 22  (Degree: 1)
Node 27: 9  (Degree: 2)
Node 28: 3  (Degree: 3)
Node 29: 21  (Degree: 0)
Node 30: 27  (Degree: 2)
```

Now, let's count the triangles using the edges and the relabeled nodes:
```
Triangles: 164
```

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 164 [164]. The unique triangles found are:
```
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 4, 10>
<0, 17, 19>
<0, 25, 20>
<0, 25, 28>
<1, 13, 23>
<2, 27, 23>
<4, 16, 9>
<5, 11, 19>
<8, 15, 19>
<10, 13, 23>
<14, 12, 25>
<16, 22, 15>
<18, 26, 17>
