Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 18) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 15) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 1) (2, 0) (2, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 18) (17, 1) (17, 11) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 4) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 15) (16, 12) (16, 9) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 2) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 15) (4, 19) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 11) (15, 6) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (18, 8) (18, 1) (18, 12) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections, from least to most connections. The vertices will be relabeled accordingly. 

Here is the list of vertices sorted by the number of connections:
```
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 16: 2 connections
Node 12: 3 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 19: 3 connections
Node 17: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 11: 4 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 14: 4 connections
Node 15: 4 connections
Node 13: 3 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
```

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the edges, considering only edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles found in the graph is:

\[ 10 \]

The unique triangles found are:

\[ <0, 1, 5>, <3, 5, 13>, <3, 5, 14>, <3, 10, 11>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 6>, <5, 9, 13>, <5, 9, 11>, <7, 8, 14>, <15, 12, 18> \]
