Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 19) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 2) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 15) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 2) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (8, 0) (8, 14) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 2) (18, 12) (18, 19) (17, 3) (14, 16) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 15) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 19) (10, 9) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 15) (15, 12) (15, 14) (15, 4) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) from least to most. 

The degrees of the nodes are as follows:  
Node 1: degree 2  
Node 0: degree 3  
Node 6: degree 1  
Node 10: degree 1  
Node 5: degree 4  
Node 8: degree 2  
Node 17: degree 1  
Node 11: degree 2  
Node 18: degree 3  
Node 13: degree 4  
Node 9: degree 5  
Node 3: degree 3  
Node 2: degree 6  
Node 19: degree 4  
Node 12: degree 4  
Node 7: degree 4  
Node 15: degree 3  
Node 4: degree 3  
Node 14: degree 4  

Next, we will proceed with the triangles counting method based on the degree-based ordering. 

By following the method stated in the goal, the total number of triangles in the graph is [23]. 

The unique triangles found are:  
<1, 0, 6>  
<1, 0, 7>  
<1, 0, 8>  
<10, 9, 19>  
<13, 2, 3>  
<13, 4, 15>  
<13, 5, 15>  
<13, 5, 4>  
<13, 5, 2>  
<13, 5, 7>  
<13, 5, 9>  
<14, 12, 18>  
<14, 12, 15>  
<14, 12, 7>  
<14, 15, 4>  
<14, 15, 12>  
<14, 15, 7>  
<14, 16, 11>  
<16, 11, 19>  
<16, 14, 12>  
<16, 14, 8>  
<18, 12, 15>  
<5, 7, 2>
