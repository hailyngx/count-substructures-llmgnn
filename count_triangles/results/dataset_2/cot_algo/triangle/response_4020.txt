Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 19) (25, 20) (25, 19) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 6) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 29) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (0, 16) (0, 21) (0, 11) (22, 5) (22, 29) (26, 20) (26, 27) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 13) (28, 11) (28, 24) (28, 15) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 14) (27, 26) (27, 18) (27, 16) (16, 0) (16, 27) (16, 24) (23, 2) (23, 21) (23, 12) (7, 3) (7, 29) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (29, 4) (29, 22) (29, 7) (29, 5) (24, 28) (24, 16) (24, 9) (24, 13) (24, 14) (6, 20) (6, 8) (6, 15) (2, 20) (2, 23) (2, 17) (2, 10) (21, 0) (21, 23) (12, 23) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 9) (13, 11) (13, 24) (13, 12) (9, 24) (9, 12) (5, 22) (5, 29) (18, 8) (18, 27) (18, 15) (15, 28) (15, 17) (15, 6) (15, 18) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 10) (10, 2) (10, 1) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 24) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the nodes by their degree, i.e., the number of connections each node has. Let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 30: 0 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 10: 2 connections
Node 22: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 26: 3 connections
Node 18: 3 connections
Node 21: 3 connections
Node 23: 3 connections
Node 27: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 12: 4 connections
Node 13: 4 connections
Node 19: 4 connections
Node 20: 4 connections
Node 29: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 24: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 15: 5 connections
Node 17: 5 connections
Node 11: 5 connections
Node 14: 5 connections
Node 16: 6 connections
Node 25: 6 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 28: 6 connections

Now, for each edge, we will only consider it if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. We will identify the triangles formed by shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

After analyzing all edges, we find that the total number of triangles in the graph is [39]. 

Unique triangles found are:
