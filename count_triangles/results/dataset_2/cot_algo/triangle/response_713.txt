Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 9, 1, 5, 3, 2, 8, 4, 0, 7, 6.

Therefore, we start by considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(1, 4) - shared connections: 5
(0, 1) - shared connections: 7
(0, 3) - shared connections: 6
(0, 6) - shared connections: 7
(1, 7) - shared connections: 4
(3, 6) - shared connections: None
(3, 8) - shared connections: None
(4, 6) - shared connections: None
(6, 7) - shared connections: None
(8, 3) - shared connections: None
(8, 5) - shared connections: None
(9, 5) - shared connections: None

The total number of triangles is [5].

Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 4, 5>.
