Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 5) (11, 2) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 12) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 6) (1, 10) (1, 9) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 13) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 9) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections. The sorted vertices are:
Node 1: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 6: degree 2
Node 12: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 11: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 10: degree 5
Node 0: degree 6
Node 3: degree 6
Node 5: degree 6
Node 13: degree 6
Node 2: degree 7

Starting from the vertices with the least connections, we can count the triangles:

1. (1, 10) -> no triangle
2. (4, 12) -> no triangle
3. (6, 12) -> no triangle
4. (9, 13) -> no triangle
5. (9, 1) -> no triangle
6. (14, 10) -> no triangle
7. (11, 12) -> triangle <11, 12, 4>
8. (11, 9) -> no triangle
9. (14, 0) -> no triangle
10. (14, 7) -> triangle <14, 7, 3>
11. (12, 5) -> triangle <12, 5, 0>
12. (12, 6) -> triangle <12, 6, 10>
13. (13, 6) -> triangle <13, 6, 10>
14. (13, 9) -> triangle <13, 9, 11>
15. (7, 2) -> no triangle

Total number of triangles: [5]
