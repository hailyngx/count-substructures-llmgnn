Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for unique triangles formed by the connected nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are pairwise connected.

From the provided adjacency list and edges, we can identify the triangles that exist in the graph:

1. Triangle <5, 9, 8>
2. Triangle <5, 1, 6>
3. Triangle <5, 1, 0>
4. Triangle <5, 0, 7>
5. Triangle <9, 7, 4>
6. Triangle <8, 5, 6>
7. Triangle <8, 5, 0>
8. Triangle <8, 5, 9>
9. Triangle <8, 5, 1>
10. Triangle <8, 5, 3>
11. Triangle <8, 5, 0>
12. Triangle <8, 9, 5>
13. Triangle <8, 9, 7>
14. Triangle <8, 9, 4>
15. Triangle <8, 9, 5>
16. Triangle <8, 9, 7>
17. Triangle <8, 4, 7>
18. Triangle <8, 4, 7>
19. Triangle <8, 4, 7>
20. Triangle <8, 4, 7>
21. Triangle <8, 4, 7>
22. Triangle <8, 4, 7>
23. Triangle <6, 5, 1>
24. Triangle <6, 5, 0>
25. Triangle <6, 5, 7>
26. Triangle <6, 7, 3>
27. Triangle <6, 7, 0>
28. Triangle <6, 1, 3>
29. Triangle <6, 1, 0>
30. Triangle <6, 3, 0>
31. Triangle <2, 8, 5>
32. Triangle <2, 8, 9>
33. Triangle <2, 8, 4>
34. Triangle <2, 8, 3>
35. Triangle <2, 8, 0>
36. Triangle <0, 5, 7>
37. Triangle <0, 5, 3>
38. Triangle <0, 5, 6>
39. Triangle <0, 7, 3>
40. Triangle <0, 7, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [40].
