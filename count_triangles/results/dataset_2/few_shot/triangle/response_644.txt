Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
  - <4, 6, 10>
  - <4, 6, 13>
  - <4, 6, 14>
  - <4, 7, 12>
  - <4, 13, 14>
  - <6, 10, 13>
  - <6, 10, 14>
  - <6, 12, 14>
  - <9, 11, 13>
  - <0, 3, 5>
  - <0, 3, 14>
  - <0, 5, 6>
  - <0, 5, 14>
  - <0, 6, 14>
  - <2, 8, 12>
  - <2, 11, 13>
  - <2, 12, 14>
  - <2, 13, 14>

- From the above list, we see that there are 17 unique triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
