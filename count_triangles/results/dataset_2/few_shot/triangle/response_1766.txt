Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. <6, 9, 3>
2. <6, 9, 5>
3. <6, 5, 4>
4. <6, 5, 3>
5. <6, 4, 3>
6. <9, 3, 4>
7. <9, 3, 5>
8. <9, 1, 7>
9. <4, 3, 5>
10. <4, 5, 8>
11. <4, 5, 2>
12. <4, 2, 5>
13. <3, 5, 6>
14. <3, 6, 4>
15. <5, 6, 4>
16. <5, 6, 3>
17. <6, 7, 9>
18. <6, 7, 3>
19. <9, 7, 1>
20. <2, 4, 5>
21. <2, 5, 6>
22. <1, 7, 9>
23. <1, 9, 0>

Therefore, there are a total of 23 triangles in the given graph.
So the total number of triangles is [23].
