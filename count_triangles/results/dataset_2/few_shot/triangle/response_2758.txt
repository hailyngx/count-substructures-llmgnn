Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

From the provided adjacency list and edge list, we can identify the triangles present in the graph. 
The unique triangles are as follows: <4, 6, 0>, <1, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 3>, <5, 6, 1>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
