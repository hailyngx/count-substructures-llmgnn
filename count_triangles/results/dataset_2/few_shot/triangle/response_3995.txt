Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 1

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph given the adjacency list and edges provided:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) 
(9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) 
(6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) 
(1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) 
(3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) 
(4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) 
(8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) 
(2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) 
(0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
(7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph: [6]

List of unique triangles:
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<0, 3, 6>
