Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by identifying unique triangles formed by sets of 3 nodes that are mutually connected. To find all the triangles, we can go through each possible combination of 3 nodes and check if they form a triangle.

The unique triangles in this graph are:
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 8, 13>
<1, 9, 14>
<2, 7, 13>
<2, 7, 10>
<3, 1, 2>
<3, 1, 13>
<3, 6, 11>
<4, 8, 9>
<7, 10, 14>
<8, 9, 10>
<11, 12, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [12].
