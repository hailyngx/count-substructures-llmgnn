Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will identify all unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes directly connected to each other.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 10, 17>
2. <0, 14, 15>
3. <3, 7, 19>
4. <3, 13, 9>
5. <4, 16, 18>
6. <4, 17, 8>
7. <4, 17, 0>
8. <5, 6, 10>
9. <8, 17, 1>
10. <8, 17, 4>
11. <9, 15, 18>
12. <10, 0, 14>
13. <10, 2, 19>
14. <10, 6, 5>
15. <10, 8, 17>
16. <11, 13, 9>
17. <13, 3, 7>
18. <15, 18, 16>
19. <17, 0, 14>
20. <17, 1, 8>
21. <17, 4, 16>
22. <19, 2, 10>
23. <19, 7, 1>
