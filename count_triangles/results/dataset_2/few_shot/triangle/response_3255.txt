Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 7, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph. Triangles are formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Looking at the given edges:
Nodes forming a triangle: (6, 9, 0), (6, 0, 5), (6, 5, 4), (6, 4, 1), (6, 1, 8), (6, 8, 9),
(9, 4, 7), (9, 7, 3), (9, 3, 2), (9, 2, 8), (7, 3, 2), (7, 2, 8), (1, 4, 3), (0, 6, 5), (0, 5, 4), (0, 4, 9), (0, 9, 8), (8, 1, 4), (8, 4, 7), (8, 7, 2).

Let's count the number of unique triangles:

<6, 9, 0>
<6, 0, 5>
<6, 5, 4>
<6, 4, 1>
<6, 1, 8>
<6, 8, 9>
<9, 4, 7>
<9, 7, 3>
<9, 3, 2>
<9, 2, 8>
<7, 3, 2>
<7, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 3>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 9, 8>
<8, 1, 4>
<8, 4, 7>
<8, 7, 2>

So, there are [20] triangles in the given graph.
