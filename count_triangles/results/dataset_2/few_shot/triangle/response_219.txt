Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [ <0, 4, 9> <0, 4, 8> <0, 1, 5> <0, 1, 7> ]. Hence, the count is [4].
