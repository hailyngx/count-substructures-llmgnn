Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, we need to identify triangles in the graph. A triangle exists when three nodes are mutually connected to each other. We will go through each set of three nodes to check if they form a triangle.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <5, 1, 7>
2. <5, 1, 14>
3. <5, 7, 1>
