Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all mutually connected. 

Looking at the graph, we see that the possible triangles are <1, 3, 5>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, and <1, 5, 8>. 

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
