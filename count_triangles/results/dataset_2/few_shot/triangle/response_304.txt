Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the graph.

**Step 1:** Count the number of triangles formed by nodes directly connected in the given edges.
- Nodes (6, 9, 17) form a triangle.  
- Nodes (1, 13, 4) form a triangle.  
- Nodes (1, 13, 12) form a triangle.  
- Nodes (9, 15, 11) form a triangle.  
- Nodes (0, 1, 16) form a triangle.  
- Nodes (0, 5, 16) form a triangle.  
- Nodes (3, 5, 16) form a triangle.  
- Nodes (2, 8, 4) form a triangle.  
- Nodes (2, 8, 18) form a triangle.  
- Nodes (2, 18, 6) form a triangle.  
- Nodes (17, 10, 4) form a triangle.  
- Nodes (17, 10, 18) form a triangle.  
- Nodes (17, 18, 13) form a triangle.  
- Nodes (6, 2, 8) form a triangle.  
- Nodes (6, 2, 18) form a triangle.  
- Nodes (6, 18, 17) form a triangle.  
- Nodes (3, 7, 14) form a triangle.  

**Step 2:** Now, let's find triangles by checking shared connections between nodes.
- Triangles formed by shared connections:  
    - Nodes (0, 1, 5)  
    - Nodes (0, 5, 13)  
    - Nodes (1, 13, 16)  
    - Nodes (2, 6, 17)  
    - Nodes (2, 8, 13)  
    - Nodes (3, 5, 12)  
    - Nodes (4, 8, 10)  
    - Nodes (11, 15, 19)  
    - Nodes (13, 16, 18)  
    - Nodes (15, 9, 19)  
    
Counting these triangles, we get a total of 24 triangles.
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [24].  
The unique triangles found are: <6, 9, 17>, <1, 13, 4>, <1, 13, 12>, <9, 15, 11>, <0, 1, 16>, <0, 5, 16>, <3, 5, 16>, <2, 8, 4>, <2, 8, 18>, <2, 18, 6>, <17, 10, 4>, <17, 10, 18>, <17, 18, 13>, <6, 2, 8>, <6, 2, 18>, <6, 18, 17>, <3, 7, 14>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 5, 13>, <1, 13, 16>, <2, 6, 17>, <2, 8, 13>, <3, 5, 12>, <4, 8, 10>, <11, 15, 19>, <13, 16, 18>, <15, 9, 19>.
