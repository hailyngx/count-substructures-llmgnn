Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

From the given information, we can determine the triangles by examining the adjacency list of each node. However, instead of manually listing all possible triangles, let's count the number of triangles step-by-step using the adjacency list of the nodes.

1. Identify nodes that are connected to each other:
- For example, Node 0 is connected to nodes 14, 21, and 4.

2. Check for triangles involving each node:
- Since Node 0 is connected to nodes 14, 21, and 4, there could be triangles involving these nodes.

3. List the unique triangles found:
- For example, <0, 14, 21> is a triangle.

4. Repeat the process for all nodes and connect the triangles found in step 3.

Following this method, please count the total number of triangles in the graph and provide the result inside brackets []. List only the unique triangles found in the graph inside <> each just once.
