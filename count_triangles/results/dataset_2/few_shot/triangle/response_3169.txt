Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with:
   - Node 2 and Node 3
   - Node 4 and Node 13
   Since Node 0 is part of two triangles, we have <0, 2, 4>.

2. Node 1 does not form any triangles.

3. Node 2 forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 17.

4. Node 3 does not form any triangles.

5. Node 4 forms a triangle with Node 13 and Node 17.

6. Node 5 forms a triangle with Node 10 and Node 19.

7. Node 6 does not form any triangles.

8. Node 7 does not form any triangles.

9. Node 8 does not form any triangles.

10. Node 9 forms a triangle with Node 11 and Node 13.

11. Node 10 does not form any triangles.

12. Node 11 forms a triangle with Node 18 and Node 5.

13. Node 12 does not form any triangles.

14. Node 13 does not form any triangles.

15. Node 14 does not form any triangles.

16. Node 15 does not form any triangles.

17. Node 16 does not form any triangles.

18. Node 17 does not form any triangles.

19. Node 18 does not form any triangles.

20. Node 19 does not form any triangles.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 5. [<0, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 17>, <5, 10, 19>, <9, 11, 13>, <11, 5, 18>]
