Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:

<2, 4, 9>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 4>
<4, 5, 9>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 6, 4>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 6, 4>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<6, 8, 3>
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 6, 3>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 2, 6>
