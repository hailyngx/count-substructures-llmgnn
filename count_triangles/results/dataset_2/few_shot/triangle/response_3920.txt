Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, 9, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 2, 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, 2, 0, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph. 
A triangle exists when three nodes are connected to each other.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<1, 2, 4>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 6, 1>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 0, 7>
<5, 4, 1>
<7, 0, 9>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
