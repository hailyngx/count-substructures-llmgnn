Response:
The graph consists of 20 nodes and 60 edges. To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all sets of 3 nodes that are connected to each other.

After analyzing the given data, we can determine the total number of triangles as well as the unique triangles present in the graph:

Total number of triangles: [30]
