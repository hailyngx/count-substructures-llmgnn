Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3)

Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. The total number of triangles can be found by examining each possible set of three nodes and checking if they form a triangle.

Based on the provided adjacency list, we can identify the triangles as follows:

1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <1, 3, 7>
5. <2, 3, 7>
6. <2, 5, 7>
7. <2, 5, 8>
8. <3, 4, 7>
9. <3, 4, 9>
10. <3, 7, 9>
11. <4, 7, 8>
12. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
