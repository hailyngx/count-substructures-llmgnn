Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can calculate it based on the number of triangles each node participates in.

Here are the nodes along with the number of triangles they form:
- Node 1 forms: <1, 13, 15>, <1, 13, 14>, <1, 15, 14>
- Node 2 forms: <2, 10, 15>, <2, 10, 16>
- Node 3 forms: <3, 14, 15>, <3, 14, 1>
- Node 4 forms: <4, 5, 13>, <4, 5, 19>
- Node 6 forms: <6, 18, 11>, <6, 18, 16>
- Node 7 forms: <7, 11, 19>
- Node 8 forms: <8, 1, 13>
- Node 9 forms: <9, 11, 12>
- Node 10 forms: <10, 15, 16>
- Node 11 forms: <11, 18, 19>
- Node 14 forms: <14, 1, 15>
- Node 16 forms: <16, 0, 6>, <16, 0, 12>
- Node 18 forms: <18, 6, 11>
- Node 19 forms: <19, 11, 17>

Counting the total number of unique triangles, we get a total of 16 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
