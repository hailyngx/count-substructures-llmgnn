Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 9, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with the following nodes:
   - (0, 2, 7)
   - (0, 2, 9)

2. Node 1 forms triangles with the following nodes:
   - (1, 3, 5)
   - (1, 4, 5)
   - (1, 7, 4)

3. Node 2 forms triangles with the following nodes:
   - (2, 5, 6)
   - (2, 5, 9)

4. Node 3 forms triangles with the following nodes:
   - (3, 1, 5)
   - (3, 4, 8)
   - (3, 5, 6)

5. Node 4 forms triangles with the following nodes:
   - (4, 1, 5)
   - (4, 5, 6)
   - (4, 8, 9)

6. Node 5 forms triangles with the following nodes:
   - (5, 1, 3)
   - (5, 1, 4)
   - (5, 2, 6)

7. Node 6 forms triangles with the following nodes:
   - (6, 3, 5)
   - (6, 4, 5)
   - (6, 7, 2)

8. Node 7 forms triangles with the following nodes:
   - (7, 1, 4)
   - (7, 6, 2)
   - (7, 8, 1)

9. Node 8 forms triangles with the following nodes:
   - (8, 3, 4)
   - (8, 4, 9)
   - (8, 7, 1)

10. Node 9 forms triangles with the following nodes:
    - (9, 4, 8)
    - (9, 2, 5)
    - (9, 2, 0)

Counting all the unique triangles, we find a total of 18 triangles in the given graph.
So, the number of triangles in the graph is [18].
