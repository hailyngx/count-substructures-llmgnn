Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, here are the unique triangles found:
<1, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<0, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<0, 2, 8>

Thus, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
