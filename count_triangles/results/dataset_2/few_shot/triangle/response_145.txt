Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 4

Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 5, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
[<0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, <7, 8, 9>]
