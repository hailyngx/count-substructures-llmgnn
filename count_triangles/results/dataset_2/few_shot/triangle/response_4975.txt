Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. For each node, we will look at all possible triangles that can be formed with its adjacent nodes.
2. A triangle is formed when there is an edge between every pair of three nodes.
3. We will iterate through each node and check all possible triangles it can form with its neighbors.

After counting, the total number of triangles found is [54].

The unique triangles found are:
