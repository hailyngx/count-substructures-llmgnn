Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency lists, Each triangle in a graph can be formed by selecting 3 nodes that are all connected to each other.

2. Let's list down the triangles present in the given graph:
   - <0, 1, 4>
   - <0, 1, 2>
   - <0, 2, 3>
   - <1, 2, 4>
   - <2, 3, 4>
   - <2, 3, 9>
   - <3, 4, 9>
   - <3, 5, 9>
   - <6, 7, 9>

3. Finally, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph:
   - Total number of triangles: [9]
