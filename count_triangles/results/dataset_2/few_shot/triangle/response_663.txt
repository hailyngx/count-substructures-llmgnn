Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated step-by-step.

1. First, let's identify the triangles formed by looking at the adjacency list of each node:

- Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 15.
- Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 3 does not form any triangle.
- Node 4 does not form any triangle.
- Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 12 and 1.
- Node 6 does not form any triangle.
- Node 7 forms a triangle with nodes 9 and 18.
- Node 8 does not form any triangle.
- Node 9 forms a triangle with nodes 7 and 18.
- Node 10 does not form any triangle.
- Node 11 does not form any triangle.
- Node 12 forms a triangle with nodes 15 and 1.
- Node 13 does not form any triangle.
- Node 14 does not form any triangle.
- Node 15 does not form any triangle.
- Node 16 does not form any triangle.
- Node 17 does not form any triangle.
- Node 18 does not form any triangle.
- Node 19 does not form any triangle.

2. Next, let's list down the unique triangles we found:
- <0, 2, 7>
- <1, 5, 15>
- <5, 12, 1>
- <7, 9, 18>

3. Finally, counting the total number of triangles, we have 4 unique triangles in total. 

Therefore, the output is:
