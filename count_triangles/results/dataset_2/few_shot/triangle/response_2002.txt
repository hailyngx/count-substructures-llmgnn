Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1, 6, and 2.
2. Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 5, 4, and 6.
3. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 8.
4. Node 3 forms a triangle with nodes 5, 7, and 8.
5. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 9, 7, and 6.
6. Node 5 forms no triangles due to lack of sufficient connections.
7. Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 9, 4, and 1.
8. Node 7 forms no triangles due to lack of sufficient connections.
9. Node 8 forms no triangles due to lack of a sufficient number of connections.
10. Node 9 forms no triangles due to lack of a sufficient number of connections.

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, and <4, 6, 7>.
