Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph based on the given edges and adjacency list:

Triangles:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 4, 11>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 8, 7>
<4, 5, 11>
<4, 9, 14>
<5, 6, 11>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 7, 13>
<1, 3, 6>
<6, 7, 13>
<6, 11, 13>
<8, 13, 7>
<8, 13, 11>
<9, 10, 4>
<9, 10, 14>
<11, 13, 5>
<11, 13, 14>

Now let's count the total number of triangles:
