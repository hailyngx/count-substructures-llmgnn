Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Look for triangles formed by each node:
   - Node 0: (0, 10, 8)
   - Node 1: No triangle
   - Node 2: No triangle
   - Node 3: (3, 10, 13)
   - Node 4: (4, 10, 19)
   - Node 5: No triangle
   - Node 6: (6, 18, 1) and (6, 12, 8)
   - Node 7: No triangle
   - Node 8: (8, 10, 12)
   - Node 9: No triangle
   - Node 10: No new triangles
   - Node 11: No triangle
   - Node 12: No new triangles
   - Node 13: No new triangles
   - Node 14: No triangle
   - Node 15: No triangle
   - Node 16: (16, 11, 17)
   - Node 17: No new triangles
   - Node 18: (18, 1, 6) and (18, 3, 6)
   - Node 19: No new triangles
   
2. Count the total number of triangles:
   - Triangles: (0, 10, 8), (3, 10, 13), (4, 10, 19), (6, 18, 1), (6, 12, 8), (16, 11, 17), (18, 1, 6), (18, 3, 6)
   
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 10, 8>, <3, 10, 13>, <4, 10, 19>, <6, 18, 1>, <6, 12, 8>, <16, 11, 17>, <18, 1, 6>, and <18, 3, 6>.
