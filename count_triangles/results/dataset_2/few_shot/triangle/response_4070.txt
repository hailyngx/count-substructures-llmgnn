Response:
Following the instructions, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we see that the nodes involved in triangles are:
- Triangle 1: Nodes 0, 1, 12
- Triangle 2: Nodes 0, 1, 14
- Triangle 3: Nodes 0, 12, 2
- Triangle 4: Nodes 0, 12, 8
- Triangle 5: Nodes 1, 3, 12
- Triangle 6: Nodes 1, 11, 7
- Triangle 7: Nodes 1, 8, 7
- Triangle 8: Nodes 2, 3, 12
- Triangle 9: Nodes 5, 9, 13
- Triangle 10: Nodes 5, 9, 14
- Triangle 11: Nodes 5, 10, 6
- Triangle 12: Nodes 9, 13, 14
- Triangle 13: Nodes 10, 0, 6
- Triangle 14: Nodes 10, 7, 8
- Triangle 15: Nodes 11, 2, 4

2. Counting the triangles, we get a total of 15 triangles.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [15]. The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 12>, <0, 1, 14>, <0, 12, 2>, <0, 12, 8>, <1, 3, 12>, <1, 11, 7>, <1, 8, 7>, <2, 3, 12>, <5, 9, 13>, <5, 9, 14>, <5, 10, 6>, <9, 13, 14>, <10, 0, 6>, <10, 7, 8>, <11, 2, 4>.
