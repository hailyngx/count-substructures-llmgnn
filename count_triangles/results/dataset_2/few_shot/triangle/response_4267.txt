Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 8, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0

Response:
Here's the step-by-step solution to finding the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Check the adjacent nodes for each node:
   - Node 0: Adjacent nodes are 4, 7, 3, 8, 5, 9
   - Node 1: Adjacent nodes are 4, 7, 3, 6, 9
   - Node 2: Adjacent nodes are 4, 8, 5, 6, 9
   - Node 3: Adjacent nodes are 1, 0, 9, 8
   - Node 4: Adjacent nodes are 7, 0, 1, 2
   - Node 5: Adjacent nodes are 7, 2, 0
   - Node 6: Adjacent nodes are 1, 2
   - Node 7: Adjacent nodes are 4, 0, 5, 1
   - Node 8: Adjacent nodes are 3, 2, 0
   - Node 9: Adjacent nodes are 1, 3, 2, 0

2. Count the number of triangles formed:
   - The triangles are formed when there exist edges between three nodes that form a closed loop.

3. Let's list the triangles:
   - <0, 4, 7>
   - <0, 4, 2>
   - <0, 7, 1>
   - <0, 7, 5>
   - <0, 3, 1>
   - <0, 3, 9>
   - <0, 8, 3>
   - <0, 8, 2>
   - <0, 5, 2>
   - <0, 5, 7>
   - <1, 4, 7>
   - <1, 4, 2>
   - <1, 7, 5>
   - <1, 3, 9>
   - <1, 6, 2>
   - <1, 9, 3>
   - <2, 4, 8>
   - <2, 4, 5>
   - <2, 8, 3>
   - <2, 5, 7>
   - <2, 5, 0>
   - <3, 1, 9>
   - <3, 8, 2>
   - <7, 4, 2>
   - <7, 4, 5>
   - <7, 5, 2>

4. Counting the total number of triangles, we find: 
   - Total number of triangles = 26

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [26].
