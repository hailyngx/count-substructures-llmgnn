Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1)

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node is involved in.

Let's calculate the total number of triangles step by step:

1. Node 0:
   - Triangles: <0, 5, 4>

2. Node 1:
   - No triangles exist for Node 1.

3. Node 2:
   - Triangles: <2, 5, 8>

4. Node 3:
   - Triangles: <3, 9, 8> <3, 9, 4> <3, 6, 7>

5. Node 4:
   - Triangles: <4, 0, 5> <4, 6, 7> <4, 7, 8> <4, 8, 9>

6. Node 5:
   - Triangles: <5, 0, 1> <5, 0, 4> <5, 1, 7> <5, 2, 8> <5, 7, 6> <5, 8, 9>

7. Node 6:
   - Triangles: <6, 4, 7> <6, 7, 3> <6, 2, 5>

8. Node 7:
   - No triangles exist for Node 7.

9. Node 8:
   - Triangles: <8, 2, 5> <8, 3, 9> <8, 3, 4>

10. Node 9:
    - Triangles: <9, 3, 8> <9, 4, 8>

Now, sum up the total number of triangles from each node: 9 triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
