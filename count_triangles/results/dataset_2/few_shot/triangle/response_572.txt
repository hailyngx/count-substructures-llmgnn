Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [6].  
The unique triangles are <5, 6, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, and <3, 5, 7>.
