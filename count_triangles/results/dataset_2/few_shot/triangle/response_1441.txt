Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the triangles by checking each possible combination of three nodes that are connected to each other.

2. For each node, check if there are two edges between the other two nodes. If yes, then it forms a triangle.

After counting all the triangles, we find that there are:
[<1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 2, 3>, <5, 8, 7>, <5, 9, 7>, <5, 4, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 8, 4>, <2, 8, 4>, <2, 4, 3>]

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
