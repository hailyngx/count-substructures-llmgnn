Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible instances where three nodes form a complete triangle (i.e., each node is connected to the other two nodes). Let's list the triangles step by step:

1. Triangles involving Node 0:
   - <0, 2, 5>

2. Triangles involving Node 1:
   - <1, 2, 6>

3. Triangles involving Node 2:
   No triangles involving only Node 2.

4. Triangles involving Node 3:
   No triangles involving only Node 3.

5. Triangles involving Node 4:
   - <4, 1, 5>
   - <4, 1, 9>
   - <4, 2, 9>
   - <4, 3, 5>

6. Triangles involving Node 5:
   No triangles involving only Node 5.

7. Triangles involving Node 6:
   - <6, 1, 8>

8. Triangles involving Node 7:
   No triangles involving only Node 7.

9. Triangles involving Node 8:
   No triangles involving only Node 8.

10. Triangles involving Node 9:
   No triangles involving only Node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
