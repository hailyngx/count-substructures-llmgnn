Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the given graph, we will identify all unique triangles. Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. Find all triangles by checking for nodes that form triangles:
   - A triangle is formed when three nodes are mutually connected to each other.

2. List the unique triangles found:
   - <0, 2, 5>
   - <0, 6, 9>
   - <0, 6, 5>
   - <0, 8, 9>
   - <0, 8, 5>
   - <0, 9, 5>
   - <1, 5, 9>
   - <1, 5, 6>
   - <2, 4, 8>
   - <2, 4, 6>
   - <2, 0, 6>
   - <2, 0, 5>
   - <2, 0, 5>
   - <2, 6, 5>
   - <3, 8, 7>
   - <3, 8, 5>
   - <5, 3, 7>
   - <5, 6, 9>
   - <6, 7, 8>
   - <6, 7, 3>
   - <8, 7, 3>
   - <8, 7, 5>
   - <9, 5, 1>
   - <9, 5, 6>

3. Count the total number of unique triangles:
   - Total number of triangles = 24

Therefore, the answer (total number of triangles) is [24].
