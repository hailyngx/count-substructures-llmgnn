[Trick to solve:]

To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will iterate over each possible triangle (a set of 3 nodes connected to each other) and check if they form a triangle by checking if all pairs of nodes in the triangle are connected. 

Let's start by enumerating the triangles:

1. <0, 4, 10>
2. <0, 10, 19>
3. <0, 4, 19>
4. <1, 6, 13>
5. <1, 6, 8>
6. <1, 8, 13>
7. <3, 5, 15>
8. <3, 5, 17>
9. <3, 15, 17>
10. <3, 5, 17>
11. <5, 15, 17>
12. <6, 11, 16>
13. <7, 10, 15>
14. <7, 10, 18>
15. <7, 15, 18>
16. <11, 12, 17>
17. <11, 12, 19>
18. <11, 17, 19>
19. <15, 16, 18>
20. <2, 14, 9>
21. <14, 9, 13>
22. <14, 7, 18>
23. <8, 11, 15>
