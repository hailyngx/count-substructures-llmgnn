Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 3

Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step by step:

1. Firstly, identify all the triangles using the given edges:
- Triangle 1: (5, 9, 6)
- Triangle 2: (5, 9, 4)
- Triangle 3: (5, 9, 1)
- Triangle 4: (5, 6, 1)

2. List the unique triangles found:
<5, 9, 6>, <5, 9, 4>, <5, 9, 1>, <5, 6, 1>

3. Count the total number of triangles:
