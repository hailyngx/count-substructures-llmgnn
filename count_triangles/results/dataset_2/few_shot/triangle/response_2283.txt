Response:
Based on the given graph, the number of triangles can be calculated by finding all possible triangles formed by the nodes. 

Let's list down the triangles based on the given edges:
1. <6, 5, 2>
2. <6, 5, 1>
3. <6, 5, 0>
4. <6, 5, 8>
5. <6, 2, 4>
6. <6, 2, 7>
7. <6, 2, 5>
8. <6, 1, 7>
9. <6, 1, 5>
10. <6, 1, 9>
11. <6, 1, 4>
12. <6, 8, 7>
13. <6, 8, 5>
14. <6, 8, 4>
15. <5, 2, 7>
16. <5, 2, 4>
17. <5, 2, 1>
18. <5, 1, 9>
19. <5, 1, 7>
20. <5, 1, 0>
21. <5, 1, 3>
22. <5, 0, 9>
23. <5, 0, 3>
24. <2, 4, 7>
25. <2, 4, 3>
26. <2, 7, 3>
27. <1, 9, 4>
28. <1, 7, 4>
29. <3, 4, 7>
30. <0, 9, 4>
31. <0, 3, 4>
32. <7, 8, 6>
33. <7, 8, 5>
34. <7, 8, 4>
35. <4, 9, 1>
36. <4, 9, 0>
37. <4, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [37].
