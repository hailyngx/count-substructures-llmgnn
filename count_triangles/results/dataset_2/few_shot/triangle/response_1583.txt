Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in the graph:

1. For node 0: (0, 5, 7), (0, 5, 3), (0, 7, 15), (0, 3, 18)
2. For node 1: (1, 5, 7)
3. For node 2: No triangles
4. For node 3: (3, 13, 18)
5. For node 4: No triangles
6. For node 5: (5, 8, 17), (5, 8, 12), (5, 17, 18), (5, 17, 15), (5, 0, 7), (5, 0, 3)
7. For node 6: No triangles
8. For node 7: No triangles
9. For node 8: (8, 16, 13), (8, 16, 2), (8, 13, 11), (8, 13, 3), (8, 13, 16), (8, 12, 17)
10. For node 9: No triangles
11. For node 10: (10, 15, 17)
12. For node 11: (11, 19, 18)
13. For node 12: No triangles
14. For node 13: (13, 16, 2), (13, 16, 8), (13, 3, 18)
15. For node 14: No triangles
16. For node 15: (15, 17, 18), (15, 17, 5), (15, 14, 19)
17. For node 16: No triangles
18. For node 17: (17, 18, 12), (17, 18, 14), (17, 18, 15)
19. For node 18: (18, 19, 14)
20. For node 19: No triangles

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [20].  
The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 7, 15>, <0, 3, 18>, <1, 5, 7>, <3, 13, 18>, <5, 8, 17>, <5, 8, 12>, <5, 17, 18>, <5, 17, 15>, <5, 0, 7>, <5, 0, 3>, <8, 16, 13>, <8, 16, 2>, <8, 13, 11>, <8, 13, 3>, <8, 13, 16>, <8, 12, 17>, <10, 15, 17>, <11, 19, 18>, <13, 16, 2>, <13, 16, 8>, <13, 3, 18>, <15, 17, 18>, <15, 17, 5>, <15, 14, 19>, <17, 18, 12>, <17, 18, 14>, <17, 18, 15>, <18, 19, 14>.
