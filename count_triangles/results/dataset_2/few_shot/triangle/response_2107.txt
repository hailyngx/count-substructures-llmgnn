Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
The given graph has 20 triangles. 
Here are the unique triangles:
<3, 9, 8>
<1, 4, 3>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 4>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 5>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 9, 3>
<7, 9, 6>
<2, 9, 6>
<2, 9, 3> 

Therefore, there are a total of [20] triangles in the given graph.
