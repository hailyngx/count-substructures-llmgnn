Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges.

To find the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for three nodes that are all connected to each other. In this case, we have the following triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
4. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
5. Triangle <1, 6, 7>
6. Triangle <1, 7, 8>
7. Triangle <2, 3, 9>
8. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
9. Triangle <2, 7, 8>
10. Triangle <3, 4, 8>
11. Triangle <4, 5, 6>
12. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
13. Triangle <3, 0, 8>
14. Triangle <0, 5, 6>
15. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
16. Triangle <2, 0, 3>
17. Triangle <2, 0, 9>
18. Triangle <3, 0, 9>
19. Triangle <3, 2, 9>
20. Triangle <4, 2, 8>
21. Triangle <4, 0, 8>
22. Triangle <4, 0, 5>
23. Triangle <0, 8, 2>
24. Triangle <0, 8, 4>

Therefore, there are a total of [24] triangles in the given graph.
