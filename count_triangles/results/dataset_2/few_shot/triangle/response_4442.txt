Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes based on the provided edges. 

Here are the unique triangles found in this graph: 
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 3, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<0, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [12].
