Response:
Based on the given graph, we are tasked with counting the number of triangles present. A triangle in a graph consists of 3 nodes that are mutually connected with each other. To find the total number of triangles, we can refer to the adjacency list provided for each node.

Let's consider each possible triangle present in this graph. A triangle can be formed by choosing any 3 nodes and checking if each pair of nodes is connected by an edge. Here is the list of unique triangles:

1. <1, 5, 9>
2. <1, 5, 6>
3. <1, 5, 0>
4. <1, 5, 3>
5. <1, 9, 7>
6. <1, 9, 5>
7. <1, 9, 2>
8. <1, 3, 4>
9. <1, 3, 7>
10. <1, 3, 0>
11. <2, 9, 7>
12. <2, 9, 8>
13. <2, 9, 5>
14. <2, 9, 1>
15. <3, 4, 7>
16. <3, 4, 8>
17. <3, 4, 2>
18. <3, 4, 7>
19. <4, 7, 8>
20. <4, 7, 2>
21. <4, 7, 3>
22. <5, 8, 0>
23. <5, 9, 7>
24. <5, 9, 6>
25. <5, 9, 1>
26. <6, 5, 1>
27. <7, 9, 2>
28. <8, 9, 5>
29. <8, 9, 2>
30. <8, 9, 4>

Hence, there are 30 triangles in this graph.
