Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step.

1. Begin by listing all the triangles in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: <2, 7, 12>
   - Triangle 2: <2, 7, 13>
   - Triangle 3: <2, 6, 10>
   - Triangle 4: <2, 6, 13>
   - Triangle 5: <2, 12, 14>
   - Triangle 6: <2, 12, 3>
   - Triangle 7: <7, 8, 9>
   - Triangle 8: <7, 8, 10>
   - Triangle 9: <7, 13, 1>
   - Triangle 10: <7, 13, 14>
   - Triangle 11: <12, 3, 5>
   - Triangle 12: <12, 3, 11>
   - Triangle 13: <12, 9, 10>
   - Triangle 14: <12, 9, 1>
   - Triangle 15: <5, 8, 14>
   - Triangle 16: <5, 8, 10>
   - Triangle 17: <5, 8 ,13>
   - Triangle 18: <5, 13, 14>
   - Triangle 19: <8, 9, 10>
   - Triangle 20: <8, 9, 14>
  
2. There are 20 unique triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
