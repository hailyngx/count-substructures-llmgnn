Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. First, we see that a triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other in a cyclic manner. So, for each node, we will explore if there are any triangles that can be formed.

2. Let's look at each node and see if there are any triangles that can be formed:
   - Node 0: No triangles can be formed with Node 0.
   - Node 1: Possible triangle with nodes 3, 7.
   - Node 2: No triangles can be formed with Node 2.
   - Node 3: No triangles can be formed with Node 3.
   - Node 4: Possible triangle with nodes 5, 8.
   - Node 5: No triangles can be formed with Node 5.
   - Node 6: No triangles can be formed with Node 6.
   - Node 7: No triangles can be formed with Node 7.
   - Node 8: No triangles can be formed with Node 8.
   - Node 9: Possible triangle with nodes 7, 8.

3. So, the possible triangles are <1, 3, 7> and <4, 5, 8>.

4. Counting the total number of triangles: [2]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
