Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7)
