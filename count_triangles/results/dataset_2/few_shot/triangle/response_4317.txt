Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. 
To find the total number of triangles, we need to find all possible combinations of three connected nodes.

Looking at the given graph and adjacency list, we can see that the triangles are formed by the following sets of nodes:
1. (2, 12, 7)
2. (2, 7, 9)
3. (7, 9, 19)
4. (7, 9, 16)
5. (12, 7, 0)

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are: 
<2, 12, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <7, 9, 19>, <7, 9, 16>, and <12, 7, 0>.
