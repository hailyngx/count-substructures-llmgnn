Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

We know that a triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Given the adjacency list and the list of edges, we can analyze the graph to find all the triangles.

Considering the graph:
- Starting from node 0: Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 17, making the triangle <0, 4, 17>.
- Moving to node 1: No triangle can be formed with node 1 alone.
- Continuing this analysis for all nodes, we can identify the following triangles: <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 17>, <0, 9, 12>, <0, 9, 17>, <2, 5, 19>, <3, 8, 9>, <3, 8, 15>, <5, 16, 19>, <11, 14, 19>, <14, 17, 19>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
