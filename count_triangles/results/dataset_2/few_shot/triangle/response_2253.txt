Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph: 

From the given information, we know that there are 20 nodes and 60 edges in the graph.

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles:

1. For each edge (u, v), we check if there is a third node w such that there are edges (u, w) and (v, w).

2. Count the total number of triangles formed by following the above step for each edge.

After examining the graph, the triangles are as follows: 
<5, 16, 17>
<6, 13, 18>
<6, 13, 19>
<6, 17, 18>
<6, 17, 19>
<10, 14, 19>
<10, 13, 18>
<10, 13, 19>
<14, 16, 19>
<16, 17, 5>
<17, 4, 10>
<17, 4, 16>
<17, 5, 16>
<18, 6, 13>
<18, 6, 17>
<18, 11, 17>
<19, 6, 13>
<19, 6, 14>
<19, 6, 17>
<19, 13, 18>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [19].
