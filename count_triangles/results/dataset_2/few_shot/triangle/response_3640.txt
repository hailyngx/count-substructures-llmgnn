Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 6, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to consider all possible sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

After analyzing the given graph information, we can find the following triangles:

- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 2, 9>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <1, 2, 7>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [19].
