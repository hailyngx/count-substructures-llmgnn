Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. To find the number of triangles in this graph, we can look for unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes connected to each other.

After analyzing the given edges and adjacency list, we find that the following triangles exist in the graph:
1. <0, 12, 14>
2. <0, 12, 15>
3. <0, 14, 16>
4. <0, 15, 25>
5. <1, 2, 17>
6. <6, 7, 13>
7. <6, 7, 29>
8. <6, 11, 20>
9. <6, 22, 27>
10. <8, 9, 22>
11. <8, 9, 7>
12. <14, 16, 26>
13. <15, 25, 28>
14. <18, 5, 8>
15. <19, 21, 4>
16. <19, 21, 22>
17. <24, 23, 20>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
