Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. We will examine each possible triangle and count how many exist in the provided graph.

Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<8, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
