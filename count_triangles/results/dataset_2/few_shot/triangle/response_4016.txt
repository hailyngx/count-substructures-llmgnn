Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Identifying the triangles can be done by looking at each node and checking for sets of three nodes that are all connected. 

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <1, 0, 4>
2. <1, 0, 8>
3. <1, 4, 8>
4. <1, 5, 7>
5. <1, 5, 9>
6. <1, 7, 5>
7. <1, 8, 4>
8. <1, 8, 2>
9. <1, 8, 4>
10. <4, 0, 1>
11. <4, 0, 3>
12. <4, 1, 7>
13. <4, 1, 8>
14. <4, 1, 9>
15. <4, 3, 0>
16. <5, 1, 7>
17. <5, 1, 9>
18. <5, 3, 6>
19. <5, 3, 9>
20. <5, 6, 3>
21. <5, 6, 9>
22. <6, 2, 3>
23. <8, 1, 4>
24. <8, 1, 5>
25. <8, 2, 6>
26. <8, 4, 1>
27. <8, 4, 9>
28. <9, 1, 5>
29. <9, 3, 5>
30. <9, 3, 6>

Total number of triangles in the given graph: [30]
