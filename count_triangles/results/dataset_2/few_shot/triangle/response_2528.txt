Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3)

Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in this graph.

Calculating the number of triangles can be done in various ways. One way is to iterate through all possible triangles and check if they are valid. Given the adjacency list representation of the graph, this can be a bit intensive. 

Another way is to notice that a triangle exists when a node is connected to two other nodes that are also connected directly. So, we can iterate through the nodes and count the triangles for each node. 

Here, we provide the total number of triangles along with some unique examples of the triangles.

[<1, 3, 7> <1, 4, 6> <1, 5, 7> <2, 4, 6> <1, 4, 7> <1, 3, 6> <2, 4, 8> <4, 5, 8> <1, 3, 9> <3, 7, 9> <1, 5, 8> <5, 8, 0> <4, 6, 7> <5, 8, 2> <4, 6, 8>]

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
