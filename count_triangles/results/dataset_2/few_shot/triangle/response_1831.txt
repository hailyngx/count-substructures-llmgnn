Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. For each node, check the neighbors and see if there are any triangles formed.
2. Keep track of unique triangles found.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<2, 7, 15>
<2, 5, 15>
<4, 16, 19>
<10, 16, 18>
<3, 13, 16>
<7, 8, 15>
<3, 14, 16>
<4, 7, 15>
<9, 12, 19>
<0, 3, 13>
<10, 11, 14>
<9, 12, 19>

Count of triangles: [12]
