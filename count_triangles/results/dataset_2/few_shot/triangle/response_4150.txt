Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated step-by-step:
1. For each node, find all possible triangles that can be formed.
2. List down the unique triangles found.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

[<0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 4>, <4, 6, 3>, <5, 9, 2>, <7, 8, 9>] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
