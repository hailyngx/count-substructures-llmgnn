Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. Let's find all the triangles step by step:

1. Look at the adjacency list for each node and identify the triangles formed by each node:
    - Node 0: <0, 2, 4>
    - Node 1: no triangles
    - Node 2: <2, 9, 18>
    - Node 3: no triangles
    - Node 4: <4, 10, 12>
    - Node 5: no triangles
    - Node 6: no triangles
    - Node 7: <7, 11, 16>, <7, 14, 15>
    - Node 8: <8, 11, 10>, <8, 13, 15>, <8, 17, 1>, <8, 17, 9>
    - Node 9: <9, 17, 8>, <9, 17, 1>, <9, 18, 2>
    - Node 10: <10, 11, 8>, <10, 15, 13>
    - Node 11: <11, 10, 15>
    - Node 12: <12, 4, 19>, <12, 5, 16>
    - Node 13: <13, 8, 11>, <13, 15, 10>
    - Node 14: <14, 15, 10>
    - Node 15: no triangles
    - Node 16: no triangles
    - Node 17: <17, 9, 18>
    - Node 18: no triangles
    - Node 19: no triangles

2. Count the total number of triangles found above:
    - Total number of triangles = 17
    
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [17]. The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <2, 9, 18>, <4, 10, 12>, <7, 11, 16>, <7, 14, 15>, <8, 11, 10>, <8, 13, 15>, <8, 17, 1>, <8, 17, 9>, <9, 17, 8>, <9, 17, 1>, <9, 18, 2>, <10, 11, 8>, <10, 15, 13>, <11, 10, 15>, <12, 4, 19>, <12, 5, 16>.
