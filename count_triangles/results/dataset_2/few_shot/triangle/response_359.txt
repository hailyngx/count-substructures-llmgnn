Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step by step:

1. First, let's list all the triangles in the graph:

- Triangle 1: <1, 3, 13>
- Triangle 2: <3, 8, 13>
- Triangle 3: <3, 10, 13>
- Triangle 4: <3, 8, 10>
- Triangle 5: <8, 9, 10>
- Triangle 6: <8, 11, 13>
- Triangle 7: <11, 5, 2>
- Triangle 8: <12, 3, 0>
- Triangle 9: <12, 3, 4>
- Triangle 10: <12, 3, 5>
- Triangle 11: <12, 3, 14>
- Triangle 12: <12, 0, 6>
- Triangle 13: <12, 0, 14>
- Triangle 14: <12, 4, 5>
- Triangle 15: <12, 4, 14>
- Triangle 16: <12, 5, 14>
- Triangle 17: <12, 14, 5>
- Triangle 18: <7, 1, 11>
- Triangle 19: <7, 1, 2>
- Triangle 20: <9, 8, 13>
- Triangle 21: <9, 8, 10>
- Triangle 22: <10, 13, 6>
- Triangle 23: <10, 13, 14>
- Triangle 24: <10, 9, 6>
- Triangle 25: <10, 9, 14>
- Triangle 26: <13, 14, 6>
- Triangle 27: <13, 14, 5>
- Triangle 28: <13, 5, 14>
- Triangle 29: <14, 6, 0>
- Triangle 30: <14, 6, 11>

2. Now, let's count the total number of triangles:
There are 30 triangles in total.

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [30].
