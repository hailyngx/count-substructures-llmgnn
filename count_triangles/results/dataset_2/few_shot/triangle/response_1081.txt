Response:
Finding the number of triangles in a graph involves identifying sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Given the above graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we can see that the graph forms a directed graph. To find triangles, we need to identify all possible sets of three nodes that are mutually connected.

The total number of triangles in this graph is [32].

The unique triangles found in this graph are:
