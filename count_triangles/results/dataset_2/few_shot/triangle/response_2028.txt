Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 4, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's proceed step by step:

1. Let's identify the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <1, 2, 6>
   - Triangle 2: <1, 2, 5>
   - Triangle 3: <1, 4, 6>
   - Triangle 4: <2, 4, 6>
   - Triangle 5: <3, 4, 7>

2. Count the total number of triangles:
   Total number of triangles = 5

Therefore, the output is:
