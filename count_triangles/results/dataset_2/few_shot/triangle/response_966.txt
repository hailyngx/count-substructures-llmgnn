Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
[<0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 8>]
