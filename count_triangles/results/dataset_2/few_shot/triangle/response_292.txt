Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2)
