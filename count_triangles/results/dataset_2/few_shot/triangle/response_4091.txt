Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
The graph has a total of 5 unique triangles: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, and <4, 7, 8>.

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
