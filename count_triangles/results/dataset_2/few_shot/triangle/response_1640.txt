Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by checking each unique triangle formed by nodes connected by edges. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

<0, 7, 16>
<0, 16, 17>
<1, 8, 11>
<1, 8, 16>
<2, 8, 16>
<2, 8, 19>
<2, 13, 18>
<3, 4, 10>
<4, 9, 16>
<4, 9, 14>
<4, 9, 16>
<5, 6, 10>
<5, 6, 13>
<5, 10, 18>
<5, 18, 13>
<9, 14, 16>
<19, 18, 12>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
