Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by the given edges. 

Given the specific connections between nodes, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 9, 1>
<4, 5, 7>
<3, 7, 5>
<3, 6, 5>
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 2, 4>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
