Response:
After analyzing the given graph, we can count the total number of triangles present in the graph.

1. We will examine each node's neighbors to find triangles.
2. A triangle is formed when three nodes are mutually connected to each other.
3. We will consider all possible combinations of three nodes.

Let's calculate the number of triangles step-by-step:

1. Choose node 0: (4, 1, 2) - <0, 4, 1>.   
2. Choose node 1: (5, 8, 6) - <1, 5, 8>.
3. Choose node 2: (0, 3, 0) - <2, 0, 3>.
4. Choose node 3: No new triangles.
5. Choose node 4: (0, 8, 5) - <4, 5, 8>.  
6. Choose node 5: (1, 9, 6) - <5, 1, 9>.  
7. Choose node 6: No new triangles.
8. Choose node 7: No triangles involving node 7.  
9. Choose node 8: (1, 4, 9) - <8, 1, 4>.  
10. Choose node 9: (5, 8, 3) - <9, 5, 8>.  

Now, let's find the total number of triangles:
