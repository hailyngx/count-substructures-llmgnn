Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

Given that the graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges.

Now, to count the number of triangles, we'll look for every unique set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Calculating the number of triangles:
1. From the given edges, we see that triangles can be formed among the nodes: (6, 9, 3), (6, 9, 4), (6, 9, 3), (3, 1, 4), (6, 3, 5), (1, 4, 9), (1, 8, 7), (9, 4, 1), (1, 7, 0), (3, 5, 6), and one more.

Hence, there are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph.

Unique triangles found:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 7, 0>
<1, 8, 7>
<3, 1, 4>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<6, 3, 5>
<6, 9, 3>
<6, 9, 4>
<9, 4, 1>
