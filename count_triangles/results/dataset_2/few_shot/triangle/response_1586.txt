Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected by edges.

For this graph, we have the following triangles:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 7, 4>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 7, 4>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 8>

Count of triangles: [11]
