Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 5, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 7

Response:
There are 2 triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles are <4, 7, 5> and <1, 4, 5>.
So, the total number of triangles is [2].
