Response:
Let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step:
1. For each node, look at all pairs of its neighbors. If any two neighbors of a node are connected to each other, then there is a triangle.
2. Count all unique triangles that can be formed in this manner.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node:
- Node 0: <4, 13, 2> can form a triangle: <0, 4, 13>
- Node 1: No triangles can be formed.
- Node 2: <7, 13, 0> can form a triangle: <2, 7, 13>; <2, 0, 13>; <2, 7, 0>
- Node 3: <5, 6, 13> can form a triangle: <3, 5, 6>; <3, 6, 13>; <3, 13, 5>
- Node 4: <9, 8, 0> can form a triangle: <4, 9, 8>; <4, 8, 0>; <4, 9, 0>
- Node 5: <9, 13, 3> can form a triangle: <5, 9, 13>; <5, 13, 3>; <5, 9, 3>
- Node 6: No triangles can be formed.
- Node 7: No triangles can be formed.
- Node 8: No triangles can be formed.
- Node 9: No triangles can be formed.
- Node 10: <9, 8, 14> can form a triangle: <10, 9, 8>; <10, 8, 14>; <10, 9, 14>
- Node 11: No triangles can be formed.
- Node 12: No triangles can be formed.
- Node 13: <5, 3, 14> can form a triangle: <13, 5, 3>; <13, 3, 14>; <13, 5, 14>
- Node 14: No triangles can be formed.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
