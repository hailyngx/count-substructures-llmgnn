Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the set of nodes and edges provided. 

By analyzing the given adjacency list, we can list out the triangles: 

<0, 4, 8>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 5>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 2>
<8, 4, 0>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
