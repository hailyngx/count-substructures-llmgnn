Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0)
