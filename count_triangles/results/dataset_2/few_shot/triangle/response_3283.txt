Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

By observing the adjacency list, we can see the triangles present in the graph:
- Node 1: 1, 4, 6
- Node 2: 2, 4, 9
- Node 5: 5, 7, 9
- Node 6: 6, 8, 9

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4]. 
The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, and <6, 8, 9>.
