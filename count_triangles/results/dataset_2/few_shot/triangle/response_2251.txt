Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 0
