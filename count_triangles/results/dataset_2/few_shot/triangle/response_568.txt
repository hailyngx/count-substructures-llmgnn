Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
[<0, 4, 6> <1, 5, 8> <1, 6, 8> <1, 2, 4> <2, 4, 7> <3, 4, 9> <3, 7, 9> <7, 0, 3>]
