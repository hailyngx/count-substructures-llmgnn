Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
[<0, 1, 8> <5, 6, 8> <3, 5, 6> <2, 4, 9> <1, 5, 8>]
