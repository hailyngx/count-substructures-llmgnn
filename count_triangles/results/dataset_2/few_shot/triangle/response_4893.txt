Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the given graph information, let's identify the triangles and count the total number of triangles:

- Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 1, 5, and 7.
- Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 5, 7, and 6.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<0, 6, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <4, 5, 7>.
