Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be determined by finding all possible triangles formed by nodes. 

Based on the given information and edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 8, 16>, <4, 7, 17>, <4, 7, 19>, <4, 17, 19>, <7, 14, 17>, <7, 14, 19>, <13, 15, 16>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
