Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7)

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, let's list all the triangles that exist in the graph:
1. <1, 3, 5>
2. <1, 3, 7>
3. <1, 5, 7>
4. <3, 4, 6>
5. <3, 6, 7>
6. <3, 6, 9>
7. <4, 6, 9>
8. <6, 7, 9>

There are 8 unique triangles in total.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
