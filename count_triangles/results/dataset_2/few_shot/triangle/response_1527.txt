Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Let's list down the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <0, 1, 8>
4. <0, 5, 3>
5. <0, 1, 9>
6. <0, 8, 4>
7. <1, 7, 4>
8. <1, 9, 6>
9. <1, 8, 4>
10. <2, 4, 7>
11. <2, 5, 6>
12. <2, 5, 3>
13. <2, 4, 8>
14. <3, 6, 9>
15. <5, 7, 4>
16. <5, 7, 6>
17. <7, 9, 1>
18. <7, 1, 8>
19. <9, 6, 5>
20. <9, 1, 8>

There are 20 unique triangles. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
