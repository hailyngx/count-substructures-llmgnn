Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
[<1, 2, 3> <1, 6, 9> <2, 3, 4> <2, 4, 6> <2, 4, 8> <2, 7, 8> <4, 7, 9> <4, 8, 9>]
