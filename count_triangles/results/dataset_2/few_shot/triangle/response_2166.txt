Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will calculate the total number of triangles present.

Let's find the triangles in the graph:
Node 0 has triangles with nodes 1, 5, 6
Node 1 has triangles with nodes 0, 5, 6, and 8
Node 2 has triangles with nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9
Node 3 has triangles with nodes 4, 6, 9
Node 4 has triangles with nodes 3, 5, 7, and 8
Node 5 has triangles with nodes 2, 4, and 7
Node 6 has triangles with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 9
Node 7 has triangles with nodes 4 and 5
Node 8 has triangles with nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9
Node 9 has triangles with nodes 2, 3, 6, and 8

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16]. 
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 5>, <6, 2, 9>, <8, 1, 9>, <8, 2, 9>, <9, 6, 8>.
