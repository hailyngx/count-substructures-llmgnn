Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2)
