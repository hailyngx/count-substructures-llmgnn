Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 27. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<4, 2, 12>, <6, 7, 14>, <3, 7, 11>, <0, 2, 10>, <1, 5, 8>, <0, 10, 11>, <1, 6, 12>, <5, 8, 14>, <4, 10, 14>, <1, 6, 13>, <2, 8, 14>, <4, 10, 5>, <3, 7, 9>, <0, 2, 12>, <1, 8, 14>, <0, 11, 12>, <5, 10, 14>, <2, 8, 1>, <4, 12, 13>, <3, 11, 12>, <0, 11, 9>, <3, 2, 7>, <1, 12, 13>, <6, 10, 14>, <1, 12, 2>, <3, 11, 9>, <4, 12, 2> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [27].
