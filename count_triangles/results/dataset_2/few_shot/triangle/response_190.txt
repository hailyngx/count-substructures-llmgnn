Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph.

First, let's find the triangles step by step:

1. (0, 1, 2)
2. (0, 2, 3)
3. (0, 2, 6)
4. (0, 2, 7)
5. (0, 2, 8)
6. (0, 6, 7)
7. (1, 3, 6)
8. (2, 3, 8)
9. (2, 6, 7)
10. (3, 4, 8)

Now, based on the list above, we have found 10 unique triangles in the graph. Thus, there are a total of 10 triangles present in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
