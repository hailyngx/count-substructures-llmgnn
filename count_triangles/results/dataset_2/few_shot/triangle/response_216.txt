Response:
Given the provided graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's find the total number of triangles.

A triangle in a graph is formed when there are three nodes connected such that there is an edge between each pair of the three nodes.

Calculating the total number of triangles in this graph:

- Triangle <1, 3, 8>
- Triangle <0, 9, 19>
- Triangle <0, 10, 15>
- Triangle <0, 10, 12>
- Triangle <0, 10, 18>
- Triangle <0, 9, 16>
- Triangle <0, 9, 17>
- Triangle <0, 9, 19>
- Triangle <1, 3, 5>
- Triangle <1, 3, 6>
- Triangle <1, 3, 13>
- Triangle <1, 8, 11>
- Triangle <1, 8, 9>
- Triangle <2, 5, 17>
- Triangle <2, 18, 0>
- Triangle <2, 18, 5>
- Triangle <2, 18, 0>
- Triangle <2, 19, 7>
- Triangle <4, 16, 9>
- Triangle <4, 16, 19>
- Triangle <4, 19, 17>
- Triangle <5, 17, 19>
- Triangle <9, 16, 12>
- Triangle <9, 16, 4>
- Triangle <9, 17, 5>
- Triangle <9, 17, 19>

Therefore, there are a total of [26] triangles in the given graph.
