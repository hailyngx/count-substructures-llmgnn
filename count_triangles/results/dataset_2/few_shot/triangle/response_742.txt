Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph based on the given information.

To find a triangle in a graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see the possible triangles formed by the nodes:
1. (0, 2, 8)
2. (0, 3, 10)
3. (1, 6, 11)
4. (1, 10, 13)
5. (2, 8, 9)
6. (3, 5, 13)
7. (5, 8, 13)
8. (5, 6, 11)
9. (6, 11, 7)
10. (8, 12, 14)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles by listing the unique triangles:
[10] <0, 2, 8> <0, 3, 10> <1, 6, 11> <1, 10, 13> <2, 8, 9> <3, 5, 13> <5, 8, 13> <5, 6, 11> <6, 11, 7> <8, 12, 14>
