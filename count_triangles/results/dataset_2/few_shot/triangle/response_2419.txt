Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify triangles by finding nodes that have edges connecting them in a triangular pattern.
2. Count the total number of triangles present.

Based on the given graph and adjacency list, we identify the following triangles:
- <11, 4, 14>
- <11, 2, 3>
- <11, 2, 12>
- <11, 2, 7>
- <11, 2, 14>
- <11, 3, 14>
- <11, 4, 14>
- <4, 0, 13>
- <4, 0, 2>
- <4, 0, 8>
- <4, 2, 3>
- <4, 2, 14>
- <0, 8, 7>
- <0, 13, 5>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <2, 3, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
