Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6)
