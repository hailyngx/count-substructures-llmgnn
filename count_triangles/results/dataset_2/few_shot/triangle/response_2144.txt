Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph:

1. First, let's identify all the unique triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: <1, 3, 5>
- Triangle 2: <1, 3, 9>
- Triangle 3: <1, 4, 9>
- Triangle 4: <1, 5, 11>
- Triangle 5: <1, 9, 7>
- Triangle 6: <3, 5, 7>
- Triangle 7: <3, 5, 11>
- Triangle 8: <3, 7, 9>
- Triangle 9: <4, 9, 13>
- Triangle 10: <5, 7, 9>
- Triangle 11: <5, 10, 11>
- Triangle 12: <5, 11, 13>
- Triangle 13: <10, 11, 12>
- Triangle 14: <10, 12, 14>
- Triangle 15: <0, 7, 9>
- Triangle 16: <0, 12, 14>
- Triangle 17: <0, 9, 13>
- Triangle 18: <2, 4, 14>
- Triangle 19: <2, 12, 14>

2. Total number of triangles in the graph is [19].
