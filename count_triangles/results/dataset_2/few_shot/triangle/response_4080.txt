Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph step by step:

1. First, identify all the triangles formed by each node.
2. Then, count the total number of unique triangles.

Node 0:
- Triangle 1: 0-5-9
- Triangle 2: 0-5-12
- Triangle 3: 0-9-11
Total triangles from Node 0: 3

Node 1:
- Triangle 1: 1-9-14
- Triangle 2: 1-9-7
- Triangle 3: 1-9-0
- Triangle 4: 1-2-10
- Triangle 5: 1-2-8
Total triangles from Node 1: 5

Node 2:
- Triangle 1: 2-10-14
- Triangle 2: 2-10-7
- Triangle 3: 2-7-11
- Triangle 4: 2-8-3
Total triangles from Node 2: 4

Node 3:
- No triangles

Node 4:
- Triangle 1: 4-5-12
- Triangle 2: 4-5-7
- Triangle 3: 4-7-6
- Triangle 4: 4-1-6
Total triangles from Node 4: 4

Node 5:
- Triangle 1: 5-12-2
- Triangle 2: 5-7-14
Total triangles from Node 5: 2

Node 6:
- Triangle 1: 6-1-13
Total triangles from Node 6: 1

Node 7:
- No new triangles

Node 8:
- No triangles

Node 9:
- Triangle 1: 9-14-10
- Triangle 2: 9-7-10
Total triangles from Node 9: 2

Node 10:
- No new triangles

Node 11:
- Triangle 1: 11-10-7
