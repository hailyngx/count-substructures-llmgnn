Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles one by one:

1. <1, 3, 5>
2. <1, 3, 9>
3. <1, 5, 9>
4. <1, 5, 7>
5. <1, 7, 9>
6. <2, 3, 5>
7. <2, 3, 9>
8. <2, 5, 6>
9. <2, 5, 9>
10. <2, 6, 9>
11. <2, 7, 9>
12. <3, 5, 9>
13. <3, 8, 1>
14. <3, 8, 5>
15. <3, 8, 9>
16. <3, 0, 4>
17. <3, 0, 5>
18. <3, 0, 9>
19. <3, 2, 5>
20. <4, 6, 8>
21. <5, 6, 9>
22. <5, 1, 9>
23. <6, 4, 8>
24. <7, 2, 9>

It seems there are **24 unique triangles** in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is **[24]**.
