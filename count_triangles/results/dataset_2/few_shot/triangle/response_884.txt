Response:
Based on the given graph, we will find the number of triangles. To do this, we need to identify all the triangles in the graph, i.e., sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 4, 15>
<0, 2, 7>
<2, 9, 7>
<4, 8, 14>
<4, 8, 16>
<2, 12, 14>
<8, 11, 13>
<5, 7, 15>
<11, 13, 15>
<16, 1, 17>
<3, 10, 18>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
