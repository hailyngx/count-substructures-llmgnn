Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 1)
