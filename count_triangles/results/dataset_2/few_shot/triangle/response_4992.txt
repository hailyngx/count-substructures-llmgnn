Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 5, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Two nodes are said to form a triangle with a third node if there is an edge between each pair of them.
2. In other words, if nodes A and B are connected, nodes B and C are connected, and nodes C and A are connected, then nodes A, B, and C form a triangle.

Let's list the triangles:

<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [23]
