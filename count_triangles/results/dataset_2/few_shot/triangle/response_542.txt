Response:
Let's start by counting the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 1 forms triangles with the following pairs of nodes connected to it: (5, 12) and (1, 17).
2. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 18.
3. Node 3 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 14.
4. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 13 and 15.
5. Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 16.
6. Node 8 forms triangles with the following pairs of nodes connected to it: (14, 18) and (6, 11).
7. Node 9 forms a triangle with nodes 17 and 12.
8. Node 12 forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 9.
9. Node 13 forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 15.
10. Node 15 forms a triangle with nodes 7 and 13.
11. Node 16 forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 7.
12. Node 17 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 9.
13. Node 18 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 12.
