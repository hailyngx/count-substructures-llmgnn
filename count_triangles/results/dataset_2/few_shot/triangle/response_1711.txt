Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 9, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 0, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 3, 5>
4. <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
