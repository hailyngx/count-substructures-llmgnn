Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2)

Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 3

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Since the graph is undirected, we will count triangles as any set of three nodes that are mutually connected.

Given the graph information and adjacency list, we can start by examining each node's connections to find all triangles. Here are the triangles found:

1. <1, 5, 6>
2. <1, 2, 3>
3. <1, 2, 8>
4. <1, 3, 5>
5. <1, 3, 9>
6. <1, 4, 5>
7. <1, 4, 7>
8. <2, 3, 7>
9. <2, 3, 8>
10. <2, 7, 8>
11. <3, 5, 9>
12. <4, 5, 7>
13. <6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [13]
