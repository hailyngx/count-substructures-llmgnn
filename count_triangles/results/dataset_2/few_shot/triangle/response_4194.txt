Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

There are a total of 30 nodes in the graph.

We will look for triangles, which are cycles of length 3.

To count the triangles, we will check each possible combination of three nodes connected to each other.

After examining all potential triangles, we will output the total number of triangles found.

Let's proceed with the calculation.
