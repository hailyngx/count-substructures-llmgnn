Response:
There are a total of 20 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 9, 12>
<1, 16, 13>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 12, 19>
<3, 7, 1>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 15, 18>
<6, 9, 12>
<6, 10, 16>
<6, 13, 16>
<6, 14, 16>
<10, 15, 18>
<12, 15, 18>
<12, 18, 19>
<13, 2, 5>
<13, 6, 9>
<13, 6, 16>
<15, 10, 16>
<15, 18, 0> 

So, the total number of triangles is [20].
