Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node individually and identifying unique triangles:

1. Triangle involving node 0:
   - (0, 2, 4) - <0, 2, 4>

2. Triangle involving node 1:
   - (1, 3, 4) - <1, 3, 4>

3. Triangle involving node 2:
   - (2, 3, 7) - <2, 3, 7>

4. Triangle involving node 3 (same as above):
   - (2, 3, 7) - <2, 3, 7>

5. Triangle involving node 4 (same as above):
   - (1, 3, 4) - <1, 3, 4>

6. Triangle involving node 5:
   - (4, 5, 9) - <4, 5, 9>

7. Triangle involving node 6:
   - (6, 7, 9) - <6, 7, 9>

8. Triangle involving node 7 (same as above):
   - (6, 7, 9) - <6, 7, 9>

9. Triangle involving node 8:
   - No unique triangles involving node 8.

10. Triangle involving node 9 (same as above):
   - (6, 7, 9) - <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
