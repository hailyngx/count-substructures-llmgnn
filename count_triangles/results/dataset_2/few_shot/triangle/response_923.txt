Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 9, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, 5, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's start by listing all the triangles found in the graph based on the given edges and adjacency list:

1. Triangle: <1, 2, 4>
2. Triangle: <0, 1, 3>
3. Triangle: <0, 2, 3>
4. Triangle: <0, 3, 9>
5. Triangle: <1, 5, 6>
6. Triangle: <1, 4, 8>
7. Triangle: <1, 8, 9>
8. Triangle: <2, 3, 4>
9. Triangle: <2, 3, 5>
10. Triangle: <0, 2, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 10. 
So, the answer is:
