Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for all possible sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Triangles are formed by three nodes that are all connected to each other directly.

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following triangles:

<0, 3, 10>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 15>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 10>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 15>
<3, 10, 2>
<3, 10, 4>
<3, 10, 0>
<3, 11, 8>
<3, 11, 0>
<3, 15, 1>
<3, 15, 0>
<3, 15, 5>
<4, 15, 1>
<4, 15, 0>
<8, 11, 3>
<13, 18, 1>
<13, 18, 4>
<13, 18, 1>
<16, 8, 15>
<16, 8, 7>
<16, 8, 14>
<16, 15, 0>
<16, 15, 5>
<16, 15, 1>
<16, 15, 6>
<16, 2, 7>
<16, 2, 10>
<16, 2, 12>

Thus, there are 30 triangles in the given graph. 
So, the total number of triangles is [30].
