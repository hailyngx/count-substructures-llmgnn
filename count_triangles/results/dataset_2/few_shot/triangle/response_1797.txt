Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. 

Here are the unique triangles:
1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <0, 6, 8>
3. <2, 4, 8>
4. <1, 5, 9>
5. <1, 7, 9>
6. <1, 5, 8>
7. <1, 7, 4>
8. <6, 7, 9>
9. <6, 7, 8>

So, the total number of triangles is [9].
