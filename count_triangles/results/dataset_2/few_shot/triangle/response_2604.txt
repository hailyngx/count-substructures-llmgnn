Response:
First, let's calculate the total number of triangles in the graph by examining each possible triangle formed by the edges.

For each edge (i, j), we look for nodes connected to both i and j. If such a node exists (let's call it k), then we have found a triangle <i, j, k>.

Let's calculate the number of triangles:

1. For edge (6, 9): Node 8 is connected to both 6 and 9.
2. For edge (6, 7): No triangle found.
3. For edge (6, 2): Node 4 is connected to both 6 and 2.
4. For edge (6, 8): Nodes 9 and 2 are connected to both 6 and 8.
5. For edge (6, 4): No triangle found.
6. For edge (9, 8): Node 6 is connected to both 9 and 8.
7. For edge (9, 7): No triangle found.
8. For edge (9, 0): No triangle found.
9. For edge (4, 6): No triangle found.
10. For edge (4, 2): No triangle found.
11. For edge (4, 3): No triangle found.
12. For edge (7, 6): No triangle found.
13. For edge (7, 9): No triangle found.
14. For edge (2, 6): Node 8 is connected to both 2 and 6.
15. For edge (2, 4): Node 6 is connected to both 2 and 4.
16. For edge (2, 8): Nodes 6 and 8 are connected to both 2 and 8.
17. For edge (2, 3): Node 8 is connected to both 2 and 3.
18. For edge (2, 0): Node 8 is connected to both 2 and 0.
19. For edge (8, 6): Nodes 9, 2, and 4 are connected to both 8 and 6.
20. For edge (8, 9): Node 6 is connected to both 8 and 9.
21. For edge (8, 2): Nodes 6 and 2 are connected to both 8 and 2.
22. For edge (8, 5): No triangle found.
23. For edge (8, 3): Nodes 6 and 2 are connected to both 8 and 3.
24. For edge (8, 1): No triangle found.
25. For edge (3, 4): No triangle found.
26. For edge (3, 2): Node 8 is connected to both 3 and 2.
27. For edge (3, 8): Nodes 6 and 2 are connected to both 3 and 8.
28. For edge (3, 0): Node 8 is connected to both 3 and 0.
29. For edge (3, 5): No triangle found.
30. For edge (0, 9): No triangle found.
31. For edge (0, 2): Node 8 is connected to both 0 and 2.
32. For edge (0, 3): Node 8 is connected to both 0 and 3.
33. For edge (0, 5): No triangle found.
34. For edge (0, 1): No triangle found.
35. For edge (5, 8): Nodes 3 and 0 are connected to both 5 and 8.
36. For edge (5, 3): No triangle found.
37. For edge (5, 0): No triangle found.
38. For edge (1, 8): No triangle found.
39. For edge (1, 0): No triangle found.

Based on the analysis above, we have found the following unique triangles:
<6, 9, 8>, <6, 2, 4>, <6, 2, 8>, <2, 8, 3>, <2, 8, 0>, <8, 6, 4>, <8, 6, 9>, <8, 6, 2>, <8, 3, 0>, <5, 8, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
