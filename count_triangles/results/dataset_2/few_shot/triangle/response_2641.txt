Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 0

Response:
In order to count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by the nodes. Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:

1. <4, 7, 1>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <1, 3, 7>

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
