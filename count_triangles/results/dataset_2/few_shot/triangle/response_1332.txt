Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Create a variable to store the count of triangles and initialize it to 0.
2. Iterate over all possible triangles formed by selecting three nodes at a time.
3. For each triangle, check if all the edges exist in the graph.
4. If all three edges exist, increment the triangle count and store the triangle in a set to ensure uniqueness.
5. Finally, output the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found.

After analyzing the provided graph, the output would be as follows:

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles:
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 10>
<6, 7, 18>
<6, 9, 11>
<10, 19, 7>
<14, 15, 18>
