Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
There are 13 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<5, 9, 2>
<5, 9, 3>
<5, 2, 6>
<5, 4, 7>
<5, 4, 6>
<9, 7, 4>
<9, 8, 1>
<9, 8, 6>
<5, 4, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 8, 1>
<4, 8, 6>
<8, 6, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [13].
