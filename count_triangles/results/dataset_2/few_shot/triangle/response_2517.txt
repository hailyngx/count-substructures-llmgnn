Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 3
