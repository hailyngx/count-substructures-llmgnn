Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4)
