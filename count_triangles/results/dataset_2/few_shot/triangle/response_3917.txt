Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all possible triangles formed by connecting three nodes that are mutually adjacent. Here are the steps to find the triangles:

1. Check each node and its neighbors to identify potential triangles.
2. For each node, iterate through its neighbors and check if there are connections between the neighbors. If two neighbors of the current node are connected, then there is a triangle formed by the current node and its two neighbors.
3. Count the total number of unique triangles found.

Let's list the triangles using the notation <a, b, c> where a, b, c are node numbers forming a triangle.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
