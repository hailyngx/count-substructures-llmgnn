Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify all the triangles by checking each possible set of three nodes that are connected to each other.

The unique triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 9, 4>
<0, 9, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
