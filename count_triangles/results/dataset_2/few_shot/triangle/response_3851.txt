Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. 

Let's find the triangles step by step:
1. Look at each node and its neighbors to find triangles.
2. Check for all possible triangles formed by three connected nodes.

Based on the adjacency list provided, the triangles found in the given graph are:
<1, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<7, 8, 5>
<9, 7, 5>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<2, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
