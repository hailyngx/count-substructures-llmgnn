Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 9, 5, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. 

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
1. <1, 5, 8>
2. <1, 5, 3>
3. <1, 5, 4>
4. <1, 8, 6>
5. <1, 8, 0>
6. <1, 8, 5>
7. <2, 4, 7>
8. <2, 4, 5>
9. <2, 7, 2>
10. <2, 7, 4>
11. <3, 5, 1>
12. <4, 7, 2>
13. <4, 7, 6>
14. <5, 8, 0>
15. <5, 8, 1>
16. <6, 7, 1>
17. <6, 7, 4>
18. <6, 8, 0>
19. <7, 9, 8>

Therefore, there are 19 triangles in the given graph. 
So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [19].
