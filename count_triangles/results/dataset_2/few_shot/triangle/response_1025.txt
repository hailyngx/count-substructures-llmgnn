Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 4

Response:
[<0, 1, 8>] [<0, 4, 7>] [<1, 2, 8>] [<1, 6, 7>] [<1, 3, 4>] [<1, 5, 7>] [<2, 5, 8>] [<3, 4, 6>] [<5, 7, 8>]
