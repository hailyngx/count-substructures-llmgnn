Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph step-by-step:

1. For each node, find all the pairs of its neighbors that are connected directly to each other. These pairs will form the edges of potential triangles involving that node.

2. Check each pair of neighbors found in step 1 and see if there is a direct edge between them. If such an edge exists, a triangle is formed among the three nodes.

3. Count the total number of unique triangles found.

Let's begin the calculations:

For Node 0:
- Pairs: (9, 5), (5, 4), (4, 9)
- Triangles: None

For Node 1:
- Pairs: (7, 13), (13, 2), (2, 14), (14, 8), (8, 4), (4, 13)
- Triangles: <7, 13, 1>, <1, 2, 13>, <1, 14, 7>

For Node 2:
- Pairs: (9, 5), (5, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (1, 5)
- Triangles: None

For Node 3:
- Pairs: (14, 2), (2, 4)
- Triangles: None

For Node 4:
- Pairs: (6, 3), (3, 11), (11, 12), (12, 4), (4, 10), (10, 6), (6, 13), (13, 1)
- Triangles: <6, 13, 4>, <4, 1, 13>

For Node 5:
- Pairs: (7, 13), (13, 2), (2, 0), (0, 7), (7, 1), (1, 9), (9, 5)
- Triangles: None

For Node 6:
- Pairs: (4, 13)
- Triangles: None

For Node 7:
- Pairs: (9, 12), (12, 14), (14, 8), (8, 5), (5, 1), (1, 13)
- Triangles: None

For Node 8:
- Pairs: (7, 10), (10, 1)
- Triangles: None

For Node 9:
- Pairs: (2, 5), (5, 13), (13, 0), (0, 9), (9, 1)
- Triangles: None

For Node 10:
- Pairs: (13, 14), (14, 8), (8, 4), (4, 13)
- Triangles: None

For Node 11:
- Pairs: (12, 4)
- Triangles: None

For Node 12:
- Pairs: (7, 14)
- Triangles: None

For Node 13:
- Pairs: (6, 9), (9, 5), (5, 1), (1, 10), (10, 6)
- Triangles: None

For Node 14:
- Pairs: (7, 12), (12, 3), (3, 1)
