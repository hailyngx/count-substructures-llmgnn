Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 shares edges with nodes 19.
2. Node 1 shares edges with nodes 16, 3, 10, and 12.
3. Node 2 shares edges with nodes 17 and 9.
4. Node 3 shares edges with nodes 11, 1, and 4.
5. Node 4 shares an edge with node 3.
6. Node 5 shares edges with nodes 14 and 18.
7. Node 6 shares edges with nodes 11, 16, 14, 9, and 15.
8. Node 7 shares an edge with node 19.
9. Node 8 shares edges with nodes 16, 17, and 15.
10. Node 9 shares edges with nodes 6, 2, and 19.
11. Node 10 shares edges with nodes 14, 1, and 12.
12. Node 11 shares edges with nodes 16, 3, 6, and 15.
13. Node 12 shares edges with nodes 1, 10, and 18.
14. Node 13 shares an edge with node 17.
15. Node 14 shares edges with nodes 17, 6, 5, and 10.
16. Node 15 shares edges with nodes 11, 6, 8, and 18.
17. Node 16 shares edges with nodes 11, 1, 8, and 6.
18. Node 17 shares edges with nodes 14, 13, 8, 2, and 18.
19. Node 18 shares edges with nodes 17, 15, 5, and 12.
20. Node 19 shares edges with nodes 9, 7, and 0.

Counting the number of triangles:
- There are 4 triangles: <6, 11, 15>, <12, 15, 18>, <14, 17, 18>, and <1, 10, 12>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
