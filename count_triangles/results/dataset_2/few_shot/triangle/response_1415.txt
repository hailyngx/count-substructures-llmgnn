Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Look for nodes that have at least 2 edges connecting them.
2. Check if the neighbors of those nodes are connected forming a triangle.
3. Count the number of triangles found.

In this graph, there are 56 triangles. Here are a few of the unique triangles:
<1, 8, 13>
<1, 7, 14>
<2, 8, 10>
<4, 5, 13>
<0, 4, 13>
<0, 6, 9>
<10, 11, 4>
<3, 6, 14>
<0, 9, 10>
<3, 7, 14>
...
