Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 5, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0

Response:
[<0, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <8, 7, 9>]
