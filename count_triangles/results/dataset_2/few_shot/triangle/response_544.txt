Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 1

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Identify the triangles by examining each unique set of 3 nodes that are all mutually connected to each other.
2. List the unique triangles found.

The total number of triangles is [10].

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
