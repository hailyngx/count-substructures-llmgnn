Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 12) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 1) (10, 9) (10, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 0, 2, and node 13
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 12, 11, 1, 10, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 11, and node 14
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 12
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 12, 11, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 14, and node 11
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 10, 7, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 8, 7, 3, 14, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 13
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 12, 0, and node 1
Node 14 is connected to node 8, 3, 11, and node 2

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<3, 11, 14>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 8, 12>
<5, 8, 9>
<1, 5, 13>
<2, 11, 14>
So, the number of triangles in the graph is [6].
