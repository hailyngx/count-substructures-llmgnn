Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
[<0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 8, 0>, <6, 7, 3>, <7, 9, 2>]
