Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is represented in brackets [].

Let's calculate the total number of triangles step by step:

1. For each node, we'll find the triangles it is a part of:
   - Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 6, 7, 11, and 8.
   - Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 7.
   - Node 2 forms triangles with nodes 7 and 13.
   - Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 4, 10, 13, and 7.
   - Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 10 and 13.
   - Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 12, 14, 10, and 13.
   - Node 6 forms triangles with nodes 0, 11, 12, and 2.
   - Node 7 forms triangles with nodes 1, 2, 8, and 9.
   - Node 8 forms a triangle with nodes 14.
   - Node 9 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 10 forms triangles with nodes 12, 4, 5, and 14.
   - Node 11 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 6.
   - Node 12 forms a triangle with nodes 10 and 6.
   - Node 13 forms triangles with nodes 2, 4, 5, and 14.
   - Node 14 forms a triangle with node 8.

2. Summing up the triangles found from all nodes, we get:
   - Total number of triangles = 20

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<2, 7, 13>, <4, 10, 13>, <5, 12, 14>, <0, 6, 11>, <3, 7, 10>, <0, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 13>, <3, 4, 10>, <0, 7, 11>, <6, 10, 12>, <5, 10, 13>, <0, 6, 12>, <5, 13, 14>, <2, 7, 13>, <1, 2, 7>, <0, 7, 6>, <3, 4, 13>, <2, 7, 14>, <3, 10, 14>, <5, 13, 10>.
