Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Counting the triangles in this graph can be quite complex due to the large number of nodes and edges. However, we can approach this systematically by looking at the adjacency list for each node and identifying any triangles.

Here are the triangles found in the graph: 
[<5, 0, 28>, <5, 10, 28>, <5, 10, 22>, <5, 14, 28>, <5, 14, 19>, <5, 21, 10>, <17, 0, 28>, <17, 0, 18>, <17, 27, 4>, <17, 27, 6>, <17, 27, 29>, <17, 27, 6>, <24, 8, 25>, <25, 7, 11>, <25, 7, 29>, <25, 9, 8>, <25, 9, 3>, <25, 23, 16>, <28, 0, 1>, <28, 0, 10>, <28, 0, 14>, <28, 1, 19>, <28, 1, 11>, <28, 10, 22>, <28, 14, 19>, <29, 8, 24>, <29, 8, 27>, <29, 24, 2>, <29, 24, 8>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [28].
