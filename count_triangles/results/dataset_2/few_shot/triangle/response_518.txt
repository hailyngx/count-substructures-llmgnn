Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
There are a total of 16 triangles in this graph.

The unique triangles are:
<5, 1, 7>
<5, 1, 9>
<5, 2, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<4, 1, 7>
<4, 1, 9>
<4, 2, 8>
<4, 2, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<7, 1, 9>
<7, 4, 9>
<7, 0, 9>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 8, 2> 

So, the total number of triangles is [16].
