Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, and node 7
