Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

To find a triangle in a graph, we need to look for a set of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other.

From the given graph, we can determine the following triangles:
1. <0, 4, 3>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 4, 9>
4. <0, 3, 6>
5. <0, 3, 9>
6. <0, 6, 9>
7. <4, 3, 6>
8. <4, 3, 9>
9. <4, 6, 9>
10. <3, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles is [10].
