Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by the nodes based on the given edges.

Let's first compute the total number of triangles:

1. For each node, we check if there are any triangles formed by considering the neighbors of the node.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles in the graph based on the identified triangles.

After examining all possible triangles, we find a total of 29 triangles in the graph:
[29]

The unique triangles found are as follows:
<3, 15, 10>, <3, 15, 1>, <3, 15, 19>, <3, 15, 17>, <3, 1, 10>, <3, 1, 18>, <3, 0, 7>, <3, 0, 16>, <3, 0, 19>, <3, 7, 17>, <3, 12, 17>, <3, 10, 19>, <3, 6, 13>, <15, 1, 10>, <15, 10, 19>, <15, 17, 12>, <15, 17, 7>, <15, 19, 16>, <1, 10, 13>, <1, 18, 8>, <10, 19, 16>, <0, 7, 17>, <0, 16, 19>, <7, 17, 12>, <8, 18, 1>, <12, 17, 7>, <12, 13, 2>, <11, 5, 8>, <11, 2, 13>
