Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are: <6, 2, 9>, <6, 4, 9>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 2, 4>, <6, 2, 7>, <6, 5, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, and <1, 5, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
