Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 14, and node 11
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 13, 12, and node 10
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 12, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 0, 7, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 11, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 6, 14, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 2, 10, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 1, 0, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 3
Node 11 is connected to node 13, 6, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 7, 8, 11, and node 3

Response:
There are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<5, 7, 14>
<0, 5, 14>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 9, 12>
<0, 11, 13>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 8, 10>
<3, 4, 12>
<3, 10, 13>
<6, 11, 13> 

So, there are 10 triangles in total. [10]
