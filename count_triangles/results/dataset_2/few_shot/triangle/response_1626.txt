Response:
Here is the step-by-step process to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. First, identify all possible triangles in the graph based on the given edges and nodes.
2. Calculate the total number of triangles formed by counting the unique triangles.
3. List the unique triangles found.

Based on the given information:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 14, 7, and 10.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 2, 13, 4, 9, and 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 12.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 11, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 10, 14, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 6, 2, 11, and 10.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 12.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 11.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 9, 14, and 12.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 12, and 10.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 13, 4, 5, 0, and 9.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 8, 6, 2, and 9.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 10.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 8, 4, and 0.

After examining the graph, we find the following unique triangles:
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 10>
<1, 9, 12>
<1, 10, 13>
<2, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 12>
<4, 8, 12>
<4, 10, 13>
<8, 9, 12>
<10, 12, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
