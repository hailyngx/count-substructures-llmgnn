Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 6, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by examining each group of three nodes.

By calculating the triangles which can be formed, we get the following result:

[<0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 3>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 8, 7>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 4, 8>, <5, 4, 0>, <5, 4, 6>, <5, 8, 6>, <3, 1, 6>, <3, 1, 9>, <3, 1, 4>, <3, 0, 8>, <3, 0, 8>, <3, 0, 9>, <3, 0, 1>, <3, 6, 1>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 6, 2>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 3, 8>, <4, 3, 0>, <4, 3, 6>, <4, 8, 6>, <5, 6, 1>, <8, 7, 9>, <8, 7, 2>, <8, 0, 9>, <8, 0, 7>, <8, 0, 5>, <8, 0, 4>, <8, 0, 2>, <8, 4, 0>, <8, 4, 2>, <8, 9, 7>, <8, 9, 0>, <8, 7, 2>, <8, 7, 0>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [45].
