Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

To find triangles in a graph, we need to look for nodes that form cycles of length 3. In simpler terms, triangles are formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Going through the given graph and adjacency list, we can determine the triangles:
1. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 9, 5, 6, and 2. Node 7, 8, and 9 are connected to node 4 forming triangles: <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, and <4, 8, 9>.
2. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 3, 5, and 2. Node 4, 1, and 3 are connected to node 6 forming triangles: <4, 6, 1> and <4, 6, 3>.
3. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 2, and 9. Node 6, 2, and 9 are connected to node 0 forming a triangle: <0, 6, 2>.

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
