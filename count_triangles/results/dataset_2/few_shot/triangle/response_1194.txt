Response:
I will find the number of triangles in this graph by checking all possible triangles formed by the nodes. Let's proceed with the calculation.

Total number of triangles = []

1. Triangles involving Node 0:
   - <0, 4, 5>
   - <0, 4, 14>

2. Triangles involving Node 1:
   - <1, 4, 7>
   - <1, 6, 9>

3. Triangles involving Node 2:
   - <2, 7, 8>
   - <2, 7, 9>
   - <2, 8, 10>
   - <2, 9, 10>

4. Triangles involving Node 3:
   - <3, 9, 10>
   - <3, 9, 13>
   - <3, 10, 13>
   - <3, 11, 12>
   - <3, 12, 14>

5. Triangles involving Node 4:
   - <4, 6, 13>
   - <4, 5, 6>
   - <4, 5, 7>
   - <4, 6, 1>

6. Triangles involving Node 5:
   - <5, 7, 14>
   - <5, 10, 14>

7. Triangles involving Node 6:
   - <6, 13, 10>

8. Triangles involving Node 7:
   - <7, 8, 12>

9. Triangles involving Node 9:
   - <9, 13, 14>

10. Triangles involving Node 10:
    - <10, 11, 13>

Total number of triangles = [0]
