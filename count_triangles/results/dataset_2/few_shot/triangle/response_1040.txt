Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be calculated by finding the number of triangles formed by each node. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's calculate this step by step.

For each node, we will check if there are any pairs of nodes connected to the current node that are also connected to each other. If such pairs are found, a triangle is formed.

Let's begin calculating the number of triangles:

1. Node 0: Possible triangles: <0, 15, 8>, <0, 15, 12>, <0, 8, 12>
2. Node 1: No triangles can be formed.
3. Node 2: No triangles can be formed.
4. Node 3: Possible triangles: <3, 7, 27>, <3, 18, 27>
5. Node 4: No triangles can be formed.
6. Node 5: No triangles can be formed.
7. Node 6: Possible triangles: <6, 20, 21>, <6, 20, 22>, <6, 21, 22>
8. Node 7: No triangles can be formed.
9. Node 8: No triangles can be formed.
10. Node 9: No triangles can be formed.
11. Node 10: No triangles can be formed.
12. Node 11: No triangles can be formed.
13. Node 12: No triangles can be formed.
14. Node 13: No triangles can be formed.
15. Node 14: No triangles can be formed.
16. Node 15: No triangles can be formed.
17. Node 16: No triangles can be formed.
18. Node 17: No triangles can be formed.
19. Node 18: Possible triangles: <18, 21, 24>, <18, 19, 24>
20. Node 19: No triangles can be formed.
21. Node 20: No triangles can be formed.
22. Node 21: No triangles can be formed.
23. Node 22: Possible triangles: <22, 15, 20>, <22, 20, 27>, <22, 15, 27>
24. Node 23: No triangles can be formed.
25. Node 24: No triangles can be formed.
26. Node 25: No triangles can be formed.
27. Node 26: No triangles can be formed.
28. Node 27: No triangles can be formed.
29. Node 28: No triangles can be formed.
30. Node 29: Possible triangles: <29, 6, 26>, <29, 6, 14>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. The unique triangles found are: <0, 15, 8>, <0, 15, 12>, <0, 8, 12>, <3, 7, 27>, <3, 18, 27>, <6, 20, 21>, <6, 20, 22>, <6, 21, 22>, <18, 21, 24>, <18, 19, 24>, <22, 15, 20>, <22, 20, 27>, <22, 15, 27>, <29, 6, 26>, <29, 6, 14>.
