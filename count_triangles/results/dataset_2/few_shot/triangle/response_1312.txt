Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
There are a total of 16 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are:
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 2, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 6, 1>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<7, 8, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
