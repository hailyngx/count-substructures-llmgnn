Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:
1. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. 
2. We will check each group of 3 connected nodes to see if they form a triangle.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 8, 9>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
