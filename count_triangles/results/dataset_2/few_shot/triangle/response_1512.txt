Response:
Following the given information, we will count the number of triangles in the provided graph.

Let's denote a triangle as a set of three connected nodes forming a closed loop. 

First, we will find all unique triangles in the graph:
1. <4, 1, 7>
2. <4, 1, 16>
3. <4, 11, 7>
4. <4, 11, 15>
5. <4, 15, 6>
6. <4, 15, 2>
7. <6, 5, 17>
8. <6, 13, 9>
9. <6, 18, 8>
10. <15, 2, 10>
11. <15, 2, 1>
12. <17, 5, 11>
13. <17, 5, 19>
14. <17, 11, 12>
15. <17, 11, 4>
16. <17, 11, 3>
17. <17, 12, 18>
18. <17, 12, 19>
19. <19, 3, 13>
20. <19, 3, 11>
21. <19, 3, 8>
22. <19, 8, 18>
23. <19, 8, 14>
24. <19, 8, 17>
25. <0, 16, 1>

Now, we will count the total number of unique triangles found: [25]
