Response:
There are a total of 16 triangles in the graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<8, 13, 17>
<4, 9, 11>
<2, 8, 19>
<1, 6, 7>
<7, 12, 17>
<2, 15, 19>
<2, 16, 14>
<4, 3, 6>
<9, 10, 5>
<13, 11, 18>
<0, 14, 16>
<13, 12, 7>
<1, 14, 15>
<8, 6, 1>
<9, 16, 2>
<17, 7, 2> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [16].
