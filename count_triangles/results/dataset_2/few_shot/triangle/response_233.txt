Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the number of triangles it contains.

Given that there are 30 nodes and 90 edges, we first need to verify the basic definition of a triangle in a graph. In a triangle, there are three nodes connected by edges forming a closed loop.

To find triangles in the graph, we can utilize the given connectivity information among the nodes and edges specified.

After analyzing the given information, the total number of triangles in the graph is [104].

Here are some of the unique triangles found in the graph:
<10, 22, 25>
<4, 9, 21>
<5, 21, 27>
<12, 14, 1>
<26, 25, 27>
<13, 2, 15>
<17, 22, 18>
<6, 12, 9>
<0, 23, 24>
<11, 26, 27>
<19, 17, 22>
<1, 7, 25>
<3, 15, 2>
<5, 7, 12>
<7, 12, 21>
<8, 9, 28>
<16, 10, 25>
<20, 19, 23>
<21, 12, 22>
<9, 3, 4>
<10, 16, 29>
<18, 28, 17>

Please note that these are just a few examples of the triangles present in the graph, and there are more triangles within the graph structure.
