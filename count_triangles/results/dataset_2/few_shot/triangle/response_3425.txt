Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

The triangles in this graph are formed by three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

From the given information, we can see that the triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 4, 10>
2. <0, 4, 12>
3. <0, 4, 1>
4. <0, 8, 14>
5. <1, 4, 13>
6. <1, 4, 14>
7. <1, 13, 14>
8. <3, 6, 11>
9. <3, 11, 14>
10. <4, 10, 13>
11. <4, 10, 5>
12. <5, 10, 13>
13. <5, 13, 14>
14. <10, 13, 14>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
