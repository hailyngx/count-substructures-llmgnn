Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. 
A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other directly. Let's list the triangles found in the graph:

1. <1, 6, 9>
2. <1, 2, 7>
3. <0, 1, 6>
4. <0, 1, 3>
5. <0, 2, 5>
6. <3, 7, 8>

Now, we need to count the total number of triangles in the graph. 
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the provided graph is [6].
