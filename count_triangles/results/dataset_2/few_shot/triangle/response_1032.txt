Response:
Following a step-by-step process to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Identify triangles using the adjacency list of each node:
   
   - <13, 16, 22>
   - <15, 28, 29>
   - <26, 8, 2>
   - <26, 9, 19>
   - <26, 5, 17>
   - <9, 14, 23>
   - <0, 7, 24>
   - <10, 18, 29>
   - <25, 6, 12>
   - <11, 20, 4>
   - <1, 17, 21>
  
2. Count the total number of triangles found in the graph:
   
   Total number of triangles: [10]
