Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3)
