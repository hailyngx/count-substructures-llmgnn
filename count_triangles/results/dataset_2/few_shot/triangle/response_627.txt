Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 0
