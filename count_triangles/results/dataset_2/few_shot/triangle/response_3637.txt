Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8)
