I will calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Based on the provided adjacency list, we can identify the following triangles:
- <0, 5, 20>
- <0, 5, 23>
- <0, 14, 23>
- <1, 7, 25>
- <1, 7, 28>
- <1, 25, 28>
- <2, 13, 19>
- <2, 13, 21>
- <2, 13, 28>
- <2, 21, 28>
- <5, 6, 18>
- <5, 6, 19>
- <5, 18, 22>
- <5, 18, 25>
- <5, 19, 28>
- <6, 18, 22>
- <6, 18, 25>
- <7, 18, 25>
