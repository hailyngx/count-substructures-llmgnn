Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

First, let's identify the triangles by checking for nodes that form triangles together:
- Looking at the connections, we can see that <5, 9, 6> form a triangle since 5 is connected to 9, 9 is connected to 6, and 6 is connected to 5.
- Similarly, <1, 6, 8> form a triangle.
- Finally, <0, 8, 7> form a triangle as well.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
