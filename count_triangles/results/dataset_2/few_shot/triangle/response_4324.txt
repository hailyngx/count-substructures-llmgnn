Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

1. Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 4: <0, 2, 4>
2. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 8: <2, 6, 8>
3. Node 3 forms a triangle with nodes 7 and 9: <3, 7, 9>
4. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 8: <4, 6, 8>
5. Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 8 and 9: <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
