Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible triangles formed by the nodes and checking if there are edges connecting all three nodes of each possible triangle.

By examining the graph provided, we can list the unique triangles:

<0, 2, 1>
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 2, 10>
<0, 13, 5>
<0, 13, 18>
<0, 1, 18>
<0, 10, 15>
<2, 6, 1>
<2, 6, 17>
<2, 6, 0>
<2, 1, 18>
<2, 0, 13>
<3, 11, 19>
<3, 11, 5>
<3, 11, 7>
<3, 11, 15>
<3, 5, 13>
<3, 5, 15>
<3, 7, 15>
<3, 19, 10>
<5, 13, 18>
<5, 13, 12>
<5, 13, 0>
<5, 15, 7>
<5, 15, 10>
