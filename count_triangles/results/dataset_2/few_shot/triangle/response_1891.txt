Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. First, let's write down all possible triangles based on the given edges:
   - Possible triangles involving node 0: <0, 6, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 9>
   - Possible triangles involving node 1: <1, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 2>, <1, 3, 4>
   - Possible triangles involving node 2: <2, 9, 8>, <2, 9, 3>, <2, 9, 1>, <2, 3, 8>
   - Possible triangles involving node 3: <3, 9, 8>, <3, 9, 1>, <3, 9, 0>, <3, 9, 2>, <3, 1, 2>
   - Possible triangles involving node 4: <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 9, 0>, <4, 9, 1>
   - Possible triangles involving node 5: <5, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 0>, <5, 7, 8>
   - Possible triangles involving node 6: <6, 9, 0>, <6, 9, 4>, <6, 9, 5>
   - Possible triangles involving node 7: No triangles possible
   - Possible triangles involving node 8: <8, 9, 3>, <8, 9, 2>, <8, 9, 5>, <8, 3, 2>
   - Possible triangles involving node 9: <9, 6, 4>, <9, 6, 0>, <9, 6, 5>, <9, 3, 3>, <9, 3, 2>, <9, 3, 8>

2. After listing all possible triangles, we can see that the unique triangles are: 
   - <0, 6, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 2>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 9, 8>, <2, 9, 3>, <2, 9, 1>, <2, 3, 8>, <3, 9, 8>, <3, 9, 1>, <3, 9, 0>, <3, 9, 2>, <3, 1, 2>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 9, 0>, <4, 9, 1>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 0>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 9, 0>, <6, 9, 4>, <6, 9, 5>, <8, 9, 3>, <8, 9, 2>, <8, 9, 5>, <8, 3, 2>, <9, 6, 4>, <9, 6, 0>, <9, 6, 5>, <9, 3, 3>, <9, 3, 2>, <9, 3, 8>

3. Finally, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [34].
