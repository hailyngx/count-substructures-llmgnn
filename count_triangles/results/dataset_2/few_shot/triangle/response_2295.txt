Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 2, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph using the provided information.

A triangle is a set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. In this graph, triangles can be found by looking for sets of three nodes that are all mutually connected.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can see the following triangles:
- Triangle 1: <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle 2: <1, 2, 9>
- Triangle 3: <5, 2, 6>
- Triangle 4: <5, 3, 9>
- Triangle 5: <7, 1, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
