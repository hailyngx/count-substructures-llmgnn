Response:
In order to count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected. We can do this by examining each node and its neighbors to see if there is a triangle formed by those connections. 

After analyzing the graph, we find the following triangles:
1. <2, 6, 15>
2. <2, 13, 17>
3. <2, 6, 12>
4. <2, 13, 18>
5. <3, 6, 15>
6. <3, 0, 17>
7. <3, 0, 19>
8. <6, 12, 10>
9. <6, 12, 5>
10. <6, 9, 13>
11. <9, 13, 18>
12. <15, 17, 19>

So, there are a total of 12 triangles in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [12].
