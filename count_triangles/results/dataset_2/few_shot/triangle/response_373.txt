Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1
