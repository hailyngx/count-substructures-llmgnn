Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
[<0, 3, 8>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 8, 2>, <1, 3, 8>, <4, 2, 7>, <5, 6, 7>]
