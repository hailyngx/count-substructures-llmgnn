Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. By observing the given graph, we can see that a triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by edges to each other.

2. Since we already have the adjacency list, we can find triangles by checking for nodes that are connected to each other.

3. Let's list down the triangles we find:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 4, 8>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 2, 8>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 2, 6>
   - Triangle 4: <0, 3, 6>
   - Triangle 5: <0, 3, 4>
   - Triangle 6: <0, 3, 7>
   - Triangle 7: <4, 6, 7>
   - Triangle 8: <2, 6, 7>
   - Triangle 9: <2, 7, 8>

4. Counting each unique triangle once, there are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
