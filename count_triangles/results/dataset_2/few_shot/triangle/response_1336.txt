Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. To count the number of triangles in this graph, we can follow these steps:

1. For each node, check all possible pairs of connected nodes to see if there's a third node that completes a triangle.
2. Record the unique triangles found.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<4, 7, 12>
<4, 13, 14>
<5, 3, 16>
<6, 8, 14>
<9, 12, 13>
<10, 11, 18>
<10, 7, 18>
<11, 2, 6>
<12, 6, 13>
<13, 14, 15>
<17, 3, 8>
<17, 8, 14>
<18, 7, 11>
<18, 11, 19>
<18, 7, 19>

There are a total of [15] triangles in the given graph.
