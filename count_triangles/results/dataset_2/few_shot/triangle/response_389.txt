Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 9, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
The adjacency list shows how the nodes are connected in the graph. To find the number of triangles in the graph, we can explore all the possible triangles using the given edges and nodes. Triangles are formed by connecting three nodes with edges to create a closed loop.

After examining the graph and considering the adjacency list, the unique triangles in the given graph are:

<2, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 8>

Hence, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
