Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Determine the number of triangles formed by each node:
- Node 0: <0, 6, 3>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 7, 5>
- Node 1: <1, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 9, 7>
- Node 2: <2, 1, 3>
- Node 3: <3, 0, 4>, <3, 2, 5>
- Node 4: <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 2>, <4, 6, 5>, <4, 9, 5>, <4, 3, 5>
- Node 5: <5, 3, 4>, <5, 0, 7>, <5, 7, 1>
- Node 6: <6, 1, 7>, <6, 1, 4>, <6, 4, 9>, <6, 0, 7>
- Node 7: <7, 6, 9>, <7, 6, 1>, <7, 6, 0>, <7, 5, 1>
- Node 8: No triangles
- Node 9: <9, 8, 5>, <9, 8, 4>, <9, 4, 6>, <9, 4, 7>

2. Calculate the total number of triangles:
   Total = 4 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 2) + 2 (from node 3) + 5 (from node 4) + 3 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 7) + 4 (from node 9) = 27

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [27].
