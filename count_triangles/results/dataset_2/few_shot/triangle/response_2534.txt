Response:
There are 15 nodes and 60 edges in the given graph. To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes. 

After analyzing the provided adjacency list, the triangles in the graph are as follows:

1. <5, 6, 7>
2. <9, 1, 10>
3. <4, 5, 7>
4. <4, 5, 6>
5. <4, 5, 9>
6. <0, 2, 14>
7. <0, 2, 11>
8. <0, 11, 14>
9. <3, 0, 4>
10. <3, 1, 9>
11. <2, 9, 13>
12. <7, 9, 13>
13. <7, 4, 5>
14. <6, 5, 9>
15. <6, 4, 7>
16. <6, 12, 13>
17. <12, 3, 4>
18. <12, 3, 0>
19. <12, 8, 11>
20. <13, 9, 7>
21. <13, 6, 12>
22. <14, 0, 2>
23. <2, 0, 11>

Hence, there are a total of [23] triangles in the given graph.
