Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle: <5, 9, 2>
2. Triangle: <5, 9, 1>
3. Triangle: <5, 9, 0>
4. Triangle: <5, 7, 4>
5. Triangle: <5, 7, 3>
6. Triangle: <5, 8, 4>
7. Triangle: <5, 8, 2>
8. Triangle: <9, 1, 2>
9. Triangle: <9, 1, 3>
10. Triangle: <9, 0, 3>
11. Triangle: <4, 7, 6>
12. Triangle: <4, 8, 6>
13. Triangle: <7, 3, 1>
14. Triangle: <8, 0, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
