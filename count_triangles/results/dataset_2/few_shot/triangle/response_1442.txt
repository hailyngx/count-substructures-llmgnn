Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 9, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 0

Response:
In order to find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for cycles of length 3. Let's first list out all the triangles and then count them.

The triangles in the graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 2>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 7, 4>
<1, 7, 2>
<1, 9, 0>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 5, 1>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 7, 4>
<5, 1, 7>

Counting the triangles found above, we get a total of [16 triangles].
