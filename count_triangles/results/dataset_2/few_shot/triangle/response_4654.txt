Response:
Based on the given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we can find the total number of triangles as follows:

- First, let's identify all the unique triangles in the graph:
    - <0, 1, 3>
    - <0, 1, 4>
    - <0, 1, 9>
    - <0, 3, 6>
    - <0, 3, 12>
    - <0, 3, 13>
    - <0, 4, 14>
    - <0, 8, 12>
    - <0, 8, 13>
    - <1, 3, 12>
    - <1, 4, 11>
    - <1, 4, 13>
    - <1, 9, 11>
    - <1, 9, 14>
    - <3, 6, 12>
    - <3, 12, 8>
    - <4, 11, 13>
    - <4, 13, 14>
    - <7, 10, 12>
    - <7, 10, 13>
    - <7, 12, 6>
    - <7, 12, 14>
    - <7, 13, 14>
    - <8, 12, 6>
    - <8, 12, 14>
    - <9, 11, 13>
    - <9, 14, 7>
    - <11, 13, 7>
    - <12, 6, 14>

- There are 27 unique triangles in total. Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [27].
