Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 5, 9, and node 0

Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 9, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will follow the steps below:

1. Identify all possible triangles by checking each combination of three nodes and verifying if there is an edge between each pair of nodes in the trio.

2. List the unique triangles found and count them.

After evaluating the graph, the total number of triangles and the unique triangles found are as follows:

Total number of triangles: [12]
Unique triangles:
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
