Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step.

1. By looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes have the following connections:

- Node 0: 7, 1, 6, 9, 8
- Node 1: 7, 5, 9, 0
- Node 2: 4, 8
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 7, 6, 3, 2
- Node 5: 1, 6, 8
- Node 6: 4, 9, 5, 8, 0
- Node 7: 4, 0, 8, 9, 1
- Node 8: 7, 3, 6, 5, 0, 2
- Node 9: 7, 1, 6, 0

2. To find triangles, we need to look for nodes that have mutual connections. Let's list down the triangles:

- Triangles involving Node 0: <0, 7, 1>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 9, 7>, <0, 9, 1>
- Triangles involving Node 1: <1, 7, 9>, <1, 5, 6>
- Triangles involving Node 2: None
- Triangles involving Node 3: None
- Triangles involving Node 4: <4, 7, 6>, <4, 6, 9>
- Triangles involving Node 5: <5, 6, 8>
- Triangles involving Node 6: <6, 4, 9>
- Triangles involving Node 7: <7, 9, 1>
- Triangles involving Node 8: <8, 3, 6>, <8, 6, 5>, <8, 6, 0>, <8, 6, 7>
- Triangles involving Node 9: <9, 7, 1>

3. Counting the unique triangles found above, we have 15 triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
