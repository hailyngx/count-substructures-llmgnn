Response:
There are a total of 16 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are as follows: 
<0, 1, 14>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 13>, <1, 3, 14>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 3, 0>, <3, 14, 13>, <3, 14, 0>, <3, 13, 0>, <5, 2, 4>, <10, 8, 4>, <10, 8, 2>, <10, 4, 2>, <10, 13, 0>. 
So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 16. [16]
