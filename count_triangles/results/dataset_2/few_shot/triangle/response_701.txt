Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3)

Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Look for each node's neighbors and see if there are any triangles formed by those neighbors.

2. For each node, find all pairs of its neighbors and check if that pair has an edge connecting them. If it does, then the three nodes form a triangle.

3. Since we want to count each triangle only once, store the unique triangles found.

4. Finally, count the total number of unique triangles.

Let's go through the process step by step. 

The unique triangles found are: 

<2, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 1>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 8, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<6, 1, 4>
<0, 3, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
