Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Pick a node:
   - Start with Node 0: (0, 27), (0, 14), (0, 6) are the edges

2. Find the neighbors of Node 0:
   - Neighbors are: 27, 14, 6

3. Check for triangles involving Node 0:
   - (0, 27, 13), (0, 27, 13), (0, 13, 14) form a triangle

4. Repeat the above steps for all nodes and count the total number of triangles.

After counting, we find that the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].

Here are the unique triangles found:
<0, 13, 14>
<0, 13, 27>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 19>
<1, 4, 24>
<2, 4, 24>
<5, 16, 25>
<8, 20, 24>
<10, 23, 25>
<11, 15, 17>
