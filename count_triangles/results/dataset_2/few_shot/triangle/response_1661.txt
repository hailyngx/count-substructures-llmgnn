Response:
The graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other forming a triangle.

Let's count the number of triangles step-by-step:

1. For each node, we will check if there exist pairs of edges that form triangles.
2. We will look for triangles by examining each possible combination of three nodes.

Here are the triangles found: 
<5, 1, 15>
<5, 1, 13>
<5, 1, 3>
<5, 1, 15>
