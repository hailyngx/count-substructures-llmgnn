Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look at each possible triangle formed by three nodes and check if they form a complete triangle by verifying if there are edges between all three pairs of nodes.

Based on the given information, the triangles in this graph are:
<5, 0, 7>, <5, 2, 7>, <5, 2, 8>, <4, 1, 9>, <4, 1, 13>, <4, 7, 10>, <0, 3, 14>, <13, 1, 9>, <13, 6, 9>, <13, 6, 5>, <13, 8, 9>, <13, 10, 3>, <13, 10, 14>, <7, 2, 11>, <7, 10, 11>, <2, 8, 11>, <2, 8, 12>, and <3, 0, 14>.

There are a total of [18] triangles in the given graph.
