Response:
Let's start by finding the triangles in this graph step by step:

1. Any triangle must contain three nodes connected to each other. Let's start by finding all possible triangles based on the given edges and adjacency lists:

- For node 0:
  - Possible triangles involving node 0: <0, 3, 14>, <0, 4, 14>, <0, 7, 14>

- For node 1:
  - Possible triangles involving node 1: <1, 9, 13>, <1, 9, 14>, <1, 13, 14>

- For node 2:
  - Possible triangles involving node 2: <2, 3, 14>, <2, 9, 14>

- For node 3:
  - Possible triangles involving node 3: <0, 3, 13>, <3, 6, 12>

- For node 4:
  - Possible triangles involving node 4: <4, 8, 10>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 9, 14>

- For node 5:
  - Possible triangles involving node 5: <5, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 9>

- For node 6:
  - Possible triangles involving node 6: <6, 12, 14>, <6, 13, 14>

- For node 7:
  - Possible triangles involving node 7: <0, 5, 7>

- For node 8:
  - Possible triangles involving node 8: <4, 8, 10>, <1, 8, 9>

- For node 9:
  - Possible triangles involving node 9: <1, 9, 13>, <4, 8, 9>

- For node 10:
  - Possible triangles involving node 10: <4, 8, 10>, <10, 13, 4>

- For node 11:
  - No triangles can be formed with node 11 alone.

- For node 12:
  - Possible triangles involving node 12: <3, 6, 12>, <12, 14, 6>

- For node 13:
  - Possible triangles involving node 13: <1, 9, 13>, <3, 6, 13>, <4, 9, 13>

- For node 14:
  - Possible triangles involving node 14: <0, 3, 14>, <1, 14, 2>

2. By examining the possible triangles, we can see that the following triangles are unique triangles in this graph: 
   <0, 3, 14>, <0, 4, 14>, <0, 7, 14>, <1, 9, 13>, <1, 9, 14>, <1, 13, 14>, <2, 3, 14>, <3, 6, 12>, <4, 8, 10>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 9, 14>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 12, 14>, <6, 13, 14>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [14].
