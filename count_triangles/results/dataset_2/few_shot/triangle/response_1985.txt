Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated step-by-step as follows:

1. Identify triangles formed by each node:
    - Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 7 and 8.
    - Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 2 and 27.
    - Node 2 forms triangles with nodes 4, 14, and 20.
    - Node 3 does not form any triangles.
    - Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 19 and 23.
    - Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 8 and 16.
    - Node 6 does not form any triangles.
    - Node 7 forms a triangle with node 11.
    - Node 8 does not form any triangles.
    - Node 9 does not form any triangles.
    - Node 10 forms triangles with nodes 15 and 16.
    - Node 11 does not form any triangles.
    - Node 12 forms a triangle with node 22.
    - Node 13 does not form any triangles.
    - Node 14 does not form any triangles.
    - Node 15 forms a triangle with node 22.
    - Node 16 forms a triangle with node 14.
    - Node 17 does not form any triangles.
    - Node 18 does not form any triangles.
    - Node 19 does not form any triangles.
    - Node 20 does not form any triangles.
    - Node 21 does not form any triangles.
    - Node 22 does not form any triangles.
    - Node 23 does not form any triangles.
    - Node 24 does not form any triangles.
    - Node 25 does not form any triangles.
    - Node 26 does not form any triangles.
    - Node 27 does not form any triangles.
    - Node 28 does not form any triangles.
    - Node 29 does not form any triangles.

2. Count the total number of triangles:
    - There are 6 triangles in the graph: <0, 7, 8>, <1, 2, 27>, <2, 4, 14>, <5, 8, 16>, <10, 15, 16>, and <12, 16, 22>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
