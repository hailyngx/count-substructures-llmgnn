Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

A triangle in a graph occurs when three nodes are all connected to each other. A triangle is formed by three edges that connect the three nodes involved.

By examining the adjacency list, we can identify the unique triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 6>
4. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
5. Triangle <3, 6, 7>
6. Triangle <3, 6, 5>
7. Triangle <4, 1, 6>
8. Triangle <4, 1, 9>
9. Triangle <4, 2, 6>
10. Triangle <4, 5, 6>
11. Triangle <4, 7, 9>
12. Triangle <6, 0, 2>
13. Triangle <6, 0, 1>
14. Triangle <6, 1, 7>
15. Triangle <6, 1, 9>
16. Triangle <6, 2, 4>
17. Triangle <6, 3, 5>
18. Triangle <6, 3, 7>
19. Triangle <6, 3, 9>
20. Triangle <7, 3, 9>
21. Triangle <9, 1, 4>
22. Triangle <9, 3, 4>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [22].
