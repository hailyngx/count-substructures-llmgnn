Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2)

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

A triangle is formed when three nodes are all interconnected with each other. Since we have 10 nodes, let's check each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle.

Checking each triplet of nodes:
1. Nodes 0, 2, 3 form a triangle. <0, 2, 3>
2. Nodes 0, 3, 5 form a triangle. <0, 3, 5>
3. Nodes 0, 5, 8 form a triangle. <0, 5, 8>
4. Nodes 1, 3, 5 form a triangle. <1, 3, 5>
5. Nodes 2, 3, 8 form a triangle. <2, 3, 8>
6. Nodes 3, 4, 9 form a triangle. <3, 4, 9>
7. Nodes 4, 6, 7 form a triangle. <4, 6, 7>
8. Nodes 5, 6, 9 form a triangle. <5, 6, 9>
9. Nodes 5, 8, 9 form a triangle. <5, 8, 9>
10. Nodes 6, 7, 9 form a triangle. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
