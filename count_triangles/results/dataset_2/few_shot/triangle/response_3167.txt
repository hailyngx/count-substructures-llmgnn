Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique triangles formed by sets of 3 connected nodes. Let's identify the triangles based on the given information:

The triangles found in this graph are:
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 0>
<2, 5, 4>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 9, 5>
<2, 9, 6>
<2, 9, 7>
<2, 1, 6>
<2, 1, 2>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 0>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 8>

<7, 5, 9>
<7, 5, 0>
<7, 9, 0>
<9, 5, 0>
<9, 6, 5>
<9, 6, 4>

Total number of triangles: [24]
