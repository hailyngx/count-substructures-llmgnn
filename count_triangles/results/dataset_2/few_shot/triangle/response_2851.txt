Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 0
