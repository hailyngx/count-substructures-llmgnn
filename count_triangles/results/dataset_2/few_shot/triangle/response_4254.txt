Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node  
- Node 0: degree = 3
- Node 1: degree = 2
- Node 2: degree = 3
- Node 3: degree = 3
- Node 4: degree = 2
- Node 5: degree = 3
- Node 6: degree = 4
- Node 7: degree = 3
- Node 8: degree = 4
- Node 9: degree = 2
- Node 10: degree = 2
- Node 11: degree = 2
- Node 12: degree = 3
- Node 13: degree = 5
- Node 14: degree = 3
- Node 15: degree = 4
- Node 16: degree = 4
- Node 17: degree = 2
- Node 18: degree = 5
- Node 19: degree = 1

Step 2: Identify triangles  
- To form a triangle, we need 3 nodes connected to each other.  
- Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following triangles:  
    - <0, 8, 13>
    - <0, 13, 5>
    - <0, 13, 17>
    - <0, 14, 6>
    - <0, 14, 18>
    - <8, 3, 7>
    - <8, 3, 4>
    - <8, 11, 6>
    - <13, 5, 16>
    - <13, 5, 12>
    - <13, 15, 1>
    - <13, 15, 6>
    - <16, 5, 12>
    - <16, 5, 18>
    - <16, 10, 9>
    - <17, 13, 4>
    - <17, 13, 15>
    - <18, 1, 15>
    - <18, 1, 12>
    - <18, 16, 10>

Step 3: Count the total number of triangles  
- There are 19 unique triangles found from the graph.  
- Therefore, the total number of triangles is [19].
