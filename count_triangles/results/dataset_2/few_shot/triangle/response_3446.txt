Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0)
