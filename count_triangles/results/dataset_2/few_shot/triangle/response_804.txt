Response:
We can count the number of triangles by examining each group of three nodes. A triangle is formed if each of the three nodes is connected to the other two. Let's list the unique triangles and then count the total number of triangles.

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 9, 15>
<0, 9, 18>
<0, 15, 18>
<1, 9, 15>
<4, 9, 12>
<4, 9, 19>
<5, 13, 17>
<6, 7, 13>
<7, 10, 18>
<9, 10, 12>
<9, 10, 18>

Total number of triangles: [12]
