Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by examining all possible triangles formed by the nodes and edges.

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
<0, 5, 10>
<0, 5, 13>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 10, 13>
<0, 10, 5>
<0, 13, 2>
<2, 7, 1>
<2, 7, 13>
<2, 13, 0>
<3, 6, 12>
<4, 8, 5>
<4, 8, 10>
<4, 8, 11>
<4, 9, 14>
<4, 9, 12>
<5, 8, 10>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 4>
<5, 9, 7>
<5, 9, 12>
<6, 10, 13>
<6, 10, 14>
<6, 12, 9>
<6, 12, 14>
<7, 1, 13>
<7, 5, 9>
<7, 5, 0>
<7, 9, 12>
<8, 10, 11>
<8, 10, 5>
<8, 11, 4>
<9, 12, 6>
<10, 13, 2>
<10, 13, 1>
<10, 11, 8>
<12, 9, 14>
<12, 14, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [37].
