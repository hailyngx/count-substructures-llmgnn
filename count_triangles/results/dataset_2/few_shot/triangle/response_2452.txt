Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by determining the number of triangles each node is involved in.

Analyzing each node individually:
- Node 0: <0, 8, 9>
- Node 1: <1, 0, 5> and <1, 2, 5>
- Node 2: <2, 1, 5>
- Node 3: <3, 1, 4>
- Node 4: <4, 3, 6> and <4, 5, 7>
- Node 5: <5, 7, 9> and <5, 1, 9>
- Node 6: <6, 4, 3>
- Node 7: <7, 0, 5>
- Node 8: <8, 0, 9>
- Node 9: <9, 0, 8>

Total unique triangles found: <0, 8, 9>, <1, 0, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <3, 1, 4>, <4, 3, 6>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
