Response:
By looking at the given graph and the adjacency list provided, we need to count the number of triangles.

Let's calculate it step by step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 18, 4, 15, and 19. Nodes 4 and 15 are connected along with nodes 0, forming the triangle <0, 4, 15>.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 18, 8, and 1. Nodes 18 and 1 are connected along with node 2, forming the triangle <2, 18, 1>.
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 13, and 0. Nodes 8 and 0 are connected along with node 4, forming the triangle <4, 8, 0>.
4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 11, 14, and 1. No additional triangle is formed here.
5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 18, 4, and 12. No additional triangle is formed here.
6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 18, 1, and 19. No additional triangle is formed here.
7. Node 10 is connected to nodes 17, 15, 3, and 16. No additional triangle is formed here.
8. Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 12, 16, and 14. No additional triangle is formed here.
9. Node 14 is connected to nodes 7 and 13. No additional triangle is formed here.
10. Node 15 is connected to nodes 10, 4, and 0. No additional triangle is formed here.
11. Node 16 is connected to nodes 10 and 13. No additional triangle is formed here.
12. Node 17 is connected to nodes 10 and 11. No additional triangle is formed here.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3] with unique triangles being <0, 4, 15>, <2, 18, 1>, and <4, 8, 0>.
