Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. First, let's identify the triangles in the graph by finding the nodes that form triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

2. Now, let's go through all the nodes in the graph and check for triangles formed by each node.

3. By looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the triangles formed by each node.

List of triangles:
<0, 20, 26>
<0, 20, 9>
<0, 20, 21>
<0, 20, 22>
<0, 20, 25>
<0, 20, 26>
<0, 22, 5>
<0, 22, 16>
<0, 22, 5>
<1, 21, 13>
<3, 26, 29>
<4, 9, 11>
<4, 9, 20>
<5, 10, 17>
<5, 10, 22>
<5, 15, 17>
<5, 15, 11>
<6, 12, 7>
<8, 17, 27>
<8, 17, 5>
<9, 20, 26>
<13, 21, 12>

4. Counting the total number of unique triangles, we find there are 21 unique triangles in the given graph.

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [21].
