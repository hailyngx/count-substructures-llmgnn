Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for cycles of length 3 (triangles). Here is the step-by-step process to find the total number of triangles in the graph:

1. Identify triangles by examining each set of three connected nodes:
   - Look at each node and its neighbors to see if there are any triangles.

2. Calculate the total number of triangles:
   - List all unique triangles found.

After examining all sets of three connected nodes in the graph, the total number of triangles found in the given graph is [11]. The unique triangles found are:
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 10>
<3, 9, 12>
<3, 9, 10>
<3, 6, 2>
<3, 6, 5>
<5, 4, 10>
<5, 4, 7>
<5, 4, 10>
<6, 0, 7>
<9, 7, 12>
