Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2)

Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to check for each set of three nodes whether they form a triangle (i.e., each node is connected to the other two).

Let's identify the unique triangles in the graph by examining the nodes and their connections:

1. Triangle <6, 0, 5>
2. Triangle <6, 0, 2>
3. Triangle <6, 0, 8>
4. Triangle <6, 2, 8>
5. Triangle <6, 5, 8>
6. Triangle <6, 5, 7>
7. Triangle <6, 2, 7>
8. Triangle <0, 3, 9>
9. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
10. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
11. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
12. Triangle <0, 9, 7>
13. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
14. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
15. Triangle <3, 7, 9>
16. Triangle <8, 1, 7>
17. Triangle <8, 5, 7>
18. Triangle <8, 2, 7>
19. Triangle <8, 2, 4>

Count of triangles: [19]
