Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go ahead and find the triangles step-by-step:

1. Nodes that are part of triangles:
- (0, 2, 8)
- (0, 2, 1)
- (0, 4, 11)
- (0, 4, 10)
- (1, 2, 7)
- (1, 2, 6)
- (1, 5, 15)
- (1, 5, 18)
- (1, 6, 13)
- (1, 13, 10)
- (2, 7, 8)
- (4, 10, 13)
- (5, 15, 17)
- (5, 18, 14)
- (7, 10, 13)
- (9, 12, 17)
- (9, 15, 17)
- (10, 13, 14)
- (10, 14, 18)
- (15, 17, 19)

2. Count of triangles found: 20

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20]. The unique triangles found are as follows:
<0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 4, 11>, <0, 4, 10>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 5, 15>, <1, 5, 18>, <1, 6, 13>, <1, 13, 10>, <2, 7, 8>, <4, 10, 13>, <5, 15, 17>, <5, 18, 14>, <7, 10, 13>, <9, 12, 17>, <9, 15, 17>, <10, 13, 14>, <10, 14, 18>, <15, 17, 19>.
