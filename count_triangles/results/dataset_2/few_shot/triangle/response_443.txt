Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 9, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 2

Response:
First, let's analyze the graph to find all the triangles within it. 
A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. 
Let's find all such triangles. 

The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 1>, <3, 5, 1>, <3, 5, 2>, <7, 8, 1>, <7, 8, 6>, <9, 4, 7>, <9, 1, 6>, <9, 1, 7>, <9, 2, 6>

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in total in this graph. 
So, the total number of triangles is [13].
