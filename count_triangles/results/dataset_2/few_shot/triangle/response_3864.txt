Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other.

Given the information provided, we can see that there are 8 unique triangles in the graph:
- <0, 8, 4>
- <0, 8, 6>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 2>
- <5, 1, 2>
- <5, 1, 7>
- <5, 7, 9>
- <9, 2, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
