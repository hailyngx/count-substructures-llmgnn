Response:
In this graph, a triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other directly. 

Let's break down the calculation step-by-step:

1. Count the triangles formed by each node:
- Node 0: <0, 4, 27> and <0, 1, 28>
- Node 1: <1, 7, 28>
- Node 2: No triangles
- Node 3: <3, 12, 22> and <3, 18, 27>
- Node 4: No triangles
- Node 5: <5, 9, 10> and <5, 17, 26>
- Node 6: No triangles
- Node 7: No triangles
- Node 8: No triangles
- Node 9: No triangles
- Node 10: No triangles
- Node 11: No triangles
- Node 12: No triangles
- Node 13: No triangles
- Node 14: No triangles
- Node 15: No triangles
- Node 16: No triangles
- Node 17: No triangles
- Node 18: <18, 21, 25> and <18, 25, 3>
- Node 19: No triangles
- Node 20: No triangles
- Node 21: No triangles
- Node 22: <22, 26, 27> and <22, 3, 19>
- Node 23: No triangles
- Node 24: No triangles
- Node 25: No triangles
- Node 26: No triangles
- Node 27: No triangles
- Node 28: No triangles
- Node 29: No triangles

2. Calculate the total number of triangles:
Total number of triangles = 2

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
