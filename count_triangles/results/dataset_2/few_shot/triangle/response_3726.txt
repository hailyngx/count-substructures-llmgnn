Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of triangles formed by each triplet of nodes.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph: 
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 3, 1>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 6, 2>
<1, 7, 5>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 1>
<3, 4, 5>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 1>
<5, 7, 4>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 9, 8>
<6, 9, 7>
<6, 7, 5>
<7, 9, 1>
<7, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [23].
