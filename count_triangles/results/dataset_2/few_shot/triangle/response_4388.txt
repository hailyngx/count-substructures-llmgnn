Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. Check each possible triangle combination based on the adjacency list:
- Triangle 1: Nodes (0, 1, 5) form a triangle.
- Triangle 2: Nodes (3, 9, 10) form a triangle.
- Triangle 3: Nodes (7, 11, 14) form a triangle.
- Triangle 4: Nodes (12, 13, 4) form a triangle.

Thus, there are four unique triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4]. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 5>, <3, 9, 10>, <7, 11, 14>, and <12, 13, 4>.
