Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

First, let's identify the triangles:
- <0, 8, 12>
- <0, 8, 15>
- <0, 1, 12>
- <0, 1, 15>
- <8, 12, 16>
- <8, 12, 18>
- <8, 7, 9>
- <8, 7, 13>
- <12, 3, 18>
- <12, 8, 18>
- <12, 16, 5>
- <1, 9, 7>
- <1, 9, 16>
- <1, 17, 2>
- <16, 2, 17>
- <16, 2, 5>
- <16, 9, 11>
- <5, 2, 17>
- <5, 2, 16>
- <5, 8, 7>
- <5, 8, 15>
- <18, 3, 11>
- <18, 3, 15>
- <18, 11, 4>

The total number of triangles in the graph is 23, which is enclosed in brackets as follows: [23].
