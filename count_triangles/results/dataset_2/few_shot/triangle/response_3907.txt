Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 7
