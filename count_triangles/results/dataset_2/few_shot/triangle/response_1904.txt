Response:
Let's go step-by-step to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. First, let's identify all the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. 

2. Let's list all the unique triangles found in the graph:
   - <3, 5, 9>
   - <1, 8, 10>
   - <4, 6, 0>
   - <0, 14, 4>

3. Since each unique triangle has been listed only once, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 4. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
