Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

A triangle in a graph is a set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. To find the total number of triangles, we can look for all possible combinations of three nodes that form a triangle based on the given edges and adjacency list.

After analyzing the graph, we find the following unique triangles:
<7, 14, 21>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 29>
<3, 4, 18>
<3, 9, 22>
<3, 9, 5>
<3, 18, 29>
<3, 18, 5>
<0, 10, 22>
<0, 10, 28>
<0, 1, 25>
<2, 9, 22>
<2, 9, 5>
<2, 0, 10>
<2, 0, 5>
<5, 25, 28>
<5, 22, 28>
<5, 18, 29>
<4, 11, 29>
<4, 20, 24>
<13, 1, 15>
<7, 21, 17>
<7, 24, 19>
<8, 20, 24>
<27, 16, 26>

Counting the unique triangles, we have found 25 triangles. So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [25].
