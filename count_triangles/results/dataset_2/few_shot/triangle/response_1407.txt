Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 9, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by counting the triangles formed by each node individually.

1. Node 0: No triangles can be formed by Node 0 as it only has 3 neighbors.

2. Node 1: The neighbors of Node 1 are {4, 7, 3, 5, 9}. Triangles formed by Node 1 are: <1, 4, 7>, <1, 3, 5>, and <1, 3, 9>.

3. Node 2: The neighbors of Node 2 are {4, 5, 0, 9}. Triangle formed by Node 2 is: <2, 4, 5>.

4. Node 3: The neighbors of Node 3 are {7, 1, 9, 8}. Triangle formed by Node 3 is: <1, 3, 9>.

5. Node 4: No triangles can be formed by Node 4 as it only has 2 neighbors.

6. Node 5: The neighbors of Node 5 are {7, 1, 8, 6, 2}. Triangle formed by Node 5 is: <1, 5, 8>.

7. Node 6: No triangles can be formed by Node 6 as it only has 3 neighbors.

8. Node 7: The neighbors of Node 7 are {3, 9, 5, 1}. Triangle formed by Node 7 is: <1, 7, 3>.

9. Node 8: No triangles can be formed by Node 8 as it only has 4 neighbors.

10. Node 9: The neighbors of Node 9 are {7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 0}. Triangles formed by Node 9 are: <1, 9, 7> and <1, 9, 3>.

Now, summing up all the unique triangles found, we have a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
