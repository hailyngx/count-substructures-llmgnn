Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 11) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (12, 4) (12, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 11, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 11, and node 13
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 12, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 7, and node 11
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 14, 11, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 12, 0, 10, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 11
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 7, 11, and node 13
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 10, 0, 5, 8, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 9, 10, 2, 0, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 6, and node 13

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the graph. Here they are listed in the format <node1, node2, node3>:

<0, 1, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 13, 14>
<5, 6, 11>
<6, 11, 13>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
