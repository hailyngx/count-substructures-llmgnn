Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3)
