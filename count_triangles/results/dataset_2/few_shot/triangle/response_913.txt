Response:
The first step is to check all possible triangles in the graph. 
By observing the adjacency list and the given edges, we identify the following triangles:

1. <2, 8, 12>
2. <2, 8, 14>
3. <3, 14, 8>
4. <4, 6, 5>
5. <4, 6, 8>
6. <4, 6, 0>
7. <4, 2, 8>
8. <4, 2, 12>
9. <4, 2, 3>
10. <4, 13, 14>
11. <4, 9, 12>
12. <5, 6, 8>
13. <5, 6, 12>
14. <5, 8, 12>
15. <8, 12, 5>
16. <8, 12, 14>
17. <9, 10, 14>
18. <9, 12, 4>
19. <9, 12, 14>
20. <10, 11, 7>
21. <11, 0, 6>
22. <11, 7, 10>
23. <11, 7, 14>
24. <11, 13, 14>
25. <12, 1, 4>
26. <12, 1, 9>
27. <13, 11, 14>

Therefore, there are 27 unique triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles is [27].
