Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, and node 2

Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. To find a triangle, we need to look for nodes that are connected to each other forming a closed loop of three edges.
   
2. We can check each node's connections to see if we can form triangles. 

Following are the triangles found in the graph:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 6>
<5, 8, 3>
<6, 8, 5>
<6, 1, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of unique triangles found and output it:
Total number of triangles: [14]
