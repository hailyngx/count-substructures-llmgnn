Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Start by checking each possible triangle formed by three nodes.
2. Look for triangles where each node is connected to the other two nodes in the triangle.
3. Count each unique triangle only once.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 6, 9>
2. <0, 6, 4>
3. <0, 9, 14>
4. <1, 3, 14>
5. <1, 3, 13>
6. <1, 14, 13>
7. <2, 3, 5>
8. <2, 3, 10>
9. <2, 5, 17>
10. <2, 5, 18>
11. <3, 5, 17>
12. <3, 5, 18>
13. <6, 9, 14>
14. <6, 10, 3>
15. <8, 12, 17>
16. <8, 12, 19>
17. <8, 17, 15>
18. <8, 18, 5>
19. <8, 18, 16>
20. <9, 14, 13>
21. <12, 17, 15>
22. <13, 14, 1>
23. <13, 14, 7>
24. <13, 7, 2>
25. <17, 12, 19>
26. <17, 12, 8>
27. <17, 15, 18>
28. <17, 15, 18>

Hence, there are [28] triangles in the given graph.
