Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 0
