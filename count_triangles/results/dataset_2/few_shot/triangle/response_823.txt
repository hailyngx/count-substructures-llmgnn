Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. First, we identify potential triangles by looking for nodes that have connections in a way that they could form a triangle.

2. Next, we validate each potential triangle to ensure all three connections exist between the nodes.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

<2, 7, 19>
<2, 13, 16>
<2, 7, 18>
<2, 13, 7>
<0, 4, 17>
<0, 11, 12>
<0, 11, 14>
<0, 11, 19>
<0, 17, 19>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 3, 8>
<8, 5, 9>
<8, 9, 18>
<11, 12, 19>
<11, 14, 16>
<2, 7, 19>
<2, 13, 16>
<2, 13, 7>
<0, 4, 17>
<0, 11, 12>
<0, 11, 14>
<0, 11, 19>
<0, 17, 19>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 3, 8>
<8, 5, 9>
<8, 9, 18>
<11, 12, 19>
<11, 14, 16>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [28].
