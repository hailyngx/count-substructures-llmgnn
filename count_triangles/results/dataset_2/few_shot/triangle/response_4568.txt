Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify all the triangles in the graph by checking all possible combinations of 3 nodes that are interconnected.

2. Nodes forming triangles: (1, 2, 4), (1, 10, 17), (1, 10, 14), (1, 13, 14), (1, 14, 18), (1, 17, 18), (2, 8, 12), (2, 8, 15), (2, 8, 16), (2, 12, 16), (2, 14, 18), (3, 7, 14), (3, 7, 19), (3, 14, 19), (4, 6, 11), (4, 6, 13), (4, 6, 7), (4, 11, 13), (6, 7, 11), (13, 14, 16), (13, 16, 18), (16, 18, 19)

3. Count the total number of unique triangles: [22]

4. List of unique triangles found:
