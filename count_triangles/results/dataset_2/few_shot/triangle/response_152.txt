Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's follow these steps:

1. Identify triangles by examining each possible set of three connected nodes.
2. List the unique triangles found.
3. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, and the adjacency list provided, the triangles in this graph are as follows:

Unique triangles:  
<0, 3, 5>  
<0, 3, 6>  
<0, 5, 7>  
<0, 6, 7>  
<1, 4, 3>  

Total number of triangles: [5]
