Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for closed loops of three nodes connected by edges. Since counting all triangles one by one might be cumbersome, we can use the adjacency list provided to simplify the process.

Given the adjacency list, we can identify the triangles by examining common neighbors of nodes in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 8, 3, 1, and 2.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 8, 0, and 2.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 3, 0, and 1.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 0, and 2.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 1, and 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9 and 1.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 2.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 9 and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 0, 7, and 1.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 2, 3, 1, and 7.

Let's count the triangles based on the adjacency list provided.
