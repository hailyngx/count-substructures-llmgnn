Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
There are <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, and <4, 7, 9> triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
