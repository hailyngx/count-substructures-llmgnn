Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's find all the triangles in the graph step by step:

1. Identify all triangles in the graph:
- <4, 0, 3>
- <4, 0, 6>
- <4, 1, 8>
- <4, 1, 6>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <4, 8, 2>
- <0, 2, 3>
- <2, 1, 8>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <6, 1, 5>
- <6, 3, 5>
- <6, 5, 7>
- <6, 9, 7>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles found:
- Total number of triangles: [15]
