Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 0
