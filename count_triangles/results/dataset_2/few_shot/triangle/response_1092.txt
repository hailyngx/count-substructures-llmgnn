Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by identifying unique triangles:

1. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
3. Triangle <1, 7, 8>
4. Triangle <1, 7, 9>
5. Triangle <1, 8, 9>
6. Triangle <2, 7, 9>
7. Triangle <3, 4, 8>
8. Triangle <3, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
