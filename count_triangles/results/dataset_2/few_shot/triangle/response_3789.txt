Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 2, and node 8

Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 0, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Let's count the total number of triangles in the given graph.

A triangle is formed when three nodes are pairwise connected. We can count the number of triangles by looking at each possible set of three nodes and checking if there is an edge between each pair.

The possible triangles are:
1. Triangle involving nodes 5, 1, and 8
2. Triangle involving nodes 5, 1, and 6
3. Triangle involving nodes 5, 6, and 9
4. Triangle involving nodes 5, 6, and 4

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <5, 1, 8>, <5, 1, 6>, <5, 6, 9>, and <5, 6, 4>.
