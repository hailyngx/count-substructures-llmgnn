Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0)

Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. To find the total number of triangles, we need to count the triangles formed by each node. For a triangle to exist, there need to be three nodes connected to each other.

2. Let's go through each node and check if any triangles are formed:
   - For Node 0: (4, 8, 7) forms a triangle.
   - For Node 1: No triangles.
   - For Node 2: No triangles.
   - For Node 3: No triangles.
   - For Node 4: (0, 6, 8) forms a triangle.
   - For Node 5: No triangles.
   - For Node 6: No triangles.
   - For Node 7: No triangles.
   - For Node 8: No triangles.
   - For Node 9: (4, 2, 7) forms a triangle.

3. Counting the total number of triangles found in the graph:
   Total number of triangles: [3]

4. Unique triangles found in the graph:
   <4, 8, 7>
   <4, 2, 7>
   <0, 6, 8>
