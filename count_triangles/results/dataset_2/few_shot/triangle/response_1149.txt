Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
In order to find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each unique triangle formed by the interconnected nodes. 

The unique triangles found in this graph are: 
<1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 8>
  
Counting these unique triangles gives us the total number of triangles in the graph, which is [7].
