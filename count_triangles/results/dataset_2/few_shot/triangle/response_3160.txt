Response:
In order to count the number of triangles in the graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all triangles by checking for each unique set of three nodes that form a closed loop of connections.

2. Once all triangles are identified, count the total number of unique triangles.

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
<4, 17, 18>
<4, 10, 2>
<4, 10, 13>
<4, 10, 7>
<4, 0, 15>
<4, 0, 9>
<4, 17, 5>
<5, 16, 11>
<5, 16, 19>
<5, 17, 1>
<5, 17, 6>
<5, 18, 1>
<6, 11, 16>
<6, 11, 17>
<6, 12, 7>
<6, 17, 1>
<6, 17, 5>
<6, 17, 4>
<6, 17, 5>
<6, 10, 7>
<7, 12, 6>
<8, 13, 10>
<8, 13, 14>
<8, 13, 10>
<9, 0, 15>
<9, 0, 1>
<9, 1, 18>
<9, 14, 13>
<10, 2, 18>
<10, 7, 12>
<10, 7, 6>
<11, 16, 5>
<13, 8, 19>
<13, 14, 3>
<14, 3, 2>
<16, 19, 8>
<17, 1, 15>
<17, 1, 18>
<17, 4, 0>
<17, 4, 2>
<17, 5, 16>
<18, 1, 15>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [42].
