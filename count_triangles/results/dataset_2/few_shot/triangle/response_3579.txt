Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all possible triangles formed by the nodes and then check if those triangles exist based on the given edges.

Let's list down the triangles step-by-step:

1. Identify all the triangles using the adjacency list and the given edges:

- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 2>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 6>
- Triangle 3: <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle 4: <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle 5: <0, 2, 7>
- Triangle 6: <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle 7: <0, 3, 4>
- Triangle 8: <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle 9: <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle 10: <0, 7, 8>
- Triangle 11: <1, 2, 8>
- Triangle 12: <2, 3, 4>
- Triangle 13: <2, 3, 7>
- Triangle 14: <3, 4, 5>
- Triangle 15: <3, 4, 7>
- Triangle 16: <3, 7, 8>

2. Count the total number of triangles:

The total number of triangles is 16.

Therefore, the output is:
[16]
