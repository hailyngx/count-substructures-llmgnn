Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 10) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 11) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 13) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 3) (3, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 5) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 14, 11, 13, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 12, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 0, 14, 13, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 10, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, 11, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 12, 5, 11, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 12, 11, and node 10
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 12, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 12, 14, and node 11
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 7, 12, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 5, 6, 0, 9, and node 13
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 7, 10, 6, 1, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 0, 11, and node 2
Node 14 is connected to node 0, 9, 2, and node 10

Response:
There are a total of 18 triangles in the given graph.

Unique triangles: 
<4, 8, 12>
<4, 8, 7>
<4, 8, 10>
<4, 12, 1>
<7, 8, 12>
<7, 8, 10>
<5, 0, 11>
<5, 11, 6>
<5, 11, 0>
<3, 2, 0>
<14, 2, 0>
<9, 14, 10>
<9, 14, 12>
<9, 14, 0>
<9, 12, 14>
<11, 9, 13>
<11, 9, 0>
<13, 11, 6> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [18].
