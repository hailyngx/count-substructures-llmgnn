Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. For each edge, check if there is a triangle that can be formed with that edge.
2. A triangle is formed when there is an edge between two nodes, and those two nodes have a common neighbor.
3. Count each unique triangle only once.

After analyzing the given graph, the total number of triangles found is 9. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9]. 
The unique triangles found are:
<2, 8, 9>
<2, 12, 3>
<2, 26, 0>
<2, 26, 4>
<8, 0, 25>
<8, 0, 6>
<8, 9, 1>
<12, 3, 29>
<12, 9, 17>
