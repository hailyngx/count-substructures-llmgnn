Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 7

Response:
After analyzing the given graph, we can count the number of triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <5, 2, 1>
2. <5, 9, 8>
3. <5, 1, 0>
4. <5, 3, 4>
5. <9, 8, 4>
6. <9, 7, 2>
7. <6, 1, 4>
8. <6, 2, 4>
9. <6, 0, 1>
10. <4, 8, 1>
11. <4, 8, 0>
12. <4, 2, 6>
13. <4, 2, 1>
14. <8, 2, 1>
15. <8, 2, 7>
16. <0, 6, 1>
17. <0, 6, 8>
18. <0, 6, 2>
19. <0, 8, 1>
20. <0, 8, 2>
21. <0, 7, 2>
22. <1, 5, 3>

Therefore, there are 22 triangles in the given graph.
Output: [22]
