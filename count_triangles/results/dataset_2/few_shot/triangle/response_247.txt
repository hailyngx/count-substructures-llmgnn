Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8

Node 5 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

We can find the triangles by checking each possible triplet of nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes in the triplet.
Here are the triangles found in this graph:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 1, 9>
4. <0, 4, 8>
5. <0, 5, 7>
6. <1, 2, 4>
7. <1, 2, 8>
8. <1, 3, 7>
9. <1, 4, 7>
10. <1, 4, 9>
11. <2, 4, 8>
12. <2, 8, 9>
13. <3, 5, 7>
14. <4, 7, 9>
15. <4, 8, 9>
16. <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
