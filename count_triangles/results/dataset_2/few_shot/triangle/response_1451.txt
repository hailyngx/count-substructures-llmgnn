Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Since the graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges, we know that there are 60 choose 2 = 1770 total possible triangles.

Now, let's find the actual triangles that exist in the graph:

1. <5, 9, 2>
2. <5, 9, 13>
3. <5, 9, 8>
4. <5, 9, 11>
5. <5, 9, 7>
6. <5, 4, 9>
7. <5, 4, 7>
8. <4, 9, 7>
9. <6, 10, 8>
10. <0, 6, 10>
11. <0, 6, 8>
12. <0, 8, 13>
13. <14, 3, 13>
14. <14, 3, 11>
15. <14, 3, 1>
16. <14, 13, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
