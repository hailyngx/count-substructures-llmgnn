Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges.

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will need to find all the possible triangles formed by nodes connected by edges in the graph. A triangle is formed when there are three nodes connected to each other forming a closed loop.

Let's count the number of triangles step by step:
1. Find all the triangles in the graph:

Triangles:

<2, 9, 3>
<2, 9, 26>
