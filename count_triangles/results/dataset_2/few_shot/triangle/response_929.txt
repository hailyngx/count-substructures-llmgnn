Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify triangles by finding nodes that have edges connecting each other to form closed loops.
2. Count each unique triangle that is found.

From the given list of edges and adjacency list, let's identify the triangles:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 1, 3, and 8. A triangle can be formed with nodes 0, 4, and 8: <0, 4, 8>.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 3, and 5. A triangle can be formed with nodes 2, 7, and 5: <2, 7, 5>.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 0. A triangle can be formed with nodes 4, 7, and 0: <4, 7, 0>.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 2. A triangle can be formed with nodes 5, 7, and 2: <5, 7, 2>.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 3, and 4. No additional triangle can be formed with node 6.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 4, 2, and 5. No additional triangle can be formed with node 7.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 3, 5, and 0. No additional triangle can be formed with node 8.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 0. No additional triangle can be formed with node 9.
- Nodes 1 and 3 do not form any additional triangles in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 8>, <2, 7, 5>, <4, 7, 0>, and <5, 7, 2>.
