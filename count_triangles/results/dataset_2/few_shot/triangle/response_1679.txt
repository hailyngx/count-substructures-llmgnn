Response:
Since the graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges, it is a dense graph. To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we need to calculate the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes. 

Let's follow these steps:
1. For each node, identify its neighbors.
2. For each pair of neighbors `i` and `j` of a node, check if there is an edge between them to form a triangle with the node.
3. Count all such triangles and sum them up.

Let's go through the nodes and count the triangles:
1. Node 0: <0, 7, 3>
2. Node 1: No triangles
3. Node 2: <2, 5, 1>
4. Node 3: No triangles
5. Node 4: No triangles
6. Node 5: No triangles
7. Node 6: No triangles
8. Node 7: <7, 0, 17>
9. Node 8: No triangles
10. Node 9: <9, 4, 17>, <9, 4, 11>, <9, 2, 11>, <9, 2, 18>
11. Node 10: No triangles
12. Node 11: No triangles
13. Node 12: No triangles
14. Node 13: No triangles
15. Node 14: No triangles
16. Node 15: No triangles
17. Node 16: No triangles
18. Node 17: No triangles
19. Node 18: No triangles
20. Node 19: <19, 7, 14>

Total number of triangles found: 5
Unique triangles: <0, 7, 3>, <2, 5, 1>, <7, 0, 17>, <9, 4, 17>, <19, 7, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
