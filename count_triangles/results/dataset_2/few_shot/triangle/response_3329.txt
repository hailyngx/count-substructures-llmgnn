Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 9) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 11) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 11, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, 5, 12, 0, and node 11

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<1, 0, 6>
<1, 11, 0>
<2, 7, 5>
<4, 13, 5> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
