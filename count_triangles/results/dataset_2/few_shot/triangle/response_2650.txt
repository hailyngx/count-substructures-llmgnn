Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
