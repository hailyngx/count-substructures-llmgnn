Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will identify all possible triangles formed by 3 nodes.

Given the adjacency list, we can see the possible triangles as follows:  
- Triangle 1: (4, 5, 6)
- Triangle 2: (4, 6, 11)
- Triangle 3: (7, 9, 6)
- Triangle 4: (7, 1, 3)
- Triangle 5: (7, 1, 9)
- Triangle 6: (7, 10, 14)
- Triangle 7: (1, 3, 8)
- Triangle 8: (3, 0, 11)
- Triangle 9: (3, 2, 14)
- Triangle 10: (5, 0, 11)
- Triangle 11: (5, 2, 14)
- Triangle 12: (5, 13, 12)
- Triangle 13: (6, 9, 1)
- Triangle 14: (8, 11, 3)
- Triangle 15: (13, 8, 3)

Therefore, there are a total of [15] triangles in the given graph.  

The unique triangles found are as follows:  
<4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 11>, <7, 9, 6>, <7, 1, 3>, <7, 1, 9>, <7, 10, 14>, <1, 3, 8>, <3, 0, 11>, <3, 2, 14>, <5, 0, 11>, <5, 2, 14>, <5, 13, 12>, <6, 9, 1>, <8, 11, 3>, <13, 8, 3>.
