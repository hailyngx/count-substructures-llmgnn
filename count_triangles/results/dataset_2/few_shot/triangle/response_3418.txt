Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 7>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<4, 5, 7>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
