Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by 3 connected nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 9, 5>
<1, 0, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 2, 9>
<4, 0, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 0>
<5, 0, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 4, 8>
<7, 0, 1>
<7, 4, 0>
<8, 0, 5>
<8, 3, 2>
<9, 0, 5>
<9, 2, 5>
<9, 3, 2>
<9, 4, 6>
<9, 4, 7>

Hence, there are 25 unique triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [25].
