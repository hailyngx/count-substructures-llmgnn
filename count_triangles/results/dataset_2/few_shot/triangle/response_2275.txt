Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3)
