Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique triangles formed by the nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected with edges between each pair of nodes.

From the given graph information, we can see the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

There are 10 unique triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
