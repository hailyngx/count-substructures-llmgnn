Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. To form a triangle, we need three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's consider each node's connections:

- Node 0: Forms triangles with nodes 13, 8, and 14.
- Node 1: Forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 2: Forms triangles with nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Node 3: Forms triangles with nodes 1, 7, and 14.
- Node 4: No triangles.
- Node 5: No triangles.
- Node 6: Forms triangles with nodes 2, 13, and 16.
- Node 7: No triangles.
- Node 8: Forms triangles with nodes 0, 14, and 15.
- Node 9: Forms triangles with nodes 2, 13, and 8.
- Node 10: No triangles.
- Node 11: No triangles.
- Node 12: Forms a triangle with nodes 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 13: Forms triangles with nodes 6, 9, and 0.
- Node 14: Forms triangles with nodes 3, 8, and 0.
- Node 15: Forms triangles with nodes 8, 16, and 18.
- Node 16: Forms triangles with nodes 2, 6, and 15.
- Node 17: No triangles.
- Node 18: No triangles.
- Node 19: No triangles.

2. Counting the total number of triangles based on the nodes found:
- Total triangles: 10
- Unique triangles: <0, 13, 8>, <0, 14, 8>, <0, 14, 3>, <1, 2, 3>, <2, 6, 13>, <2, 9, 1>, <3, 12, 1>, <6, 13, 16>, <8, 9, 13>, <15, 16, 18>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
