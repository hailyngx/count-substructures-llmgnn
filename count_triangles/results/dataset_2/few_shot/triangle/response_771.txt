Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 5, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 9, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms triangles with:
    - Node 4, 6
    - Node 4, 8
    - Node 4, 9
    - Node 6, 8
    - Node 6, 9

- Node 1 forms triangles with:
    - Node 5, 9

- Node 2 forms a triangle with:
    - Node 6, 8

- Node 3 forms triangles with:
    - Node 4, 5
    - Node 4, 6
    - Node 4, 8
    - Node 5, 6
    - Node 5, 8

- Node 4 does not form any triangles.

- Node 5 forms triangles with:
    - Node 4, 7
    - Node 6, 7
    - Node 6, 9
    - Node 3, 4
    - Node 3, 6

- Node 6 forms a triangle with:
    - Node 7, 9

- Node 7 does not form any triangles.

- Node 8 does not form any triangles.

- Node 9 does not form any triangles.

Considering the triangles found above, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13], and the unique triangles are:
<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 8>, <6, 7, 9>.
