Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 2, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 9, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 8, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can first look at each possible triangle involving each node.

Node 0: 
- Possible triangles: 0-7-5, 0-7-9, 0-8-6, 0-8-2, 0-6-2

Node 1: 
- Possible triangles: 1-3-5, 1-5-6, 1-3-8

Node 2: 
- Possible triangles: 2-7-6, 2-6-0

Node 3: 
- Possible triangles: 3-7-9, 3-1-5, 3-1-8

Node 4: 
- Possible triangles: 4-8-9, 4-5-7

Node 5: 
- Possible triangles: 5-7-6

Node 6: 
- No triangles involving node 6 are unique.

Node 7: 
- Possible triangles: 7-0-9, 7-0-5, 7-3-9

Node 8: 
- Possible triangles: 8-4-9, 8-4-5, 8-1-9, 8-1-5

Node 9: 
- Possible triangles: 9-4-7

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 19. 
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 8, 2>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <7, 0, 9>, <5, 7, 6>, <8, 4, 9>, <8, 4, 5>, <8, 1, 9>, and <8, 1, 5>.
