Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

There are three nodes required to form a triangle. We will iterate over all possible combinations of three nodes and check if they form a triangle based on the given edges.

The total number of triangles in this graph is [10].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 9, 15>
<1, 9, 4>
<1, 15, 4>
<2, 7, 19>
<2, 12, 3>
<2, 14, 17>
<3, 7, 19>
<4, 9, 15>
<10, 13, 5>
<10, 12, 2>
