Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 17) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (13, 5) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 19) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 17) (1, 15) (1, 12) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 18) (18, 11) (18, 9) (18, 8) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 12) (17, 16) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (14, 8) (14, 4) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 19) (4, 17) (4, 14)

Node 11 is connected to node 16, 10, and node 18
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 10, 0, 1, and node 19
Node 13 is connected to node 5
Node 14 is connected to node 8, and node 4
Node 15 is connected to node 3, 1, 19, and node 7
Node 16 is connected to node 11, 0, and node 17
Node 17 is connected to node 16, 3, 0, 7, and node 4
Node 18 is connected to node 11, 9, and node 8
Node 19 is connected to node 15, 0, and node 12

Response:
The graph consists of the following triangles:
<11, 10, 3>, <11, 18, 9>, <16, 17, 0>, <16, 17, 7>, <16, 0, 19>, <16, 11, 10>, <3, 17, 7>, <3, 15, 1>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 10, 12>, <15, 7, 2>, <15, 19, 0>, <5, 9, 12>, <9, 18, 8>, <0, 19, 12>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
