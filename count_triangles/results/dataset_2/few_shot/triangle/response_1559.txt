Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 9, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. <4, 7, 8>
2. <4, 0, 8>
3. <4, 0, 6>
4. <4, 7, 6>
5. <7, 2, 8>
6. <7, 2, 3>
7. <7, 5, 8>
8. <1, 5, 8>
9. <1, 5, 0>
10. <3, 6, 7>
11. <3, 6, 0>
12. <3, 9, 8>
13. <3, 2, 8>
14. <6, 5, 7>
15. <6, 5, 0>
16. <9, 8, 4>
17. <8, 5, 7>
18. <8, 5, 0>

So, there are 18 triangles in total in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [18].
