Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. From the given information, we can see that the graph is undirected and has 15 nodes with 60 edges.

2. We will now list all the triangles present in the graph by checking each set of three nodes that form a triangle. We will skip any duplicates and only list each unique triangle once.

Triangles: 
<0, 10, 14>
<0, 11, 12>
<0, 1, 11>
<0, 6, 11>
<1, 2, 13>
<1, 7, 10>
<2, 4, 13>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 13, 14>
<6, 11, 12>

3. Count the total number of triangles found through the above list.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
