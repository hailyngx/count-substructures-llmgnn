Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 3

Response:
Let's first find the unique triangles in this graph:

1. Node 0, 3, 4 form a triangle <0, 3, 4>
2. Node 1, 2, 5 form a triangle <1, 2, 5>
3. Node 2, 6, 7 form a triangle <2, 6, 7>
4. Node 2, 3, 8 form a triangle <2, 3, 8>
5. Node 4, 8, 9 form a triangle <4, 8, 9>
6. Node 5, 7, 8 form a triangle <5, 7, 8>
7. Node 5, 8, 9 form a triangle <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
