Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges.

To find the number of triangles in the graph:
1. For each node, check if there are any pairs of neighbors that are connected. If yes, count it as a triangle.
2. To avoid counting the same triangle multiple times, consider each triangle only once.

The number of triangles in this graph is [6], and the unique triangles are: 
<0, 1, 3>, <4, 6, 11>, <5, 12, 18>, <4, 5, 16>, <1, 12, 17>, <2, 14, 19>.
