Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Check each possible triangle formed by choosing 3 nodes:
   - For each node pair (i, j), check if there exists a node k such that there are edges (i, k) and (j, k).
   - If such a node k exists, then a triangle is formed by nodes i, j, and k.

2. List down the unique triangles found:
   - <3, 9, 13>
   - <4, 6, 7>
   - <0, 10, 2>

3. Calculate the total number of triangles found:
   - Total number of triangles = 3

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
