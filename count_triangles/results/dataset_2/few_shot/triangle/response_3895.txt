Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we'll need to count all the triangles formed by three connected nodes.

1. From the given information, we can see the graph is a directed graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges.

2. Next, we will list down all the unique triangles present in the graph:
   - <5, 8, 7>
   - <5, 4, 7>
   - <5, 7, 8>
   - <9, 3, 6>
   - <9, 2, 5>
   - <4, 1, 7>
   - <4, 5, 7>
   - <0, 4, 7>
   - <0, 6, 3>
   - <0, 7, 5>

3. Finally, counting the total number of unique triangles in the graph, we find there are 10 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
