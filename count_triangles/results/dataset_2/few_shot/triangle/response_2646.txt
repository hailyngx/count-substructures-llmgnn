Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 9>, <6, 1, 9>, <3, 1, 9>, <5, 3, 6>, <5, 3, 0>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 4>, <5, 7, 4>, <8, 7, 3>, <8, 7, 0>, <8, 3, 2>, <8, 3, 0>, <2, 3, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [21].
