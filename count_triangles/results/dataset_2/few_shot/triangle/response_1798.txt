Response:
To calculate the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other in a closed loop.

Given the graph information, we can analyze the connections between nodes to identify all the triangles.

Let's find the triangles step by step:
1. Look for nodes connected in triangles directly:
- <5, 9, 15>
- <5, 9, 17>
- <5, 12, 7>
- <5, 12, 0>
- <5, 1, 11>
- <9, 15, 18>
- <9, 17, 4>
- <9, 16, 7>
- <9, 16, 13>
- <4, 7, 12>
- <4, 7, 16>
- <3, 10, 6>
- <12, 0, 19>
- <16, 13, 8>
- <16, 13, 14>
- <12, 0, 19>

2. Look for nodes connected through a common neighbor:
- Identify triangles formed indirectly through shared neighbors:
  - <5, 9, 16> (via node 16)
  - <5, 12, 11> (via node 11)
  - <5, 1, 11> (via node 11)
  - <5, 12, 0> (via node 0)
  - <5, 9, 17> (via node 17)
  - <9, 17, 6> (via node 17)
  - <9, 16, 7> (via node 7)
  - <9, 16, 8> (via node 8)
  - <4, 17, 2> (via node 17)
  - <4, 7, 16> (via node 7)
  - <4, 17, 6> (via node 17)
  - <3, 6, 19> (via node 6)
  - <12, 11, 0> (via node 11)
  - <12, 0, 19> (via node 0)
  - <16, 7, 8> (via node 7)
  - <16, 13, 14> (via node 13)
  - <16, 15, 18> (via node 15)

3. Count the total number of distinct triangles found:
- Total number of triangles: [21]

Therefore, there are a total of 21 triangles in the given graph.
