Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0)
