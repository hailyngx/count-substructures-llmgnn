Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible triangles, each containing three edges.

Calculating the number of triangles in the graph:
From the given adjacency list, we can observe that some triangles are formed as follows:

1. Triangle involving nodes 0, 6, and 12: <0, 6, 12>
2. Triangle involving nodes 0, 13, and 5: <0, 13, 5>
3. Triangle involving nodes 0, 13, and 6: <0, 13, 6>
4. Triangle involving nodes 1, 9, and 8: <1, 9, 8>
5. Triangle involving nodes 2, 3, and 5: <2, 3, 5>
6. Triangle involving nodes 2, 4, and 5: <2, 4, 5>
7. Triangle involving nodes 2, 6, and 14: <2, 6, 14>
8. Triangle involving nodes 2, 8, and 11: <2, 8, 11>
9. Triangle involving nodes 3, 5, and 10: <3, 5, 10>
10. Triangle involving nodes 4, 10, and 11: <4, 10, 11>
