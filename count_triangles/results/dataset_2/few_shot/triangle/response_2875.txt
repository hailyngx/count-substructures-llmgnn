Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by looking for the number of unique triangles formed by three nodes connected to each other.

The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<6, 10, 13>
<7, 13, 10>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
