Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 0, 7, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2

Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
[<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 5, 1>, <2, 5, 1>, <3, 9, 4>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 9, 8>] [7]
