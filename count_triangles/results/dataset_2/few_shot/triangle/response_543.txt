Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 4) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are:
<5, 8, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
