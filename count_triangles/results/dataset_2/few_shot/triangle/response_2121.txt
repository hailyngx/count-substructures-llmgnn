Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in this graph step by step:

1. Identify the triangles based on the given graph:
   - Looking at the graph and adjacency list, we can identify the triangles by finding nodes that are connected in a triangular formation.

2. Below are the triangles found in this graph:
   - <1, 3, 7>
   - <1, 3, 10>
   - <1, 4, 13>
   - <1, 8, 12>
   - <1, 8, 13>
   - <1, 7, 14>
   - <3, 6, 13>
   - <3, 7, 11>
   - <4, 5, 12>
   - <4, 9, 11>
   - <7, 9, 11>
   - <8, 11, 12>
   - <8, 12, 13>
   - <9, 10, 12>
   - <9, 11, 12>

3. Count the total number of unique triangles:
   - By counting the unique triangles listed above, we find that there are 15 unique triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
