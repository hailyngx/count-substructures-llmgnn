Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 5, 11, and 14.
2. Node 2 forms triangles with nodes 8, 16, and 18.
3. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 6.
4. Node 6 forms triangles with nodes 4, 5, and 12.
5. Node 7 forms a triangle with nodes 12 and 14.
6. Node 8 forms triangles with nodes 2, 14, and 15.
7. Node 11 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 10.
8. Node 12 forms a triangle with nodes 6, 7, and 19.
9. Node 14 forms triangles with nodes 7, 8, and 9.
10. Node 16 forms triangles with nodes 8 and 15.
11. Node 17 forms a triangle with nodes 7 and 18.

Total number of triangles = 11

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11]. The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 11>, <2, 8, 16>, <4, 5, 6>, <6, 4, 12>, <7, 12, 14>, <8, 2, 14>, <0, 11, 10>, <6, 7, 12>, <7, 14, 8>, and <7, 17, 18>.
