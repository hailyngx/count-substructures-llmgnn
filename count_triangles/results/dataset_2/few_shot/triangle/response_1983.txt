Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Let's start by counting the number of triangles in the given graph:
1. Look at each group of three nodes that are all connected to each other.
2. Count how many triangles can be formed with those three nodes.

Based on the given information, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<5, 9, 8>
<5, 2, 9>
<5, 2, 1>
<5, 8, 1>
<5, 7, 1>
<9, 4, 8>
<9, 4, 7>
<9, 8, 7>
<4, 7, 0>
<7, 0, 6>
<7, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of 12 unique triangles in the given graph.
So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
