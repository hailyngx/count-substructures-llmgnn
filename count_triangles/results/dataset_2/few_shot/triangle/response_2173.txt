Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for cycles of length 3, which represent triangles. 

The triangles can be formed by identifying nodes that have mutual connections with each other. Let's list out the triangles and then count them:

1. <3, 6, 9>
2. <1, 2, 6>
3. <3, 4, 7>
4. <0, 2, 8>
5. <2, 3, 6>
6. <3, 5, 7>

There are 6 unique triangles in the graph.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
