Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8)
