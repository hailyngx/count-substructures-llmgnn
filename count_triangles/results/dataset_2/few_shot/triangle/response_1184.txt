Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2)
