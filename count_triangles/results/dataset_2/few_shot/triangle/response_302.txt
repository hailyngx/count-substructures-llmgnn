Response:
Let's solve this step-by-step to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Identify Possible Triangles**: Look for nodes that are connected in such a way that they form triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

2. **Find Triangles**: For each node, look for pairs of nodes it's connected to. If these pairs are also connected (i.e., form a triangle), note down the triangle.

3. **Total Number of Triangles**: Once you have found all the triangles, count them.

Following the steps, let's look for triangles:

From the given graph, we can find the following triangles:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 1, and 9 forming triangle <5,7,9>.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 1 forming triangle <8,9,1>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
