Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

1. Count the total number of triangles:
    - The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by summing up the number of triangles that each node participates in.
    - To find the number of triangles a node participates in, we count the number of triangles that can be formed with the edges connected to that node.

2. Calculate the number of triangles for each node:

- Node 0:
  - Triangles: {0, 9, 6}, {0, 4, 6}, and {0, 2, 4}

- Node 1:
  - Triangles: {1, 4, 6}

- Node 2:
  - Triangles: {2, 4, 6}

- Node 3:
  - Triangles: {3, 4, 6} and {3, 1, 4}

- Node 4:
  - Triangles: {4, 6, 0} and {4, 1, 3}

- Node 5:
  - No triangles as it doesn't have a triangle configuration.

- Node 6:
  - Triangles: {6, 4, 0}

- Node 7:
  - No triangles

- Node 8:
  - No triangles

- Node 9:
  - No triangles

3. Sum up the number of triangles from each node:

Total number of triangles = 3 (from Node 0) + 1 (from Node 1) + 1 (from Node 2) + 2 (from Node 3) + 2 (from Node 4) + 1 (from Node 6) = 10 triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10]. 

Unique triangles found:
<0, 9, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 1, 4>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 1, 3>.
