Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 2

Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes.

Let's list the unique triangles:

1. <1, 2, 5>
2. <1, 2, 9>
3. <1, 4, 5>
4. <1, 4, 7>
5. <1, 9, 5>
6. <1, 9, 7>
7. <2, 3, 5>
8. <2, 3, 8>
9. <2, 5, 8>
10. <3, 6, 7>
11. <3, 7, 8>
12. <4, 7, 8>
13. <5, 6, 9>
14. <5, 7, 9>
15. <8, 9, 4>

Since we have listed 15 unique triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
