Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 5) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (9, 1) (9, 8) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 14) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 10) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 6) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 14, 7, 11, 12, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 11, 10, 13, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 12, 13, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 11, 6, 12, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 12, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 14, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 2, 11, and node 10
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 0, 14, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 11, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 10 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 12 is connected to node 3, 4, 2, 0, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 14 is connected to node 0, 7, 12, and node 5

Response:
There are a total of 12 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 8, 11>
<0, 8, 12>
<0, 11, 12>
<0, 7, 14>
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 9, 11>
<2, 6, 12>
<2, 6, 13>
<2, 12, 14>
<5, 10, 14>
<7, 13, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
