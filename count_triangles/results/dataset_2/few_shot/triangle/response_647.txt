Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can count the number of triangles by identifying all unique triangles formed by three nodes that are connected to each other. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Identify all triangles based on the given edges:
    - Nodes 0, 1, and 3 form a triangle <0, 1, 3>
    - Nodes 1, 4, and 9 form a triangle <1, 4, 9>
    - Nodes 1, 8, and 9 form a triangle <1, 8, 9>
    - Nodes 1, 2, and 8 form a triangle <1, 2, 8>
    - Nodes 1, 3, and 5 form a triangle <1, 3, 5>
    - Nodes 4, 5, and 6 form a triangle <4, 5, 6>
    - Nodes 6, 8, and 9 form a triangle <6, 8, 9>

2. The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
