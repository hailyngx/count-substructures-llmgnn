Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2)
