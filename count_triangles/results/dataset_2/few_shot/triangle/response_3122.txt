Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 5
