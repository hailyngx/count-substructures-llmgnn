Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

First, we will determine all the triangles in the graph based on the given edges and connections. Then, we will count the total number of unique triangles present in the graph.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<3, 26, 28>
<3, 26, 11>
<3, 26, 10>
<3, 26, 27>
<1, 14, 8>
<1, 14, 15>
<1, 14, 0>
<25, 17, 29>
<25, 17, 18>
<25, 29, 16>
<25, 29, 17>
<0, 16, 24>
<0, 16, 25>
<0, 16, 29>
<0, 16, 28>

Total number of triangles in the given graph: [14]
