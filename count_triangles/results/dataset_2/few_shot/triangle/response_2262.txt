Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph by looking for nodes that form triangles. 

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 13, 1, and 6.
2. Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 7, 13, and 8.
3. Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 16, 4, and 9.
4. Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 7, 15, and 3.
5. Node 6 forms triangles with nodes 18, 14, and 19.
6. Node 7 forms triangles with nodes 4, 17, and 1.
7. Node 8 forms triangles with nodes 10, 18, and 1.
8. Node 9 forms triangles with nodes 17, 14, and 3.
9. Node 12 forms triangles with nodes 11, 17, and 2.
10. Node 13 forms triangles with nodes 1, 19, and 0.
11. Node 14 forms triangles with nodes 16, 2, and 9.
12. Node 16 forms triangles with nodes 11, 3, and 14.
13. Node 17 forms triangles with nodes 7, 12, and 9.
14. Node 18 forms triangles with nodes 15, 6, and 8.
15. Node 19 forms triangles with nodes 13, 6, and 3.

Now, let's count the total number of unique triangles and list them:

Total number of triangles: [16]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <1, 7, 13>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 7, 15>, <6, 14, 18>, <7, 1, 17>, <8, 1, 18>, <9, 14, 17>, <11, 12, 17>, <13, 0, 19>, <14, 2, 16>, <16, 3, 14>, <17, 7, 9>, <18, 6, 8>, <19, 3, 6>
