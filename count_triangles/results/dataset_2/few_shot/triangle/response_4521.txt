Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 4.

Unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 2, 4>
<3, 7, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 3, 4> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
