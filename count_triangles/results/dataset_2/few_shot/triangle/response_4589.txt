Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Look for triangles formed by each node:
- Node 0: <0, 1, 12> is a triangle.
- Node 1: No triangles.
- Node 2: No triangles.
- Node 3: No triangles.
- Node 4: No triangles.
- Node 5: No triangles.
- Node 6: No triangles.
- Node 7: No triangles.
- Node 8: No triangles.
- Node 9: No triangles.
- Node 10: No triangles.
- Node 11: No triangles.
- Node 12: No triangles.
- Node 13: No triangles.
- Node 14: No triangles.

2. Total number of triangles: [1]
   
So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 1. The unique triangle found is <0, 1, 12>.
