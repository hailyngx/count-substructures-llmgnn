1. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 8, 17>
3. Triangle <0, 17, 7>
4. Triangle <1, 6, 10>
5. Triangle <3, 13, 14>
6. Triangle <3, 13, 18>
7. Triangle <3, 13, 2>
8. Triangle <3, 13, 16>
9. Triangle <4, 6, 10>
10. Triangle <4, 6, 16>
11. Triangle <4, 11, 7>
12. Triangle <4, 11, 16>
13. Triangle <5, 14, 18>
14. Triangle <5, 14, 13>
15. Triangle <5, 14, 19>
16. Triangle <5, 19, 9>
17. Triangle <6, 9, 10>
18. Triangle <6, 9, 12>
19. Triangle <7, 11, 17>
20. Triangle <7, 15, 17>
