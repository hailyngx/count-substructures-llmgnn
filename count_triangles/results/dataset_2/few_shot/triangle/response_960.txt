Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

Step 1: Identify all the triangles in the graph.
- Triangles are formed by 3 connected nodes.

Step 2: List out the triangles found:
- <1, 6, 10>
- <3, 4, 12>
- <0, 8, 13>

Step 3: Calculate the total number of unique triangles found.
- Total number of triangles: [3]
