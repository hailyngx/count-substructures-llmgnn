Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 7, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
The graph is as follows:
```
          1 ---- 2   
         /|     / \
        / |    /   \
       0  |   3 --- 4
        \ |   |     |
         \|   |     |
           8  9 --- 7
            \ |
             \|
              5

Let's find the number of triangles in this graph.

First, let's list down the triangles:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 3>
3. <0, 1, 4>
4. <0, 1, 8>
5. <0, 2, 4>
6. <0, 7, 8>
7. <1, 2, 4>
8. <1, 6, 8>
9. <2, 4, 9>
10. <2, 8, 9>
11. <3, 4, 9>

There are 11 unique triangles in this graph, so the total number of triangles is given as [11].
