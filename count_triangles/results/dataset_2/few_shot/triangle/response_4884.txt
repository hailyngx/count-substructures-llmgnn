Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's first list all the triangles that we can form using the given graph:

1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <1, 2, 5>
5. <1, 3, 5>
6. <2, 5, 7>
7. <2, 6, 9>
8. <4, 5, 7>
9. <4, 6, 8>
10. <6, 8, 9>
11. <7, 8, 9>

There are 11 unique triangles in the graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is given as [11].
