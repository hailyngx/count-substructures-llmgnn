Response:
Let's find the triangles in the graph:

1. From the given graph, we can see that a triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by three edges. We need to find all possible triangles in the graph.

2. To do this, we will look for nodes that are connected to each other, forming triangles.

3. Let's find the triangles in the graph:
    - Triangle 1: <1, 2, 4>
    - Triangle 2: <1, 19, 10>
    - Triangle 3: <2, 6, 10>
    - Triangle 4: <2, 11, 8>
    - Triangle 5: <3, 9, 16>
    - Triangle 6: <3, 10, 16>
    - Triangle 7: <3, 4, 11>
    - Triangle 8: <4, 11, 8>
    - Triangle 9: <7, 12, 18>
    - Triangle 10: <7, 14, 16>
    - Triangle 11: <7, 14, 0>
    - Triangle 12: <16, 14, 18>
    - Triangle 13: <16, 18, 6>
    - Triangle 14: <16, 3, 10>
    - Triangle 15: <16, 9, 10>
    - Triangle 16: <16, 9, 18>
    - Triangle 17: <16, 9, 3>
    - Triangle 18: <16, 9, 4>
    - Triangle 19: <16, 3, 13>
    - Triangle 20: <18, 17, 9>
    - Triangle 21: <18, 17, 8>
    - Triangle 22: <18, 17, 6>
    - Triangle 23: <18, 12, 7>
   
4. Now that we have found all the triangles in the graph, let's count them:
    - Total number of triangles = 23

5. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [23].
