Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

Counting triangles in a graph can be time-consuming as it involves checking all possible combinations of three nodes that are connected to each other. To simplify it, we can use the given information to find the triangles more efficiently.

Looking at the graph and the adjacency list, we can see that there are some triangles present. Let's enumerate the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 8>
4. Triangle <1, 3, 6>
5. Triangle <1, 3, 7>
6. Triangle <1, 4, 5>
7. Triangle <1, 4, 9>
8. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
9. Triangle <2, 5, 9>
10. Triangle <2, 7, 9>
11. Triangle <3, 6, 9>
12. Triangle <4, 5, 9>
13. Triangle <5, 6, 0>
14. Triangle <5, 6, 2>
15. Triangle <5, 6, 8>
16. Triangle <5, 8, 2>
17. Triangle <7, 0, 2>
18. Triangle <7, 1, 3>
19. Triangle <7, 1, 9>
20. Triangle <7, 2, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [20] triangles in the given graph.
