Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. For each node, find its neighbors. 
2. For each pair of neighbors of a node, check if they are connected. 
3. If the pair of neighbors are connected, check if there is an edge between the pair of neighbors as well.

Let's calculate the number of triangles:

1. Node 0: (2, 4), (0, 8), (0, 2), (0, 12), so there are no triangles involving node 0.
2. Node 1: (8, 2), (1, 13), no triangles.
3. Node 2: (9, 5), (2, 13), (2, 1), (2, 0), triangle <2, 9, 5>.
4. Node 3: (7, 11), no triangles.
5. Node 4: (10, 5), (4, 11), no triangles.
6. Node 5: (7, 5), no triangles.
7. Node 6: (9, 7), (6, 12), no triangles.
8. Node 7: (3, 11), (7, 5), (7, 10), triangle <3, 7, 11>.
9. Node 8: (10, 0), (8, 1), no triangles.
10. Node 9: (2, 11), no triangles.
11. Node 10: (4, 7), no triangles.
12. Node 11: (3, 14), no triangles.
13. Node 12: (13, 1), no triangles.
14. Node 13: (14, 2), (13, 12), no triangles.
15. Node 14: no triangles.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <2, 9, 5>, <3, 7, 11>.
