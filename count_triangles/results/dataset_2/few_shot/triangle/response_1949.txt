Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. We notice that a triangle is formed when three vertices are connected with each other. There are a total of 15 nodes in the graph.

2. To find the number of triangles, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

3. We will iterate through each node and check if there are two edges that connect it to two other nodes. If such edges exist, we check if those two other nodes are connected by an edge as well, forming a triangle.

4. After analyzing the graph, we find the following triangles:
   - <0, 4, 14>
   - <1, 4, 12>
   - <1, 7, 13>
   - <2, 6, 9>
   - <2, 6, 10>
   - <2, 6, 14>
   - <3, 0, 14>
   - <4, 6, 9>
   - <7, 11, 13>
   - <7, 11, 8>
   - <7, 11, 12>
   - <7, 13, 0>
   - <7, 13, 1>
   - <7, 13, 14>
   - <9, 6, 4>
   - <11, 8, 5>
   - <11, 8, 6>
   - <12, 10, 2>
   - <12, 10, 5>
   - <12, 10, 11>
   - <12, 11, 8>
   - <12, 11, 13>

5. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [22].
