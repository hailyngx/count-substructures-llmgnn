Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

From the given adjacency list, we can identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
