Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that form a triangle. A triangle is formed by three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes. 

There are several triangles in the given graph, and listing them all out will help us in counting them:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 1, 12>
4. <0, 3, 13>
5. <0, 12, 14>
6. <1, 3, 11>
7. <1, 2, 5>
8. <1, 11, 14>
9. <2, 5, 10>
10. <3, 4, 11>
11. <3, 4, 14>
12. <3, 10, 13>
13. <4, 7, 8>
14. <4, 9, 11>
15. <4, 11, 14>
16. <5, 6, 14>
17. <5, 9, 14>
18. <6, 7, 8>
19. <6, 10, 12>
20. <6, 10, 13>
21. <6, 8, 9>
22. <7, 8, 9>
23. <10, 12, 14>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [23].
