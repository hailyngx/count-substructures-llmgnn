Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Given the adjacency list, here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
