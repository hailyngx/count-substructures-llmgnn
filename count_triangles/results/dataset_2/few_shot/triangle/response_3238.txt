Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look at each node and check if there are any triangles formed by the edges connected to that node. 

1. For Node 0, there is no triangle.
2. For Node 1, there is no triangle.
3. For Node 2, there is one triangle: <1, 8, 2>.
4. For Node 3, there is no triangle.
5. For Node 4, there is one triangle: <7, 8, 4>.
6. For Node 5, there is no triangle.
7. For Node 6, there are two triangles: <6, 7, 4> and <6, 7, 1>.
8. For Node 7, there is no triangle.
9. For Node 8, there is one triangle: <8, 4, 1>.
10. For Node 9, there is no triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
