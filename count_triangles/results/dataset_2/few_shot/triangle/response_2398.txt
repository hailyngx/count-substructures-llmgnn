Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
[<0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 2, 9>]
