Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in this given graph:

Counting triangles in a graph can be done by checking all possible combinations of 3 nodes that are connected to each other in the graph.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the triangles. The triangles can be found by examining each node and its neighbors.

Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:
