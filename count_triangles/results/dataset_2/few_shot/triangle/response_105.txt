Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2)
