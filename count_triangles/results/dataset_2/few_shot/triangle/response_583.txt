Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph are as follows:  

[<0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 2>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 8, 5>, <1, 8, 2>, <2, 1, 8>, <2, 8, 3>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 7, 4>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 5>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 8, 6>, <6, 9, 7>, <7, 9, 4>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [20].
