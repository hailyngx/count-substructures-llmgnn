Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
[<0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 8, 2>, <6, 7, 9>]
