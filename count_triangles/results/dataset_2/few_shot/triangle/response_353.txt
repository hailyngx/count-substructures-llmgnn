Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 1

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can calculate the number of triangles present in the graph. A triangle is formed by three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's find the number of triangles:

1. Nodes 0, 2, and 7 form a triangle: <0, 2, 7>
2. Nodes 0, 2, and 6 form a triangle: <0, 2, 6>
3. Nodes 0, 6, and 7 form a triangle: <0, 6, 7>
4. Nodes 1, 5, and 9 form a triangle: <1, 5, 9>
5. Nodes 1, 3, and 5 form a triangle: <1, 3, 5>
6. Nodes 1, 3, and 7 form a triangle: <1, 3, 7>
7. Nodes 1, 3, and 9 form a triangle: <1, 3, 9>
8. Nodes 2, 3, and 7 form a triangle: <2, 3, 7>
9. Nodes 2, 3, and 8 form a triangle: <2, 3, 8>
10. Nodes 2, 4, and 8 form a triangle: <2, 4, 8>
11. Nodes 2, 4, and 6 form a triangle: <2, 4, 6>
12. Nodes 3, 5, and 7 form a triangle: <3, 5, 7>
13. Nodes 4, 6, and 8 form a triangle: <4, 6, 8>
14. Nodes 4, 6, and 9 form a triangle: <4, 6, 9>
15. Nodes 5, 6, and 9 form a triangle: <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] triangles in the given graph.
