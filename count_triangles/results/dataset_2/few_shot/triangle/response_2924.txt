Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. From the given adjacency list, we can see that for a triangle to exist, we need three nodes connected in a cycle.

2. Checking each combination of nodes, we find the following triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <4, 7, 10>
   - Triangle 2: <10, 11, 7>
   - Triangle 3: <4, 13, 10>

3. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
