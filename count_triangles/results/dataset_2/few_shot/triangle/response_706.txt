Response:
The graph described has a total of 15 nodes and 60 edges. To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. Let's calculate that now:

The triangles found in this graph are:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 3, 5>
4. <1, 3, 8>
5. <1, 7, 8>
6. <1, 9, 10>
7. <1, 9, 12>
8. <1, 9, 4>
9. <3, 10, 13>
10. <3, 11, 13>
11. <3, 5, 13>
12. <5, 10, 13>
13. <5, 12, 13>
14. <10, 11, 13>
15. <10, 14, 13>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
