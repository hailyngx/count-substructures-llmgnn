Response:
There are total of 16 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 9, 4>
<0, 9, 8>
<0, 9, 14>
<0, 9, 13>
<0, 3, 14>
<0, 3, 11>
<0, 3, 13>
<0, 8, 14>
<0, 8, 12>
<1, 10, 7>
<1, 10, 11>
<1, 7, 2>
<2, 8, 12>
<2, 8, 4>
<2, 8, 5>
<4, 8, 5>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
