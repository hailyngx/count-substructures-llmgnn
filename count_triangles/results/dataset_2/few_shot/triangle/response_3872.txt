Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 2

Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step by step. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

1. Node 0:
   - Connected to nodes 7, 8, and 2
   - No triangle is formed with these connections.

2. Node 1:
   - Connected to nodes 4, 3, 6, and 2
   - No triangle is formed with these connections.

3. Node 2:
   - Connected to nodes 5, 1, 3, 8, and 0
   - No triangle is formed with these connections.

4. Node 3:
   - Connected to nodes 9, 4, 7, 1, and 2
   - Triangle <3, 1, 2> is formed.

5. Node 4:
   - Connected to nodes 5, 1, 6, and 3
   - No triangle is formed with these connections.

6. Node 5:
   - Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7
   - No triangle is formed with these connections.

7. Node 6:
   - Connected to nodes 9, 4, 1, and 8
   - No triangle is formed with these connections.

8. Node 7:
   - Connected to nodes 5, 9, 0, and 3
   - No triangle is formed with these connections.

9. Node 8:
   - Connected to nodes 9, 6, 2, and 0
   - No triangle is formed with these connections.

10. Node 9:
    - Connected to nodes 6, 8, 3, and 7
    - No triangle is formed with these connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1] and the unique triangle found is <3, 1, 2>.
