Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Identify the triangles:
- A triangle is formed when three nodes are fully connected to each other.
- We need to find all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

2. Count the triangles:
- <3, 9, 13>
- <3, 9, 14>
- <7, 8, 11>
- <7, 8, 6>
- <2, 12, 13>

3. Output:
There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
