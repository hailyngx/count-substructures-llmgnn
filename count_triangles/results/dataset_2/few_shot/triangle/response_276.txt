Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Looking at the given adjacency list, we can see that node 0 is connected to nodes 15 and 10. Node 15 is connected to nodes 1, 10, 0, 8, and 17, etc.

Counting the number of triangles in the graph would involve finding all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Total number of triangles: [28]
