Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

A triangle is formed when three nodes are pairwise connected to each other. To find triangles, we can look for nodes that are connected to each other and form a cycle of length 3.

Going through the adjacency list, we can identify the triangles present in the graph:

1. Triangle <2, 17, 18>
2. Triangle <2, 17, 13>
3. Triangle <2, 18, 13>
4. Triangle <3, 10, 14>
5. Triangle <4, 9, 12>
6. Triangle <5, 11, 17>
7. Triangle <5, 11, 19>
8. Triangle <5, 15, 19>
9. Triangle <8, 1, 4>
10. Triangle <8, 2, 17>
11. Triangle <8, 2, 18>
12. Triangle <8, 2, 19>
13. Triangle <9, 12, 4>
14. Triangle <9, 13, 17>
15. Triangle <9, 13, 18>
16. Triangle <10, 14, 12>
17. Triangle <13, 18, 17>
18. Triangle <14, 10, 12>
19. Triangle <14, 19, 5>
20. Triangle <14, 19, 8>
21. Triangle <18, 19, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [21].
