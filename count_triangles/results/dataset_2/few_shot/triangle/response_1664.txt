Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify the triangles in the graph based on the given edges and connections:
- Triangle 1: (0, 6, 8)
- Triangle 2: (0, 6, 9)
- Triangle 3: (0, 6, 12)
- Triangle 4: (0, 4, 11)
- Triangle 5: (1, 6, 12)
- Triangle 6: (1, 2, 9)
- Triangle 7: (2, 3, 6)
- Triangle 8: (2, 3, 12)
- Triangle 9: (2, 3, 13)
- Triangle 10: (2, 7, 10)

2. List the unique triangles found:
- <0, 6, 8>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <0, 6, 12>
- <0, 4, 11>
- <1, 6, 12>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <2, 3, 12>
- <2, 3, 13>
- <2, 7, 10>

3. Count the total number of triangles: [10]
