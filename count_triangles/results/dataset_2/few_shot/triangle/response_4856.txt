Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node is involved in and then dividing by 3 as each triangle has 3 nodes. Let's determine the triangles involving each node:

Triangles involving Node 0: [(0, 4, 9), (0, 5, 13)]
Triangles involving Node 1: [(1, 2, 7), (1, 5, 7)]
Triangles involving Node 2: [(2, 4, 6), (2, 6, 7), (2, 11, 4)]
Triangles involving Node 3: [(3, 5, 7), (3, 12, 5), (3, 12, 13)]
Triangles involving Node 4: [(4, 8, 12)]
Triangles involving Node 5: [(0, 3, 5), (1, 3, 5), (5, 7, 3)]
Triangles involving Node 6: [(2, 6, 7)]
Triangles involving Node 7: [(1, 2, 7), (2, 6, 7), (3, 5, 7)]
Triangles involving Node 8: [(4, 8, 12), (8, 9, 11), (8, 9, 13)]
Triangles involving Node 9: [(0, 4, 9), (9, 11, 13)]
Triangles involving Node 10: []
Triangles involving Node 11: [(8, 9, 11), (8, 11, 12), (11, 12, 13)]
Triangles involving Node 12: [(3, 12, 13)]
Triangles involving Node 13: [(0, 5, 13)]
Triangles involving Node 14: []

Now, we count the number of unique triangles and list them inside <>:

Total Number of Triangles: [14]
Unique Triangles: <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 13>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 11, 4>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 12, 5>, <3, 12, 13>, <4, 8, 12>, <8, 9, 11>, <8, 9, 13>, <11, 12, 13>
