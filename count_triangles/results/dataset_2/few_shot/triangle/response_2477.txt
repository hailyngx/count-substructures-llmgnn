Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for every set of three nodes that form a triangle. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

From the provided graph information, we can list out the unique triangles:
1. <10, 11, 13>
2. <11, 13, 14>
3. <4, 10, 13>
4. <6, 12, 14>
5. <3, 5, 12>

There are 5 unique triangles in this graph.
So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
