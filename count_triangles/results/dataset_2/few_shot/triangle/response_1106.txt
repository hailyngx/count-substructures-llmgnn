Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. List all triangles:  
Triangles in the graph can be formed by finding all possible cycles of length 3.

The triangles in the graph are:
<0, 5, 18>
<0, 5, 18>
<2, 7, 13>
<2, 7, 13>
<2, 7, 13>
<2, 7, 13>
<2, 7, 17>
<2, 7, 17>
<2, 7, 17>
<2, 9, 15>
<2, 9, 15>
<3, 7, 13>
<3, 7, 13>
<4, 14, 17>
<4, 14, 17>
<4, 14, 19>
<9, 15, 20>
<9, 15, 20>

2. Count the total number of triangles:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
