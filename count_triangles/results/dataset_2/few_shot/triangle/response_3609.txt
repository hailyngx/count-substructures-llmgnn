Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated based on the number of triangles each node participates in. 

Here are the triangles found in this graph:

<3, 9, 18>  
<3, 9, 10>  
<3, 2, 7>  
<6, 8, 19>  
<6, 7, 15>  
<6, 7, 2>  
<6, 7, 3>  
<7, 2, 15>  
<7, 2, 3>  
<7, 2, 6>  
<9, 3, 10>  
<9, 3, 18>  
<9, 3, 2>  
<9, 10, 4>  
<10, 4, 13>  
<10, 4, 16>  
<10, 4, 13>  
<14, 7, 17>  
<15, 3, 6>  
<15, 3, 2>  
<15, 6, 8>  
<16, 1, 4>  
<16, 1, 13>  
<16, 4, 5>  
<16, 4, 13>  
<17, 5, 14>  
<19, 6, 8>  
<19, 6, 10>  
<19, 8, 6>  
<19, 8, 10>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [29].
