Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0)
