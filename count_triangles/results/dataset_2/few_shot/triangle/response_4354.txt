Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all possible triangles formed by 3 nodes connected to each other. Let's calculate this step-by-step:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 4), (0, 3, 6), (0, 4, 6), (1, 3, 7), (1, 4, 8), (3, 4, 7), (3, 6, 7), (4, 6, 7) - 0 triangles

2. Node 1: (1, 5, 8) - 1 triangle

3. Node 2: (2, 4, 8), (2, 7, 8) - 0 triangles

4. Node 3: (3, 7, 1), (3, 7, 0) - 0 triangles

5. Node 4: (4, 8, 2) - 1 triangle

6. Node 5: No triangle can be formed with one connection.

7. Node 6: No triangle can be formed with one connection.

8. Node 7: (7, 9, 3), (7, 6, 0), (7, 6, 4), (7, 6, 2), (7, 2, 1), (7, 0, 1) - 0 triangles

9. Node 8: (8, 5, 1), (8, 5, 9), (8, 5, 4), (8, 5, 2), (8, 1, 0), (8, 1, 9), (8, 1, 3), (8, 1, 2), (8, 4, 9), (8, 4, 5), (8, 4, 2) - 0 triangles

10. Node 9: No triangle can be formed with one connection.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <1, 5, 8>, <4, 8, 2>
