Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph.

To form a triangle, we need three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find all the unique triangles in this graph:

1. From the given edges and adjacency list, we can see that the possible triangles are:
   - <11, 7, 6>
   - <11, 7, 12>
   - <11, 15, 13>
   - <16, 3, 9>
   - <16, 9, 18>
   - <17, 7, 12>
   - <3, 4, 15>
   - <3, 5, 2>
   - <3, 7, 12>
   - <6, 7, 12>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
