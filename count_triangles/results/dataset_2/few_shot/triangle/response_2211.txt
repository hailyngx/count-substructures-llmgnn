Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (5, 8) (5, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
[<0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <7, 8, 9>]
