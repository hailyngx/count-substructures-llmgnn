Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. From the given edge list, we can observe that any triangle in the graph will involve nodes connected in the following manner:
   - For example, if we have edges (a, b), (b, c), and (a, c), then nodes a, b, and c form a triangle.

2. Let's identify the unique triangles present in the graph:
   - <16, 21, 29>
   - <7, 12, 17>
   - <5, 8, 15>
   - <0, 13, 22>
   - <0, 13, 28>
   - <0, 22, 28>
   - <3, 13, 20>
   - <5, 8, 6>
   - <5, 8, 12>
   - <5, 8, 24>

3. Now, let's count the total number of triangles:
   - The total number of triangles = 10

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
