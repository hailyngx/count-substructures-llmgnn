Response:
Following the information provided, we can identify the triangles in the graph by finding the nodes that form cycles of length 3. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 7, 15>
2. <3, 4, 18>
3. <4, 10, 13>
4. <5, 14, 16>
5. <5, 15, 19>
6. <6, 9, 13>
7. <8, 9, 16>
8. <15, 7, 19>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
