Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. For each node in the graph, we will list out all the triangles formed by that node along with its connected nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

Triangles for each node:
Node 0: <0, 1, 13>, <0, 1, 24>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 13, 24>, <0, 13, 4>
Node 1: <1, 6, 29>, <1, 6, 0>, <1, 29, 0>
Node 2: <2, 19, 20>, <2, 19, 15>, <2, 20, 15>
Node 3: No triangles
Node 4: <4, 23, 20>, <4, 23, 0>, <4, 20, 0>
Node 5: <5, 13, 12>, <5, 13, 28>, <5, 12, 28>
Node 6: No triangles
Node 7: <7, 13, 11>
Node 8: <8, 26, 29>, <8, 26, 24>, <8, 29, 24>, <8, 29, 0>, <8, 24, 0>
Node 9: <9, 13, 12>
Node 10: <10, 15, 12>, <10, 15, 14>, <10, 15, 29>, <10, 12, 29>, <10, 14, 29>
Node 11: No triangles
Node 12: <12, 6, 1>, <12, 6, 9>, <12, 6, 18>, <12, 5, 18>, <12, 5, 10>, <12, 18, 10>
Node 13: <13, 9, 5>, <13, 9, 17>, <13, 9, 7>, <13, 5, 17>, <13, 5, 7>, <13, 17, 7>, <13, 17, 25>, <13, 7, 25>
Node 14: No triangles
Node 15: <15, 2, 20>
Node 16: No triangles
Node 17: <17, 22, 13>, <17, 22, 25>, <17, 13, 25>
Node 18: <18, 26, 19>, <18, 26, 8>
Node 19: No triangles
Node 20: <20, 21, 2>
Node 21: No triangles
Node 22: <22, 21, 23>, <22, 21, 14>, <22, 23, 14>
Node 23: No triangles
Node 24: <24, 8, 29>, <24, 8, 0>, <24, 29, 0>
Node 25: <25, 16, 17>, <25, 16, 27>, <25, 17, 27>
Node 26: No triangles
Node 27: <27, 21, 25>, <27, 21, 11>, <27, 25, 11>
Node 28: No triangles
Node 29: <29, 1, 16>, <29, 1, 10>, <29, 1, 3>, <29, 1, 8>, <29, 3, 8>, <29, 10, 3>
