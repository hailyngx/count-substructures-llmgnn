Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 8

Response:
Let's count the total number of triangles in this graph:

- There are 10 nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- A triangle is formed when three nodes are fully connected to each other.

From the given edges, we can find the following triangles:
1. Triangle <1, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
4. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 4, 5>
6. Triangle <4, 5, 7>
7. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
8. Triangle <3, 4, 8>
9. Triangle <4, 8, 9>
10. Triangle <0, 3, 6>
11. Triangle <0, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of 11 triangles in this graph.
So, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [11].
