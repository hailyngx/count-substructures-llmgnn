Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by observing the triangles formed by each set of three nodes connected by edges.

Considering the provided edges:
(5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0)
(9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7)
(6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0)
(4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3)
(7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1)
(1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8)
(3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8)
(8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0)
(2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6)
(0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8)

We can see triangles are formed by nodes: 5-2-8, 5-1-8, 5-1-7, 5-1-3, 9-3-7, 6-4-0, 4-6-8, 4-6-0, 4-8-3, 7-3-1, 3-1-8, 5-8-4, 5-8-0, 2-9-3, 2-6-4, and 2-6-0.

Counting the number of each unique triangle found:
- <5, 2, 8>
- <5, 1, 8>
- <5, 1, 7>
- <5, 1, 3>
- <9, 3, 7>
- <6, 4, 0>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <4, 8, 3>
- <7, 3, 1>
- <3, 1, 8>
- <5, 8, 4>
- <5, 8, 0>
- <2, 9, 3>
- <2, 6, 4>
- <2, 6, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
