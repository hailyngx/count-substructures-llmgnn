Response:
Let's start by counting the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Look for triangles formed by each node:
   - Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1 and 7.
   - Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 9 and 10.
   - Node 2 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 3 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 4 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 11 and 15.
   - Node 6 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 7 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 8 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 9 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 10 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 11 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 12 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 13 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 14 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 15 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 16 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 17 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 18 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 19 does not form any triangles.

2. Triangles found: 
   - <0, 1, 7>
   - <1, 9, 10>
   - <5, 11, 15>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
