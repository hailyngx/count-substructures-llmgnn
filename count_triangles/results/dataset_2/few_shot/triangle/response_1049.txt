Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Start by identifying all triangles in the graph using the provided edge list and adjacency list. A triangle in a graph consists of three nodes connected by edges to form a closed loop.

The following triangles are identified:
<4, 8, 14>
<5, 9, 28>
<5, 25, 27>
<7, 19, 29>
<8, 13, 18>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles in the graph. Each unique triangle should be counted only once.

Total number of triangles: [5]
