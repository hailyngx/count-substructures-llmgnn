Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 13) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 11) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 10) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12)

Response:
The given graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges.

From the given information, we can list some of the triangles in the graph:
- <1, 4, 10>
- <3, 5, 11>
- <5, 8, 13>
- <0, 8, 13>
- <4, 12, 14>
- <0, 9, 13>
- <2, 10, 12>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
