Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can go through each possible triangle in the graph and check if it forms a triangle. 
A triangle is formed when three nodes are pairwise connected. Let's determine the triangles:
- **Triangle 1**: <0, 4, 8>
- **Triangle 2**: <0, 4, 13>
- **Triangle 3**: <0, 5, 3>
- **Triangle 4**: <0, 5, 6>
- **Triangle 5**: <0, 5, 13>
- **Triangle 6**: <0, 6, 12>
- **Triangle 7**: <0, 6, 13>
- **Triangle 8**: <0, 8, 3>
- **Triangle 9**: <0, 12, 6>
- **Triangle 10**: <0, 13, 4>
- **Triangle 11**: <0, 13, 6>
- **Triangle 12**: <1, 6, 13>
- **Triangle 13**: <1, 9, 11>
- **Triangle 14**: <1, 9, 10>
- **Triangle 15**: <1, 11, 13>
- **Triangle 16**: <2, 7, 10>
- **Triangle 17**: <2, 7, 14>
- **Triangle 18**: <2, 10, 3>
- **Triangle 19**: <2, 10, 7>
- **Triangle 20**: <2, 13, 6>
- **Triangle 21**: <2, 13, 11>
- **Triangle 22**: <3, 5, 11>
- **Triangle 23**: <3, 5, 8>
- **Triangle 24**: <3, 8, 2>
- **Triangle 25**: <3, 10, 7>
- **Triangle 26**: <4, 8, 14>
- **Triangle 27**: <6, 12, 13>
- **Triangle 28**: <7, 12, 10>
- **Triangle 29**: <7, 12, 14>
- **Triangle 30**: <7, 14, 13>

Now, it's time to count the total number of triangles. 
There are 30 unique triangles in the graph.
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [30].
