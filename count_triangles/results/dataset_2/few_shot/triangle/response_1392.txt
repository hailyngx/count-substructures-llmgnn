Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's start by listing out the triangles <A, B, C> where A, B, and C are nodes in the graph:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 3, 13>
3. <0, 5, 13>
4. <0, 13, 14>
5. <1, 2, 14>
6. <3, 6, 11>
7. <3, 7, 11>
8. <0, 5, 8>
9. <4, 5, 10>
10. <4, 5, 8>
11. <4, 10, 12>
12. <4, 12, 13>
13. <5, 8, 14>
14. <8, 11, 13>
15. <10, 11, 13>
