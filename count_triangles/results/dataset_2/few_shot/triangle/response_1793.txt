Response:
From the given graph, we can see that there are multiple triangles present based on the given edges and adjacency list. Let's identify the unique triangles step by step:

1. Triangle between nodes 4, 5, and 8:
    - This triangle is formed by edges: (4, 5), (5, 8), (8, 4)
    
2. Triangle between nodes 6, 1, and 2:
    - This triangle is formed by edges: (6, 1), (1, 2), (2, 6)
    
3. Triangle between nodes 0, 4, and 8:
    - This triangle is formed by edges: (0, 4), (4, 8), (8, 0)
    
4. Triangle between nodes 0, 7, and 8:
    - This triangle is formed by edges: (0, 7), (7, 8), (8, 0)
    
5. Triangle between nodes 0, 4, and 9:
    - This triangle is formed by edges: (0, 4), (4, 9), (9, 0)
    
6. Triangle between nodes 4, 8, and 9:
    - This triangle is formed by edges: (4, 8), (8, 9), (9, 4)
    
7. Triangle between nodes 4, 5, and 9:
    - This triangle is formed by edges: (4, 5), (5, 9), (9, 4)
    
8. Triangle between nodes 6, 7, and 8:
    - This triangle is formed by edges: (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 6)
    
9. Triangle between nodes 6, 8, and 9:
    - This triangle is formed by edges: (6, 8), (8, 9), (9, 6)
    
Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [9]. The unique triangles found are <4, 5, 8>, <6, 1, 2>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, and <6, 8, 9>.
