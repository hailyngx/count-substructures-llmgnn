Response:
There are a total of 14 triangles in this graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<0, 1, 14>
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 8, 12>
<1, 6, 13>
<2, 4, 12>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 10, 13>
<4, 10, 12>
<5, 6, 13>
<5, 10, 13>
<5, 10, 3>
<5, 11, 12>
<6, 10, 13>
<6, 11, 9>  

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
