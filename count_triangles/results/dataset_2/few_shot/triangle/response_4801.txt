Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

Looking at the given information, we can see that a triangle exists when three nodes are interconnected. To find all the triangles, we will check each combination of three nodes if they form a triangle based on the given edges and connections.

After analyzing the graph and connections, we find the following unique triangles:
1. <1, 4, 7>
2. <1, 7, 11>
3. <1, 21, 11>
4. <1, 21, 16>
5. <1, 21, 20>
6. <4, 7, 11>
7. <4, 7, 29>
8. <4, 2, 18>
9. <7, 3, 10>
10. <7, 11, 29>
11. <18, 2, 15>
12. <18, 6, 19>
13. <22, 5, 12>
14. <3, 5, 22>
15. <3, 5, 12>
16. <3, 8, 25>
17. <16, 17, 21>
18. <16, 21, 11>
19. <17, 22, 25>
20. <17, 28, 10>
21. <17, 28, 3>
22. <25, 24, 15>
23. <10, 12, 24>
24. <10, 7, 29>
25. <27, 16, 21>

Therefore, there are 25 unique triangles in the given graph.

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [25].
