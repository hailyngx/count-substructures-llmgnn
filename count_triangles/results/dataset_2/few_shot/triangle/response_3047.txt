Response:
First, let's find all the triangles in the given graph:

1. We initialize an empty list to store all the triangles.
2. For each node in the graph:
   - Consider all possible pairs of connected nodes with the current node.
   - Check if there is an edge between the pair of connected nodes to form a triangle.
   - If a triangle is found, add it to the list of triangles.

After considering all nodes, we count the total number of unique triangles and list them.

Let's calculate the number of triangles step-by-step:

1. <0, 3, 15>
2. <0, 3, 10>
3. <0, 3, 8>
4. <0, 8, 17>
5. <0, 8, 19>
6. <0, 8, 7>
7. <0, 10, 11>
8. <0, 10, 9>
9. <0, 15, 12>
10. <2, 5, 18>
11. <5, 3, 15>
12. <5, 3, 18>
13. <5, 3, 2>
14. <5, 3, 7>
15. <5, 15, 12>
16. <5, 15, 0>
17. <5, 18, 12>
18. <5, 18, 17>
19. <5, 7, 6>
20. <5, 7, 13>
21. <5, 7, 6>
