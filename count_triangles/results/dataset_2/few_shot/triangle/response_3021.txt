Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to first identify the triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 12, 14>
2. Triangle <0, 7, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 18, 3>
4. Triangle <0, 1, 19>
5. Triangle <3, 18, 10>
6. Triangle <3, 14, 9>
7. Triangle <5, 6, 8>
8. Triangle <5, 16, 10>
9. Triangle <9, 1, 19>
10. Triangle <9, 2, 17>
11. Triangle <10, 4, 3>
12. Triangle <10, 14, 16>

There are a total of 12 unique triangles in the given graph.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
