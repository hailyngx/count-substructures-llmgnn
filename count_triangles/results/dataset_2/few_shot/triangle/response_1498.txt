Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph.

To count the triangles, we will look for each possible triangle formed by 3 nodes. We will check if each set of 3 nodes forms a complete triangle by checking if each node is connected to the other two nodes in the set.

The triangles are formed by the following node sets: (0, 2, 6), (0, 2, 3), (0, 2, 5), (0, 3, 5), (1, 3, 8), (1, 5, 8), (1, 7, 9), (2, 3, 4), (4, 7, 8), (4, 8, 9).

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10]. The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 9>.
