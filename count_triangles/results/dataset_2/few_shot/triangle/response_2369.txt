Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we see the triangles formed by the following nodes:
1. Triangle <0, 11, 14>
2. Triangle <1, 9, 10>
3. Triangle <5, 9, 19>
4. Triangle <6, 7, 16>
5. Triangle <7, 9, 13>
6. Triangle <8, 13, 17>
7. Triangle <9, 12, 17>
8. Triangle <9, 13, 19>
9. Triangle <14, 10, 11>

So, there are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
