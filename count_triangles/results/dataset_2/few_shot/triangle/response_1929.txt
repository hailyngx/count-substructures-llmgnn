Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will check for each node the number of triangles it participates in. Since a triangle consists of three nodes, we need to check if there is a path of length 2 between each pair of nodes that form a triangle.

For example, let's take node \(5\) and the nodes it is connected to: \{9, 6, 8, 1, 7\}.

Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 8. Let's check for the triangles involving node 5:

1. Triangle involving nodes 5, 6, 8: Triangle found <5, 6, 8>
2. Triangle involving nodes 5, 1, 7: Triangle found <5, 1, 7>

Next, we will check all nodes for triangles they can form and sum up the total number of triangles.

After checking all nodes, we find that the total number of triangles in the given graph is 4. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
