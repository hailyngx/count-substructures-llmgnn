Response:
Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:
1. We start by checking each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle.
2. A triangle is formed when each node in the triplet is connected to the other two nodes.
3. We can use the given adjacency list to determine if such connections exist.

The total number of triangles is given in brackets:
