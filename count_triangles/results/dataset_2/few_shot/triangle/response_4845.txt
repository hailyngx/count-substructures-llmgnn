Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. From the given edges and nodes, we can determine that there are multiple triangles. Let's list them down:

   - Triangle 1: <1, 3, 9>
   - Triangle 2: <1, 3, 0>
   - Triangle 3: <1, 3, 2>
   - Triangle 4: <1, 9, 6>
   - Triangle 5: <1, 5, 7>
   - Triangle 6: <3, 4, 0>
   - Triangle 7: <3, 4, 7>
   - Triangle 8: <1, 5, 2>
   - Triangle 9: <1, 6, 8>
   - Triangle 10: <3, 8, 9>

2. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
