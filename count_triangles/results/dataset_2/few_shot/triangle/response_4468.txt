Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

To find a triangle, we need a cycle of length 3, which means we need three nodes connected to each other. Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that for a triangle, we need a node that is connected to two other nodes to form a cycle.

In the given graph, we can observe the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 2, 4>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
