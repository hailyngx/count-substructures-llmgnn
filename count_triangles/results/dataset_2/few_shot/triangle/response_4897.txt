Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 1, and node 0

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can observe the following triangles:

<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 6>
<4, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
