Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify triangles by looking for 3 nodes that are all connected to each other.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the triangles in this graph are:
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<0, 1, 9>
<3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
