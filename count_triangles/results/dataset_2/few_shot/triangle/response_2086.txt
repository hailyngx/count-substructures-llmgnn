Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Review the adjacency list and the edges to identify triangles:

From the adjacency list and edges, we can find pairs of nodes that share a common neighbor. These pairs, along with their common neighbor, form triangles.

2. List out the triangles:

<6, 9, 1>
<6, 9, 12>
<6, 12, 4>
<6, 10, 14>
<6, 10, 13>
<9, 14, 10>
<9, 8, 0>
<9, 8, 2>
<9, 8, 11>
<9, 8, 7>
<9, 8, 10>
<9, 2, 12>
<9, 2, 1>
<9, 2, 14>
<9, 3, 5>
<9, 3, 4>
<1, 2, 12>
<3, 5, 11>
<3, 5, 12>
<4, 11, 12>
<4, 10, 13>
<12, 13, 10>
<12, 2, 14>
<12, 5, 0>
<5, 11, 0>
<13, 7, 0>
<13, 10, 6>

3. Count the total number of unique triangles:

[26] (26 triangles in total)

Therefore, there are 26 triangles in the given graph.
