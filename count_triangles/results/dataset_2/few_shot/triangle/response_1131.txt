Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes.

The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 4>
<6, 7, 5>
<6, 5, 1>
<6, 5, 7>
<7, 5, 1>
<8, 9, 4>
<8, 9, 0>
<8, 9, 2>
<8, 4, 2>
<8, 4, 3>
<9, 4, 2>
<9, 4, 3>
<4, 2, 7>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [20].
