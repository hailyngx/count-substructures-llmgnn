Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles by examining each set of three nodes that are interconnected.

Given the adjacency list, we can identify the following unique triangles:
1. <1, 3, 8>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 6, 7>
4. <1, 6, 8>
5. <1, 7, 8>
6. <0, 1, 6>
7. <0, 1, 9>
8. <0, 2, 7>
9. <0, 2, 3>
10. <3, 4, 8>
11. <3, 4, 9>
12. <4, 7, 8>
13. <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [13] triangles in the given graph.
