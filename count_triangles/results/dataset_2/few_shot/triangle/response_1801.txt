Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
[<4, 8, 7> <5, 4, 9> <3, 1, 9> <3, 8, 6> <5, 1, 6> <0, 3, 2>] [6]
