Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 9, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 3, and node 2

Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 9, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Look for triangles formed by nodes connected to each other:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 5>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 1, 3>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 1, 9>
   - Triangle 4: <0, 5, 3>
   - Triangle 5: <1, 3, 5>
   - Triangle 6: <1, 2, 5>
   - Triangle 7: <1, 2, 4>
   - Triangle 8: <1, 3, 6>
   - Triangle 9: <1, 6, 7>
   - Triangle 10: <2, 4, 7>
   - Triangle 11: <3, 4, 7>
   - Triangle 12: <3, 5, 6>
   - Triangle 13: <3, 5, 8>
   - Triangle 14: <3, 6, 7>
   - Triangle 15: <3, 6, 9>
   - Triangle 16: <3, 7, 9>
   - Triangle 17: <3, 8, 9>
   - Triangle 18: <4, 7, 9>
   - Triangle 19: <5, 6, 7>
   - Triangle 20: <5, 2, 4>
   - Triangle 21: <5, 2, 8>
   - Triangle 22: <6, 7, 9>
   - Triangle 23: <8, 9, 2>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles:
   - Total number of triangles: [23]
