Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph: 
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 13>
<1, 7, 14>
<1, 11, 13>
<3, 9, 10>
<3, 10, 11>
<3, 11, 14>
<4, 5, 13>
<6, 7, 14>
<6, 8, 9>
<10, 11, 13>
<10, 13, 0>
<11, 13, 14>
<0, 7, 14>

Total number of triangles: [15]
