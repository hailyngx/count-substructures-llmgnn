Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

As we can see, there are multiple triangles present in the graph. The triangles are formed by the nodes that are connected to each other. 

Counting the triangles:
1. Triangle formed by nodes 4, 5, and 6
2. Triangle formed by nodes 4, 6, and 8
3. Triangle formed by nodes 0, 2, and 5
4. Triangle formed by nodes 0, 2, and 4
5. Triangle formed by nodes 0, 5, and 7
6. Triangle formed by nodes 1, 2, and 4
7. Triangle formed by nodes 1, 2, and 9
8. Triangle formed by nodes 1, 7, and 9
9. Triangle formed by nodes 2, 4, and 9
10. Triangle formed by nodes 3, 4, and 5
11. Triangle formed by nodes 3, 4, and 2
12. Triangle formed by nodes 6, 7, and 0
13. Triangle formed by nodes 4, 6, and 9

Hence, there are a total of 13 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
