Response:
We can find the number of triangles in the given graph by counting all the triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Let's start by listing the unique triangles:

<0, 7, 12>
<0, 7, 14>
<0, 10, 14>
<1, 2, 13>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 5, 10>
<2, 5, 14>
<2, 8, 5>
<3, 7, 14>
<3, 6, 11>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 11, 13>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 10, 14>
<6, 7, 11>
<7, 9, 13>
<7, 12, 14>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles based on the unique triangles listed above:
