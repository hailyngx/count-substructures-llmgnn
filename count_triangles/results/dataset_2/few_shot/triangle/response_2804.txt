Response:
Based on the given graph and the adjacency list provided, we will determine the number of triangles and list the unique triangles found.

A triangle exists when there are three nodes, each of which is connected to the other two nodes. 

Let's list the triangles found: 
<0, 5, 12>
<0, 5, 13>
<0, 11, 13>
<4, 5, 14>
<4, 13, 14>
<4, 10, 13>
<6, 11, 12>
<6, 12, 14>
<6, 3, 12>
<6, 3, 7>
<8, 10, 4>
<8, 10, 7>
<8, 1, 2>
<8, 6, 14>
<9, 3, 13>

Counting the total number of triangles: [14]
