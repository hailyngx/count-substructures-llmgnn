Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 6, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 9, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 0, 2, and node 3

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are interconnected with edges, thus forming triangles. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. <4, 8, 9>
2. <4, 8, 5>
3. <4, 8, 3>
4. <8, 5, 2>
5. <8, 3, 9>
6. <5, 4, 6>
7. <5, 4, 0>
8. <5, 8, 3>
9. <5, 2, 6>
10. <6, 4, 0>
11. <6, 4, 1>
12. <6, 1, 7>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
