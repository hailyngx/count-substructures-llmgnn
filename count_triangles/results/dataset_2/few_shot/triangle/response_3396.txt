Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3)

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step. 

First, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

Now, let's list down the triangles we can find based on the connections mentioned in the graph.

- Triangle 1: <4, 7, 9>
- Triangle 2: <4, 5, 7>
- Triangle 3: <4, 5, 8>
- Triangle 4: <4, 6, 9>
- Triangle 5: <7, 5, 8>
- Triangle 6: <6, 1, 8>
- Triangle 7: <6, 3, 5>
- Triangle 8: <6, 0, 9>
- Triangle 9: <1, 0, 6>
- Triangle 10: <1, 5, 8>
- Triangle 11: <8, 2, 9>
- Triangle 12: <8, 2, 0>

Counting the total number of unique triangles in the graph, there are 12 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
