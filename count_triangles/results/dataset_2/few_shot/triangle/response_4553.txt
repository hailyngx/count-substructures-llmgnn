Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 1) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 14) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 10) (10, 4) (10, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 11, 7, and node 12
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 13, 4, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, 13, and node 12
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 11, 13, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 10, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 14, 2, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 11, 12, and node 14
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 4, and node 1
Node 11 is connected to node 3, 0, 8, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 11, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 14 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
Based on the given graph, here is the list of unique triangles found:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 11, 12>
<2, 6, 13>
<2, 7, 13>
<2, 12, 13>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 8, 11>
<4, 1, 10>
<6, 8, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
