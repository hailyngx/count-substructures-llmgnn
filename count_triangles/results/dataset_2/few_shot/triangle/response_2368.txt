Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in this graph:

1. Count the triangles involving each node:
- Node 0: <0, 2, 13>
- Node 1: <1, 9, 13>, <1, 10, 13>
- Node 2: <2, 9, 11>
- Node 3: No triangles as all its edges involve Node 6 or 4.
- Node 4: No triangles involving 4 as all its edges are connected to Node 7 or 3.
- Node 5: No triangles as all its edges are connected to Node 1 or 12.
- Node 6: <6, 9, 10>, <6, 9, 14>
- Node 7: No triangles as all its edges are connected to Node 6, 4, or 3.
- Node 8: No triangles as there is only one edge.
- Node 9: No new triangles involving 9.
- Node 10: No new triangles involving 10.
- Node 11: No triangles as all its edges are connected to Node 2 or 5.
- Node 12: No triangles as all its edges are connected to Node 0 or 14.
- Node 13: No new triangles involving 13.
- Node 14: No new triangles involving 14.

2. Now, summing up the triangles involving all nodes:
- Total number of triangles = 2

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
