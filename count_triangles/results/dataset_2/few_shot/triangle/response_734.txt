Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0

Response:
Calculating the number of triangles in a graph can be quite complex, especially for larger graphs. However, in this case with 10 nodes and the given adjacency list, we can find the number of triangles by examining each unique triangle in the graph.

Given the adjacency list, we can identify the triangles formed by the nodes. Here are the unique triangles found:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Now, counting the total number of triangles inside brackets []:
