Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 0, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 3

Response:
First, let's start by identifying the triangles in the graph:

1. Node 0, Node 4, Node 1 <0, 4, 1>
2. Node 0, Node 4, Node 5 <0, 4, 5>
3. Node 0, Node 4, Node 8 <0, 4, 8>
4. Node 0, Node 4, Node 9 <0, 4, 9>
5. Node 0, Node 5, Node 6 <0, 5, 6>
6. Node 1, Node 4, Node 2 <1, 4, 2>
7. Node 1, Node 4, Node 9 <1, 4, 9>
8. Node 1, Node 7, Node 2 <1, 7, 2>
9. Node 2, Node 4, Node 8 <2, 4, 8>
10. Node 2, Node 4, Node 9 <2, 4, 9>
11. Node 3, Node 1, Node 4 <3, 1, 4>
12. Node 3, Node 2, Node 4 <3, 2, 4>
13. Node 4, Node 5, Node 8 <4, 5, 8>
14. Node 4, Node 5, Node 6 <4, 5, 6>
15. Node 4, Node 8, Node 6 <4, 8, 6>
16. Node 4, Node 8, Node 9 <4, 8, 9>
17. Node 6, Node 8, Node 9 <6, 8, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles:
