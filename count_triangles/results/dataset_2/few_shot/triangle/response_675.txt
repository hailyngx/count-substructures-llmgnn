Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. From the given edges, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle <6, 1, 9>
- Triangle <6, 1, 3>
- Triangle <6, 1, 4>
- Triangle <6, 3, 5>
- Triangle <6, 3, 1>
- Triangle <6, 3, 4>
- Triangle <6, 8, 4>
- Triangle <9, 1, 2>
- Triangle <9, 1, 4>
- Triangle <9, 1, 0>
- Triangle <9, 3, 4>
- Triangle <9, 4, 0>
- Triangle <1, 3, 4>
- Triangle <1, 4, 8>
- Triangle <3, 4, 8>
- Triangle <8, 4, 0>
These are the triangles formed by considering the given edges. 

2. Let's consider the triangles formed by the graph structure:
- Triangle <6, 1, 3>
- Triangle <6, 1, 4>
- Triangle <6, 1, 9>

3. Let's count the total number of triangles:
Total number of triangles = 16

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
