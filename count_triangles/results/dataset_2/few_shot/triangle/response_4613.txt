Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. From the given adjacency list, we can identify that there are several triangles in the graph. 
2. Let's identify the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 4, 8>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 4, 6>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 4, 2>
   - Triangle 4: <0, 8, 6>
   - Triangle 5: <2, 6, 13>
   - Triangle 6: <2, 6, 11>
   - Triangle 7: <2, 6, 0>
   - Triangle 8: <3, 6, 13>
   - Triangle 9: <3, 6, 11>
   - Triangle 10: <3, 6, 2>
   - Triangle 11: <4, 12, 9>
   - Triangle 12: <4, 12, 14>
   - Triangle 13: <4, 12, 7>
   - Triangle 14: <5, 7, 13>
   - Triangle 15: <7, 12, 13>
   - Triangle 16: <8, 7, 13>

3. Therefore, there are a total of 16 triangles in the given graph [16].
