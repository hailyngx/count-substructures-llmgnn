Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 7, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1 and 6: <0, 1, 6>
- Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 7: <0, 1, 7>
- Node 2 does not form any triangles.
- Node 3 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 9: <0, 3, 9>
- Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 5, 6, and 9: <4, 5, 6> and <4, 6, 9>
- Node 5 does not form any triangles.
- Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 9: <4, 6, 9>
- Node 7 does not form any triangles.
- Node 8 does not form any triangles.
- Node 9 forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 6: <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
