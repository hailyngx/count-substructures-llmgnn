Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are pairwise connected. We can do this by examining each node and checking if there are two edges connecting the node to a pair of other nodes.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 1, 9>
4. <0, 2, 12>
5. <0, 3, 5>
6. <0, 3, 11>
7. <0, 7, 4>
8. <0, 7, 12>
9. <1, 4, 7>
10. <1, 5, 6>
11. <1, 5, 11>
12. <1, 6, 14>
13. <1, 9, 11>
14. <2, 10, 14>
15. <2, 13, 5>
16. <2, 13, 12>
17. <3, 5, 11>
18. <5, 11, 6>
19. <7, 11, 8>
20. <11, 8, 13>
21. <11, 9, 10>
22. <12, 14, 6>

There are a total of 22 triangles in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [22].
