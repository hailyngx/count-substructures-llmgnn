Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to count the number of unique triangles formed by the connected nodes.

After analyzing the information provided, we find that the triangles in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 19, 24>
2. <0, 19, 15>
3. <0, 19, 9>
4. <0, 19, 13>
5. <0, 24, 7>
6. <0, 24, 9>
7. <0, 24, 27>
8. <0, 27, 3>
9. <0, 27, 14>
10. <0, 27, 29>
11. <1, 28, 13>
12. <1, 28, 14>
13. <1, 4, 6>
14. <1, 4, 25>
15. <1, 9, 19>
16. <2, 7, 24>
17. <2, 7, 8>
18. <3, 4, 6>
19. <3, 4, 25>
20. <3, 8, 18>
21. <3, 8, 26>
22. <3, 12, 13>
23. <3, 12, 18>
24. <3, 12, 27>
25. <3, 18, 26>
26. <4, 6, 25>
27. <9, 15, 16>
28. <9, 15, 26>
29. <9, 16, 25>
30. <11, 22, 2>
31. <11, 22, 29>
32. <11, 14, 27>
33. <11, 14, 28>
