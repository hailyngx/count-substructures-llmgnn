Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

As a triangle is formed by three connected nodes, we can search for triangles by examining each unique combination of three nodes. We will iterate through each node, then for each pair of connected nodes to that node, we will check for another connection between the pair of connected nodes forming a triangle.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 10, 4>
2. <0, 10, 6>
3. <0, 11, 12>
4. <0, 11, 6>
5. <0, 16, 2>
6. <0, 16, 4>
7. <0, 16, 6>
8. <0, 4, 10>
9. <0, 6, 11>
10. <0, 6, 10>
11. <1, 8, 2>
12. <10, 12, 9>
13. <13, 17, 12>
14. <13, 17, 15>
15. <15, 17, 13>
16. <15, 17, 19>
17. <16, 18, 2>
18. <16, 18, 13>

There are 18 triangles in total in this graph, which can be denoted as [18].
