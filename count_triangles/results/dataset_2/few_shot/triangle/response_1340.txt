Response:
In this graph, there are 24 triangles. 
The unique triangles found are as follows:
<14, 8, 17>
<14, 9, 12>
<0, 1, 12>
<0, 7, 10>
<0, 7, 15>
<0, 1, 6>
<16, 6, 15>
<16, 6, 1>
<2, 4, 10>
<4, 5, 10>
<15, 12, 19>
<10, 2, 17>
<10, 7, 19>
<10, 7, 15>
<12, 9, 14>
<5, 4, 2>
<5, 4, 13>
<17, 8, 14>
<17, 8, 6>
<13, 10, 5>
<10, 18, 11>
<10, 18, 3>
<12, 1, 6>
<12, 1, 0> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [24].
