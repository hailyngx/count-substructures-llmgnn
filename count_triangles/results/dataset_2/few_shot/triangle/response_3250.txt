Response:
Based on the given information, the graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges.
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Look for triangles in the graph. A triangle consists of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

2. Check each set of three nodes to see if they form a triangle.

3. List the unique triangles found.

After analyzing the given information, the total number of triangles found in the graph is 60 as given below:

[<0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <4, 9, 14>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 12, 19>, <2, 12, 19>, <2, 13, 19>, <3, 12, 17>, <3, 12, 2>, <3, 17, 5>, <3, 2, 13>, <3, 7, 17>, <5, 12, 14>, <5, 12, 17>, <5, 14, 9>, <5, 14, 17>, <5, 17, 7>, <8, 0, 6>, <8, 0, 9>, <8, 0, 19>, <8, 6, 16>, <8, 6, 0>, <9, 14, 5>, <9, 13, 1>, <9, 4, 10>, <14, 5, 17>, <14, 17, 7>, <14, 9, 13>, <0, 8, 19>, <0, 6, 16>, <12, 2, 19>, <12, 5, 17>, <12, 5, 19>, <12, 5, 14>, <12, 3, 17>, <12, 3, 2>, <13, 1, 15>, <13, 1, 2>, <13, 1, 11>, <13, 9, 14>, <6, 16, 17>, <6, 16, 4>, <5, 19, 11>, <5, 19, 18>, <5, 19, 8>, <5, 19, 2>, <16, 17, 7>, <16, 17, 3>, <17, 7, 5>, <17, 7, 14>, <17, 3, 12>, <17, 3, 2>, <17, 3, 7>, <10, 4, 1>, <19, 18, 5>, <19, 18, 11>, <19, 2, 3>] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [60].
