Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 0, 7, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, 2, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph by finding nodes that form triangles.

Node pairs that are connected: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 0), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 1), (5, 8), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 1), (2, 8), (2, 3), (2, 4), (8, 7), (8, 3), (7, 1), (3, 4)

Now, we can identify the triangles formed by the above node pairs.
- Triangle 1: <6, 9, 0>
- Triangle 2: <6, 7, 0>
- Triangle 3: <6, 5, 8>
- Triangle 4: <6, 7, 8>
  
Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
