Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 0, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 4

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [ <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 2>, <3, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 3> ]. There are 5 unique triangles in total.
