Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected. 

From the given graph:
- Node 0 forms triangles with node 1 and node 5.
- Node 1 forms triangles with node 0, node 5, and node 8.
- Node 2 forms triangles with node 1 and node 8.
- Node 3 does not form any triangles.
- Node 4 forms a triangle with node 5.
- Node 5 forms triangles with node 0, node 1, and node 4.
- Node 6 does not form any triangles.
- Node 7 does not form any triangles.
- Node 8 forms a triangle with node 1.
- Node 9 forms triangles with node 5 and node 1.

Therefore, the unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<0, 1, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
