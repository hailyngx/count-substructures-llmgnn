Response:
We can identify the triangles in the graph by looking for nodes that have edges connecting them in such a way that they form a closed loop. Here, a triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected by edges in a way that they form three sides of a triangle.

Let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

[33] triangles

Here are the unique triangles found:
