Response:
[count the number of triangles in the given graph]

In order to count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Let's identify the triangles in the graph based on the provided information:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 21>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 7, 25>
4. Triangle <0, 7, 18>
5. Triangle <0, 4, 8>
6. Triangle <0, 27, 6>
7. Triangle <0, 27, 13>
8. Triangle <0, 27, 8>
9. Triangle <0, 27, 6>
10. Triangle <0, 10, 2>
11. Triangle <0, 29, 15>
12. Triangle <0, 29, 19>
13. Triangle <0, 29, 2>
14. Triangle <0, 29, 19>
15. Triangle <2, 26, 10>
16. Triangle <2, 18, 17>
17. Triangle <2, 18, 14>
18. Triangle <2, 10, 26>
19. Triangle <2, 10, 9>
20. Triangle <2, 29, 19>
21. Triangle <2, 29, 15>
22. Triangle <4, 21, 28>
23. Triangle <4, 21, 22>
24. Triangle <4, 8, 27>
25. Triangle <2, 25, 22>
26. Triangle <2, 25, 7>
27. Triangle <7, 25, 1>
28. Triangle <7, 18, 17>
29. Triangle <10, 26, 12>
30. Triangle <10, 26, 2>
31. Triangle <10, 9, 16>
32. Triangle <17, 18, 14>
33. Triangle <19, 29, 15>
34. Triangle <19, 29, 17>
35. Triangle <21, 20, 28>
36. Triangle <21, 20, 22>
37. Triangle <21, 22, 28>
38. Triangle <22, 25, 7>
39. Triangle <22, 25, 1>
40. Triangle <23, 3, 12>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [40].
