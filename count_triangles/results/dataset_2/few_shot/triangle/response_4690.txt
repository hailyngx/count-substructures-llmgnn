Response:
Let's start by finding the triangles in the graph:

- We will check each possible triangle in the graph by looking at each combination of three nodes connected to each other.
- If a triangle is found, we will list it only once in the output.
- Count the total number of unique triangles found.

After examining the given graph, the total number of triangles found is 6. The unique triangles are:

<4, 1, 7>
<4, 1, 11>
<4, 1, 19>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 0, 15>
<13, 2, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
