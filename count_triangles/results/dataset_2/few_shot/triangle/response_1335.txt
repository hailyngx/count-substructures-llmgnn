Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (9, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 6, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 4, 5, and 7: <0, 4, 5> and <0, 5, 7>.
- Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 4, 5, and 7: <1, 4, 5>.
- Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 4, 5, and 6: <3, 4, 5> and <3, 5, 6>.
- Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 5, 6, and 3: <4, 5, 6>.
- Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 6, 7, and 4: <5, 6, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
