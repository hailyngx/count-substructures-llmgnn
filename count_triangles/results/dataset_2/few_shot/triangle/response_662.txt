Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are fully connected to each other.

Given that the graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges, the total number of triangles can be calculated by analyzing the connectivity of the nodes.

Let's first identify the unique triangles one by one:
1. <3, 1, 6>
2. <3, 1, 4>
3. <3, 6, 2>
4. <3, 6, 7>
5. <3, 7, 2>
6. <4, 1, 6>
7. <4, 5, 9>
8. <4, 5, 7>
9. <4, 9, 7>
10. <5, 7, 9>
11. <0, 3, 9>
12. <0, 8, 5>
13. <0, 8, 6>
14. <2, 6, 7>
15. <2, 3, 7>
16. <2, 3, 9>

Now, we can count the total number of triangles found above and output the result in brackets:
