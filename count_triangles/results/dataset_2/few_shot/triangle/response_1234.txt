Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, we need to calculate the total number of triangles by examining every possible triangle formed by three nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

Given the adjacency list, we can find the triangles by checking for common neighbors for each node pair. 

The total number of triangles in this graph is [30].

The unique triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 8, 11>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 8, 5>
<1, 4, 14>
