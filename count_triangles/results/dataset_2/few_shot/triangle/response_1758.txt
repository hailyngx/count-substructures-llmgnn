Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, 6, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 3

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are:
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 9>

So, the total number of triangles found in the graph is [5].
