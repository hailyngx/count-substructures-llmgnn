Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 5, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
[<0, 5, 8>, <3, 7, 9>] at least.
