Response:
Following the given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will count the number of triangles present.

After analyzing the graph, we find several triangles:
<2, 12, 14>
<1, 9, 12>
<1, 13, 5>
<1, 13, 9>
<4, 11, 10>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 5, 13>
<0, 2, 14>
<8, 13, 2>
<2, 3, 11>
<2, 0, 7>
<9, 12, 14>

There are 12 unique triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
