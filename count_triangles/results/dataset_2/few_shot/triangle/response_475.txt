Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the adjacency list given, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph:  

Let's examine each node with its neighbors to identify triangles:
- Node 0: 5-0-8 form a triangle.
- Node 1: 3-1-2 form a triangle.
- Node 2: No triangles.
- Node 3: 3-1-5 form a triangle.
- Node 4: No triangles.
- Node 5: No triangles.
- Node 6: No triangles.
- Node 7: 7-3-4 form a triangle.
- Node 8: No triangles.
- Node 9: 9-6-7 form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles are <5, 0, 8>, <3, 1, 2>, and <7, 3, 4>.
