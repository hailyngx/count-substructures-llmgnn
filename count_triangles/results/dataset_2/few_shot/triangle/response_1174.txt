Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are:
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 8, 9>
<2, 8, 3>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
