Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. From the provided adjacency list, identify the triangles:
   - <4, 7, 12>
   - <4, 9, 11>
   - <4, 1, 10>
   - <4, 1, 14>
   - <4, 5, 2>
   - <4, 5, 6>
   - <4, 14, 9>
   - <4, 11, 10>
   - <4, 7, 0>
   - <4, 7, 3>
   - <4, 7, 6>
   - <4, 11, 9>
   - <4, 5, 6>
   - <7, 3, 2>
   - <7, 6, 12>
   - <9, 11, 4>
   - <9, 14, 1>
   - <9, 13, 14>
   - <9, 13, 8>
   - <9, 13, 6>
   - <10, 1, 14>
   - <10, 8, 2>
   - <10, 2, 5>
   - <10, 11, 4>
