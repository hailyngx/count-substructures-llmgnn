Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by calculating the number of triangles each node is a part of and then summing them up. 

Calculating the number of triangles for each node:
- Node 0 is a part of 0 triangles.
- Node 1 is a part of 0 triangles.
- Node 2 is a part of 1 triangle: <2, 8, 10>.
- Node 3 is a part of 2 triangles: <3, 6, 12> and <3, 6, 0>.
- Node 4 is a part of 2 triangles: <4, 12, 2> and <4, 9, 12>.
- Node 5 is a part of 2 triangles: <5, 10, 8> and <5, 10, 9>.
- Node 6 is a part of 0 triangles.
- Node 7 is a part of 0 triangles.
- Node 8 is a part of 2 triangles: <8, 10, 1> and <8, 13, 5>.
- Node 9 is a part of 2 triangles: <9, 2, 8> and <9, 10, 5>.
- Node 10 is a part of 2 triangles: <10, 8, 1> and <10, 9, 5>.
- Node 11 is a part of 1 triangle: <11, 13, 5>.
- Node 12 is a part of 1 triangle: <12, 4, 9>.
- Node 13 is a part of 2 triangles: <13, 14, 4> and <13, 14, 11>.
- Node 14 is a part of 0 triangles.

Adding up the number of triangles each node is in, we get:
0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 17

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
