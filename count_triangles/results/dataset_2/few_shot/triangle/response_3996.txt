Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the sets of 3 nodes that form a triangle. A triangle is formed when each node is connected to both of the other two nodes. Let's list down the unique triangles present in the graph and then count them.

Unique triangles in the graph:
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [6]
