Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph given the adjacency list and the edges.

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

Triangle 1: <2, 9, 14>
Triangle 2: <0, 1, 2>
Triangle 3: <0, 1, 8>
Triangle 4: <0, 7, 8>
Triangle 5: <0, 2, 9>
Triangle 6: <0, 7, 10>
Triangle 7: <0, 8, 13>
Triangle 8: <1, 2, 12>
Triangle 9: <2, 9, 12>
Triangle 10: <4, 12, 14>
Triangle 11: <7, 9, 10>
Triangle 12: <7, 9, 12>
Triangle 13: <3, 4, 11>
Triangle 14: <3, 4, 13>
Triangle 15: <3, 4, 14>
Triangle 16: <3, 5, 7>
Triangle 17: <3, 6, 13>
Triangle 18: <5, 7, 9>
Triangle 19: <9, 10, 11>
Triangle 20: <9, 11, 14>
Triangle 21: <10, 11, 12>

Hence, there are [21] triangles in the given graph.
