Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by examining each possible triangle formed by the nodes. In this case, we observe that there are 7 unique triangles in the graph:
<0, 4, 1>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <5, 3, 6>, <5, 3, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
