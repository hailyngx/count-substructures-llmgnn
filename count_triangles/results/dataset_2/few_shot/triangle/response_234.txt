Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 7, 8, and node 4
