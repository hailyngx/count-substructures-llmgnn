Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. From the given edges, we can identify triangles based on the connections between nodes. For example, if nodes A, B, and C are connected forming a triangle, we would have edges (A, B), (B, C), and (A, C) all present in the graph.

2. Given the adjacency list for each node, we can find potential triangles involving each node.

3. After analyzing the graph, the count of triangles found is [22].
