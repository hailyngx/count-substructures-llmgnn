Node 18 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 19 is connected to node 5, and node 1

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<1, 11, 13>
<2, 6, 18>
<3, 12, 16>
<3, 17, 4>
<3, 9, 15>
<4, 10, 17>
<5, 8, 15>
<5, 18, 19>

So, the total number of triangles is [8].
