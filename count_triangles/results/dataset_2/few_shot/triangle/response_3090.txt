Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. **Identifying triangles:**
- A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.
- To find a triangle, we need to look for nodes that are connected to each other in such a way that they complete a triangle.

2. **Calculating the number of triangles:**
- We will check each combination of 3 connected nodes to see if they form a triangle.
- We will consider each triangle only once to avoid duplicate counting.

3. **Results:**
- Based on the given graph information, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
- The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
  - <3, 4, 8>
  - <3, 10, 14>
  - <10, 12, 17>
