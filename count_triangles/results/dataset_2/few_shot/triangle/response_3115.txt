Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

1. For each node, check if there are two edges between its neighboring nodes. If such pairs exist, form a triangle with the current node.

2. Calculate the total number of triangles by counting the unique triangles formed across all nodes.

The unique triangles are: 
<5, 3, 13>
<5, 0, 1>
<1, 6, 12>
<1, 8, 13>
<0, 6, 10>
<0, 5, 12>
<6, 10, 0>
<12, 1, 6>
<6, 12, 2>
<11, 9, 4>
<11, 4, 14>
<11, 14, 12>
<4, 14, 12>
<7, 10, 6>
<7, 2, 8>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
