Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify the triangles formed by each node:
- Node 0: <0, 8, 15>, <0, 6, 17>
- Node 1: No triangles
- Node 2: No triangles
- Node 3: <3, 5, 15>, <3, 5, 14>, <3, 8, 15>, <3, 8, 14>
- Node 4: <4, 15, 17>
- Node 5: <5, 11, 19>, <5, 16, 18>
- Node 6: <6, 10, 1>, <6, 1, 18>, <6, 1, 16>
- Node 7: No triangles
- Node 8: <8, 0, 15>, <8, 0, 17>, <8, 6, 17>
- Node 9: No triangles
- Node 10: No triangles
- Node 11: No triangles
- Node 12: No triangles
- Node 13: <13, 14, 18>
- Node 14: <14, 3, 18>, <14, 3, 13>
- Node 15: No triangles
- Node 16: No triangles
- Node 17: <17, 4, 7>
- Node 18: No triangles
- Node 19: No triangles

2. Counting the total number of triangles:
   - <0, 8, 15>, <0, 6, 17>, <3, 5, 15>, <3, 5, 14>, <3, 8, 15>, <3, 8, 14>, <4, 15, 17>, <5, 11, 19>, <5, 16, 18>, <6, 10, 1>, <6, 1, 18>, <6, 1, 16>, <8, 0, 15>, <8, 0, 17>, <8, 6, 17>, <13, 14, 18>, <14, 3, 18>, <14, 3, 13>, <17, 4, 7>
   
Therefore, there are a total of [18] triangles in the given graph.
