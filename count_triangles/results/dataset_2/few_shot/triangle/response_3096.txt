Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, 7, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
[<0, 1, 9> <0, 6, 7> <1, 4, 7> <2, 3, 6> <2, 3, 8> <2, 4, 6> <2, 4, 8> <5, 2, 8> <5, 3, 6> <5, 8, 2>]
