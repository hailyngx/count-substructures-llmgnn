Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
[<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 8>]
