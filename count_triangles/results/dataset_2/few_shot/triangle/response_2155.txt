Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 1, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles where each triangle consists of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can list down the triangles present in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
4. Triangle <3, 4, 8>
5. Triangle <5, 9, 0>
6. Triangle <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
