Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
There are [22] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 5, 6>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 9, 1>, <6, 8, 4>, <6, 8, 5>, <7, 5, 9>, <8, 2, 9>, <8, 3, 9>, <9, 1, 5>.
