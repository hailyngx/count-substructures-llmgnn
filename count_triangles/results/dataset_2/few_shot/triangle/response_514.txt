Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 9, and node 5

Node 6 is connected to node 1, 9, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in this graph.

To count the total number of triangles, we will look for nodes that form triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <1, 3, 9>
5. <1, 6, 9>
6. <3, 4, 7>
7. <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
