Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's start by checking each possible triangle formed by the edges given:

1. Triangle: <1, 5, 7>
2. Triangle: <1, 3, 7>
3. Triangle: <1, 4, 7>
4. Triangle: <1, 6, 0>
5. Triangle: <3, 5, 7>
6. Triangle: <3, 7, 8>
7. Triangle: <4, 9, 7>
8. Triangle: <4, 7, 1>
9. Triangle: <4, 7, 9>
10. Triangle: <4, 7, 3>
11. Triangle: <4, 8, 0>

Therefore, there are 11 unique triangles in the given graph, which can be seen above. So, the total number of triangles is [11].
