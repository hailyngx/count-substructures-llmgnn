Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph can be found by counting all the unique triangles formed by sets of three connected nodes.
First, let's find all the triangles in the graph:

<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 7, 14>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 10, 15>
<2, 6, 14>
<3, 6, 14>
<4, 8, 1>
<4, 8, 0>
<4, 9, 17>
<6, 17, 9>
<6, 17, 16>
<6, 13, 15>
<12, 9, 17>
<12, 9, 4>
<12, 9, 18>
<12, 18, 11>
<12, 18, 11>
<14, 15, 10>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [19].
