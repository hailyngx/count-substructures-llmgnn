Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 11) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 14, 11, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 10, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, 13, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 10, 2, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 10, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 13, 2, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 11
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 12, 14, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 11, 14, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 3
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 0

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in this graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 3, 14>
<0, 13, 5>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 12> 

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
