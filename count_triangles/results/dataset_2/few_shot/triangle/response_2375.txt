Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
In order to count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all unique triangles formed by the connected nodes. Let's list the triangles and then find their total count:

1. <5, 4, 7>
2. <5, 4, 8>
3. <5, 7, 8>
4. <5, 7, 9>
5. <5, 8, 9>
6. <4, 0, 1>
7. <4, 0, 2>
8. <4, 1, 0>
9. <4, 2, 0>
10. <7, 6, 3>
11. <7, 6, 8>
12. <7, 3, 8>
13. <6, 3, 8>
14. <6, 3, 9>
15. <6, 8, 9>
16. <3, 8, 9>
17. <5, 4, 0>
18. <5, 0, 9>
19. <4, 1, 0>
20. <4, 2, 0>

There are 20 unique triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
