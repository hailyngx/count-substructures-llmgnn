Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
There are 3 triangles in this graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<1, 8, 9>
<0, 1, 3>
<2, 3, 7>

So, the total number of triangles is [3].
