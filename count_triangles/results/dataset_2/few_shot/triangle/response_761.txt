Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 7, 3, and 6.
   Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 2, and 8.
   Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 8, and 6.
   Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 0, and 8.
   Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
   Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 0.
   Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 2, and 0.
   Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 0, and 3.
   Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 3, and 2.
   Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 2, 1, 7, and 0.

2. Determine the triangles in the graph:
   - <0, 5, 6>
   - <0, 5, 9>
   - <0, 6, 9>
   - <3, 4, 0>
   - <3, 4, 7>
   - <0, 7, 9>
   - <1, 2, 6>
   - <1, 2, 8>
   - <1, 6, 9>
   - <1, 8, 9>
   - <2, 6, 9>
   - <2, 8, 9>

3. Count the total number of unique triangles: [12]

So, there are 12 unique triangles in the given graph.
