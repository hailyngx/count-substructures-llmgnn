Response:
We will calculate the number of triangles in the graph step-by-step. 

1. For each node, we will list out the nodes it is connected to:
   - Node 0: {5, 11, 2, 8, 4}
   - Node 1: {3, 14, 12, 7}
   - Node 2: {5, 3, 8, 0}
   - Node 3: {1, 11, 7, 2, 8}
   - Node 4: {9, 12, 13, 0}
   - Node 5: {2, 12, 11, 0}
   - Node 6: {11, 14}
   - Node 7: {1, 3, 12}
   - Node 8: {3, 2, 0}
   - Node 9: {4, 14, 10, 12}
   - Node 10: {9, 11, 13}
   - Node 11: {5, 3, 10, 0, 6, 12}
   - Node 12: {5, 9, 1, 11, 7, 4}
   - Node 13: {10, 4, 14}
   - Node 14: {9, 1, 6, 13}

2. For each node, we will find the triangles it is part of:
   - Node 0 triangles: <0, 5, 11> and <0, 2, 8>
   - Node 1 triangles: No triangles
   - Node 2 triangles: No triangles
   - Node 3 triangles: No triangles
   - Node 4 triangles: No triangles
   - Node 5 triangles: <5, 11, 0>
   - Node 6 triangles: No triangles
   - Node 7 triangles: No triangles
   - Node 8 triangles: No triangles
   - Node 9 triangles: No triangles
   - Node 10 triangles: No triangles
   - Node 11 triangles: <11, 5, 0>
   - Node 12 triangles: No triangles
   - Node 13 triangles: No triangles
   - Node 14 triangles: No triangles

3. Total number of triangles in the graph: [2]
   
Unique triangles found: <0, 5, 11>, <0, 2, 8>
