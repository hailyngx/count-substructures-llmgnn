Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all triangles formed by sets of 3 nodes that are mutually connected.

The triangles in this graph are: <1, 3, 6>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 8>.

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
