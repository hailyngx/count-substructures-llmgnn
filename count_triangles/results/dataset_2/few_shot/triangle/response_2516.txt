Response:
Calculating the total number of triangles in this graph can be done step-by-step:

1. We know that a triangle consists of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. This means that for any three nodes forming a triangle, each node must have an edge connecting it to the other two nodes.

2. The number of triangles in a graph can be determined by finding all possible combinations of three nodes among the 10 nodes and then checking if all three nodes are connected to each other.

3. Given the graph and adjacency list information, we can identify the following unique triangles:
   - <0, 1, 4>
   - <1, 2, 4>
   - <1, 3, 5>
   - <1, 4, 7>
   - <2, 3, 6>
   - <2, 4, 8>
   - <3, 5, 6>
   - <4, 5, 8>

4. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
