Response:
Let's start by identifying the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are mutually connected to each other.

Based on the given edges and adjacency list, here are the triangles identified:
- Triangle 1: <1, 5, 13>
- Triangle 2: <1, 16, 10>
- Triangle 3: <1, 16, 20>
- Triangle 4: <1, 19, 26>
- Triangle 5: <2, 11, 17>
- Triangle 6: <2, 11, 23>
- Triangle 7: <2, 12, 29>
- Triangle 8: <2, 17, 26>
- Triangle 9: <3, 21, 25>
- Triangle 10: <4, 5, 13>
- Triangle 11: <4, 6, 15>
- Triangle 12: <5, 13, 29>
- Triangle 13: <8, 14, 28>
- Triangle 14: <9, 19, 26>
- Triangle 15: <9, 20, 26>
- Triangle 16: <9, 20, 16>
- Triangle 17: <11, 17, 26>
- Triangle 18: <14, 8, 15>
- Triangle 19: <18, 29, 12>
- Triangle 20: <20, 16, 10>
- Triangle 21: <20, 26, 17>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 21.  
So, the output is:  
[21]
