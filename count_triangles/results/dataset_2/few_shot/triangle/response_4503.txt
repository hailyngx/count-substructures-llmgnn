Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by finding all possible triangles formed by nodes. Since counting them manually can be quite tedious, the best approach is to look for triangles formed by the edges directly. 

To count the number of triangles, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify each triangle from the given edges.
2. Count the total number of distinct triangles found.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<5, 9, 1>
<5, 9, 2>
<5, 9, 13>
<5, 9, 3>
<5, 13, 7>
<5, 2, 13>
<5, 2, 4>
<5, 4, 6>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 4>
<5, 6, 12>
<9, 1, 6>
<9, 2, 13>
<9, 2, 4>
<9, 3, 7>
<1, 6, 4>
<1, 6, 11>
<6, 4, 2>
<6, 4, 11>
<6, 4, 12>
<6, 11, 14>
<6, 12, 14>
<4, 10, 14>
<3, 7, 13>
<11, 8, 7>
<11, 8, 14>
<11, 0, 2>
<11, 0, 7>
<11, 2, 7>
<11, 2, 14>
<11, 6, 14>
<14, 7, 12>
<14, 7, 6>
<14, 7, 11>
<14, 7, 10>
<14, 6, 12>
<14, 6, 11>

The number of distinct triangles is 36. 
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [36].
