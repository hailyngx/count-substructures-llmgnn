Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the graph step-by-step:

1. Look for triangles formed by nodes connected directly:
   - <1, 4, 17>
   - <1, 4, 25>
   - <2, 5, 6>
   - <3, 14, 25>
   - <3, 21, 22>
   - <3, 21, 15>
   - <4, 17, 20>
   - <4, 25, 20>
   - <5, 6, 15>
   - <7, 20, 22>
   - <8, 1, 21>
   - <8, 3, 21>
   - <14, 29, 25>
   - <16, 17, 20>
   - <0, 26, 29>
   - <0, 28, 15>
   - <0, 28, 5>
   - <0, 3, 21>
   - <9, 10, 23>
   - <12, 9, 7>
   - <12, 16, 17>
   - <15, 22, 21>
   - <15, 24, 27>
   - <15, 24, 18>
   - <18, 25, 20>
   - <27, 24, 18>
   
2. Count the total number of triangles. Each unique triangle is counted only once:
   - Number of triangles = 26

Therefore, there are [26] triangles in the given graph.
