Response:
Let's start by finding the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Look for all triangles by checking all possible combinations of three nodes connected by edges.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles found.

After checking all possible combinations, the triangles in the graph are:
- <3, 4, 14>
- <3, 4, 11>
- <3, 8, 14>
- <4, 7, 11>
- <4, 7, 14>
- <4, 13, 14>
- <6, 9, 1>
- <6, 9, 4>
- <6, 1, 8>
- <6, 1, 3>
- <6, 1, 9>
- <8, 9, 1>
- <8, 9, 13>
- <11, 7, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
