Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all unique triangles formed by a set of three nodes that are fully connected with each other.

After analyzing the given graph, the triangles formed in the graph are as follows:

1. <0, 2, 7>
2. <0, 2, 14>
3. <0, 7, 14>
4. <1, 2, 3>
5. <1, 2, 14>
6. <1, 3, 4>
7. <1, 4, 13>
8. <1, 12, 14>
9. <2, 5, 3>
10. <2, 5, 6>
11. <2, 5, 7>
12. <2, 1, 14>
13. <2, 7, 14>
14. <3, 4, 13>
15. <4, 6, 13>
16. <4, 8, 6>
17. <4, 11, 6>
18. <6, 11, 13>
19. <7, 10, 12>
20. <7, 0, 14>
21. <9, 0, 12>
22. <9, 5, 6>
23. <9, 5, 11>
24. <9, 11, 0>
25. <12, 1, 10>
26. <13, 6, 14>
