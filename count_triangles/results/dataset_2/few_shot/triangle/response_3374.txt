Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step. 

1. Start with each node and its neighbors:
   - Node 0: 5, 9, 6, 7, 3, 2
   - Node 1: 5, 6, 3, 2
   - Node 2: 4, 1, 0
   - Node 3: 7, 1, 0
   - Node 4: 5, 9, 6, 8, 2
   - Node 5: 9, 8, 1, 4, 0, 7
   - Node 6: 1, 4, 0
   - Node 7: 5, 0, 3, 8
   - Node 8: 5, 4, 7
   - Node 9: 5, 4, 0

2. Identify the triangles:
   - Triangles involving node 0: <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>
   - Triangles involving node 1: No triangles
   - Triangles involving node 2: No triangles
   - Triangles involving node 3: No triangles
   - Triangles involving node 4: <4, 5, 9>
   - Triangles involving node 5: <5, 7, 0>, <5, 4, 8>, <5, 7, 8>
   - Triangles involving node 6: No triangles
   - Triangles involving node 7: <7, 8, 5>
   - Triangles involving node 8: No triangles
   - Triangles involving node 9: No triangles

3. Calculate the total count of triangles: [5]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5].
