Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 0
