Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

Looking at the graph, we can see that a triangle is a set of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes. 

We have the following triangles:
<5, 9, 6>
<5, 9, 2>
<5, 9, 0>
<5, 6, 4>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 2, 4>
<5, 2, 7>
<5, 0, 9>
<5, 0, 2>
<9, 6, 4>
<9, 6, 7>
<9, 2, 4>
<9, 2, 7>
<6, 4, 7>
<5, 6, 9>

Thus, there are total of 15 triangles in the graph.

So, the total number of triangles is [15].
