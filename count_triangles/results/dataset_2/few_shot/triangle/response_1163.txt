Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other.

There are 9 unique triangles in this graph:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [9].
