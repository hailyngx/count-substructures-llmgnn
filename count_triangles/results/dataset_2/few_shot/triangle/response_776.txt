Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are fully connected to each other.

Looking at the given graph, the triangles can be formed by checking each combination of three nodes to see if they are fully connected.

Nodes that can form a triangle are: 
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 7
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 6
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 7
- Node 0, Node 4, Node 7
- Node 0, Node 7, Node 8
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 7
- Node 2, Node 3, Node 6
- Node 2, Node 3, Node 7
- Node 2, Node 6, Node 7
- Node 3, Node 6, Node 7
- Node 4, Node 7, Node 8

So, there are a total of 12 unique triangles. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
