Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for unique triangles formed by nodes that are interconnected. Here is the calculation step-by-step:

1. Count the number of triangles:

Based on the given graph and adjacency list, the triangles formed by interconnected nodes are:

<4, 9, 5>
<4, 9, 7>
<4, 9, 1>
<4, 3, 8>
<4, 3, 1>
<9, 5, 2>
<9, 5, 3>
<7, 1, 9>
<8, 3, 0>
<8, 3, 4>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles found: [10] 

Therefore, there are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph.
