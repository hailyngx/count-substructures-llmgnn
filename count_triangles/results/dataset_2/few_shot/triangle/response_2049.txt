Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 3

Response:
The triangles in the given graph can be broken down as follows:
- Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 6, 4, and 3.
- Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 6, 4, and 2.
- Node 2 forms triangles with nodes 5, 4, and 8.
- Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 5, 9, and 8.
- Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 9, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 9, 2, and 3.
- Node 6 forms triangles with nodes 9, 1, and 4.

Based on the above breakdown, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7]. 
The unique triangles found are: <0, 6, 3>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 9, 3>, <6, 4, 9>.
