Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 1

Response:
Based on the given undirected graph and adjacency list, let's find the total number of triangles present in the graph:

To count the number of triangles, we analyze each possible triangle formed by the edges. A triangle is formed if three nodes are mutually connected to each other.

The unique triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 8>
<3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
