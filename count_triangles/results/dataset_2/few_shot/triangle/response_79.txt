Response:
Following the steps to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

Step 1: Identify triangles using nodes connected by edges.
- As a triangle consists of three nodes connected by edges, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.
- Given the adjacency list, we can identify possible triangles by looking at intersections of connections between nodes.

Step 2: Count the identified triangles and list them.
- Traverse through each set of three nodes, evaluate if they form a triangle, and count the total number of triangles found.

After analyzing the given graph and following the steps mentioned, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].

Unique triangles found:
1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 1, 10>
4. <0, 1, 11>
5. <1, 5, 9>
6. <1, 5, 11>
7. <1, 6, 9>
8. <1, 8, 9>
9. <4, 6, 10>
10. <4, 6, 14>
11. <6, 9, 14>
12. <9, 10, 14>
