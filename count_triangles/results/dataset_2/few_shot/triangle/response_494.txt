Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph step-by-step. 

First, we identify triangles by looking for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to both of the other two. 

From the given graph, we can find the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 3, 8>
3. <0, 5, 2>
4. <1, 4, 6>
5. <1, 4, 8>
6. <1, 6, 8>
7. <1, 7, 8>
8. <1, 3, 7>
9. <2, 3, 6>
10. <2, 3, 0>
11. <3, 7, 8>
12. <6, 4, 1>
13. <6, 4, 9>
14. <6, 9, 8>
15. <6, 1, 9>
16. <9, 3, 1>
17. <9, 3, 6>
18. <9, 1, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of 18 triangles in the given graph. 
The answer is [18].
