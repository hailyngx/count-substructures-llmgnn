Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 2, 6, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 9, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in the graph. 

For any triangle in a graph, we need three nodes that are all pairwise connected. Let's list the unique triangles:

<4, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 6>
<4, 7, 5>
<4, 9, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<7, 9, 8>
<7, 5, 8>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 6, 8>
<5, 0, 1>

Based on the unique triangles found, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
