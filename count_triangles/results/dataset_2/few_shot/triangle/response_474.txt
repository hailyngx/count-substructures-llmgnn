Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify unique triangles.

1. Triangles formed by node 0:
- <0, 2, 8>

2. Triangles formed by node 1:
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 5, 8>

3. Triangles formed by node 2:
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 5, 9>

4. Triangles formed by node 3:
No triangles formed by this node.

5. Triangles formed by node 4:
- <4, 6, 7>

6. Triangles formed by node 5:
- <5, 6, 7>

7. Triangles formed by node 6:
No new triangles formed by this node.

8. Triangles formed by node 7:
No triangles formed by this node.

9. Triangles formed by node 8:
No triangles formed by this node.

10. Triangles formed by node 9:
No new triangles formed by this node.

Counting the triangles found above, we have in total:
[7 triangles]
