Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8)
