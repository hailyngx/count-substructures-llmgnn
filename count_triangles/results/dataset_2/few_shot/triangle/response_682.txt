Response:
Let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle: <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle: <0, 1, 5>
3. Triangle: <0, 1, 12>
4. Triangle: <0, 3, 6>
5. Triangle: <0, 5, 7>
6. Triangle: <0, 5, 14>
7. Triangle: <1, 4, 11>
8. Triangle: <1, 5, 14>
9. Triangle: <2, 8, 12>
10. Triangle: <4, 7, 11>
11. Triangle: <5, 6, 14>

Therefore, there are a total of 11 triangles in the given graph.
