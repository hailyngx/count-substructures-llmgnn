Response:
[Finding the number of triangles in a graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges:]

The first step in finding the number of triangles in the given graph would be to identify all the possible triangles that can be formed using the edges provided. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other, forming a closed loop.

After examining the given graph's edges and adjacency list for each node, we can list down the unique triangles. 

<3, 6, 13>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 13, 14>
<3, 1, 11>
<3, 1, 14>
<5, 2, 9>
<6, 9, 7>
<10, 11, 0>
<10, 11, 8>
<12, 8, 10>
<12, 8, 4>
<12, 0, 10>
<12, 0, 14>
<13, 8, 14>
<14, 7, 12>

Based on the identified unique triangles, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
