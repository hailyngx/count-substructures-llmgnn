Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. From the given graph, we can see that the following triangles are present:   
   <11, 16, 1>, <11, 16, 28>, <11, 26, 6>, <1, 16, 10>, <1, 16, 11>, <1, 0, 29>, <1, 0, 14>, <1, 0, 26>, <1, 8, 13>, <1, 3, 16>, <8, 13, 7>, <13, 14, 25>, <12, 27, 26>, <12, 27, 6>, <12, 6, 24>, <27, 26, 0>, <4, 9, 19>, <4, 9, 7>, <16, 10, 19>, <16, 11, 18>, <24, 10, 19>, <24, 6, 15>, <24, 6, 18>, <24, 5, 19>, <20, 7, 9>, <21, 20, 7>, <21, 20, 1>, <21, 2, 13>, <21, 2, 25>, <21, 2, 15>, <21, 25, 23>

2. Total number of triangles = 30

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [30].
