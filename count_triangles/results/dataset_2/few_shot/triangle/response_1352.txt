Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
[<0, 2, 4> <2, 4, 9> <3, 5, 6> <0, 4, 9> <6, 7, 8> <0, 2, 9> <1, 4, 8> <0, 3, 7> <2, 6, 8> <1, 5, 8> <0, 3, 5>]
