Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. Check for triangles involving each node:
   - Node 0: Triangle <0, 15, 17>
   - Node 1: No triangles
   - Node 2: No triangles
   - Node 3: No triangles
   - Node 4: No triangles
   - Node 5: Triangle <5, 9, 15>
   - Node 6: No triangles
   - Node 7: No triangles
   - Node 8: No triangles
   - Node 9: No triangles
   - Node 10: Triangle <10, 12, 14>
   - Node 11: No triangles
   - Node 12: No triangles
   - Node 13: No triangles
   - Node 14: No triangles
   - Node 15: No triangles
   - Node 16: No triangles
   - Node 17: No triangles
   - Node 18: No triangles
   - Node 19: No triangles

2. Total number of triangles: 2
3. List of triangles: <0, 15, 17>, <5, 9, 15>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
