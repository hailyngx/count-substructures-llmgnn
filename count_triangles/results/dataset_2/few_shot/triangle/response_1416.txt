Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of triangles.
In a triangle, each vertex is connected to the other two vertices. So, we will need to count how many triangles can be formed using each node as a potential starting point.

Step 2: Analyze each node to find triangles.
Here are the triangles found in the given graph: 
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 9>

Step 3: Calculate the total number of triangles.
Adding up the unique triangles found, we have a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
