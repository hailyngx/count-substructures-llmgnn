Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting all the unique triangles formed by three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's calculate this:

- First, let's determine the total number of triangles by counting them: 

There are a few different triangles that can be found in this graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
<1, 19, 20>
<8, 16, 22>
<5, 7, 22>
<12, 16, 22>
<5, 8, 26>
<3, 18, 24>
<7, 23, 26>
<7, 14, 23>
<10, 24, 26>
<21, 15, 20>
<9, 11, 13>
<13, 14, 16>
<8, 17, 27>
