Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, 0, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Based on the given graph and adjacency list, we can determine the total number of triangles by counting the number of unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

Here is the count of each triangle along with their unique representation:

Triangles:
<6, 9, 1>
<6, 9, 4>
<6, 9, 7>
<6, 9, 0>
<6, 4, 9>
<9, 4, 7>
<9, 4, 0>
<9, 4, 1>
<9, 7, 4>
<4, 7, 0>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
