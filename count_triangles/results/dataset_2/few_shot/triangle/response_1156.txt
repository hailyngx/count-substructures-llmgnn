Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

Looking at the provided graph, the triangles can be formed by finding nodes that are connected with each other in a loop of three.

There are three unique triangles found in this graph:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 7>
3. <2, 5, 7>

The total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
