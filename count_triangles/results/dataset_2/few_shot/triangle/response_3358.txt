Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 6, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 9, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
[<0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 9>]
