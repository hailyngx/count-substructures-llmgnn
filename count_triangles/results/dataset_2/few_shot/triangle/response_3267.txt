Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. From the given edges and adjacency list, we see the triangles can have the following combinations: (0, 1, 5), (0, 3, 5), (0, 5, 8), (2, 5, 9), (3, 5, 9), (3, 7, 9).
   
2. Let's list these unique triangles:
   - <0, 1, 5>
   - <0, 3, 5>
   - <0, 5, 8>
   - <2, 5, 9>
   - <3, 5, 9>
   - <3, 7, 9>
   
3. The total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
