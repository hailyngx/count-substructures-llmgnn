Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 3) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 13) (5, 14) (5, 1) (5, 10) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 10) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 3, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 5, and node 13
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 3, 11, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 11, 0, 13, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, 0, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 14, 1, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 12, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 14, 10, and node 11
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 14, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 12
Node 11 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 3
Node 12 is connected to node 6, 3, 13, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 3, 0, 1, and node 12

Response:
There are 18 triangles in the graph. They are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 12>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 5, 14>
<1, 5, 10>
<1, 5, 13>
<2, 3, 11>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 11, 8>
<3, 12, 6>
<4, 7, 6>
<8, 10, 5>
<8, 10, 12>
<11, 2, 8>

So, the total number of triangles is [18].
