Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

A triangle in a graph is formed when three nodes are connected in a closed loop. In this graph, we will look for all possible triangles.

Let's start by listing the triangles:

1. Triangle 1: <4, 6, 11>
2. Triangle 2: <4, 6, 14>
3. Triangle 3: <4, 9, 11>
4. Triangle 4: <4, 9, 12>
5. Triangle 5: <4, 7, 1>
6. Triangle 6: <4, 1, 8>
7. Triangle 7: <4, 1, 13>
8. Triangle 8: <7, 9, 12>
9. Triangle 9: <7, 9, 11>
10. Triangle 10: <7, 1, 8>
11. Triangle 11: <7, 1, 13>
12. Triangle 12: <6, 9, 11>
13. Triangle 13: <6, 9, 14>
14. Triangle 14: <9, 11, 12>
15. Triangle 15: <5, 8, 14>
16. Triangle 16: <5, 8, 10>
17. Triangle 17: <5, 8, 1>
18. Triangle 18: <5, 14, 3>
19. Triangle 19: <0, 2, 12>
20. Triangle 20: <2, 5, 14>
21. Triangle 21: <2, 5, 11>
22. Triangle 22: <2, 5, 10>
23. Triangle 23: <12, 0, 11>
24. Triangle 24: <14, 6, 11>

There are a total of 24 unique triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [24].
