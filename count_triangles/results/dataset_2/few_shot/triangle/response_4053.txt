Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. From the given information, the graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges.
2. Now, let's find the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.
3. We can identify triangles by examining each possible combination of three nodes that are all connected to each other.
4. Counting the triangles in this graph can be time-consuming, so let's list the triangles directly:

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<0, 1, 4>

5. There are 14 unique triangles listed above.
6. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
