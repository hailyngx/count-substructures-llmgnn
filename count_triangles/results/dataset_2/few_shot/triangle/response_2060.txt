Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:
1. Given the adjacency list for each node, we can look for nodes that are connected by a triangle.
2. We will identify the triangles using the edge connections provided.

After analyzing the graph, the identified unique triangles are:
<5, 7, 9>
<0, 1, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
