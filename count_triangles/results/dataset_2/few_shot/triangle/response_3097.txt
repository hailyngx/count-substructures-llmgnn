Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify triangles based on the adjacency list:
- Triangle <0, 8, 9>
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <0, 3, 4>
- Triangle <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle <2, 6, 7>
- Triangle <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle <5, 7, 8>
- Triangle <6, 7, 9>

2. Determine the number of unique triangles:
- Total number of triangles: 10

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
