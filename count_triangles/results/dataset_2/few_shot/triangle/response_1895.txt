Response:
Based on the given graph, we can start by listing the triangles one by one. A triangle is formed by three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. Potential Triangle with nodes: 0, 1, 8
2. Potential Triangle with nodes: 0, 1, 11
3. Potential Triangle with nodes: 0, 8, 18
4. Potential Triangle with nodes: 0, 9, 16
5. Potential Triangle with nodes: 1, 8, 13
6. Potential Triangle with nodes: 1, 11, 5
7. Potential Triangle with nodes: 2, 6, 15
8. Potential Triangle with nodes: 2, 6, 12
9. Potential Triangle with nodes: 2, 6, 11
10. Potential Triangle with nodes: 4, 7, 10
11. Potential Triangle with nodes: 4, 7, 9
12. Potential Triangle with nodes: 6, 10, 15

In this case, there are 12 potential triangles listed above. 
Among these, there are 6 unique triangles which can be represented as follows:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 11>, <0, 8, 18>, <0, 9, 16>, <1, 8, 13>, <2, 6, 15>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
