Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6)
