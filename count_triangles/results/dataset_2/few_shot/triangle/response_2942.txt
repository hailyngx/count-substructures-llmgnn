Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all unique triangles formed by three nodes. Let's calculate this step-by-step:

1. Identify all the possible triangles:
- Triangle 1: Nodes 0, 1, 8
- Triangle 2: Nodes 4, 6, 7
- Triangle 3: Nodes 2, 4, 7
- Triangle 4: Nodes 3, 8, 9
- Triangle 5: Nodes 3, 0, 8
- Triangle 6: Nodes 3, 0, 9
- Triangle 7: Nodes 3, 2, 9

2. Count the total number of unique triangles:

[7]
<0, 1, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 8, 9>
<3, 0, 8>
<3, 0, 9>
<3, 2, 9>
