Response:
There are 21 triangles found in the given graph.  
Here are the unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 10, 12>
<1, 5, 14>
<1, 8, 10>
<1, 10, 13>
<2, 8, 14>
<2, 13, 14>
<3, 13, 14>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 10>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 9, 14>
<7, 9, 11>
<8, 1, 5>
<8, 2, 13>
<9, 10, 12>
<10, 0, 12>
<11, 0, 14>
