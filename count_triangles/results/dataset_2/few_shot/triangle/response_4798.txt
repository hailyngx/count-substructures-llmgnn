Response:
Based on the given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's count the number of triangles.

A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. To find all possible triangles, we need to consider each set of three connected nodes.

Let's list the unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 12>
<0, 3, 12>
<0, 5, 10>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 9, 10>
<2, 11, 13>
<4, 11, 13>
<4, 8, 11>
<4, 8, 14>
<4, 13, 14>
<5, 9, 10>
<9, 11, 4>
<9, 11, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
