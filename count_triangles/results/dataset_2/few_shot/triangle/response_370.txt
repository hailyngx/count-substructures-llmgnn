Response:
The graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. 

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

After examining the graph and the given information, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<3, 1, 12>
<3, 12, 9>
<3, 12, 8>
<3, 12, 1>
<4, 1, 10>
<4, 5, 14>
<4, 5, 0>
<4, 10, 8>
