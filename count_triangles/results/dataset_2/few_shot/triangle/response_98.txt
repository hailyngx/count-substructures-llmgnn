Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

First, let's identify the triangles based on the given edges and adjacency list.

Triangles can be formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Here are the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 13>
3. Triangle <0, 3, 12>
4. Triangle <0, 12, 13>
5. Triangle <1, 8, 11>
6. Triangle <1, 11, 12>
7. Triangle <1, 12, 13>
8. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
9. Triangle <2, 3, 13>
10. Triangle <3, 6, 9>
11. Triangle <4, 9, 14>
12. Triangle <5, 6, 9>
13. Triangle <5, 10, 14>
14. Triangle <6, 9, 14>
15. Triangle <12, 13, 14>

Count of triangles: [15]
