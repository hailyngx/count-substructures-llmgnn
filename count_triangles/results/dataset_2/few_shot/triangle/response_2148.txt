Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. For each node, find the neighbors that it is connected to.
2. Iterate through all possible triangles formed by the neighbors of each node.
3. Check if each triangle is indeed present in the graph based on the given edges.

The triangles found in the graph are: 
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
