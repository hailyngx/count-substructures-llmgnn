Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Based on the information provided, we can see that there are multiple triangles in this graph.

2. Let's identify some of the triangles based on the given edges and adjacency list:
   - Triangle 1: (6, 10, 15)
   - Triangle 2: (6, 8, 11)
   - Triangle 3: (2, 9, 11)
   - Triangle 4: (12, 13, 18)
   - Triangle 5: (4, 13, 18)
   - Triangle 6: (5, 14, 17)

3. Combining the identified triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is 6.

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are as follows:
<6, 10, 15>
<6, 8, 11>
<2, 9, 11>
<12, 13, 18>
<4, 13, 18>
<5, 14, 17>
