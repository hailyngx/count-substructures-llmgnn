Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, 8, and node 2

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0: Not part of any triangle.
2. Node 1: Forms triangles with nodes 3 and 8: <1, 3, 8>.
3. Node 2: Forms triangles with nodes 4, 5, 7, and 9: <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 5, 9>.
4. Node 3: Forms a triangle with node 4: <3, 4, 9>.
5. Node 4: Forms triangles with nodes 7, 9, 5, and 6: <4, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 9>.
6. Node 5: Not part of any additional triangle.
7. Node 6: Not part of any additional triangle.
8. Node 7: Not part of any additional triangle.
9. Node 8: Formed triangles with nodes 1 and 5: <8, 1, 5>.
10. Node 9: Forms triangles with nodes 2, 4, 6, and 8: <9, 4, 7>, <9, 4, 6>, <9, 6, 8>.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
