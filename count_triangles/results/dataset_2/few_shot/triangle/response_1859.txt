Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2)
