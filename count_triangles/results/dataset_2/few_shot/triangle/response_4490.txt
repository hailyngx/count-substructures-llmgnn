Response:
Let's solve this step-by-step to find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Identify triangles:
   - A triangle exists when three nodes are fully connected to each other.
   - We will look for each possible combination of three connected nodes to identify triangles.

2. Let's list down the triangles found in the graph:
   - <0, 2, 14>
   - <0, 2, 4>
   - <1, 4, 12>
   - <6, 10, 11>
   - <6, 10, 4>
   - <8, 11, 13>
   - <8, 11, 4>

3. Count the total number of unique triangles found:
   - Total number of triangles: [7]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
