Response:
Here are the steps to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Look for triangles by examining each node in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

2. Identify the triangles by checking if there are connections between each set of three nodes.

3. List all the unique triangles found in the graph

Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:
Total number of triangles = 0
Unique triangles: []
