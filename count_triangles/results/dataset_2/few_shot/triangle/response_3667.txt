Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the graph:

First, count the triangles by examining each node:

- Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1 and 27.
- Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 6 and 27.
- Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 14.
- Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 8 and 26.
- Node 4 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 5 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 6 forms a triangle with node 23.
- Node 7 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 8 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 9 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 10 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 11 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 12 forms triangles with nodes 19 and 29.
- Node 13 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 14 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 15 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 16 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 17 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 18 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 19 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 20 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 21 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 22 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 23 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 24 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 25 forms a triangle with node 14.
- Node 26 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 27 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 28 does not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 29 does not form a triangle with any other node.

The total number of triangles found is 6. The unique triangles are as follows: <0, 1, 27>, <1, 6, 27>, <2, 14, 25>, <3, 8, 26>, <3, 26, 28>, <12, 19, 29>.

Therefore, the output will be [6].
