Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 2, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 1

Response:
To find all triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. Triangles occur when three nodes are connected in a closed loop. 

Following are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 0, 4>
<2, 0, 6>
<4, 0, 6>
<8, 0, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
