Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2)
