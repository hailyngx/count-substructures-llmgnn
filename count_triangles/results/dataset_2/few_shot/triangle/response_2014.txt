Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can build a list of triangles and then count the total number of triangles in the graph.

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<3, 1, 13>
<3, 1, 6>
<3, 1, 18>
<3, 1, 5>
<7, 13, 1>
<7, 13, 3>
<7, 13, 2>
<7, 8, 17>
<7, 8, 12>
<7, 8, 0>
<12, 14, 6>
<12, 14, 4>
<12, 14, 5>
<12, 14, 7>
<14, 6, 1>
<14, 6, 5>
<14, 6, 4>
<14, 5, 3>
<14, 5, 12>
<14, 5, 7>
<18, 1, 4>
<18, 1, 11>
<18, 1, 0>
<18, 1, 3>
<19, 15, 7>
<19, 15, 12>
<19, 15, 7>
<19, 12, 14>
<19, 12, 7>
<19, 12, 15>
<0, 8, 17>
<0, 8, 7>
<0, 8, 4>

Total number of triangles: [33]
