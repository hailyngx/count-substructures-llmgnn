Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are as follows:
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
So, the total number of triangles is [8].
