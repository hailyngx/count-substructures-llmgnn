Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 7>

So, the total number of triangles is [7].
