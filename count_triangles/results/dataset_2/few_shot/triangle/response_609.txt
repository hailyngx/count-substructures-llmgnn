Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 5, and node 8

Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
- Step 1: Identify the triangles
- Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles

Let's start by identifying the triangles:
1. Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that potential triangles exist among nodes that are interconnected.

The triangles in this graph are:
- <5, 1, 0>
- <5, 3, 7>
- <5, 7, 6>

Now, counting the total number of unique triangles:
