Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes together. Let's break down the process step by step:

1. Identify Triangles:
   - Look for all possible triangles formed by the given edges and nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected in such a way that each node is connected to both of the other two nodes.
  
2. List of Unique Triangles:
   - After identifying all triangles, list them out and count how many unique triangles exist in the graph.
   
3. Output:
   - Finally, provide the total number of unique triangles found in the graph.

Let's now start by identifying the triangles and listing the unique ones.
