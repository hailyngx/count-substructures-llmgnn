Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 6) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 2) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 10, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 9, 0, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 13, 6, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 10, 5, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, 12, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 13, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 11, 6, 13, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 14
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 11, 0, and node 14
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 11, and node 0
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 10, 14, and node 9
Node 12 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 8, 11, 5, 12, 2, and node 9

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. 
Here are the unique triangles found:
<1, 4, 7>, <1, 9, 11>, <1, 9, 14>, <1, 9, 0>, <1, 12, 5>, <3, 1, 0>, <3, 1, 2>, <5, 8, 14>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
