Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node based on the given edges and adjacency list:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 6
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 4

Now, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:
- For each edge (u, v), we check if there is a node w such that there are edges (u, w) and (w, v). This forms a triangle.
- Counting the triangles in this manner, we find the total number of triangles.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is 12.
The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 8>.
