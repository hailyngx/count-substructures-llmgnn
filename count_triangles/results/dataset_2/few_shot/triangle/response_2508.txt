Response:
Let's go step-by-step to find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Counting triangles:
- From the given graph, we see that a triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.
- We can find triangles by examining each combination of 3 nodes and checking if there are edges connecting all the pairs.
- We will list the triangles found along with their nodes, and then count the total number of unique triangles.

2. Triangles in the graph (in the form of <node1, node2, node3>):
- <0, 1, 10>
- <0, 4, 11>
- <0, 8, 10>
- <0, 8, 11>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <1, 3, 12>
- <1, 6, 10>
- <2, 3, 13>
- <4, 9, 12>
- <6, 8, 13>
- <8, 12, 13>

3. Total number of triangles: [10]
