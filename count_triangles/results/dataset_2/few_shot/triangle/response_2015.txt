Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Calculate the number of triangles formed by each node:
   - Node 0: <0, 1, 13>, <0, 1, 15>, <0, 1, 17>, <0, 13, 15>, <0, 15, 17>
   - Node 1: <1, 3, 15>, <1, 3, 16>, <1, 15, 16>
   - Node 2: No triangles
   - Node 3: <3, 9, 18>
   - Node 4: No triangles
   - Node 5: No triangles
   - Node 6: No triangles
   - Node 7: <7, 11, 15>
   - Node 8: No triangles
   - Node 9: No triangles
   - Node 10: No triangles
   - Node 11: No triangles
   - Node 12: No triangles
   - Node 13: No triangles
   - Node 14: No triangles
   - Node 15: No triangles
   - Node 16: No triangles
   - Node 17: No triangles
   - Node 18: No triangles
   - Node 19: No triangles

2. Total number of triangles:
   - Total number of triangles = 7
   
Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7]. Examples of unique triangles include <0, 1, 13>, <1, 3, 15>, and <7, 11, 15>.
