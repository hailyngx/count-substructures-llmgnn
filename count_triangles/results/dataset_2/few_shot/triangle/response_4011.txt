Response:
We can find triangles in the graph by checking for nodes that form a cycle of length 3. Let's count the number of triangles step by step:

1. Consider each node as a potential starting point of a triangle.
2. Check all possible pairs of neighbors of the starting node to see if there is an edge between them.
3. If an edge exists between the pairs of neighbors, then a triangle is formed with the starting node.
4. Increment the count whenever a triangle is found.

Let's start the process of counting triangles:
  
1. Start with Node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to Node 3.
   - Node 3 is connected to Node 11, so there is no triangle involving Node 0.

2. Move to Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to Node 18.
   - Node 18 is connected to Node 3, but there is no edge between Node 1 and Node 3, so no triangle involving Node 1.

3. Continue checking all nodes in a similar manner.

After checking all nodes, the total number of triangles found in the graph is [6]. The unique triangles are:
<3, 8, 29>
<13, 21, 14>
<13, 8, 17>
<14, 11, 16>
<15, 26, 24>
<17, 8, 20>
