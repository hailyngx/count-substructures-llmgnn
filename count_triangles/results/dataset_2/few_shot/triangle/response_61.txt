Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
Node 0: Degree = 4
Node 1: Degree = 3
Node 2: Degree = 4
Node 3: Degree = 3
Node 4: Degree = 4
Node 5: Degree = 4
Node 6: Degree = 3
Node 7: Degree = 4
Node 8: Degree = 3
Node 9: Degree = 4
Node 10: Degree = 4
Node 11: Degree = 5
Node 12: Degree = 4
Node 13: Degree = 6
Node 14: Degree = 4

Now, let's look for triangles in the graph:
1. For Node 0:
- Triangles with Node 0: <0, 10, 4>
- Triangles with Node 1: No triangles
- Triangles with Node 2: <0, 2, 4>
- Triangles with Node 13: No triangles

2. For Node 1:
- Triangles with Node 2: <1, 2, 4>

3. For Node 2:
- Triangles with Node 3: No triangles
- Triangles with Node 4: <2, 4, 5>
- Triangles with Node 5: <2, 5, 12>
- Triangles with Node 10: <2, 4, 10>

4. For Node 3:
- Triangles with Node 9: No triangles
- Triangles with Node 12: <3, 12, 5>

5. For Node 4:
- Triangles with Node 10: <4, 10, 12>
  
6. For Node 5:
- Triangles with Node 12: <5, 12, 10>

7. For Node 6:
- Triangles with Node 11: <6, 11, 13>

8. For Node 7:
- Triangles with Node 11: <7, 11, 13>

9. For Node 8:
- Triangles with Node 9: <8, 9, 13>

10. For Node 9:
- Triangles with Node 13: <9, 13, 11>

11. For Node 10:
- No more triangles from Node 10

12. For Node 11:
- Triangles with Node 12: <11, 12, 5>

13. For Node 12:
- No more triangles from Node 12

14. For Node 13:
- No more triangles from Node 13

15. For Node 14:
- No more triangles from Node 14

By examining all the triangles formed by the nodes, we see that the unique triangles are: 
<0, 10, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 12>, <2, 4, 10>, <3, 12, 5>, <4, 10, 12>, <5, 12, 10>, <6, 11, 13>, <7, 11, 13>, <8, 9, 13>, <9, 13, 11>, <11, 12, 5>.

Therefore, there are a total of [14] triangles in the given graph.
