Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by three connected nodes. Let's analyze the graph to find all the triangles:

For each node, we will check if there are any two nodes connected to it that are also connected to each other, forming a triangle.

Node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 7)
Node 1: (1, 2, 7)
Node 2: (2, 5, 6), (2, 5, 8), (2, 6, 8), (2, 6, 7)
Node 3: (3, 1, 7), (3, 6, 9), (3, 6, 7)
Node 4: No triangles
Node 5: (5, 6, 8), (5, 6, 7)
Node 6: (6, 9, 3), (6, 5, 7), (6, 3, 7)
Node 7: (7, 1, 3)
Node 8: No triangles
Node 9: No triangles

From the analysis above, we can see the unique triangles formed in the graph are: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 7>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 1, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 7>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
