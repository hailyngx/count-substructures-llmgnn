Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle consists of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Based on the provided information, we can identify the following triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 5, 1>
- Triangle 2: <0, 8, 1>
- Triangle 3: <0, 3, 8>
- Triangle 4: <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle 5: <2, 6, 9>
  
There might be more triangles present in the graph, so let's carefully verify the connections among the nodes to find any additional triangles. 

After carefully reviewing the connections between nodes, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
