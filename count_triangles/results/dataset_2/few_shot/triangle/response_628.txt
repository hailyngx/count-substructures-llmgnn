Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 6, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
[<0, 4, 6> <0, 6, 8> <0, 4, 8> <4, 6, 7> <4, 6, 1> <5, 7, 9> <5, 1, 9> <1, 6, 9> <1, 3, 5> <1, 3, 4> <2, 4, 8> <6, 7, 4> <8, 9, 6>]
