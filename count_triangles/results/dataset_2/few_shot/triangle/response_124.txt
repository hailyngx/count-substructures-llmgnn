Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Check the individual nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 8
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 7, 3, 2
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 5, 7, 1, 6
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 9, 7, 1, 8
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 9, 7, 0
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 9, 2, 8, 0
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 9, 7, 2
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 9, 4, 3, 6, 2, 1
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 5, 3, 0
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 5, 6, 4, 3, 7, 0

2. Identify triangles:
- Triangles involving node 0: <0, 5, 8>, <0, 4, 9>
- Triangles involving node 1: No triangles
- Triangles involving node 2: <2, 5, 7>, <2, 7, 6>
- Triangles involving node 3: No triangles
- Triangles involving node 4: No triangles
- Triangles involving node 5: <5, 9, 0>
- Triangles involving node 6: No triangles
- Triangles involving node 7: <7, 9, 4>, <7, 9, 2>, <7, 9, 6>, <7, 4, 0>, <7, 3, 1>
- Triangles involving node 8: No triangles
- Triangles involving node 9: <9, 5, 0>, <9, 6, 7>

3. Add up the total number of unique triangles: [9]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
