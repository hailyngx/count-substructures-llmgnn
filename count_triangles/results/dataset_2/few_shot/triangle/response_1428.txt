Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph:

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<13, 26, 27>
<13, 20, 25>
<15, 20, 25>
<0, 12, 24>
<4, 12, 23>
<9, 10, 15>
<14, 16, 17>
<11, 23, 29>
<1, 7, 22>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
