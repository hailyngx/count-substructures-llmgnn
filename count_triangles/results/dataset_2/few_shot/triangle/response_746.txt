Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

From the given adjacency list and edge list, we can see the triangles present in the graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<3, 0, 10>
<3, 10, 8>
<3, 10, 13>
<4, 8, 11>
<4, 11, 6>
<4, 12, 13>
<6, 7, 13>
<6, 13, 10>
<7, 12, 1>
<9, 12, 4>
<9, 13, 7>
<9, 14, 5>
<12, 13, 7>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
