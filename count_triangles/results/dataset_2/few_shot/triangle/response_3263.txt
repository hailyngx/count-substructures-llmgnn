Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

After analyzing the graph and the adjacency list, we can identify the following triangles:
<10, 15, 22>
<10, 15, 26>
<10, 22, 28>
<10, 26, 28>
<10, 22, 0>
<10, 15, 17>
<10, 15, 22>
<15, 17, 22>
<15, 17, 28>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 22>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 29>
<1, 5, 14>
<1, 14, 6>
<9, 17, 23>
<9, 23, 29>
<12, 16, 20>
<12, 16, 27>
<12, 20, 27>
<17, 22, 28>
<19, 26, 10>
<19, 26, 12>
<19, 26, 27>
<23, 28, 29>
<24, 25, 6>

Therefore, there are [26] triangles in the given graph.
