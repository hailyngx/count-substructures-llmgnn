Response:
Let's denote the nodes as follows:
0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5, 6: 6, 7: 7, 8: 8, 9: 9, 10: 10, 11: 11, 12: 12, 13: 13, 14: 14, 15: 15, 16: 16, 17: 17, 18: 18, 19: 19

Based on the given information, we need to find the number of triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are mutually connected to each other.

Let's start by identifying the triangles one by one:

1. <1, 3, 13>
2. <4, 7, 13>
3. <4, 7, 14>
4. <4, 10, 0>
5. <4, 10, 8>
6. <5, 11, 16>
7. <6, 9, 15>
8. <6, 9, 14>
9. <6, 2, 14>
10. <6, 2, 14>
11. <6, 8, 17>
12. <6, 8, 10>
13. <7, 11, 16>
14. <7, 11, 5>
15. <11, 16, 19>
16. <13, 18, 12>

Now, let's count the total number of unique triangles found in the graph:
