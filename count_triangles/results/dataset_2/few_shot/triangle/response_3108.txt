Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. Check each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle.
2. Calculate the number of triangles based on the edges provided.

After analyzing the graph and its edges, we find that there are a total of **27 triangles** present in the given graph.

Here are some unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <1, 3, 2>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 3, 7>
4. <1, 3, 12>
5. <1, 2, 0>
6. <1, 2, 5>
7. <1, 2, 14>
8. <1, 2, 12>
9. <1, 2, 3>
10. <1, 5, 8>
11. <1, 5, 13>
12. <1, 5, 14>
13. <1, 12, 4>
14. <1, 12, 11>
15. <1, 12, 13>
16. <1, 14, 10>
17. <1, 14, 13>
18. <1, 14, 5>
19. <2, 0, 9>
20. <2, 0, 4>
21. <2, 0, 6>
22. <2, 0, 3>
23. <2, 0, 1>
24. <2, 4, 9>
25. <2, 4, 3>
26. <2, 4, 12>
27. <2, 4, 3> 

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is **27**.
