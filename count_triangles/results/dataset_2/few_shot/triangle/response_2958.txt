Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 5, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 7, 1>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 6, 4>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 0, 7>
<2, 0, 9>
<2, 0, 1>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 1>
<3, 5, 4>
<3, 8, 6>
<3, 8, 0>
<4, 5, 1>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 1>
<4, 6, 7>
<7, 4, 6>
<7, 4, 5>
<7, 2, 9>
<7, 2, 0>
<9, 2, 0>
<0, 9, 8>
<0, 9, 2>
<0, 9, 7>
<1, 7, 4>
<1, 7, 6>
<3, 8, 9>
<3, 8, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [38].
