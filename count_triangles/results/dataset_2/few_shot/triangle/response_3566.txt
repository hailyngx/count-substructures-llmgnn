Response:
Let's go step by step to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Identify the triangles: Triangles occur when three nodes are all connected with each other. We can look at each combination of three nodes to check if they form a triangle.

2. Check all possible triangles:
   - Triangles involving node 0: <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 14>
   - Triangles involving node 1: No triangles involving node 1.
   - Triangles involving node 2: No triangles involving node 2.
   - Triangles involving node 3: No triangles involving node 3.
   - Triangles involving node 4: <4, 6, 12>
   - Triangles involving node 5: No additional triangles involving node 5.
   - Triangles involving node 6: No triangles involving node 6.
   - Triangles involving node 7: No triangles involving node 7.
   - Triangles involving node 8: <8, 12, 13>
   - Triangles involving node 9: No additional triangles involving node 9.
   - Triangles involving node 10: No triangles involving node 10.
   - Triangles involving node 11: No triangles involving node 11.
   - Triangles involving node 12: No additional triangles involving node 12.
   - Triangles involving node 13: No triangles involving node 13.
   - Triangles involving node 14: No additional triangles involving node 14.

3. Counting the total number of triangles: 
   Total number of triangles = 4 (as listed above)

Therefore, there are total of 4 triangles in the given graph.
