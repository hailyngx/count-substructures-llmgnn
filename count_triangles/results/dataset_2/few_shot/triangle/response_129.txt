Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 6)

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

From the given information about the edges, it can be observed that the graph is an undirected graph. 

A triangle consists of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by examining each triplet of nodes and checking if they form a triangle.

By checking all possible triangles in the graph, we find the following unique triangles:
<5, 8, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
