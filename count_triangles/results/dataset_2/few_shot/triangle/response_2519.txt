Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 2, 3, and node 1

Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can consider each triplet of nodes and determine if they form a triangle.

The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 4>
<2, 9, 5>
<2, 9, 8>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 0>
<3, 9, 5>
<3, 9, 2>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 9, 5>
<4, 9, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 9, 8>
<6, 9, 8>
<6, 7, 0>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 0, 4>
<7, 9, 8>
<7, 0, 4>
<8, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [31].
