Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 6, and node 3

Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify all triangles formed by looking for unique sets of 3 nodes that are mutually connected to each other.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Based on the provided information, the triangles found in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 6>
3. <0, 4, 6>
4. <1, 4, 8>
5. <2, 4, 6>
6. <2, 4, 9>
7. <2, 5, 8>
8. <2, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
