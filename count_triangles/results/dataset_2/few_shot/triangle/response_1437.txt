Response:
The adjacency list provided gives us the information we need to determine the number of triangles in the graph.

To find a triangle, we look for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two. Here are the triangles found in this graph:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 19>
<0, 4, 12>
<0, 13, 16>
<2, 4, 12>
<4, 5, 19>
<5, 16, 19>
<8, 11, 15>
<9, 13, 16>
<14, 17, 10>
<14, 17, 16>
<18, 5, 19>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [<12>].
