Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Identify all the triangles in the graph based on the given edges and connections:
   - Triangles: <0, 8, 15>, <0, 8, 4>, <0, 4, 14>, <0, 9, 19>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 17>, <1, 6, 14>, <1, 6, 5>, <1, 2, 10>, <2, 10, 12>, <3, 7, 14>, <3, 7, 15>, <3, 7, 16>, <3, 12, 2>, <3, 12, 18>, <3, 13, 19>, <3, 13, 16>, <3, 13, 18>, <4, 8, 15>, <4, 8, 0>, <4, 14, 6>, <4, 13, 16>, <4, 13, 18>, <6, 5, 17>, <7, 15, 19>, <7, 15, 16>, <13, 16, 18>, <13, 16, 15>, <13, 19, 15>, <16, 17, 18>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles: [30]
