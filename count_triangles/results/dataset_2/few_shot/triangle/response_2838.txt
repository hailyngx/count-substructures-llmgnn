Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

To count the number of triangles, we will iterate over each node and check for triangles involving that node. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Counting triangles:

1. Node 0: No triangles.
2. Node 1: No triangles.
3. Node 2: No triangles.
4. Node 3: No triangles.
5. Node 4: Triangle <4, 24, 26>.
6. Node 5: No triangles.
7. Node 6: No triangles.
8. Node 7: No triangles.
9. Node 8: No triangles.
10. Node 9: Triangle <9, 18, 28>.
11. Node 10: Triangle <10, 13, 22>.
12. Node 11: Triangle <11 ,23, 24>.
13. Node 12: No triangles.
14. Node 13: No triangles.
15. Node 14: No triangles.
16. Node 15: No triangles.
17. Node 16: No triangles.
18. Node 17: No triangles.
19. Node 18: No triangles.
20. Node 19: No triangles.
21. Node 20: No triangles.
22. Node 21: No triangles.
23. Node 22: No triangles.
24. Node 23: No triangles.
25. Node 24: No triangles.
26. Node 25: No triangles.
27. Node 26: No triangles.
28. Node 27: No triangles.
29. Node 28: No triangles.
30. Node 29: No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [3]

Triangles found: <4, 24, 26>, <9, 18, 28>, <10, 13, 22>.
