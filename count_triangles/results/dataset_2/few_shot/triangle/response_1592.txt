Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

We will look for triangles in the graph by checking for nodes that have connections to each other in a closed loop.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<4, 18, 10>
<5, 19, 27>
<5, 14, 26>
<7, 20, 21>
<9, 19, 27>
<13, 23, 27>
<14, 16, 26>
<13, 17, 15>
<1, 7, 20>
<2, 13, 27>
<2, 14, 25>
<2, 22, 16>
<8, 21, 5>
<0, 1, 29>
<12, 23, 4>
<14, 15, 28>
<16, 22, 2>

Based on the identified triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [16]
