Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes that are mutually connected to each other.

The total number of triangles in this graph is [10].

The unique triangles found in this graph are:
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <1, 4, 3>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <3, 8, 5>
