Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by finding the number of nodes that are connected to each node with two edges. We will identify such triangles based on the given graph's edges.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [13]. The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 5, 12>, <0, 8, 1>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 10, 14>, <2, 9, 13>, <3, 6, 13>, <3, 7, 10>, <3, 11, 12>, <6, 9, 13>, <9, 10, 14>.
