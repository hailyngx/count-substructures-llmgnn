Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
[<0, 7, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 2, 9>, <6, 8, 2>, <6, 3, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 5, 9>, <7, 1, 5>]
