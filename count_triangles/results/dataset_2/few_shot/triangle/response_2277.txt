Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. For each node, find all possible triangles it can form:
- Node 0: <0, 8, 18>, <0, 8, 2>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 2, 18>, <0, 2, 11>, <0, 18, 5>.
- Node 1: <1, 6, 17>, <1, 6, 10>, <1, 17, 10>, <1, 17, 2>.
- Node 2: <2, 9, 10>, <2, 9, 1>, <2, 9, 12>, <2, 9, 0>, <2, 1, 10>, <2, 1, 12>, <2, 1, 0>, <2, 10, 0>.
- Node 3: No triangles.
- Node 4: <4, 3, 6>, <4, 3, 10>, <4, 3, 5>, <4, 6, 10>, <4, 10, 5>.
- Node 5: <5, 4, 19>, <5, 4, 8>, <5, 4, 18>, <5, 19, 18>.
- Node 6: <6, 1, 8>, <6, 1, 4>, <6, 8, 4>.
- Node 7: No triangles.
- Node 8: <8, 6, 5>, <8, 6, 0>, <8, 5, 0>.
- Node 9: No triangles.
- Node 10: <10, 9, 1>, <10, 9, 4>, <10, 9, 7>, <10, 1, 4>, <10, 1, 7>, <10, 4, 7>.
- Node 11: <11, 15, 17>, <11, 15, 13>, <11, 17, 13>.
- Node 12: No triangles.
- Node 13: No triangles.
- Node 14: No triangles.
- Node 15: No triangles.
- Node 16: No triangles.
- Node 17: No triangles.
- Node 18: <18, 5, 0>.
- Node 19: No triangles.

2. Count the total number of unique triangles:
- Total number of triangles = 21

Therefore, there are [21] triangles in the given graph.
