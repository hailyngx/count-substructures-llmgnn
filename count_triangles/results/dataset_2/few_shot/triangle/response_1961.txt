Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Consider each node and find all possible triangles connected to that node:
- Node 0: No triangles.
- Node 1: <1, 9, 15>, <1, 9, 2>, <1, 15, 19>, <1, 2, 16>, <1, 8, 6>, <1, 2, 13>
- Node 2: <2, 16, 4>, <2, 16, 15>, <2, 16, 11>, <2, 1, 9>, <2, 1, 8>, <2, 10, 12>, <2, 10, 13>
- Node 3: No triangles.
- Node 4: No triangles.
- Node 5: <5, 17, 11>, <5, 17, 9>, <5, 17, 12>, <5, 7, 3>, <5, 7, 13>
- Node 6: <6, 8, 10>, <6, 8, 1>, <6, 8, 2>, <6, 18, 19>, <6, 18, 15>, <6, 18, 16>, <6, 7, 5>, <6, 7, 3>, <6, 7, 13>
- Node 7: <7, 5, 17>, <7, 5, 14>, <7, 3, 12>, <7, 3, 10>, <7, 3, 13>, <7, 6, 8>, <7, 6, 18>, <7, 6, 13>
- Node 8: <8, 1, 9>, <8, 1, 15>, <8, 10, 12>, <8, 10, 2>, <8, 6, 18>, <8, 6, 7>
- Node 9: <9, 1, 15>, <9, 1, 8>, <9, 17, 12>
- Node 10: <10, 8, 6>, <10, 8, 1>, <10, 12, 14>, <10, 12, 3>, <10, 12, 17>, <10, 2, 13>
- Node 11: <11, 16, 2>, <11, 16, 15>, <11, 16, 4>, <11, 17, 5>, <11, 17, 9>, <11, 17, 12>

- Node 13: <13, 2, 0>, <13, 2, 7>, <13, 0, 7>
- Node 14: <14, 5, 17>, <14, 5, 7>, <14, 4, 16>, <14, 4, 12>
- Node 15: <15, 16, 11>, <15, 16, 2>, <15, 16, 4>, <15, 1, 9>, <15, 1, 17>
- Node 16: <16, 2, 10>, <16, 2, 13>, <16, 4, 14>, <16, 4, 5>
- Node 17: <17, 11, 9>, <17, 11, 5>, <17, 11, 12>, <17, 9, 1>, <17, 5, 14>, <17, 9, 12>
- Node 18: No triangles.
- Node 19: No triangles.

2. Count the total number of unique triangles: 
- Total number of unique triangles = 50

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [50].
