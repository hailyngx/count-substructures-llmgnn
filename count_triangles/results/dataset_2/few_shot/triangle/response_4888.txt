Response:
Here is the calculation for the total number of triangles in the given graph:

1. For each node, calculate the number of triangles it is a part of. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected.
2. The total number of triangles is one-third of the sum of triangles each node contributes because each triangle is counted three times (once for each node in it).

Let's calculate the number of triangles:
Node 0 contributes to 2 triangles: <0, 3, 15> and <0, 12, 16>
Node 1 contributes to 1 triangle: <1, 14, 19>
Node 2 contributes to 1 triangle: <2, 8, 15>
Node 3 contributes to 1 triangle: <3, 7, 9>
Node 4 contributes to 1 triangle: <4, 11, 12>
Node 5 contributes to 1 triangle: <5, 13, 14>
Node 6 contributes to 1 triangle: <6, 7, 13>
Node 7 contributes to 1 triangle: <7, 9, 13>
Node 8 contributes to 2 triangles: <8, 15, 18> and <8, 2, 15>
Node 9 contributes to 1 triangle: <9, 18, 7>
Node 10 contributes to 0 triangles
Node 11 contributes to 1 triangle: <11, 18, 4>
Node 12 contributes to 2 triangles: <12, 0, 16> and <12, 2, 4>
Node 13 contributes to 1 triangle: <13, 5, 14>
Node 14 contributes to 1 triangle: <14, 16, 5>
Node 15 contributes to 1 triangle: <15, 0, 8>
Node 16 contributes to 1 triangle: <16, 14, 0>
Node 17 contributes to 1 triangle: <17, 6, 13>
Node 18 contributes to 2 triangles: <18, 9, 7> and <18, 8, 11>
Node 19 contributes to 1 triangle: <19, 1, 12>

Total number of triangles is [15].
