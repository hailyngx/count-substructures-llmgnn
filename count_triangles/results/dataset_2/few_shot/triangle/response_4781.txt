Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 7, and node 2
