Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can use the concept that a triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. We will now calculate the number of triangles formed in this graph step-by-step:

1. First, identify the triangles by examining each set of three connected nodes:
   - From the adjacency list given, we find the following triangles:
     - Triangle 1: <4, 8, 12>
     - Triangle 2: <5, 15, 7>
     - Triangle 3: <11, 14, 19>
     - Triangle 4: <11, 16, 19>
     - Triangle 5: <4, 12, 0>
     - Triangle 6: <2, 10, 12>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles found:
   - Total number of triangles: [6]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is [6].
