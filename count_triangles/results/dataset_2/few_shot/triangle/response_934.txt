Node 18 is connected to node 9, 13, and node 1
Node 19 is connected to node 6, 10, and node 5

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are:
<4, 9, 10>
<6, 8, 7>
<6, 2, 0>
<7, 5, 19>
<7, 16, 17>
<9, 18, 13>
<10, 12, 0>
<10, 12, 2>
<12, 1, 18>
<15, 16, 17> 

So, the total number of triangles is [10].
