Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find the number of unique triangles formed by three connected nodes.

Looking at the provided adjacency list and the given edges, we can identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle: <0, 6, 9>
2. Triangle: <0, 1, 5>
3. Triangle: <0, 3, 4>
4. Triangle: <0, 5, 7>
5. Triangle: <1, 4, 6>
6. Triangle: <1, 6, 8>
7. Triangle: <1, 8, 9>
8. Triangle: <2, 3, 4>
9. Triangle: <2, 8, 9>
10. Triangle: <3, 4, 7>
11. Triangle: <5, 7, 0>
12. Triangle: <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
