Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 8, 9> 

So, the total number of triangles is [8].
