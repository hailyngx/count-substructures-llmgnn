Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. For each node pair (i, j) where i < j, check if there exists a third node k such that there are edges between both (i, k) and (j, k). If such a node k exists, then we have found a triangle.

2. Counting the triangles in the graph by following the above step reveals the total number of triangles in the graph.

Let's find the triangles in the given graph step by step:

Triangles: <1, 3, 4>, <1, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <6, 4, 5>, <6, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 2>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [10]
