Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph. A triangle is a set of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes.

By examining the graph and connections, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
