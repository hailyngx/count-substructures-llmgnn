Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. We need to find the total number of triangles in this graph.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following triangles:
<9, 2, 1>
<9, 13, 18>
<9, 13, 7>
<4, 0, 12>
<4, 7, 13>
<4, 11, 10>
<7, 13, 18>
<7, 15, 1>
<7, 15, 14>
<7, 16, 17>
<13, 12, 18>
<14, 15, 1>
<16, 17, 10>
<19, 3, 8>
<19, 16, 1>

Counting these unique triangles, we find a total of 15 triangles inside brackets:
