Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 17) (7, 12) (7, 16) (14, 6) (14, 5) (17, 4) (17, 13) (17, 19) (8, 4) (8, 19) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 1) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 6) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 1) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 10) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 6) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 6) (9, 3) (9, 18) (9, 16) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 15) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 16) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 2) (18, 9) (18, 0)
