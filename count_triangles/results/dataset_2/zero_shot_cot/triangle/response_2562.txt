Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
