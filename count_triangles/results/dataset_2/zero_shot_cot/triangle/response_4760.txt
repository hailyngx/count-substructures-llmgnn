Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (10, 19) (11, 14) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 7) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 3) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) (3, 4) (3, 18) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 17) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 9) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 15) (12, 17) (12, 6) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 7) (19, 10) (19, 17) (7, 13) (7, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 1) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 19)
