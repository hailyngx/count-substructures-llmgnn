Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by the given edges. 

The total number of triangles in this graph is [18].

The unique triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 3, 0>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 4>
<7, 8, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 9, 7>
<3, 4, 1>
