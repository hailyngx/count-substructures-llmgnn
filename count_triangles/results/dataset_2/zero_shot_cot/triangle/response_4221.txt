Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 7>, and <5, 7, 9>.
