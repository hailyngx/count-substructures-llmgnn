Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

So, the total number of triangles is [8].
