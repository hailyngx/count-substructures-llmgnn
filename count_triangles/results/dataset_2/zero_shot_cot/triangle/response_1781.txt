The edges are as follows: (1, 29) (1, 28) (1, 8) (21, 20) (21, 23) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 17) (3, 4) (3, 24) (3, 16) (3, 2) (14, 25) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 11) (2, 3) (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 15) (29, 1) (29, 2) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 26) (27, 25) (27, 22) (27, 19) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 23) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 26) (8, 18) (23, 21) (23, 9) (24, 3) (24, 25) (22, 2) (22, 27) (22, 26) (26, 12) (26, 8) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 15) (5, 0) (5, 28) (5, 10) (13, 10) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 25) (20, 21) (10, 26) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 15) (15, 2) (15, 12) (15, 26) (15, 10) (16, 3) (16, 28) (16, 18) (28, 1) (28, 5) (28, 16) (11, 17) (11, 12) (11, 25) (25, 14) (25, 27) (25, 24) (25, 0) (25, 11) (19, 2) (19, 27) (18, 8) (18, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangles involving node 1: (1, 29, 2) 
2. Triangles involving node 2: (2, 3, 4) 
3. Triangles involving node 3: (3, 4, 7) 
4. Triangles involving node 4: (4, 7, 17) 
5. Triangles involving node 7: (7, 4, 17) 
6. Triangles involving node 8: (8, 0, 5) 
7. Triangles involving node 10: (10, 5, 0) 
8. Triangles involving node 11: (11, 12, 6) 
9. Triangles involving node 15: (15, 10, 26) 
10. Triangles involving node 16: (16, 18, 8) 
11. Triangles involving node 19: (19, 2, 22) 
12. Triangles involving node 22: (22, 2, 27) 
13. Triangles involving node 25: (25, 24, 3) 

Now, let's count the total number of triangles:

And list the unique triangles:

<1, 29, 2>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 17>, <8, 0, 5>, <10, 5, 0>, <11, 12, 6>, <15, 10, 26>, <16, 18, 8>, <19, 2, 22>, <22, 2, 27>, <25, 24, 3>
