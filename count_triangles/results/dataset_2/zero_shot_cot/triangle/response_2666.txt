Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
[12]

Unique triangles: <5, 1, 9>, <5, 0, 6>, <5, 0, 8>, <9, 1, 4>, <9, 1, 6>, <9, 4, 6>, <4, 8, 1>, <3, 6, 1>, <3, 6, 0>, <3, 8, 0>, <8, 7, 3>, <8, 2, 0>
