Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 15) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 19) (8, 9) (8, 13) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 18) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 17) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 10) (15, 16) (15, 1) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 4) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (5, 0) (5, 17) (5, 10) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 19) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 18) (18, 13) (18, 10) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 14)
