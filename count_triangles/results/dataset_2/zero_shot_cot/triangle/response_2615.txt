Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [8].
The unique triangles found are: <6, 9, 14>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 7, 4>, <0, 11, 5>, <0, 12, 13>, <7, 11, 10>, <8, 14, 9>.
