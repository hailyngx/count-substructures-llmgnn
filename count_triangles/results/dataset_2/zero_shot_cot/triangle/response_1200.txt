Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 11) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 11) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) (0, 2) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 1) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 3)
