Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 1) (3, 13) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 14)
