Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 6) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 3) (11, 9) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 10) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 0) (13, 18) (10, 5) (10, 7) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 17) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 16) (17, 4) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 6) (4, 2) (4, 17) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 14) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 9) (9, 11) (9, 18) (9, 7) (0, 3) (0, 13) (1, 2) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 12) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 6) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 16) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 9)
