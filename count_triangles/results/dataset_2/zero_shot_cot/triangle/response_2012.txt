Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

After analyzing the provided edge list, the unique triangles in the graph are as follows:

<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 28>
<1, 5, 15>
<1, 7, 28>
<1, 7, 15>
<1, 13, 15>
<1, 13, 28>
<2, 5, 16>
<2, 5, 0>
<2, 0, 5>
<2, 0, 8>
<5, 16, 28>
<5, 16, 21>
<5, 16, 22>
<5, 16, 17>
<5, 17, 22>
<5, 22, 17>
<5, 22, 12>
<5, 12, 14>
<5, 12, 21>
<5, 12, 22>
<5, 12, 15>
<5, 21, 19>
<5, 21, 12>
<5, 21, 16>
<5, 21, 14>
<5, 19, 21>
<5, 22, 12>
<7, 8, 1>
<8, 0, 2>
<10, 27, 29>
<12, 14, 21>
<12, 14, 29>
<12, 14, 13>
<12, 14, 23>
<12, 15, 21>
<12, 15, 13>
<12, 15, 20>
<12, 19, 24>
<12, 19, 21>
<12, 19, 6>
<12, 22, 21>
<13, 14, 29>
<13, 14, 29>
<13, 14, 23>
<13, 14, 12>
<13, 14, 21>
<14, 21, 23>
<14, 21, 29>
<14, 21, 12>
<14, 21, 29>
