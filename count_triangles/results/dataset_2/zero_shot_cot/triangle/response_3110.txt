Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 5) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2)
