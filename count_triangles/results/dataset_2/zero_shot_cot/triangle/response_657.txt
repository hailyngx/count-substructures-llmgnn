Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. 

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<5, 6, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
