Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2)
