Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 1) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 19) (4, 16) (4, 12) (4, 19) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 2) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 17) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 3) (0, 19) (12, 4) (12, 10) (14, 11) (14, 8) (18, 9) (18, 5) (17, 16) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (8, 7) (8, 14) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 10) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 0) (15, 5) (15, 17) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are 15 unique triangles in this graph. 
Here they are:
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 13>
<1, 7, 13>
<2, 9, 13>
<2, 9, 17>
<2, 10, 12>
<2, 10, 13>
<3, 6, 17>
<3, 17, 15>
<4, 16, 19>
<5, 13, 18>
<5, 13, 2>
<5, 15, 17>
<9, 13, 2>
<9, 18, 5>
The total number of triangles is [15].
