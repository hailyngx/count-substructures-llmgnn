Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 7) (2, 8) (2, 10) (3, 0) (3, 10) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 13) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 1) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 13)
