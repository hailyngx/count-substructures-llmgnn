Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
Here are the unique triangles present in the given graph:
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 0, 4>
<1, 0, 8>
<7, 4, 2>
<7, 4, 3>
<7, 0, 3>
<7, 0, 9>
<5, 2, 8>

There are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph. 
So, the total number of triangles is [10].
