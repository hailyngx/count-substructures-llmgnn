Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [12].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 3>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 0>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 0>.
