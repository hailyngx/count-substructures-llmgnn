Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 17) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 19) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 12) (12, 11) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 0) (10, 14) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (17, 4) (17, 3) (17, 15) (2, 19) (2, 13) (19, 3) (19, 2) (19, 6) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 15) (1, 18) (1, 14) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 1) (13, 0) (13, 2) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 6) (15, 16) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 15) 

Response:
