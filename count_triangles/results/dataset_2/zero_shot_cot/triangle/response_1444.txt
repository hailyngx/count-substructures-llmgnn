Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 12) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 11) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles can be found by looking for nodes that are connected to each other in a triangular manner. 

There are several triangles in this graph. Let's list them below:

<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 14>
<0, 7, 14>
<12, 5, 0>
<12, 5, 14>
<12, 0, 14>
<2, 9, 13>
<2, 9, 10>
<2, 10, 13>
<11, 12, 13>
<11, 12, 1>

There are a total of [14] triangles in the graph.
