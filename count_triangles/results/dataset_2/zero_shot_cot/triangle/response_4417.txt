Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 1) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the triangles in this graph step by step:

1. Looking for triangles that include node 0:
   - (0, 5, 1)
   - (0, 5, 2)
   - (0, 5, 3)
   - (0, 8, 1)
   - (0, 8, 3)
   - (0, 11, 8)

2. Looking for triangles that include node 1:
   - (1, 5, 13)
   - (1, 5, 6)
   - (1, 8, 13)
   - (1, 8, 6)

3. Looking for triangles that include node 2:
   - (2, 5, 9)
   - (2, 5, 7)
   - (2, 5, 0)
   - (2, 5, 1)
   - (2, 5, 3)
   - (2, 7, 4)
   - (2, 7, 3)

4. Looking for triangles that include node 3:
   - (3, 0, 8)
   - (3, 8, 1)
   - (3, 8, 11)
   - (3, 12, 6)

5. Looking for triangles that include node 4:
   - (4, 2, 7)

6. Looking for triangles that include node 6:
   - (6, 12, 14)
   - (6, 1, 13)
   - (6, 1, 11)
   - (6, 10, 7)

7. Looking for triangles that include node 7:
   - (7, 12, 9)
   - (7, 12, 3)
   - (7, 12, 6)
   - (7, 12, 13)
   - (7, 11, 14)

8. Looking for triangles that include node 8:
   - (8, 0, 11)
   - (8, 1, 13)
   - (8, 1, 6)
   - (8, 1, 11)

9. Looking for triangles that include node 10:
   - (10, 7, 6)

10. Looking for triangles that include node 11:
    - (11, 7, 14)

11. Looking for triangles that include node 12:
    - (12, 9, 7)
    - (12, 7, 13)

12. Looking for triangles that include node 13:
    - (13, 7, 14)

13. Looking for triangles that include node 14:
    - (14, 13, 11)

After going through all possible triangles, we have found the following unique triangles:
<0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 8, 3>, <0, 11, 8>, 
<1, 5, 13>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 8, 13>, <1, 8, 6>, 
<2, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 0>, <2, 5, 1>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 7, 4>, <2, 7, 3>, 
<3, 0, 8>, <3, 8, 1>, <3, 8, 11>, <3, 12, 6>, 
<4, 2, 7>, 
<6, 12, 14>, <6, 1, 13>, <6, 1, 11>, <6, 10, 7>, 
<7, 12, 9>, <7, 12, 3>, <7, 12, 6>, <7, 12, 13>, <7, 11, 14>, 
<8, 0, 11>, <8, 1, 13>, <8, 1, 6>, <8, 1, 11>, 
<10, 7, 6>, 
<11, 7, 14>, 
<12, 9, 7>, <12, 7, 13>, 
<13, 7, 14>, 
<14, 13, 11>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [39].
