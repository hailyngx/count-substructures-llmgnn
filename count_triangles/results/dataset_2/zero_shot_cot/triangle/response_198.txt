Response:
Let's count the total number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to node 1: 6, 10, 13, 2, 3, 6
   Triangles involving node 1: <6, 10, 1>, <13, 1, 2>, <3, 1, 6> 

2. Nodes connected to node 2: 9, 18, 1
   Triangles involving node 2: <9, 1, 2>

3. Nodes connected to node 3: 4, 1, 16
   Triangles involving node 3: <4, 3, 1>

4. Nodes connected to node 4: 7, 18, 14, 16, 3
   Triangles involving node 4: <7, 4, 16>

5. Nodes connected to node 5: 11, 16
   No triangles involving node 5.

6. Nodes connected to node 6: 1, 8, 0
   Triangles involving node 6: <1, 6, 0>

7. Nodes connected to node 7: 4, 0, 8
   No triangles involving node 7.

8. Nodes connected to node 8: 7, 6, 13, 16
   No triangles involving node 8.

9. Nodes connected to node 9: 2
   No triangles involving node 9.

10. Nodes connected to node 10: 17, 1
    No triangles involving node 10.

11. Nodes connected to node 11: 19, 5
    No triangles involving node 11.

12. Nodes connected to node 12: 13, 0, 15
    No triangles involving node 12.

13. Nodes connected to node 13: 8, 12, 1, 18
    Triangles involving node 13: <8, 13, 1>

14. Nodes connected to node 14: 4
    No triangles involving node 14.

15. Nodes connected to node 15: 18, 19, 12
    No triangles involving node 15.

16. Nodes connected to node 16: 4, 8, 5, 3
    Triangles involving node 16: <4, 16, 3>

17. Nodes connected to node 17: 10, 19
    No triangles involving node 17.

18. Nodes connected to node 18: 4, 13, 2, 15
    No triangles involving node 18.

19. Nodes connected to node 19: 11, 17, 15
    No triangles involving node 19.

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph:
There are a total of 4 unique triangles: <6, 10, 1>, <13, 1, 2>, <3, 1, 6>, <7, 4, 16>.

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
