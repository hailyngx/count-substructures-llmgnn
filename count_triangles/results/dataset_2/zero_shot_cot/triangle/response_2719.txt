Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 3) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 11) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (10, 6) (10, 9) 

Response:
