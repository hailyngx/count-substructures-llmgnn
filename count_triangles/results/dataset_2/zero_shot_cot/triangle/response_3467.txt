Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 1) (16, 19) (5, 18) (5, 0) (9, 14) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 8) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 10) (14, 9) (14, 2) (6, 13) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 18) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 14) (19, 11) (19, 16) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 18) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 15)
