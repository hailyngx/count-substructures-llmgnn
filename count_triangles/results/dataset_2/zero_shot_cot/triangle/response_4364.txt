Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 3) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 10) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 8, 14>, <1, 10, 14>, <2, 9, 14>, <2, 10, 14>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 11>, <3, 7, 12>, <4, 8, 11>, <7, 8, 11>, <9, 10, 14>, <11, 12, 3>, <11, 12, 5>.
