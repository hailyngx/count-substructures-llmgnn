Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 5) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 12) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) 

Response:
There are  <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 11>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 10, 11>, <0, 10, 12>, <1, 14, 13>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 10>, <5, 13, 14>  unique triangles in the given graph.
Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
