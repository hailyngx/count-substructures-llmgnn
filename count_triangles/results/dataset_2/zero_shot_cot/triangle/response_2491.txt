Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 10) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 11) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11)
