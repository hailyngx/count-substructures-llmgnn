Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 12) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 19) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 0) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 16) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 5) (13, 5) (13, 17) (15, 1) (15, 4) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 16) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 19) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 17) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 10) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 14) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
