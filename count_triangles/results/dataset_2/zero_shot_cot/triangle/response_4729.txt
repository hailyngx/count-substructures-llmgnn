Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 16) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 12) (10, 15) (10, 2) (11, 18) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 3) (4, 9) (8, 19) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 9) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 6) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 0) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 0) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 1) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 6) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 9) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 15) (6, 16) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 19) (0, 12) (0, 1)
