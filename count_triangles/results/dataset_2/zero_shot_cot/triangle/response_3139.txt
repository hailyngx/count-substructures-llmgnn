Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) 

Response:
There are [(10 choose 3) = 120] possible triangles in a complete graph with 10 nodes. However, in this given graph, we will count the number of triangles by examining each unique triangle formed by the edges provided.

The unique triangles formed in this graph are:
- <5, 9, 7>
- <9, 6, 7>
- <5, 6, 2>
- <5, 1, 2>
- <5, 2, 4>
- <5, 4, 0>
- <9, 6, 2>
- <9, 6, 1>
- <9, 7, 5>
- <6, 7, 5>
- <4, 7, 0>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 2>
- <4, 2, 6>
- <0, 8, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
