Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 1) (0, 27) (0, 23) (0, 1) (27, 0) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 29) (3, 25) (3, 26) (3, 22) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 26) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 15) (6, 16) (9, 10) (9, 25) (9, 18) (22, 3) (23, 0) (23, 16) (23, 28) (23, 19) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 28) (21, 20) (21, 29) (28, 23) (28, 13) (28, 12) (28, 2) (15, 10) (15, 17) (15, 5) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 1) (26, 3) (26, 25) (26, 2) (2, 28) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 20) (24, 8) (24, 5) (24, 29) (29, 11) (29, 21) (29, 24) (12, 8) (12, 28) (12, 20) (12, 5) (12, 14) (20, 21) (20, 2) (20, 12) (20, 5) (19, 4) (19, 23) (19, 2) (5, 15) (5, 24) (5, 12) (5, 20) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 12) (16, 6) (16, 23) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 18) 

Response:
First, let's count the total number of triangles in this graph.
We can do this by checking each combination of three nodes to see if they form a triangle by having edges connecting all three nodes.

After going through all possible combinations, the total number of triangles in the graph is [30].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<4, 7, 1>
<10, 17, 15>
<9, 25, 26>
<23, 28, 29>
<5, 12, 24>
