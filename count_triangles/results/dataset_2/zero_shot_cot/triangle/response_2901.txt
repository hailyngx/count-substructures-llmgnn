Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 10) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 10) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 9) (8, 14) (8, 9) (8, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 10) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 9) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 13) 

Response:

<4, 13, 5>
<4, 13, 10>
<5, 1, 7>
<5, 1, 3>
<5, 1, 14>
<5, 2, 7>
<5, 2, 6>
