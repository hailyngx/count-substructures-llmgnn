Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 7) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 6) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 9) (5, 15) (5, 19) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 6) (2, 17) (2, 12) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 18) (0, 15) (0, 13) (0, 10) (6, 8) (6, 19) (18, 11) (18, 12) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 10)
