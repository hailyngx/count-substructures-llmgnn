Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
