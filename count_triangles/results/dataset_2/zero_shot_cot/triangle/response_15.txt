Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 17) (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 7) (14, 5) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 0) (10, 3) (10, 4) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 6) (7, 9) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 19) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 18) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 18) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 2) (19, 12) (19, 4) (19, 16) (6, 11) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 4) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 19) (4, 1) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 15) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 16)
