Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 15) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 19) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 2) (12, 1) (12, 19) (1, 12) (1, 17) (1, 19) (17, 1) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 7) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 14) (16, 0) (16, 14) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 11) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 13) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 4) (14, 15) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 13) (8, 0) (8, 18) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 11) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 13) (4, 5) (4, 3) (13, 0) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 11) 

Response:
[<0, 7, 10> <0, 13, 19> <1, 12, 19> <2, 9, 6> <3, 4, 5> <3, 11, 13> <3, 14, 15> <4, 5, 15> <8, 11, 18> <10, 7, 0> <13, 14, 15>]
