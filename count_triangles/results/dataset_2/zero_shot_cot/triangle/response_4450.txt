Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in this graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<6, 2, 9>
<1, 0, 6>
<3, 5, 7> 

So, the total number of triangles is [6].
