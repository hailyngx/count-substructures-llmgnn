Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 12) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 0) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 6) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 4) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) 

Response:
[<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 14>, <0, 3, 12>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 14>, <1, 10, 13>, <1, 12, 13>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 12>, <3, 7, 12>, <3, 4, 14>, <4, 6, 14>, <9, 10, 11>]
