Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 4) (0, 29) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 3) (27, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 29) (9, 19) (14, 1) (14, 18) (17, 10) (17, 23) (17, 15) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 2) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 25) (15, 5) (20, 26) (28, 19) (29, 0) (29, 9) (29, 24) (21, 24) (21, 13) (21, 19) (24, 29) (24, 21) (24, 26) (24, 11) (19, 9) (19, 28) (19, 21) (19, 26) (19, 5) (26, 20) (26, 24) (26, 19) (26, 18) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 11) (22, 8) (18, 14) (18, 26) (18, 7) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 8) (11, 24) (11, 22) (11, 23) (11, 12) (23, 17) (23, 11) (23, 25) (25, 27) (25, 15) (25, 23) (25, 16) (25, 8) (7, 15) (7, 18) (16, 25) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 22) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 22) (2, 13) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 11) (12, 1) (13, 21) (13, 2) (8, 27) (8, 22) (8, 5) (8, 25) (3, 27) (3, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles present in the graph.

1. Calculate the total number of triangles:
Since there are 30 nodes, and each triangle has 3 edges, we can calculate the total number of triangles using the formula: 
Total triangles = (90C3) / 3! = 11780

2. List the unique triangles:
