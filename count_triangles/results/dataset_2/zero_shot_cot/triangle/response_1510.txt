Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 28) (1, 27) (21, 10) (21, 16) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 29) (12, 8) (12, 27) (12, 17) (12, 11) (27, 1) (27, 12) (28, 1) (28, 3) (28, 14) (29, 23) (29, 25) (29, 4) (26, 1) (26, 18) (26, 10) (26, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (22, 0) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 24) (13, 20) (13, 15) (18, 26) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 17) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 16) (3, 28) (3, 20) (3, 6) (6, 26) (6, 3) (6, 24) (24, 5) (24, 6) (24, 7) (16, 21) (16, 10) (16, 14) (11, 12) (11, 5) (0, 8) (0, 22) (0, 25) (2, 23) (2, 9) (2, 25) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 15) (14, 8) (14, 28) (14, 16) (14, 7) (4, 29) (4, 5) (4, 20) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 17) (20, 13) (20, 3) (20, 4) (20, 19) (7, 24) (7, 14) (19, 10) (19, 20) (25, 29) (25, 0) (25, 2) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph and list them. 

1. Identify triangles using the given edges:
    - First, count the triangles formed by each node:
        - Node 1: (1, 26, 28)
        - Node 2: No triangles
        - Node 3: No triangles
        - Node 4: No triangles
        - Node 5: No triangles
        - Node 6: (6, 24, 26)
        - Node 7: No triangles
        - Node 8: (8, 12, 27) and (8, 14, 28)
        - Node 9: No triangles
        - Node 10: (10, 16, 21) and (10, 18, 26)
        - Node 11: No triangles
        - Node 12: (12, 17, 27)
        - Node 13: No triangles
        - Node 14: No triangles
        - Node 15: No triangles
        - Node 16: No triangles
        - Node 17: No triangles
        - Node 18: (18, 17, 26)
        - Node 19: No triangles
        - Node 20: No triangles
        - Node 21: No triangles
        - Node 22: No triangles
        - Node 23: (23, 8, 29)
        - Node 24: No triangles
        - Node 25: No triangles
        - Node 26: No triangles
        - Node 27: No triangles
        - Node 28: No triangles
        - Node 29: No triangles

2. Count the total number of triangles:
    - Total number of triangles = 2

3. List of unique triangles:
    - <1, 26, 28>
    - <8, 12, 27>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
