Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].

The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
