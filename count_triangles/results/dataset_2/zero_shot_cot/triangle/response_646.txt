Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 15) (14, 0) (14, 10) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 13) (1, 6) (1, 8) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 19) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 19) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 18) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 15) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (9, 4) (9, 17) (5, 3) (5, 18) (5, 10) (18, 6) (18, 15) (18, 8) (18, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 4) (17, 7) (17, 8) (17, 9) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5)
