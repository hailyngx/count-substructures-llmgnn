Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in the given graph by checking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The possible triangles are: 
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
