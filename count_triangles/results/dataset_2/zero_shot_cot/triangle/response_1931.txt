Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (4, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 19) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 16) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 13) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (12, 7) (12, 16) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 14) (17, 5) (17, 9) (15, 10) (15, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 2) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 12) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 2) (0, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 19) (2, 6) (14, 9)
