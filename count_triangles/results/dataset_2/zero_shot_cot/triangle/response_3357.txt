Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 17) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 18) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 13) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 19) (14, 16) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 19) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 7) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 12) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 7) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 18) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 11) (18, 16) (3, 9) (11, 9) (11, 18) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 2) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 0) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 18)
