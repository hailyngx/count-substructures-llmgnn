Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 15) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 10) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 10) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 15) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 15) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 19) (10, 12) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 11) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
The unique triangles are <0, 17, 14>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 12>, <1, 5, 11>, <2, 4, 12>, <2, 8, 10>, <7, 11, 19>, <8, 12, 15>.
