Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
In order to count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Let's list the triangles found in the graph:
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 1>
<3, 7, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 7>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
