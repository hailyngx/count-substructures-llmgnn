Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 13) (10, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 2) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 14)
