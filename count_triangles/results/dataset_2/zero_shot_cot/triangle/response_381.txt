Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (10, 15) (10, 2) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 12) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 19) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 19) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 12) (1, 7) (1, 17) (15, 10) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (12, 17) (12, 2) (3, 7) (3, 13) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 14) (6, 16) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (18, 16) (18, 14)
