Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in this graph:
1. <1, 3, 8>
2. <1, 3, 9>
3. <1, 4, 7>
4. <2, 3, 8>
5. <4, 6, 8>
6. <6, 8, 2>

So, the total number of triangles is [6].
