Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (1, 14) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 4) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 4) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 4) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 13) (4, 14) (4, 0) (4, 3)
