Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 21) (3, 6) (15, 10) (15, 1) (15, 12) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 28) (9, 14) (9, 7) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 2) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 17) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 7) (6, 20) (2, 25) (2, 8) (2, 28) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 24) (14, 20) (17, 8) (17, 29) (17, 1) (29, 17) (29, 21) (22, 4) (1, 15) (1, 25) (1, 17) (1, 23) (1, 12) (21, 3) (21, 25) (21, 6) (21, 29) (7, 9) (7, 6) (26, 28) (26, 18) (28, 9) (28, 2) (28, 26) (28, 20) (16, 4) (16, 19) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 19) (18, 14) (18, 26) (18, 23) (4, 22) (4, 16) (4, 10) (4, 23) (11, 20) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 23) (23, 1) (23, 18) (23, 4) (23, 19) (24, 14) (24, 12) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 24) (20, 6) (20, 14) (20, 28) (20, 11) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [34].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <1, 12, 15>, <1, 12, 25>, <1, 17, 23>, <1, 17, 25>, <1, 17, 29>, <1, 23, 4>, <1, 23, 19>, <5, 6, 21>, <5, 13, 8>, <5, 13, 0>, <5, 13, 9>, <5, 9, 7>, <6, 5, 13>, <6, 5, 21>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 21>, <7, 6, 9>, <9, 5, 13>, <9, 5, 28>, <9, 7, 6>, <9, 7, 14>, <9, 14, 0>, <9, 14, 18>, <9, 14, 24>, <10, 4, 16>, <10, 4, 19>, <10, 15, 1>, <14, 0, 18>, <14, 0, 24>, <14, 9, 5>, <14, 9, 7>, <14, 18, 23>, and <19, 10, 16>.
