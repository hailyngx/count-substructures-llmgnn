Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 13) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 5) (10, 17) (10, 4) (11, 19) (11, 15) (17, 6) (17, 10) (17, 18) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 13) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 5) (7, 3) (7, 14) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 5) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 15) (15, 9) (15, 11) (15, 19) (14, 7) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 18) (13, 16) (13, 12) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 12)
