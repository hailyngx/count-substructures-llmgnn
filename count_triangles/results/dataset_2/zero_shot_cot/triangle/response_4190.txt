Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 12) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 2) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 1) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 2) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 9) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 5) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of 15 triangles present in the given graph. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<1, 5, 13>
<6, 7, 14>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 6, 10>
<0, 6, 12>
<2, 6, 14>
<2, 13, 3>
<2, 13, 6>
<3, 11, 13>
<5, 11, 12>
<8, 10, 12>
<8, 12, 14>
<9, 10, 11>
<9, 10, 12>
<9, 11, 12> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
