Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (3, 18) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 8) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 10) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 6) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 19) (0, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 13) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 16) (16, 14) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 9) (19, 3) (19, 6) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 13) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 18) (18, 3) (18, 16) (18, 13)
