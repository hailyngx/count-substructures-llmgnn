Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 18) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (0, 16) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 6) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 19) (15, 1) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 12) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 2) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 19) (19, 7) (19, 18) (12, 0) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 17) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (2, 9) (2, 16) (2, 17) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other in such a way that they create a closed loop. 

Let's list the triangles found in the graph step by step:
1. Triangle <1, 15, 5>
2. Triangle <3, 9, 15>
3. Triangle <3, 9, 11>
4. Triangle <3, 9, 8>
5. Triangle <4, 8, 10>
6. Triangle <4, 8, 14>
7. Triangle <5, 6, 14>
8. Triangle <5, 8, 15>
9. Triangle <9, 11, 13>
10. Triangle <12, 13, 17>
11. Triangle <12, 13, 11>
12. Triangle <12, 13, 15>
13. Triangle <12, 15, 16>
14. Triangle <0, 16, 12>
15. Triangle <2, 9, 17>

Counting the number of unique triangles found, we have a total of [15] triangles in the given graph.
