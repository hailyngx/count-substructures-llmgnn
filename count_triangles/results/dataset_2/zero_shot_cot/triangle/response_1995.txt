Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 5) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 2) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 14) 

Response:
There are 16 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 8, 11>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 8, 11>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 0>
<8, 5, 0>
<10, 11, 7>
<10, 5, 0>
<11, 7, 5>
<11, 6, 0>
<7, 5, 0>
<13, 6, 2>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
