Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 5>
