Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 23) (16, 4) (5, 13) (5, 22) (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 29) (9, 15) (9, 14) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 6) (3, 1) (0, 12) (0, 23) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 18) (4, 16) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 25) (18, 20) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 28) (19, 26) (19, 8) (19, 27) (26, 19) (26, 24) (21, 24) (21, 6) (21, 25) (24, 16) (24, 26) (24, 21) (24, 29) (24, 25) (28, 18) (28, 14) (17, 1) (17, 2) (17, 7) (6, 1) (6, 21) (6, 2) (6, 27) (29, 9) (29, 24) (29, 15) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 22) (13, 5) (13, 23) (14, 9) (14, 28) (22, 5) (22, 4) (22, 8) (22, 27) (27, 19) (27, 6) (27, 22) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 13) (23, 7) (7, 20) (7, 17) (7, 23) (12, 0) (12, 20) (12, 18) (25, 4) (25, 21) (25, 24) (25, 15) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 29) (15, 25) (10, 5) (2, 17) (2, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [18] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 6>, <4, 16, 18>, <4, 22, 27>, <4, 8, 22>, <4, 25, 15>, <5, 15, 25>, <6, 1, 21>, <6, 2, 27>, <7, 17, 23>, <9, 15, 29>, <12, 18, 20>, <12, 18, 28>, <13, 5, 23>, <16, 11, 24>, <16, 24, 29>, <18, 4, 22>, <21, 6, 25>, <24, 25, 29>.
