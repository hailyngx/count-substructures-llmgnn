Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (12, 6) (12, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<6, 9, 4>
<6, 9, 7>
<5, 6, 13>
<5, 13, 1>
<2, 8, 14>
<0, 1, 14>
