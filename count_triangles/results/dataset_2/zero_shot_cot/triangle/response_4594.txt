Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 13) (14, 8) (14, 7) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 19) (1, 11) (1, 5) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 2) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 6) (6, 17) (6, 16) (6, 4) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (9, 17) (9, 12) (9, 18) (18, 15) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 18) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 10) (13, 15) (13, 12) (13, 18) (10, 4) (10, 7) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 10) (19, 3) (19, 17) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [28]. 
The unique triangles found are <4, 6, 16>, <8, 12, 18>, <3, 8, 18>, <13, 15, 18>, <4, 6, 10>, <5, 7, 10>, <0, 12, 13>, <2, 5, 7>, <9, 12, 18>, <15, 18, 13>, <8, 11, 18>, <1, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <17, 19, 3>, <0, 2, 12>, <8, 11, 1>, <16, 2, 6>, <15, 18, 9>, <1, 11, 8>, <6, 16, 2>, <8, 14, 7>, <9, 17, 6>, <0, 12, 2>, <13, 15, 0>, <18, 15, 0>, <4, 6, 17>, <17, 9, 12>.
