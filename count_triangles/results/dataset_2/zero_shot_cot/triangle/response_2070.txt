Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 6) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 15) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 7) (17, 13) (17, 15) (4, 8) (4, 1) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 3) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 14) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 9) (15, 13) (15, 17) (9, 0) (9, 19) (9, 1) (9, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (18, 10) (18, 9) (18, 6) (6, 16) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 18) (14, 5) (14, 1)
