Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 19) (15, 8) (15, 16) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 18) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 15) (8, 2) (8, 12) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 4) (5, 19) (5, 4) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 16) (18, 17) (18, 14) (18, 16) (7, 3) (7, 6) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 13) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (13, 14) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 0) (16, 15) (16, 19) (16, 18) (16, 13) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 13) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 12) (12, 8) (12, 0)
