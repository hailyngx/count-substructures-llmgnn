Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
There are three triangles in this graph. 
The unique triangles found are: <4, 7, 1>, <8, 5, 3>, <0, 6, 2>. 

So, the total number of triangles is [3].
