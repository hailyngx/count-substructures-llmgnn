Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 8) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 15) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (0, 16) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 15) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 5) (19, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (17, 4) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 10) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 10) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 9) (12, 5) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 9) 

Response:
