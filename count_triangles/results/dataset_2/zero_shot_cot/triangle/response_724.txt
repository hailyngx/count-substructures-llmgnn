Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 12) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 7) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13)
