Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 19) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 3) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 3) (15, 4) (15, 10) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 0) (0, 11) (0, 19) (0, 3) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 17) (17, 12) (17, 5) (3, 18) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (2, 11) (2, 14) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 17) (5, 1) (14, 18) (14, 3) (14, 2) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 5)
