Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 19) (3, 6) (3, 15) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 8) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 13) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 19) (19, 6) (19, 12) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 1) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 12) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 16) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 2) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 4) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 11) (18, 15)
