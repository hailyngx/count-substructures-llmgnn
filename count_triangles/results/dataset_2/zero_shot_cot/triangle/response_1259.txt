Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are [32] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are: 
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 4>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
<p>(Note: The vertices inside the triangle are in ascending order.)
