Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 17) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 18) (7, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 6) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 1) (0, 7) (0, 19) (15, 1) (15, 5) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 19) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 14) (18, 8) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 10) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 19) (19, 0) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 10) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 10) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 5)
