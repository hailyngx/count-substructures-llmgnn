Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (26, 9) (26, 21) (26, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 9) (6, 26) (6, 24) (6, 25) (6, 16) (18, 22) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 29) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 15) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 16) (23, 20) (23, 13) (10, 15) (10, 24) (11, 3) (11, 4) (3, 22) (3, 11) (3, 12) (25, 6) (25, 1) (25, 14) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 1) (20, 23) (20, 0) (20, 2) (4, 22) (4, 11) (19, 8) (19, 15) (7, 5) (7, 18) (21, 26) (21, 16) (15, 22) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 28) (13, 23) (13, 17) (13, 2) (17, 0) (17, 13) (17, 28) (17, 27) (8, 19) (8, 29) (8, 27) (16, 6) (16, 23) (16, 21) (16, 14) (27, 17) (27, 8) (27, 1) (2, 20) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (24, 6) (24, 10) (29, 18) (29, 8) (1, 5) (1, 25) (1, 0) (1, 27) (28, 15) (28, 17) (14, 18) (14, 25) (14, 16) (14, 12) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<5, 1, 25>
<5, 7, 18>
<5, 7, 0>
<23, 20, 0>
<23, 20, 2>
<23, 13, 17>
<22, 18, 7>
<22, 18, 29>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
