Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in this graph. Below are the unique triangles found:
