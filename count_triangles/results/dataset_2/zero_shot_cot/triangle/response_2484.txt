Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 9) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 15) (9, 10) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 10) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 8) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 12) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (17, 19) (17, 13) (17, 4) (1, 5) (1, 14) (6, 12) (7, 13) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 6) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 13) (14, 1) (8, 5) (8, 18) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 18) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 17)
