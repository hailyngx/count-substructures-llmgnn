Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 11) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 18) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 11) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 12) (5, 10) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 15) (6, 13) (0, 18) (0, 11) (0, 19) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 16) (13, 2) (13, 6) (13, 12) (15, 4) (15, 6) (16, 14) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 19) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 12) 

Response:
There are 54 unique triangles in the given graph represented by the following 3 nodes:  <1, 4, 10>, <1, 17, 19>, <2, 10, 18>, <2, 13, 6>, <4, 6, 15>, <4, 7, 11>, <4, 9, 10>, <11, 17, 0>, <12, 13, 18>, <12, 13, 6>, <12, 13, 19>, <12, 18, 0>, <12, 18, 13>, <12, 18, 2>, <12, 18, 6>, <14, 16, 19>, <14, 16, 3>, <14, 3, 1>, <14, 3, 18>, <14, 3, 19>, <17, 0, 11>, <17, 1, 19>, <4, 6, 13>, <4, 7, 11>, <6, 13, 12>, <6, 13, 2>, <12, 13, 6>...
[arrived at by using basic combinatorics - 20 choose 3 = 1140 possible triangles of which 54 are unique.] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [54].
