Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are <2, 8, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 7>, and <5, 7, 8>.
