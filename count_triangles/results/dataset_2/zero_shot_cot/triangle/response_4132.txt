Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (0, 3) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 12) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 9) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2)
