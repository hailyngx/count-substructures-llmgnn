Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) 

Response:
There are <0, 7, 14>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 1, 11>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 7, 14>, <0, 11, 13>, <1, 3, 12>, <1, 3, 11>, <1, 3, 0>, <1, 8, 6>, <1, 8, 5>, <1, 8, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 13>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 11, 6>, <3, 11, 10>, <3, 12, 7>, <4, 12, 7>, <4, 13, 0>, <4, 13, 12>, <4, 6, 11>, <5, 6, 4>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 10, 13>, <6, 11, 3>, <6, 11, 10>, <6, 11, 0>, <6, 8, 5>, <6, 8, 7>, <7, 12, 13>, <7, 14, 12>, <8, 9, 5>, <10, 11, 3>, <10, 13, 4>.
