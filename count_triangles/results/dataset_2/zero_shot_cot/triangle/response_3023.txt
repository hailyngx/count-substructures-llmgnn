Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 12) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 9) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 14) 

Response:

The unique triangles found are: 
<2, 8, 10>
<2, 5, 12>
<2, 6, 14>
<5, 11, 12>
<6, 11, 14>
<8, 9, 10>
