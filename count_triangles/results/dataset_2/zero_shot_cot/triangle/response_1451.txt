Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 11) (13, 1) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 12) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].

The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 9, 2>
<5, 9, 10>
<5, 2, 10>
<4, 7, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 8, 13>
<0, 13, 14>
<13, 11, 3>
<1, 11, 13>
<1, 11, 12>
<2, 9, 10>
