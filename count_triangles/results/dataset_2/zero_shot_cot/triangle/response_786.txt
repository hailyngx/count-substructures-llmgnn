Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 16) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 18) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 16) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 18) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 7) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 7) (0, 16) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 13) (13, 2) (13, 14) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 6) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 0) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 7) (12, 3) (12, 5) (19, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [10].
The unique triangles are <1, 2, 3>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 10>, <1, 7, 11>, <2, 3, 15>, <2, 8, 18>, <4, 5, 16>, <4, 8, 18>, <4, 14, 13>, <7, 0, 16>.
