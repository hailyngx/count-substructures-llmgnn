Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [8].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 7, 3>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <5, 3, 7>, <6, 4, 7>, <7, 8, 9>.
