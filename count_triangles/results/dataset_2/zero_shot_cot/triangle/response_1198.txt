Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<4, 8, 1>
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 8, 5>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
