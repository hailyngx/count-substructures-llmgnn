Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are total of 5 triangles in this graph.

The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 7, 9>

So, the total number of triangles is [5].
