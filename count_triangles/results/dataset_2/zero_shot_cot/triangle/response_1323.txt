Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [24].
The unique triangles found are <2, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 2>, <3, 6, 8>, <7, 6, 8>, <5, 8, 1>, <5, 8, 2>, <5, 8, 6>.
