Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 16) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 18) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (17, 0) (17, 5) (5, 17) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 18) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 0) (15, 18) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 8) (12, 3) (16, 4) (16, 10) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 13) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) (14, 8) (14, 13) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 18) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 14) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 0)
