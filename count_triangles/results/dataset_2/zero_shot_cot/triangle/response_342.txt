Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3)
