Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7)
