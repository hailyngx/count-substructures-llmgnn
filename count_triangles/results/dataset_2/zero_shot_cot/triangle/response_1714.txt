Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 1) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 14) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [17].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 9, 13>, <1, 8, 11>, <3, 7, 14>, <4, 7, 10>, <4, 9, 11>, <4, 10, 11>, <4, 10, 12>, <6, 9, 13>, <6, 7, 14>, <9, 10, 14>, <0, 1, 13>, <3, 7, 10>, <3, 10, 14>, <7, 10, 14>, <7, 10, 2>, <9, 11, 4>, <11, 8, 1>.
