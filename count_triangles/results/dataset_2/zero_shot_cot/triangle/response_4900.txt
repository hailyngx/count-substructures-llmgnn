Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are as follows:

1. <1, 2, 3>
2. <1, 6, 8>
3. <3, 5, 8>
4. <3, 4, 9>
5. <4, 6, 9>
6. <6, 0, 7>
7. <7, 4, 9>
8. <7, 1, 3>
9. <8, 1, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
