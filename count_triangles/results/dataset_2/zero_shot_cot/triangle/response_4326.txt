This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 20) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 14) (22, 27) (22, 12) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 8) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 16) (17, 29) (17, 27) (4, 28) (7, 8) (10, 18) (11, 0) (11, 29) (11, 20) (6, 3) (6, 23) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 23) (8, 21) (23, 13) (23, 6) (23, 8) (23, 25) (23, 16) (29, 17) (29, 11) (29, 1) (29, 27) (1, 29) (1, 16) (1, 12) (26, 19) (26, 0) (19, 26) (19, 15) (19, 21) (19, 20) (19, 16) (16, 14) (16, 23) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 28) (28, 4) (28, 16) (3, 6) (3, 27) (21, 8) (21, 19) (21, 15) (25, 23) (25, 24) (15, 19) (15, 21) (27, 22) (27, 17) (27, 29) (27, 3) (27, 18) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 27) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 24) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 0) (0, 11) (0, 26) (0, 24) (2, 13) (2, 14) (20, 13) (20, 5) (20, 11) (20, 19) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the triangles present in the graph:
- Triangle 1: (13, 22, 14)
- Triangle 2: (13, 22, 27)
- Triangle 3: (5, 9, 8)
- Triangle 4: (13, 2, 14)
- Triangle 5: (13, 23, 6)
- Triangle 6: (13, 23, 8)
- Triangle 7: (5, 20, 11)
- Triangle 8: (2, 14, 12)
- Triangle 9: (8, 23, 16)
- Triangle 10: (8, 23, 27)
- Triangle 11: (23, 16, 1)
- Triangle 12: (16, 1, 12)
- Triangle 13: (16, 23, 28)
- Triangle 14: (27, 3, 6)
- Triangle 15: (27, 3, 18)
- Triangle 16: (12, 1, 24)
- Triangle 17: (12, 24, 0)

2. Count the total number of unique triangles: 17

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [17]. 
The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<13, 22, 14>, <13, 22, 27>, <5, 9, 8>, <13, 2, 14>, <13, 23, 6>, <13, 23, 8>, <5, 20, 11>, <2, 14, 12>, <8, 23, 16>, <8, 23, 27>, <23, 16, 1>, <16, 1, 12>, <16, 23, 28>, <27, 3, 6>, <27, 3, 18>, <12, 1, 24>, <12, 24, 0>.
