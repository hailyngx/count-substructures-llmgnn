Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 13) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 13) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 13, 14>
<0, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 11>
<1, 6, 10>
<1, 2, 13>
<4, 12, 13>
<9, 10, 11>
