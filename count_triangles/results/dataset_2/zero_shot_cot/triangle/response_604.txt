Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique triangles found in the graph are <5, 9, 6>, <6, 4, 1>, <6, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <5, 9, 3>, <2, 5, 7>.
