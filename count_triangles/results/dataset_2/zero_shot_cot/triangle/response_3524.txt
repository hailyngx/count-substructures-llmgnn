Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].

The unique triangles found in the graph are <1, 3, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, and <0, 2, 7>.
