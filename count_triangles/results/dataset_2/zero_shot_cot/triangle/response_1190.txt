Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 9) (14, 12) (17, 1) (17, 8) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 15) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 13) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 7) (13, 8) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 1) (5, 19) (5, 3) (6, 16) (6, 11) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 11) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 9) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 11) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 12) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 18) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 19) (11, 18) (15, 4) (15, 12) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 15)
