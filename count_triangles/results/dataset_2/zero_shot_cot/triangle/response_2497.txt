Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 6) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 14) (9, 0) (9, 14) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 0) 

Response:
[<0, 4, 14>, <0, 3, 14>, <0, 12, 9>, <1, 6, 11>, <2, 4, 14>, <2, 10, 12>, <2, 13, 6>, <3, 5, 14>, <3, 8, 13>, <5, 6, 14>, <7, 8, 11>]
[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 9, 14>, <1, 6, 11>, <2, 4, 10>, <2, 13, 6>, <3, 5, 14>, <3, 8, 13>, <5, 6, 14>, <7, 8, 11>]
There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
