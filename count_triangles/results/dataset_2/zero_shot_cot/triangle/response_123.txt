Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 0) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (12, 5) (12, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 14) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 4)
