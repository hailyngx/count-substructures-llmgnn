Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 1) (4, 0) 

Response:
Total number of triangles: [10]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 1>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 1>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 8>
