Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 4) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 14) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 4) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 14) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 4) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 14) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 2)
