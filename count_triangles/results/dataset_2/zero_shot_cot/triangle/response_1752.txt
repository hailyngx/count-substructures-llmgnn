Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 19) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 10) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 15) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 18) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 7) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 19) (16, 17) (18, 5) (18, 11) (18, 15) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 17) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 18) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 19) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 10) (0, 12)
