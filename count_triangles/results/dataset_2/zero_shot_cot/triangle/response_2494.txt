Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 4) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 13) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 10) (1, 9) (1, 13) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 1) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 10>
<5, 6, 14>
<5, 8, 2>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 11, 12>
<5, 11, 0>
<5, 11, 13>
<5, 14, 0>
<5, 14, 3>
<6, 7, 10>
<7, 10, 4>
<7, 10, 14>
<8, 2, 4>
<12, 4, 0>
These are the unique triangles in the given graph.
