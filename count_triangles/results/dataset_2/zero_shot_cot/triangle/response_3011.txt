Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 23) (1, 9) (21, 7) (21, 12) (21, 25) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 17) (6, 22) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 13) (9, 0) (7, 21) (7, 17) (7, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 20) (17, 6) (17, 7) (17, 27) (28, 6) (28, 8) (28, 5) (28, 15) (22, 6) (22, 26) (22, 2) (22, 16) (26, 22) (26, 16) (26, 4) (4, 26) (4, 27) (4, 16) (27, 17) (27, 4) (27, 2) (27, 5) (25, 21) (25, 19) (25, 18) (20, 10) (20, 29) (20, 24) (29, 20) (29, 16) (29, 24) (8, 7) (8, 28) (8, 19) (19, 25) (19, 8) (19, 23) (2, 22) (2, 27) (2, 5) (2, 11) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 4) (16, 29) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 23) (18, 25) (18, 23) (15, 28) (5, 28) (5, 27) (5, 2) (11, 2) (11, 24) (24, 20) (24, 29) (24, 11) (3, 12) (23, 1) (23, 19) (23, 0) (23, 18) (23, 12) (14, 10) (12, 21) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 23) (13, 9) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph.

Unique triangles found:
<0, 10, 12>
<0, 12, 23>
<4, 16, 26>
<5, 8, 28>
<5, 11, 24>
<6, 9, 28>
<18, 23, 25>
<20, 24, 29>

So, the total number of triangles is [8].
