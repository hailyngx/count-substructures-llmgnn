Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 6) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 18) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 15) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 19) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 19) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 17) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 19) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 7) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 3) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 19) (7, 1)
