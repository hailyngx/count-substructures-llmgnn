Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 1) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 5) 

Response:
