Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 13) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 2) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) 

Response:
[<2, 7, 11> <3, 4, 13>]
