Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 21) (9, 3) (8, 28) (8, 10) (8, 25) (13, 23) (13, 14) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 29) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 28) (15, 6) (15, 20) (15, 28) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 14) (7, 27) (12, 7) (12, 29) (11, 2) (28, 8) (28, 20) (28, 15) (28, 18) (25, 8) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 19) (25, 22) (1, 6) (1, 14) (3, 9) (3, 21) (3, 29) (21, 9) (21, 3) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 10) (2, 6) (2, 11) (23, 13) (23, 5) (23, 18) (26, 0) (26, 25) (26, 29) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 1) (5, 23) (5, 4) (19, 25) (19, 4) (19, 17) (17, 19) (17, 22) (18, 28) (18, 23) (24, 29) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 19) (29, 0) (29, 12) (29, 3) (29, 26) (29, 24) (27, 20) (27, 7) (27, 10) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 27) (10, 22) (22, 25) (22, 16) (22, 17) (22, 10) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is as follows: 

[<0, 20, 15> <0, 20, 28> <0, 16, 22> <0, 26, 29> <4, 5, 19> <7, 25, 27> <7, 12, 29> <8, 25, 28> <9, 4, 19> <9, 3, 21> <10, 16, 22> <14, 7, 27> <15, 6, 20> <25, 7, 14> <25, 22, 10> <25, 26, 29> <28, 15, 20>] 

There are a total of [16] triangles in the given graph.
