Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in this graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 
Let's list the unique triangles found:

<5, 6, 3>
<5, 6, 4>
<5, 1, 4>
<5, 0, 7>
<9, 6, 4>
<9, 4, 7>
<6, 4, 7>
<6, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<7, 1, 2> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
