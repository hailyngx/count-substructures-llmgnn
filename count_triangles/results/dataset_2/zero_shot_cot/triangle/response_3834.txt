Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 3) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 5) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 14) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 10) 

Response:
There are <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 5, 10>, <0, 5, 12>, <0, 5, 14>, <2, 1, 9>, <2, 1, 13>, <2, 7, 12>, <2, 7, 14>, <5, 10, 13>, <6, 12, 14>, <7, 2, 13>, <7, 5, 14>, <9, 2, 13>, <10, 5, 13> triangles in the graph.

Thus, there are a total of [15] triangles in the graph.
