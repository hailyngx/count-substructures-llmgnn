Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 4) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 14) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 5) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 10) (17, 15) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (9, 11) (9, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 14) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 18) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 18) (7, 1) (7, 3) (15, 17) (15, 19) (19, 15) (19, 0) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 16) (6, 4) (14, 16) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 18) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 6) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 5)
