Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 2) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 19) (10, 11) (10, 7) (2, 15) (2, 8) (18, 14) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 17) (5, 16) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 17) (17, 12) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 9) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 14) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 15) (19, 1) (19, 14) (19, 9) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 6) (14, 19) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 19) 

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in the given graph.

From the list of edges, we can see the following triangles:
- (1, 3, 11)
- (2, 8, 15)
- (4, 9, 12)
- (6, 14, 17)
- (9, 14, 19)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles:
Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <1, 3, 11>, <2, 8, 15>, <4, 9, 12>, <6, 14, 17>, <9, 14, 19>
