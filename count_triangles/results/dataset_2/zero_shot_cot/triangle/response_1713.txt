Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
Steps to find the number of triangles:

1. List out the triangles by selecting three nodes and checking if there is an edge between each pair of nodes.
2. Go through all possible combinations to identify triangles in the graph.
3. Count the total number of unique triangles found.

Here are the <unique triangles> found:
1. <5, 6, 2>
2. <5, 1, 3>
3. <5, 1, 2>
4. <5, 3, 2>
5. <9, 0, 7>
6. <9, 4, 8>
7. <9, 4, 2>
8. <9, 8, 7>
9. <4, 7, 0>
10. <4, 7, 6>
11. <4, 8, 6>
12. <4, 2, 7>
13. <4, 2, 6>
14. <7, 0, 6>
15. <7, 0, 2>
16. <7, 6, 2>
17. <1, 3, 0>
18. <8, 3, 0>
19. <8, 6, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [19].
