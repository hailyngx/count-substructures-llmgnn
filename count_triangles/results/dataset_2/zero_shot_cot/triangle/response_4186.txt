Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [18].
Unique triangles found are <2, 9, 7>, <1, 9, 0>, <1, 9, 2>, <1, 8, 0>, <1, 7, 2>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 3, 2>, <9, 8, 4>, <9, 7, 2>, <9, 4, 7>, <9, 2, 7>, <9, 2, 1>, <9, 1, 0>, <8, 6, 4>, <3, 2, 1>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 7, 4>.
