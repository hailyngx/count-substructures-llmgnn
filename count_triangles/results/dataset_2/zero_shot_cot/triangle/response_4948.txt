Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) 

Response:
Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <5, 1, 9>, <5, 7, 1>, <5, 6, 8>, <6, 1, 7>, <8, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>
