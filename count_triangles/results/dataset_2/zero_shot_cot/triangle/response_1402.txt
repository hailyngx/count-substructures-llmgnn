Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (15, 7) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 17) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 17) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 18) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 13) (6, 16) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 8) (0, 10) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 14) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 17) (1, 2) (1, 19) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 2) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 16) (14, 18) (8, 12) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 18) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 1)
