Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 3) (20, 23) (20, 28) (25, 8) (25, 0) (10, 21) (10, 9) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 1) (17, 29) (17, 16) (17, 22) (17, 2) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 16) (28, 20) (28, 29) (28, 24) (29, 17) (29, 28) (29, 1) (29, 4) (12, 27) (12, 21) (12, 14) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 1) (27, 5) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 6) (3, 20) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 14) (3, 24) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 3) (23, 20) (23, 11) (23, 4) (5, 27) (5, 26) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 22) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 24) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 14) (16, 17) (16, 18) (24, 28) (24, 3) (24, 19) (24, 0) (1, 11) (1, 29) (1, 27) (1, 7) (8, 25) (8, 6) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 7) (6, 26) (6, 8) (0, 25) (0, 15) (0, 24) (0, 22) (0, 9) (9, 10) (9, 0) (22, 17) (22, 15) (22, 0) (13, 2) (4, 29) (4, 23)
