Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 11) (3, 10) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 18) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 0) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 17) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 11) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 14) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 14) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 4) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 16) (15, 0) (15, 16) (15, 17) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 15) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 12) (9, 1) (9, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 12) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 10) (17, 2) (17, 15)
