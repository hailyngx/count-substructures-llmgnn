Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 19) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 15) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7) (9, 8) (9, 13) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 8) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 18) (4, 3) (12, 5) (12, 18) (0, 5) (16, 17) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 18) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 14) (2, 13) (2, 5) (14, 1) (14, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 unique triangles in this graph of 20 nodes and 60 edges, as shown below:

[<1, 3, 17>]
[<1, 3, 11>]
[<1, 7, 17>]
[<1, 13, 17>]
[<3, 11, 13>]
[<5, 7, 11>]
[<5, 7, 17>]
[<5, 11, 17>]
[<7, 11, 17>]
[<11, 15, 18>]
 
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
