Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 13) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 15) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (2, 3) (2, 15) (18, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 8) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 19) (5, 3) (19, 11) (19, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 16) (4, 0) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 16) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 16) (9, 10) (9, 16) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 16) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 15) 

Response:
There are 20 nodes and 60 edges in the given graph. To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify unique triangles among the edges provided.

After analyzing the edges, the triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 8, 14>
<0, 4, 16>
<0, 17, 15>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 6, 16>
<1, 13, 6>
<1, 13, 4>
<2, 3, 15>
<3, 13, 1>
<3, 13, 6>
<3, 13, 12>
<3, 17, 15>
<4, 16, 6>
<4, 16, 8>
<4, 19, 11>
<6, 9, 10>
<6, 16, 9>
<7, 11, 12>
<8, 14, 18>
<13, 12, 11>
<16, 15, 17>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [21].
