Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 15) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 19) (3, 12) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 2) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 18) (1, 8) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 19) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 9) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 7) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 10) (7, 4) (5, 15) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 18) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 4) (12, 3) (12, 14) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 0) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 13) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 18)
