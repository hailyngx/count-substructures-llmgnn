Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 7) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<6, 9, 2>
<6, 9, 10>
<6, 9, 0>
<6, 5, 3>
<6, 5, 11>
<6, 11, 3>
<4, 8, 10>
<12, 8, 10>
