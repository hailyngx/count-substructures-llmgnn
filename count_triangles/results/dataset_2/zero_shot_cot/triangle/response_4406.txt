Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 5) (5, 14) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 13) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [23].
The unique triangles found are <0, 12, 14>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 4>, <5, 6, 14>, <5, 13, 6>, <5, 13, 3>, <5, 13, 10>, <5, 1, 2>, <5, 1, 4>, <6, 10, 3>, <6, 10, 8>, <6, 13, 3>, <10, 8, 11>, <10, 9, 4>, <1, 9, 4>, <12, 0, 14>, <12, 0, 2>, <12, 11, 4>, <12, 11, 7>, <14, 4, 1>, <14, 4, 11>, <14, 5, 6>, <14, 5, 13>.
