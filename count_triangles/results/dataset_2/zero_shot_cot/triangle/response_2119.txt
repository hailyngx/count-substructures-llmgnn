Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 0) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 4) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 12) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 9) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 14) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (14, 2) (14, 10)
