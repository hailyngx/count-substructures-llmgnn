Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 23) (13, 7) (13, 18) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 27) (22, 12) (3, 17) (3, 23) (3, 8) (15, 26) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 24) (9, 26) (9, 17) (9, 16) (26, 15) (26, 9) (26, 14) (4, 24) (4, 2) (7, 13) (0, 20) (0, 10) (0, 19) (20, 0) (20, 1) (20, 21) (20, 23) (20, 11) (1, 20) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 14) (10, 0) (21, 13) (21, 20) (21, 18) (14, 22) (14, 26) (14, 1) (14, 18) (2, 22) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 11) (12, 22) (12, 18) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 19) (11, 20) (11, 2) (6, 25) (6, 8) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 9) (5, 23) (5, 27) (23, 13) (23, 3) (23, 20) (23, 5) (27, 22) (27, 5) (27, 29) (27, 24) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 25) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 29) (18, 13) (18, 21) (18, 14) (18, 12) (24, 15) (24, 4) (24, 27) (25, 6) (25, 29) (25, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 25) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<0, 1, 20>, <1, 14, 16>, <2, 11, 20>, <2, 14, 22>, <4, 24, 27>, <6, 8, 25>, <9, 15, 17>, <9, 16, 19>, <13, 18, 21>, <14, 18, 22>, <23, 27, 29>, <25, 27, 29>.
