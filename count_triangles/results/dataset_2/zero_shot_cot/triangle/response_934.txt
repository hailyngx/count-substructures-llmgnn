Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 11) (14, 6) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 7) (6, 14) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 4) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 19) (11, 14) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 12) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 6) (19, 10) (19, 5) (15, 0) (15, 16) (15, 4) (16, 17) (16, 15) (16, 7) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 16) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 1) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 1) (3, 17) (3, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 15) (1, 12) (1, 18) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 12>
<4, 9, 10>
<4, 10, 19>
<6, 9, 18>
<7, 8, 16>
<7, 16, 17>
