Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) 

Response:
There are 18 unique triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<9, 1, 5>
<9, 2, 8>

So, there are a total of [18] triangles in the graph.
