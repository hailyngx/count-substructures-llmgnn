Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 15) (12, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 19) (8, 17) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 3) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 9) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 0) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 17) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 9) (16, 1) (11, 2) (11, 18) (14, 2) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 10) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 11) (10, 7) (10, 9) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 19) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 4) 

Response:
There are [60] edges in the graph.

The triangles in the graph are:
<5, 13, 3>
<5, 13, 6>
<5, 3, 13>
<6, 7, 12>
<6, 2, 3>
<6, 2, 13>
<7, 12, 15>
<7, 10, 9>
<7, 18, 11>
<12, 15, 1>
<12, 9, 1>
<2, 3, 13>
<2, 3, 4>
<8, 17, 19>
<13, 3, 4>
<1, 15, 0>
<1, 9, 0>
<15, 0, 18>
<19, 4, 0>
<4, 9, 0>

There are [19] triangles in the given graph.
