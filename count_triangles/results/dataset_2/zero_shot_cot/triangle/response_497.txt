Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in this graph, and they are:
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 3, 8>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
