Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 18) (3, 5) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 19) (8, 11) (8, 4) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 14) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 16) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 7) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 16) (12, 6) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 6) (9, 0) (9, 14) (18, 1) (18, 11) (2, 4) (2, 6) (7, 10) (7, 19) (7, 15) (7, 17) (13, 11) (13, 16) (17, 19) (17, 7) (6, 12) (6, 16) (6, 2)
