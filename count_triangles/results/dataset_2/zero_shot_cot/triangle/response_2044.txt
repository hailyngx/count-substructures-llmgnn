Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 19) (15, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (17, 10) (17, 16) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (11, 14) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 18) (8, 15) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 14) (18, 0) (18, 19) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 16) (16, 17) (16, 0) (16, 19) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 14) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 11)
