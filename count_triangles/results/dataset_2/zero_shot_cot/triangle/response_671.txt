Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 1) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is 4.

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
