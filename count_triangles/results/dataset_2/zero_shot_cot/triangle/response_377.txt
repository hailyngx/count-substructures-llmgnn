Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 19) (6, 4) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 19) (11, 9) (11, 12) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 18) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 4) (7, 5) (7, 10) (16, 17) (16, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 17) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 13) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 19) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 3) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 19) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 15) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 15) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 14 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<1, 12, 13>
<1, 12, 18>
<1, 13, 15>
<2, 9, 17>
<2, 9, 5>
<2, 17, 4>
<3, 10, 19>
<4, 14, 15>
<4, 17, 19>
<4, 6, 14>
<8, 12, 18>
<9, 11, 12>
<9, 11, 19>
<10, 13, 15>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [14].
