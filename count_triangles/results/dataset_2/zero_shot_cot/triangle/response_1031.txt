Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 5) (15, 18) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 17) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 16) (18, 15) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 8) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 16) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 10) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 12) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 1) (5, 3) (5, 19) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 11) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (12, 18) (12, 1) (13, 7) (13, 11) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 1) (16, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 19) (6, 3) (6, 16)
