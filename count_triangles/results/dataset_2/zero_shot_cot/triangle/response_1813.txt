Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 12) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 13) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 15) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (18, 6) (19, 3) (19, 14) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (0, 11) (0, 8) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 13) (7, 1) (7, 13) (17, 5) (17, 15) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 9) (8, 0) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 17) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 13) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 16) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 11)
