Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 15) (16, 13) (16, 4) (16, 6) (5, 17) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 12) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 4) (1, 15) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 4) (14, 15) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 18) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 14) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 10) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 10) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 12) (10, 13) (10, 7) (12, 9) (12, 19) (0, 11) (0, 19) (0, 18) (18, 8) (18, 0) (4, 16) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<4, 6, 16>
<4, 14, 17>
<6, 9, 16>
<4, 8, 14>
