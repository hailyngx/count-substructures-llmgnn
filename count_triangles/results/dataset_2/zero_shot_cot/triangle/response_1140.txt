Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in this graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<4, 10, 11> 
<2, 4, 5> 
<2, 5, 14> 
<2, 5, 11> 
<7, 11, 4> 
<1, 7, 13> 
<0, 3, 14> 
<0, 8, 6>
