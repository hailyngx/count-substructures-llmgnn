Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 9) (1, 13) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 10) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 11) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 2) (19, 13) (19, 14) (9, 16) (9, 2) (12, 18) (12, 15) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 17) (15, 12) (15, 14) (18, 1) (18, 12) (14, 19) (14, 15)
