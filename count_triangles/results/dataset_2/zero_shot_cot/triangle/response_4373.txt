Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 27) (20, 29) (20, 18) (20, 22) (20, 2) (25, 6) (25, 24) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 21) (8, 7) (5, 12) (6, 25) (6, 24) (6, 14) (6, 15) (28, 29) (28, 26) (28, 13) (29, 20) (29, 28) (29, 26) (29, 12) (2, 20) (2, 27) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 17) (0, 7) (0, 22) (0, 23) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 27) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 17) (21, 8) (21, 19) (21, 12) (17, 11) (17, 26) (17, 15) (24, 25) (24, 6) (24, 9) (14, 6) (22, 20) (22, 0) (22, 27) (9, 4) (9, 24) (9, 10) (9, 23) (23, 0) (23, 9) (23, 19) (27, 16) (27, 2) (27, 1) (27, 22) (27, 13) (12, 5) (12, 29) (12, 21) (3, 4) (3, 10) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 19) (18, 20) (18, 10) (18, 13) (19, 21) (19, 23) (19, 10) (13, 28) (13, 1) (13, 27) (13, 18) 

Response:
In order to count the number of triangles, we can look for nodes that have at least two edges connecting them. 

Let's look for triangles step-by-step:

1. Nodes with multiple edges:
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 8 and 9.
   - Node 6: Connected to nodes 15, 24, and 25.
   - Node 8: Connected to nodes 4, 7, and 21.
   - Node 9: Connected to nodes 4, 10, and 23.
   - Node 10: Connected to nodes 3, 9, 18, and 19.
   - Node 13: Connected to nodes 1, 18, 27, and 28.
   - Node 15: Connected to nodes 1, 6, and 17.
   - Node 16: Connected to nodes 7, 11, and 27.
   - Node 17: Connected to nodes 11, 15, and 26.
   - Node 18: Connected to nodes 10, 13, and 20.
   - Node 19: Connected to nodes 10, 21, and 23.
   - Node 20: Connected to nodes 2, 18, 22, and 29.
   - Node 22: Connected to nodes 0, 20, and 27.
   - Node 23: Connected to nodes 0, 9, and 19.
   - Node 24: Connected to nodes 6, 9, and 25.
   - Node 26: Connected to nodes 17, 28, and 29.
   - Node 27: Connected to nodes 1, 16, 22, and 13.
   - Node 28: Connected to nodes 13, 26, and 29.
   - Node 29: Connected to nodes 12, 20, 26, and 28.

2. Triangles found:
   - <4, 8, 9>
   - <6, 15, 17>
   - <9, 10, 19>
   - <13, 18, 28>
   - <26, 28, 29>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
