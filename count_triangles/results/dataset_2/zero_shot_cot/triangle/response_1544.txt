Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 15 triangles in the given graph.

Unique triangles found in the graph are:
<5, 7, 8>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 4>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<1, 3, 4>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<0, 3, 6>
<2, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
