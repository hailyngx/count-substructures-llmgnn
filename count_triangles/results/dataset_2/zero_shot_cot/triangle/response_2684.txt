Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 15) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 13) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 15) (8, 0) (8, 15) (9, 14) (9, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (1, 18) (1, 6) (17, 3) (17, 12) (3, 19) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 14) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (13, 0) (13, 16) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 10) 

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the triangles in the graph:
   - Looking at the given edges, we can see that triangles are formed by three nodes connected together.

2. Count the total number of triangles:
   - By examining the given edges and nodes, we can count a total of 7 triangles in the graph.

3. List the unique triangles:
   - <2, 6, 1>
   - <2, 6, 15>
   - <1, 6, 18>
   - <7, 0, 8>
   - <12, 5, 17>
   - <15, 8, 18>
   - <14, 9, 10>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
