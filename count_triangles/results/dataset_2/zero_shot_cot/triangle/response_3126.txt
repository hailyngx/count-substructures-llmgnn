Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 16) (9, 6) (2, 0) (2, 11) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 13) (7, 16) (7, 8) (12, 5) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 11) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 17) (8, 7) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 5) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 13) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 10) (15, 19) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 15) (16, 6) (16, 7) (16, 4) (14, 8) (14, 5) (1, 8) (1, 13) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (17, 0) (17, 4) (13, 18) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 1)
