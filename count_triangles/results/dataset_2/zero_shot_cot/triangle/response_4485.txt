Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 11) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 14) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 18) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 13) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 8) (15, 1) (15, 17) (15, 16) (13, 11) (17, 15) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 16) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 12) (19, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (6, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 10) (10, 3) (10, 9) (16, 15) (16, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (12, 19) (12, 0) 

Response:
[<0, 2, 3> <0, 2, 9> <1, 8, 15> <2, 7, 11> <2, 7, 3> <2, 7, 0> <2, 9, 19> <3, 7, 11> <4, 9, 18> <8, 15, 16>]
