Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 26) (18, 22) (18, 16) (18, 6) (22, 18) (20, 17) (20, 13) (20, 6) (20, 10) (25, 7) (25, 28) (8, 4) (8, 5) (17, 20) (17, 15) (9, 21) (9, 14) (9, 27) (9, 19) (13, 20) (13, 23) (13, 6) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 23) (21, 9) (21, 3) (21, 2) (21, 29) (14, 9) (14, 26) (14, 6) (26, 7) (26, 14) (26, 5) (26, 29) (28, 25) (28, 3) (28, 0) (2, 21) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 26) (5, 0) (12, 24) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 29) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 23) (16, 7) (16, 18) (16, 1) (16, 23) (11, 7) (11, 27) (0, 4) (0, 28) (0, 5) (6, 18) (6, 20) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 27) (24, 12) (1, 19) (1, 16) (29, 21) (29, 26) (29, 15) (10, 20) (10, 23) (27, 9) (27, 11) (27, 6) (23, 13) (23, 3) (23, 19) (23, 16) (23, 10) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <4, 8, 5>, <4, 7, 25>, <4, 26, 5>, <7, 11, 27>, <7, 11, 26>, <7, 16, 18>, <7, 16, 23>, <7, 25, 28>, <7, 26, 14>, <9, 14, 26>, <9, 14, 6>, <9, 19, 1>, <9, 21, 29>, <13, 20, 6>, <15, 17, 20>, <15, 19, 23>.
