Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 13) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2)
