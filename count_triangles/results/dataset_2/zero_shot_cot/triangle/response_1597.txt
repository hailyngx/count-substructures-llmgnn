Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [2].

The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 3> and <6, 7, 8>.
