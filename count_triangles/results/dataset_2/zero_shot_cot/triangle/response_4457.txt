Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 2) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 13) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<4, 8, 1>
<4, 10, 0>
<5, 10, 1>
<6, 13, 3>

So, the total number of triangles is [4].
