Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 4) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 10) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 8) (2, 16) (2, 5) (2, 13) (18, 9) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 17) (12, 7) (0, 10) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 13) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 4) (9, 18) (9, 4) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 1) (4, 16) (4, 19) (4, 9) (4, 6) (13, 2) (13, 18) (13, 14) (6, 11) (6, 10) (6, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [4].

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 11, 17>
<4, 9, 19>
<6, 10, 11>
<7, 8, 14>
