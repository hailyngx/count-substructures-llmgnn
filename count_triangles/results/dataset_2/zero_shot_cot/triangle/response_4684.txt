Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 8) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 4) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 12) (27, 18) (27, 20) (27, 26) (2, 16) (2, 21) (29, 28) (29, 25) (29, 22) (18, 27) (18, 14) (22, 29) (22, 6) (22, 21) (10, 11) (10, 25) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 19) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (23, 8) (23, 24) (5, 24) (5, 21) (6, 22) (6, 17) (6, 26) (28, 29) (28, 9) (9, 28) (9, 14) (9, 20) (9, 7) (19, 8) (19, 12) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 9) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 12) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 0) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 3) (20, 27) (20, 9) (20, 3) (20, 26) (26, 27) (26, 6) (26, 20) (26, 12) (1, 13) (1, 25) (25, 29) (25, 10) (25, 1) (25, 0) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 25) (0, 24) (0, 4) (24, 23) (24, 5) (24, 0) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 0) (21, 2) (21, 22) (21, 5) (12, 15) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 26) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [26]. 
The unique triangles found in the graph are <4, 13, 0>, <6, 17, 3>, <7, 9, 20>, <9, 20, 3>, <9, 7, 20>, <12, 26, 20>, <12, 3, 20>, <15, 12, 3>, <22, 21, 5>, <22, 6, 21>, <22, 5, 21>, <25, 29, 1>, <25, 0, 29>, <25, 1, 29>, <26, 20, 12>, <26, 12, 20>, <26, 27, 20>, <26, 6, 20>, <26, 20, 27>, <27, 26, 20>, <28, 9, 20>, <28, 20, 9>, <29, 1, 25>, <29, 25, 1>, <29, 25, 0>, <29, 0, 25>.
