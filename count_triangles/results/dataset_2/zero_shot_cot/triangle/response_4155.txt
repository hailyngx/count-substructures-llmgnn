Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 16) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 14) (14, 7) (14, 17) (14, 3) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 0) (10, 17) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 8) (11, 15) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 16) (18, 0) (19, 11) (19, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (1, 9) (1, 19) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (15, 11) (15, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 16) (0, 4) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [8].

Unique triangles found in the graph are:
<2, 15, 16>
<3, 12, 13>
<3, 10, 12>
<4, 7, 14>
<4, 0, 6>
<10, 11, 15>
<11, 8, 12>
<16, 5, 18>
