Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles [] in the given graph is 5. 
The unique triangles found in the graph are <4, 5, 8>, <4, 0, 8>, <5, 1, 6>, <5, 2, 6>, <6, 7, 9>.
