Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 14) (1, 5) (1, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 6) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 10) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 4)
