Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 19) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 15) (8, 7) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 19) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 15) (15, 10) (15, 14) (15, 11) (15, 7) (12, 16) (12, 19) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 5) (1, 16) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 3) (19, 12) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 5) (5, 18) (5, 16) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. First, let's identify all triangles in the graph:

<0, 10, 14>
<2, 11, 3>
<2, 11, 13>
<2, 18, 5>
<3, 11, 13>
<3, 18, 5>
<4, 0, 14>
<5, 7, 13>
<5, 16, 18>
<5, 7, 15>
<7, 13, 16>
<7, 13, 5>
<10, 14, 15>

2. Now, let's count the total number of unique triangles:
[13] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 13.
