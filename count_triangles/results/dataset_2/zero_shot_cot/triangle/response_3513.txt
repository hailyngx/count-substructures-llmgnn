Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 14) (22, 8) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 17) (23, 10) (10, 23) (10, 17) (10, 21) (17, 23) (17, 10) (17, 4) (28, 29) (28, 24) (28, 18) (28, 5) (29, 28) (29, 1) (29, 27) (29, 0) (7, 6) (7, 26) (12, 24) (12, 8) (12, 9) (3, 14) (11, 23) (11, 19) (5, 28) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 20) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 4) (8, 22) (8, 12) (8, 18) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 13) (21, 26) (21, 4) (16, 21) (16, 13) (16, 9) (25, 27) (25, 14) (27, 29) (27, 25) (27, 6) (14, 22) (14, 3) (14, 25) (14, 26) (26, 7) (26, 21) (26, 14) (1, 29) (1, 13) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 20) (2, 0) (13, 21) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 24) (6, 7) (6, 27) (6, 15) (4, 23) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 21) (0, 29) (0, 1) (0, 2) (15, 6) (18, 28) (18, 5) (18, 8) (24, 28) (24, 12) (24, 13) (9, 12) (9, 16) (20, 5) (20, 2) 

Response:
[<5, 18, 28> <1, 13, 21> <4, 17, 23> <0, 1, 29> <0, 2, 5> <4, 19, 21> <6, 15, 27> <8, 12, 18> <22, 14, 25>]
