Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 12) (13, 24) (22, 28) (0, 27) (0, 25) (0, 18) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 7) (27, 19) (2, 19) (2, 20) (2, 14) (8, 25) (17, 29) (17, 9) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 21) (26, 25) (26, 6) (26, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (18, 0) (6, 26) (6, 21) (6, 20) (21, 13) (21, 29) (21, 6) (21, 16) (21, 23) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 16) (19, 27) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 5) (19, 7) (15, 25) (16, 21) (16, 5) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 10) (28, 22) (28, 24) (28, 23) (7, 27) (7, 19) (7, 11) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 9) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 12) (14, 2) (14, 12) (12, 13) (12, 26) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 20) (20, 2) (20, 6) (20, 12) (20, 24) (9, 17) (9, 11) (9, 23) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 23) (24, 13) (24, 27) (24, 28) (24, 20) (23, 21) (23, 28) (23, 9) (23, 10) (25, 0) (25, 8) (25, 26) (25, 15) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [52].
The unique triangles found are <2, 6, 21>, <2, 19, 29>, <2, 14, 12>, <6, 21, 16>, <6, 21, 23>, <12, 20, 24>, <12, 26, 25>, <13, 21, 29>, <13, 21, 6>, <13, 24, 27>, <16, 5, 11>, <19, 7, 11>, <19, 5, 16>, <19, 27, 7>, <20, 12, 14>, <21, 16, 5>, <21, 23, 28>, <25, 15, 8>, <27, 0, 25>, <27, 19, 29>, <27, 24, 13>, <29, 17, 9>, <10, 23, 9>, <10, 23, 28>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 11, 5>, <1, 11, 7>, <3, 12, 26>, <12, 14, 2>, and <20, 24, 28>.
