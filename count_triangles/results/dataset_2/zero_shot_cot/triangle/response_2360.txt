Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 21) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 2) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 29) (2, 3) (2, 29) (29, 15) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 1) (29, 25) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 9) (17, 26) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 19) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 28) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 25) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 18) (10, 11) (10, 9) (18, 3) (18, 7) (18, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 21) (5, 28) (6, 16) (6, 5) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 24) (26, 17) (26, 21) (28, 29) (28, 13) (28, 5) (12, 14) (12, 23) (21, 11) (21, 7) (21, 5) (21, 26) (21, 22) (20, 17) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 18) (27, 22) (25, 29) (25, 4) (25, 22) (19, 8) (19, 13) (24, 1) (22, 21) (22, 27) (22, 25) (22, 0) (0, 4) (0, 22) (0, 23) (23, 3) (23, 12) (23, 0) 

Response:
There are 22 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<1, 15, 29>
<1, 15, 3>
<1, 29, 15>
<1, 24, 29>
<1, 24, 15>
<1, 24, 29>
<1, 24, 15>
<1, 29, 24>
<2, 3, 29>
<2, 3, 15>
<2, 29, 3>
<3, 15, 29>
<3, 15, 1>
<3, 29, 15>
<4, 7, 21>
<4, 7, 18>
<4, 7, 3>
<4, 5, 28>
<4, 5, 21>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 21, 7>
<4, 21, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [22].
