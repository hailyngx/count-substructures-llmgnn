Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 16) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 19) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 18) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 19) (2, 11) (2, 4) (18, 17) (6, 10) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 16) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 19) (13, 17) (13, 15) (0, 17) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 12) (12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 8) (12, 19) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 8) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 15) (7, 15) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 6) (8, 12) (8, 15)
