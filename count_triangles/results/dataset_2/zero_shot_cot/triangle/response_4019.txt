Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 8) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 17) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 9) (14, 0) (1, 17) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 15) (17, 18) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 6) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 6) (10, 5) (10, 18) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 13) (3, 13) (8, 11) (8, 15) (2, 16) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 15) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 8) (15, 2) (6, 16) (6, 18) (6, 19)
