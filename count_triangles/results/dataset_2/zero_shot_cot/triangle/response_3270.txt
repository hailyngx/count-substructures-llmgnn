Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (17, 13) (17, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 2) (5, 13) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 12) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 3) (15, 9) (16, 12) (16, 6) (18, 14) (18, 19) (18, 6) (12, 13) (12, 16) (3, 17) (3, 9) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 11) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 1) (11, 6) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 6) (6, 16) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 2)
