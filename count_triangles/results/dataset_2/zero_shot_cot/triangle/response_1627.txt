Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 11) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 17) (9, 6) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 18) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 15) (11, 17) (7, 15) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 18) (0, 3) (0, 7) (19, 7) (19, 18) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 17) (18, 1) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 14) (17, 6) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 4) (14, 16) (4, 14) (16, 10) (16, 13) (16, 14) (2, 3) (2, 17)
