Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to check for every combination of three nodes if they form a triangle by having edges connecting all three nodes. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
1. <4, 8, 2>
2. <0, 7, 9>
3. <1, 5, 3>
4. <2, 5, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
