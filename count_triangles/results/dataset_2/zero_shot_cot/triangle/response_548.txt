Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [28]. 
The unique triangles found are: <4, 5, 7>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 2, 8>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 3, 6>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 6, 1>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 1, 4>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 3, 2>, <6, 3, 5>, <9, 0, 2>, <9, 2, 3>, <9, 0, 4>, <9, 8, 2>, <9, 8, 7>.
