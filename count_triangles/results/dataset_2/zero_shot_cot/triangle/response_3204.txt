Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (5, 6) (5, 3) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 4) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) 

Response:
Total number of triangles: [12]
Unique triangles found: <1, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 11>, <1, 6, 14>, <1, 9, 11>, <1, 9, 6>, <1, 9, 11>, <1, 9, 14>, <1, 11, 6>, <1, 11, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 9, 6>, <3, 9, 13>
