Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Since we are provided with the list of edges, let's construct the adjacency list for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 5, 7}

2. Now, we'll check each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle:
- <0, 1, 2> forms a triangle.
- <0, 2, 8> forms a triangle.
- <0, 2, 9> forms a triangle.
- <0, 8, 9> forms a triangle.
- <1, 2, 6> forms a triangle.
- <1, 2, 9> forms a triangle.
- <1, 6, 9> forms a triangle.
- <2, 5, 8> forms a triangle.
- <2, 6, 8> forms a triangle.
- <2, 8, 9> forms a triangle.
- <5, 6, 7> forms a triangle.
- <5, 6, 8> forms a triangle.
- <5, 6, 9> forms a triangle.
- <6, 7, 9> forms a triangle.
- <8, 5, 9> forms a triangle.

3. Counting the total number of unique triangles found, we have:
[15]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<8, 5, 9>
