Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 23) (21, 24) (21, 13) (21, 29) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 23) (6, 26) (9, 22) (9, 12) (14, 6) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 2) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 12) (13, 21) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 0) (2, 17) (2, 16) (18, 10) (18, 29) (7, 23) (7, 27) (12, 9) (12, 8) (24, 21) (24, 11) (24, 27) (22, 9) (22, 26) (22, 5) (26, 6) (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 15) (5, 13) (5, 22) (5, 10) (5, 20) (28, 1) (28, 26) (3, 0) (3, 19) (11, 14) (11, 24) (4, 13) (4, 27) (27, 7) (27, 24) (27, 4) (27, 16) (25, 17) (25, 29) (23, 1) (23, 6) (23, 7) (0, 13) (0, 3) (15, 26) (15, 19) (15, 29) (19, 14) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 16) (20, 5) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 5) (29, 21) (29, 8) (29, 18) (29, 25) (29, 15) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 27) (16, 19)
