Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are: <2, 8, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 5>.
