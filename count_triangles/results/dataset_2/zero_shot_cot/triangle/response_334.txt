Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (4, 1) (4, 13) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 7) (2, 10) (2, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [9]. 
The unique triangles found are <5, 9, 12>, <6, 7, 3>, <10, 11, 13>, <1, 4, 13>, <0, 7, 14>, <0, 13, 7>, <0, 14, 10>, <1, 8, 13>, <11, 7, 3>.
