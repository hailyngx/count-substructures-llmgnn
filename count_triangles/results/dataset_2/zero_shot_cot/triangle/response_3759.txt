Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 13) (15, 16) (15, 3) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 11) (2, 10) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 3) (13, 7) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 1) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 17) (1, 18) (1, 9) (1, 7) (6, 16) (6, 14) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 19) (14, 6) (14, 10) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (9, 1) (9, 4) (12, 18) (12, 10) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 12) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 1) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph step by step.

1. Find all triangles formed by three nodes connected by edges:
- Triangle 1: (11, 16, 8)
- Triangle 2: (11, 16, 6)
- Triangle 3: (11, 19, 18)
- Triangle 4: (11, 19, 17)
- Triangle 5: (11, 2, 10)
- Triangle 6: (11, 18, 1)
- Triangle 7: (11, 18, 17)
- Triangle 8: (16, 8, 7)
- Triangle 9: (16, 15, 3)
- Triangle 10: (16, 6, 14)
- Triangle 11: (19, 18, 17)
- Triangle 12: (18, 17, 19)

2. Counting the number of unique triangles from the list above:
- <11, 16, 8>
- <11, 16, 6>
- <11, 19, 18>
- <11, 19, 17>
- <11, 2, 10>
- <11, 18, 1>
- <11, 18, 17>
- <16, 8, 7>
- <16, 15, 3>
- <16, 6, 14>
- <19, 18, 17>

[There are 11 unique triangles in total.]
