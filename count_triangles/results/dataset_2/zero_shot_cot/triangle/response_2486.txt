Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 14) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 7) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 12) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 14) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 5) 

Response:
Triangles in the graph are formed by three nodes connected by edges. To find the total number of triangles, let's identify the triangles one by one.

There are multiple triangles in this graph, and listing all of them individually would be a long process. Instead, we can start by identifying the unique triangles and then count them.

Let's list the unique triangles first:

1. <0, 6, 10>
2. <2, 3, 13>
3. <2, 5, 13>
4. <2, 11, 13>
5. <2, 5, 10>
6. <4, 1, 12>
7. <6, 9, 12>
8. <8, 7, 14>
9. <8, 11, 14>
10. <8, 13, 14>
11. <9, 3, 7>
12. <9, 7, 14>
13. <9, 12, 14>
14. <11, 10, 14>

Since there are 14 unique triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is 14. Therefore, the answer is:
[14]
