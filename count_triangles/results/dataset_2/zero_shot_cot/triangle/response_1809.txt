Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [6].

Unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<1, 3, 6>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 7, 8>
