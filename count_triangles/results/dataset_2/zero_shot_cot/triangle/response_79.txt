Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (3, 5) (3, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is as follows: [6]
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <1, 5, 9>, <6, 10, 14>, <1, 6, 9>, <0, 10, 14>, <4, 6, 12>, <2, 11, 14>.
