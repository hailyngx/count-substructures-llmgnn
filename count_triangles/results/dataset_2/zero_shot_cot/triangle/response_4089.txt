Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node.
- Node 0: 4 edges
- Node 1: 5 edges
- Node 2: 4 edges
- Node 3: 5 edges
- Node 4: 3 edges
- Node 5: 4 edges
- Node 6: 4 edges
- Node 7: 6 edges
- Node 8: 2 edges
- Node 9: 5 edges

Step 2: Count the number of triangles formed by each unique set of three connected nodes.
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <3, 7, 9>

Step 3: Calculate the total number of triangles.
