Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 5) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 8) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 4) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 1) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 12) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 13) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 9) (6, 8) (6, 13) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 16) (5, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (14, 2) (4, 17) (4, 19) (9, 16) (9, 2) (9, 1) (12, 11) (12, 15) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 0) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 6)
