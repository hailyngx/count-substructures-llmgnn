Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 10) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 6)
