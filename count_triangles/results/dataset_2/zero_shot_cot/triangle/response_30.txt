Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 16) (7, 13) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 9) (15, 1) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 9) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 8) (16, 6) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 4) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 18) (19, 3) (19, 12) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 17) (9, 18) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 1) (8, 17) (8, 14) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (4, 16) (4, 3) (2, 6) (2, 16) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 14) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 4) (3, 10) (10, 3)
