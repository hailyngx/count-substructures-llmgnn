Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 22) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 22) (21, 17) (2, 4) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 25) (29, 6) (10, 21) (10, 15) (11, 8) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 28) (0, 9) (20, 2) (20, 0) (20, 13) (20, 4) (20, 5) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 3) (4, 2) (4, 20) (4, 28) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 17) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 22) (19, 24) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 28) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 23) (15, 1) (15, 2) (15, 10) (16, 0) (16, 14) (16, 6) (22, 1) (22, 21) (22, 19) (22, 3) (23, 26) (23, 12) (23, 9) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 23) (8, 11) (8, 5) (28, 0) (28, 4) (28, 7) (5, 20) (5, 8) (5, 3) (6, 29) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 16) (14, 6) (14, 25) (24, 19) (24, 7) (25, 2) (25, 14) (17, 21) (17, 18) (17, 12) (13, 20) (13, 6) (13, 3) (3, 26) (3, 22) (3, 5) (3, 13) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found: 
<0, 20, 2>
<0, 7, 28>
<2, 4, 20>
<6, 14, 16>
<12, 17, 7>
<19, 22, 26>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
