Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 3) (8, 12) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 14) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 0)
