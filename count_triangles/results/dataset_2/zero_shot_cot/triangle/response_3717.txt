Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 9) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 14) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 14) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of 16 triangles in this graph. They are:

[<0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 13>, <1, 4, 13>, <1, 4, 14>, <1, 7, 14>, <1, 7, 13>, <3, 8, 12>, <3, 8, 11>, <3, 11, 12>, <7, 13, 14>, <9, 11, 12>, <9, 12, 14>, <11, 12, 14>]
