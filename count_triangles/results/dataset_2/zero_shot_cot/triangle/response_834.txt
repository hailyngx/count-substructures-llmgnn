Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6)
