Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 12) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 13) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 4) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 4) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 3) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 4) (16, 14) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 4) (9, 10) (18, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 18) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 19) (4, 16) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 3) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) (3, 8) (3, 16) (3, 12) 

Response:
