Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 27) (11, 5) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 18) (1, 21) (1, 20) (1, 27) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 13) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 20) (2, 14) (29, 16) (29, 2) (29, 20) (7, 12) (7, 10) (3, 23) (3, 4) (26, 19) (26, 13) (12, 7) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 17) (8, 2) (8, 28) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 21) (13, 26) (13, 18) (28, 16) (28, 8) (28, 14) (28, 25) (10, 21) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 23) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 22) (20, 1) (20, 2) (20, 29) (4, 3) (4, 0) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 13) (22, 15) (22, 6) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 27) (25, 28) (25, 6) (9, 8) (9, 23) (6, 22) (6, 25) (6, 24) (24, 6) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 23) (5, 27) (23, 3) (23, 10) (23, 9) (23, 5) (0, 8) (0, 15) (0, 4) (27, 11) (27, 1) (27, 10) (27, 17) (27, 5) (14, 2) (14, 28) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph.

Since the graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges, we know it is a simple undirected graph.

To find the total number of triangles, we need to check each unique set of three nodes that form a triangle.

Now, let's list down the triangles present in the graph:

<1, 20, 29>
<1, 20, 2>
<1, 21, 13>
<2, 8, 28>
<2, 8, 29>
<2, 14, 28>
<2, 14, 20>
<3, 23, 5>
<3, 23, 9>
<3, 4, 0>
<4, 0, 8>
<5, 17, 27>
<5, 11, 27>
<5, 23, 27>
<5, 23, 17>
<6, 22, 25>
<6, 22, 15>
<7, 10, 21>
<7, 10, 15>
<8, 9, 23>
<8, 9, 0>
<10, 15, 21>
<10, 15, 27>
<10, 23, 9>
<11, 16, 27>
<13, 18, 21>
<13, 18, 26>
<14, 20, 29>
<16, 18, 19>
<16, 18, 29>
<18, 19, 26>
<22, 15, 6>
<23, 5, 27>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [32].
