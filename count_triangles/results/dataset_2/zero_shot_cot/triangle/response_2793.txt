Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 14) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 10) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 10) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 14) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0)
