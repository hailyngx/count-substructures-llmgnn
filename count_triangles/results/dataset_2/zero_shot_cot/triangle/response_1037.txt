Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 7) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 13) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 11>
<4, 13, 14>

So, the total number of triangles is [4].
