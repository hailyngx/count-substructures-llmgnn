Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 7) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 6) (29, 0) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 9) (20, 24) (20, 6) (25, 20) (25, 17) (25, 28) (0, 29) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 19) (4, 23) (4, 1) (8, 28) (8, 19) (8, 21) (3, 21) (3, 26) (11, 13) (11, 15) (6, 29) (6, 20) (6, 21) (6, 26) (21, 8) (21, 3) (21, 6) (21, 12) (5, 23) (5, 12) (5, 24) (19, 0) (19, 8) (19, 15) (10, 15) (10, 22) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 10) (15, 18) (16, 17) (16, 9) (28, 25) (28, 8) (28, 26) (22, 2) (22, 0) (22, 10) (22, 17) (14, 26) (14, 13) (26, 3) (26, 6) (26, 28) (26, 14) (17, 25) (17, 16) (17, 22) (7, 2) (7, 29) (7, 18) (7, 1) (23, 4) (23, 5) (23, 9) (12, 21) (12, 5) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 18) (24, 20) (24, 5) (27, 9) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 13) (9, 20) (9, 16) (9, 23) (9, 27) (1, 4) (1, 7)
