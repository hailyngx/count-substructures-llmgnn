Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 triangles in this graph. Here they are:

[<0, 1, 2> <1, 3, 6> <3, 6, 7> <3, 5, 6>]
