Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 18) (17, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 12) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 14) (18, 17) (18, 0) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (0, 18) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 12) (16, 13) (16, 19) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 14) (5, 2) (5, 12) (1, 7) (1, 19) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 15) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 19) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (15, 2) (15, 9) (15, 11) (15, 13) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 5) (13, 9) (13, 16) (13, 15) (19, 16) (19, 1) (19, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<0, 9, 11>
<0, 9, 15>
<0, 11, 15>
<9, 13, 16>
<10, 3, 14>
<14, 7, 9>
