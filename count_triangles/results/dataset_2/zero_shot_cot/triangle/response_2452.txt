Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
[<1, 5, 9> <1, 5, 2> <1, 3, 4> <1, 3, 7> <1, 0, 8> <4, 5, 7>]
