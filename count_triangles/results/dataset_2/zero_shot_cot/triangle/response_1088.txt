Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 13) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 1) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 11) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in this graph. 

Unique triangles:
<0, 10, 14>
<1, 7, 11>
<1, 2, 13>
<2, 3, 13>
<2, 4, 14>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 14, 2>
<5, 10, 13>
<7, 11, 13>
<9, 10, 11>

Total number of triangles is [10].
