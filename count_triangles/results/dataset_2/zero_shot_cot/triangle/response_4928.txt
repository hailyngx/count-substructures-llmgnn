Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 3) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 9) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 15) (7, 8) (7, 18) (7, 16) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 19) (2, 6) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 19) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 1) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 5) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 11) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 17) (3, 18) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 3) (15, 16) (15, 12) (15, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 15) (17, 0) (17, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 5, 7, and 1. However, only node 5 is connected to both nodes 1 and 13, forming a triangle <1, 5, 8>.
2. Node 13 is connected to nodes 10 and 8. Node 10 is also connected to node 18, but there are no more connections that form a triangle.
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 11, 6, and 6 again. Although node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 2, there are no triangles formed.
4. Node 18 is connected to nodes 10 and 7. Node 10 is connected to node 13 but does not form a triangle.
5. Node 0 is connected to nodes 16, 17, and 9. Node 16 is connected to nodes 7 and 3 but does not form a triangle.
6. Node 16 is connected to nodes 7 and 3. Node 7 is connected to node 8 but does not form a triangle.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 8 and 18, but there are no triangles formed.
8. Node 10 is connected to nodes 13, 18, and 19. However, there are no triangles formed.
9. Node 2 is only connected to node 6, and no triangle is formed.
10. Node 12 is connected to nodes 14 and 15, but no triangle is formed.
11. Node 1 is connected to nodes 8, 6, 14, and 5. Nodes 14 and 5 are not connected to each other, so no triangle is formed here.
12. Node 6 (listed previously).
13. Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 19, and 5. No triangle is formed.
14. Node 19 is connected to nodes 10, 12, and 11; however, there are no triangles formed.
15. Node 5 (listed previously).
16. Node 3 is connected to nodes 18, 16, 14, and 9. Nodes 14 and 9 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
17. Node 14 (listed previously).
18. Node 15 is connected to nodes 16, 12, and 9. No triangle is formed.
19. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 15. No triangle is formed.
20. Node 17 is only connected to node 5, and no triangle is formed.

Since we have identified all the triangles in the graph, let's count the total number of triangles and list them:

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <1, 5, 8>
