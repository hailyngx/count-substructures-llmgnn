Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 19) (6, 16) (6, 8) (10, 11) (2, 5) (2, 8) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 13) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 17) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 18) (13, 7) (15, 8) (15, 7) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 19) (7, 13) (7, 15) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 3) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 14) (3, 0) (3, 12) (19, 9) (19, 0) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 0) (17, 12)
