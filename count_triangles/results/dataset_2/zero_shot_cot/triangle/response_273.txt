Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].

The unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 7>.
