Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 0) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 3) (10, 13) (10, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<5, 9, 3>
<5, 9, 13>
<5, 9, 7>
<5, 8, 13>
<8, 13, 14>
<4, 6, 0>
<9, 1, 8>
<9, 1, 11>
