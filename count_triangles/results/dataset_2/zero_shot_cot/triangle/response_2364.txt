Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
[<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 9>]
