Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 8) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 5) (17, 15) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 6) (0, 11) (0, 3) (1, 15) (1, 19) (1, 9) (5, 16) (5, 4) (5, 17) (19, 7) (19, 1) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 9) (2, 12) (3, 16) (3, 4) (3, 0) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 18) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 10) (18, 11) (18, 12) (18, 10) (18, 13) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 9) (13, 18) (8, 11) 

Response:
[<0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 11, 18>, <1, 9, 15>, <4, 6, 10>, <4, 7, 12>, <5, 16, 17>, <7, 12, 18>, <9, 13, 14>]
