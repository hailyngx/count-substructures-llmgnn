Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 14) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 17) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 4) (6, 11) (6, 17) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 14) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 19) (15, 19) (15, 17) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 3) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 18) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 15) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 16) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 18) (16, 4) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 16) (18, 8) (18, 3) (18, 16)
