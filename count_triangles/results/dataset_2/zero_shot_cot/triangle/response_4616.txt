Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 0) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 11) 

Response:
There are a total of 12 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 9, 13>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 11>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 14>
<1, 7, 10>
<2, 9, 11>
<3, 6, 13>
<4, 10, 14>
<8, 10, 13>
<8, 10, 0>
<12, 13, 14> 

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [12].
