Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 29) (13, 7) (13, 18) (22, 5) (22, 6) (22, 1) (2, 26) (2, 15) (29, 13) (29, 17) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 24) (14, 20) (17, 29) (17, 14) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 5) (26, 2) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 3) (26, 8) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 1) (16, 4) (16, 9) (16, 19) (18, 13) (18, 26) (18, 3) (15, 2) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 25) (7, 13) (25, 15) (25, 23) (25, 4) (6, 22) (6, 14) (6, 24) (24, 14) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 21) (11, 14) (11, 20) (1, 22) (1, 28) (1, 12) (3, 26) (3, 18) (3, 27) (5, 22) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 21) (8, 10) (8, 26) (8, 5) (12, 1) (12, 21) (12, 19) (12, 23) (20, 14) (20, 11) (20, 27) (0, 19) (21, 24) (21, 5) (21, 12) (9, 28) (9, 16) (9, 15) (9, 19) (27, 24) (27, 3) (27, 20) (23, 25) (23, 12) (4, 16) (4, 25) (19, 16) (19, 12) (19, 0) (19, 9) 

Response:
There are [<0, 16, 19>, <1, 10, 22>, <1, 28, 26>, <3, 18, 26>, <3, 18, 27>, <4, 16, 25>, <5, 10, 21>, <5, 21, 22>, <5, 8, 21>, <6, 14, 24>, <9, 15, 28>, <9, 15, 19>, <9, 16, 19>, <12, 19, 23>, <12, 19, 21>, <14, 17, 29>, <14, 17, 20>, <17, 29, 14>, <18, 13, 26>, <20, 14, 11>, <24, 6, 14>, <24, 6, 27>] unique triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [22].
