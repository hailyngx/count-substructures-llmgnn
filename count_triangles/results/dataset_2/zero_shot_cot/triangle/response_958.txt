Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
[<0, 1, 5>, <1, 2, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <6, 9, 1>]
