Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 9) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 12) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 5) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (3, 0) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 0) (10, 13) (10, 7) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 14)
