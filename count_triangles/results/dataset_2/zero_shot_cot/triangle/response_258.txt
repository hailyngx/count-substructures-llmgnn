Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 15 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are as follows:
<6, 9, 8>
<6, 9, 0>
<6, 3, 9>
<6, 3, 5>
<6, 8, 0>
<6, 5, 3>
<6, 5, 4>
<6, 5, 2>
<6, 0, 9>
<6, 0, 8>
<9, 3, 5>
<3, 5, 4>
<8, 5, 4>
<8, 5, 2>
<0, 9, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
