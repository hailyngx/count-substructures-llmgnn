Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph using an adjacency matrix:

```
    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
0   0  0  0  0  0  1  0  1  1  1
1   0  0  1  0  1  0  0  0  1  1
2   0  1  0  1  0  0  0  1  1  0
3   0  0  1  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
4   0  1  0  0  0  0  1  1  0  0
5   1  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  1
6   0  0  0  1  1  1  0  1  1  1
7   1  0  1  0  1  0  1  0  1  0
8   1  1  1  0  0  0  1  1  0  0
9   1  1  0  0  0  1  1  0  0
