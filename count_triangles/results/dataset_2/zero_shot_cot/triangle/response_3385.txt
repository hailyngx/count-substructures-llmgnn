Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 1) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 2) (3, 25) (3, 27) (25, 13) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 9) (23, 22) (23, 29) (23, 19) (2, 22) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 20) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 24) (8, 2) (8, 28) (8, 20) (19, 23) (19, 29) (19, 14) (19, 27) (26, 20) (26, 6) (9, 22) (9, 25) (9, 20) (11, 28) (11, 29) (28, 8) (28, 11) (28, 17) (28, 12) (28, 27) (6, 26) (6, 21) (6, 4) (21, 6) (21, 5) (7, 25) (10, 12) (10, 20) (15, 17) (4, 6) (4, 27) (4, 1) (27, 3) (27, 19) (27, 28) (27, 4) (27, 16) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 24) (12, 28) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 0) (16, 27) (16, 24) (17, 28) (17, 15) (17, 12) (24, 18) (24, 1) (24, 16) (14, 19) (14, 5) (20, 2) (20, 8) (20, 26) (20, 9) (20, 10) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 5) (29, 23) (29, 19) (29, 11) (5, 21) (5, 14) (5, 0) 

Response:
[<1, 4, 27>, <2, 8, 20>, <2, 9, 22>, <2, 20, 26>, <2, 20, 9>, <2, 22, 9>, <4, 6, 27>, <5, 14, 19>, <5, 21, 6>, <5, 21, 14>]
[<0, 12, 17>]
[<19, 23, 29>]
[<8, 11, 28>]
[<12, 17, 28>]

The total number of triangles is [14].
