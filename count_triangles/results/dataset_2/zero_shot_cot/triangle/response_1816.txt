Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 7) (9, 0) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 7) (18, 15) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 16) (14, 11) (14, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 19) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 11) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 18) (15, 10) (15, 4) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (8, 19) (8, 6) (8, 7) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 6) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 4) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 11) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 6) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 12) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 3) (12, 13) (12, 3)
