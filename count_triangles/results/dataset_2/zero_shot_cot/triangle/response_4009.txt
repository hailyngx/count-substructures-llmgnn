Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 11) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 3) (9, 16) (9, 13) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 10) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 8) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 11) (0, 8) (0, 16) (16, 9) (16, 0) (16, 2) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 4) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 10) (11, 15) (11, 4) (11, 19) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 18) (18, 1) (18, 10) (18, 17) (17, 5) (17, 18)
