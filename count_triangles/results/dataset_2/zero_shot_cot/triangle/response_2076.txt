Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
I will now count the number of triangles in the given graph.

[6] total number of triangles

Unique triangles:
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 8, 5>
<1, 9, 0>
<3, 2, 6>
<4, 8, 9>
<0, 2, 5>
