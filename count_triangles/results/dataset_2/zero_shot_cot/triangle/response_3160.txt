Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 5) (8, 13) (8, 19) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 7) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 4) (15, 0) (15, 1) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 4) (19, 16) (19, 8) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 3) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 17) (4, 10) (5, 16) (5, 18) (5, 17) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 14)
