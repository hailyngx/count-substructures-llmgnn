Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 18) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 13) (13, 2) (13, 15) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 4) (4, 10) (4, 17) (12, 5) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 14) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 3) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 6) (19, 3) (0, 5) (0, 15) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 0) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 8) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 0) 

Response:
There are 16 triangles in the given graph and they are as follows:
<0, 5, 15>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 15, 18>
<3, 14, 17>
<3, 14, 4>
<3, 0, 6>
<4, 10, 17>
<6, 0, 2>
<6, 0, 18>
<7, 14, 16>
<8, 2, 1>
<8, 2, 9>
<8, 2, 13>
<9, 2, 8>
<9, 5, 12>
<10, 7, 14>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
