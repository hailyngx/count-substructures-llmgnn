Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 20) (1, 23) (1, 12) (1, 6) (21, 9) (21, 18) (21, 25) (4, 22) (7, 29) (7, 14) (7, 27) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 23) (15, 3) (15, 23) (15, 9) (15, 28) (20, 22) (20, 6) (20, 28) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 8) (29, 7) (19, 22) (19, 17) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 2) (26, 27) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 28) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 27) (2, 26) (2, 8) (2, 10) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (11, 14) (11, 5) (9, 21) (9, 15) (9, 8) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 24) (25, 21) (25, 6) (25, 18) (27, 7) (27, 26) (27, 14) (24, 16) (24, 5) (23, 1) (23, 3) (23, 15) (5, 11) (5, 24) (28, 15) (28, 20) (28, 0) (18, 21) (18, 25) (18, 6) (12, 13) (12, 1) (6, 1) (6, 20) (6, 25) (6, 18) (6, 10) (10, 2) (10, 6) 

Response:
