Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 12) (15, 10) (15, 9) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 4) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 12) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 19) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 4) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 13) (16, 3) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 0) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 9) (12, 3) (12, 18) (7, 3) (7, 18) (7, 8) (5, 2) (5, 18) (6, 8) (6, 13) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 0) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) (1, 0)
