Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 4) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 5) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 7) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 10) 

Response:
