Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 9) (3, 11) (3, 2) (15, 16) (15, 0) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (18, 19) (18, 12) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 5) (0, 15) (0, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 6) (1, 17) (1, 7) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 9) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 4) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 10) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 9) (9, 16) (9, 19) (9, 10) 

Response:
There are two steps to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

Step 1: Identify all the triangles in the graph based on the given edges.
Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles.

Step 1 - Triangles in the graph:
<11, 16, 15>
<11, 16, 7>
<11, 16, 9>
<11, 3, 2>
<11, 14, 17>
<11, 14, 12>
<11, 19, 18>
<16, 15, 0>
<16, 15, 7>
<16, 15, 9>
<16, 7, 8>
<16, 9, 19>
<3, 2, 4>
<14, 17, 1>
<18, 12, 7>
<18, 19, 10>
<7, 5, 0>
<7, 5, 12>
<7, 12, 18>
<5, 0, 15>
<5, 0, 13>
<5, 12, 18>
<13, 6, 4>
<1, 17, 14>
<19, 10, 8>
<19, 10, 6>
<10, 4, 2>
<10, 4, 6>
<10, 4, 9>

Step 2 - Counting unique triangles:
Total number of triangles: [28]
Unique triangles:
<11, 16, 15>
<11, 16, 7>
<11, 16, 9>
<11, 3, 2>
<11, 14, 17>
<11, 14, 12>
<11, 19, 18>
<16, 15, 0>
<16, 15, 7>
<16, 15, 9>
<16, 7, 8>
<16, 9, 19>
<3, 2, 4>
<14, 17, 1>
<18, 12, 7>
<18, 19, 10>
<7, 5, 0>
<7, 5, 12>
<7, 12, 18>
<5, 0, 15>
<5, 0, 13>
<13, 6, 4>
<19, 10, 8>
<19, 10, 6>
<10, 4, 2>
<10, 4, 6>
