Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 13) (14, 7) (14, 15) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 8) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 7) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 17) (8, 9) (8, 18) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 12) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 12) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 19) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 7) (0, 17) (0, 3) (0, 18) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 4) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 9) (18, 0) (19, 15) (19, 1) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 19) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 9)
