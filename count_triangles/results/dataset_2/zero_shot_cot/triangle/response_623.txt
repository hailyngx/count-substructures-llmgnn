Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 18) (16, 19) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 14) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 6) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 18) (17, 0) (17, 9) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 14) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 15) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 6) (0, 2) (0, 17) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 12) (9, 15) (9, 17) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 19)
