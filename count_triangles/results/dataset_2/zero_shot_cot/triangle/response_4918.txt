Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 1) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 10) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 11) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 10) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 3) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles found are <2, 7, 9>, <2, 12, 13>, <2, 3, 14>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 10, 12>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 11, 14>, <8, 13, 9>.
