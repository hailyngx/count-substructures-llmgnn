Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are 20 unique triangles in the given graph. The total number of triangles is [20].
The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 9>.
