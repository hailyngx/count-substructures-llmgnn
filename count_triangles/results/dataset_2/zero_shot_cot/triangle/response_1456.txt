Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 3) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 9) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 13) (4, 13) (4, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].

The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<1, 10, 11>
<1, 12, 13>
<1, 13, 14>
<2, 9, 12>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 9, 14>
<9, 12, 14>
