Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 4) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 9) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 19) (3, 11) (3, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 17) (5, 19) (5, 17) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 13) (1, 18) (1, 7) (1, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 15) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 16) (15, 6) (15, 13) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 15) (16, 18) (16, 9) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 17) (12, 18) (17, 7) (17, 5) (17, 4)
