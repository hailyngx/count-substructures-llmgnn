Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0)
