The edges are as follows: (15, 18) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 14) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 29) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 7) (3, 25) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 16) (12, 27) (12, 16) (12, 21) (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 19) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 4) (26, 17) (4, 27) (4, 26) (16, 25) (16, 12) (16, 28) (28, 16) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 1) (14, 27) (14, 24) (6, 24) (6, 22) (24, 14) (24, 6) (24, 17) (24, 1) (24, 2) (8, 5) (8, 28) (8, 0) (8, 22) (19, 13) (19, 23) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 21) (10, 26) (10, 1) (10, 23) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 24) (2, 7) (0, 28) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 1) (20, 9) (20, 18) (20, 22) (21, 12) (21, 11) (21, 23) (29, 5) (23, 19) (23, 10) (23, 21) (23, 17) (17, 26) (17, 24) (17, 23) (1, 28) (1, 24) (1, 10) (1, 0) (22, 6) (22, 8) (22, 20) (18, 15) (18, 20) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Look for nodes that have at least two edges connecting them to other nodes. These nodes are potential candidates for forming triangles.
2. For each pair of nodes connected by an edge, check if there is a third node that is connected to both nodes. If such a third node exists, a triangle is formed.
3. Count all the unique triangles formed in the graph.

Let's go through the calculation step by step:

1. Identify the potential triangles formed in the graph:
- (2, 3, 5)
- (0, 1, 8)
- (0, 1, 11)
- (0, 1, 24)
- (0, 8, 28)
- (0, 11, 21)
- (0, 11, 24)
- (1, 10, 24)
- (1, 10, 23)
- (1, 24, 2)
- (2, 3, 24)
- (2, 5, 7)
- (2, 7, 9)
- (2, 24, 7)
- (3, 16, 25)
- (4, 26, 17)
- (5, 2, 7)
- (5, 2, 8)
- (5, 2, 9)
- (5, 2, 24)
- (5, 7, 9)
- (6, 22, 24)
- (7, 9, 11)
- (8, 0, 28)
- (10, 1, 24)
- (10, 1, 23)
- (10, 23, 17)
- (12, 16, 27)
- (12, 16, 25)
- (13, 19, 23)
- (14, 24, 27)
- (16, 12, 25)
- (16, 12, 27)
- (16, 25, 28)
- (17, 23, 26)
- (17, 23, 24)
- (19, 13, 23)
- (20, 9, 22)
- (21, 11, 23)

2. Count the total number of unique triangles:
[34]

3. List the unique triangles found:
<2, 3, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 11>, <0, 1, 24>, <0, 8, 28>, <0, 11, 21>, <0, 11, 24>, <1, 10, 24>, <1, 10, 23>, <1, 24, 2>, <2, 3, 24>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 16, 25>, <4, 26, 17>, <5, 2, 7>, <5, 2, 8>, <5, 2, 9>, <5, 2, 24>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 22, 24>, <7, 9, 11>, <8, 0, 28>, <10, 1, 24>, <10, 1, 23>, <10, 23, 17>, <12, 16, 27>, <12, 16, 25>, <13, 19, 23>, <14, 24, 27>, <16, 12, 25>, <16, 12, 27>, <16, 25, 28>, <17, 23, 26>, <17, 23, 24>, <19, 13, 23>, <20, 9, 22>, <21, 11, 23>
