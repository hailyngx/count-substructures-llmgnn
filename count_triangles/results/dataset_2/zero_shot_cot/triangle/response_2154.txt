Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 11) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 9) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 10) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 12)
