Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 18) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 19) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 17) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 19) (17, 2) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 6) (8, 3) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 19) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 13) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 13) (14, 12) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [50]. 
The unique triangles found are <5, 13, 17>, <9, 13, 17>, <9, 5, 13>, <5, 0, 19>, <9, 0, 19>, <17, 1, 10>, <7, 11, 4>, <15, 1, 10>, <15, 6, 12>, <3, 8, 10>, <3, 9, 10>, <11, 7, 4>, <16, 17, 18>, <16, 11, 7>.
