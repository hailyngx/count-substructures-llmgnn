Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 0) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 6) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [8].
The unique triangles found are: 
<5, 4, 1>
<5, 10, 14>
<5, 14, 4>
<9, 8, 13>
<9, 12, 4>
<4, 7, 14>
<1, 11, 0>
<10, 0, 6>
