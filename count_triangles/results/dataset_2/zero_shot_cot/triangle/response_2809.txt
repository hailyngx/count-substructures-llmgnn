Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 13) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 14) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 7) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 18) (7, 0) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 1) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 16) (15, 17) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 15) (16, 1) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (10, 6) (10, 3) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 3) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 1) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 3) (1, 19) (1, 16) (1, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 4) (11, 5) (11, 18) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can use the fact that a triangle is formed whenever three nodes are connected to each other.

The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 12>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 7, 18>
<1, 14, 19>
<1, 14, 16>
<1, 16, 19>
<2, 9, 12>
<4, 17, 19>
<4, 17, 3>
<4, 19, 1>
<6, 10, 3>
<6, 10, 14>
<6, 14, 1>
<8, 12, 2>
<8, 12, 15>
<8, 12, 19>
<9, 13, 14>
<9, 13, 17>
<9, 13, 16>
<9, 14, 16>
<15, 16, 17>
<15, 16, 18>
<15, 17, 4>
<15, 18, 16>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [24].
