Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 4) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 15) (14, 17) (14, 7) (17, 11) (17, 14) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (18, 5) (18, 2) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 6) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 1) (19, 2) (19, 10) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 12) (10, 5) (10, 19) (10, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 8) (15, 11) (15, 9) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 10)
