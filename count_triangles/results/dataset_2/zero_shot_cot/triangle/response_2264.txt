Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) 

Response:
[count of triangles: 6]
<5, 4, 8>
<5, 4, 0>
<4, 1, 8>
<4, 1, 6>
<7, 4, 8>
<8, 6, 3>
