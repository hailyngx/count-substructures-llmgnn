Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are 20 triangles in this graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found: 
<0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 9, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <6, 5, 9>, <6, 5, 1>, <6, 9, 7>, <7, 9, 5>, <7, 9, 4>, <8, 5, 2>, <8, 5, 4>, <0, 5, 1> 
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [20].
