Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 8) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [10].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<6, 9, 13>
<6, 3, 0>
<6, 1, 10>
<6, 0, 11>
<9, 10, 13>
<9, 13, 3>
<10, 1, 8>
<8, 4, 5>
<4, 11, 0>
<7, 2, 5>
