Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 26) (3, 18) (15, 10) (15, 22) (15, 28) (15, 2) (1, 21) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 9) (21, 29) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 26) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 16) (25, 27) (25, 6) (6, 25) (6, 9) (6, 14) (9, 21) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 24) (28, 15) (28, 11) (28, 13) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 24) (8, 22) (0, 17) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 23) (11, 28) (11, 14) (17, 20) (17, 0) (17, 13) (13, 28) (13, 17) (26, 3) (26, 7) (26, 20) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 4) (27, 25) (27, 10) (16, 7) (16, 20) (18, 3) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 23) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 12) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 23) (5, 0) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 23) (24, 29) (29, 21) (29, 24) (29, 22) (23, 14) (23, 19) (23, 12) (23, 24) (22, 15) (22, 8) (22, 29) 

Response:
