Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all unique sets of three nodes that are connected by edges. Triangles are formed when three nodes are connected to each other forming a closed loop.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [10].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 2>
<5, 6, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 9>
