Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 6) (12, 7) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 2) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 6) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2)
