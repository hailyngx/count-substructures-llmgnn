Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
I will list all the triangles present in the given graph:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 3>
<2, 5, 4>
<2, 1, 0>
<2, 1, 4>
<2, 1, 7>
<2, 8, 7>
<2, 0, 6>
<2, 0, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 6>
<9, 5, 4>
<9, 5, 2>
<9, 5, 1>
<9, 5, 0>
<9, 8, 7>
<9, 8, 3>
<9, 8, 2>
<9, 8, 7>
<8, 6, 7>
<8, 6, 0>
<8, 0, 6>
<7, 6, 8>
<7, 6, 0>
<7, 3, 4>
<7, 3, 0>
<7, 3, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [30].
