Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 18) (4, 7) (4, 16) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 13) (3, 10) (3, 19) (3, 18) (11, 9) (11, 13) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 1) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 15) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 15) (0, 9) (0, 12) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 6) (15, 2) (15, 12) (19, 3) (19, 2) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 18) (6, 14) (6, 16) (6, 8) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 18) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 1) (18, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [30].
The unique triangles found are <2, 5, 17>, <2, 12, 15>, <2, 16, 6>, <3, 10, 18>, <9, 11, 13>, <10, 1, 13>, <10, 8, 18>, <10, 3, 19>, <12, 0, 9>, <16, 4, 7>, <16, 6, 8>, <18, 1, 13>, <18, 1, 10>, <18, 3, 19>, <2, 15, 12>, <5, 7, 4>, <5, 16, 4>, <6, 8, 18>, <6, 14, 17>, <6, 16, 12>.
