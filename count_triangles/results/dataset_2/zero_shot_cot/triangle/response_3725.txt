Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 27) (17, 14) (17, 16) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 9) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 13) (21, 9) (22, 5) (22, 24) (23, 2) (23, 3) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 15) (6, 25) (6, 8) (6, 13) (28, 21) (19, 26) (19, 10) (26, 19) (26, 25) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 8) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 4) (15, 12) (15, 1) (8, 6) (8, 26) (8, 9) (8, 29) (9, 7) (9, 21) (9, 8) (9, 3) (10, 7) (10, 21) (10, 19) (10, 27) (25, 6) (25, 26) (25, 4) (27, 14) (27, 10) (11, 26) (11, 0) (0, 11) (3, 23) (3, 9) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 24) (16, 18) (16, 20) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 4) (13, 21) (13, 6) (13, 29) (2, 23) (2, 1) (20, 26) (20, 16) (29, 8) (29, 13) (29, 4) (5, 22) (5, 18) (5, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 5) (4, 1) (4, 25) (4, 24) (4, 29) (4, 5) 

Response:
I will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of triangles using the number of edges and nodes.
The total number of triangles can be calculated using the formula: 
\[ \text{Total triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \times \left( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Total edges} \right) \times \left( \text{Total nodes} \times \left( \text{Total nodes} - 2 \right) \right) \]

Plugging in the given values:
\[ \text{Total triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \times \left( \frac{1}{2} \times 90 \right) \times \left( 30 \times 28 \right) = 7,560 \]

So, there are 7,560 triangles in the given graph.

Step 2: List the unique triangles found in the graph.
Here are some of the unique triangles found in the graph:
1. <4, 25, 26>
2. <18, 5, 22>
3. <16, 17, 1>
4. <9, 7, 21>
5. <13, 6, 29>
6. <10, 19, 26>

[Total number of triangles: 7,560]
