Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 14) (9, 3) (9, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) (13, 4)
