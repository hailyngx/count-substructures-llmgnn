Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 8) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 16) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 14) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 19) (11, 4) (11, 2) (19, 8) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 0) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 16) (2, 10) (2, 11) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 9) (7, 15) (7, 5) (7, 19) (14, 8) (18, 17) (18, 0) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 18) (0, 9) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 13) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 9)
