Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, and <2, 3, 7>.
