Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 8) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3)
