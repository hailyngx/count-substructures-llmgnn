Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 20) (26, 17) (26, 3) (3, 26) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 19) (25, 23) (25, 29) (25, 14) (10, 17) (10, 22) (17, 26) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 23) (8, 27) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 24) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 16) (29, 25) (29, 17) (29, 18) (21, 6) (21, 28) (21, 13) (28, 21) (28, 20) (22, 9) (22, 10) (22, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (0, 1) (0, 13) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 24) (16, 6) (16, 23) (18, 29) (18, 19) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 15) (19, 25) (19, 18) (19, 24) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 22) (12, 2) (12, 20) (12, 15) (14, 25) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 15) (13, 21) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 2) (27, 8) (23, 25) (23, 17) (23, 16) (23, 18) (23, 20) (20, 9) (20, 28) (20, 12) (20, 23) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 14) (24, 5) (24, 7) (24, 19) 

Response:
Following the given graph information, we can count the total number of triangles:

Let's denote each node as follows:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

We need to find all possible triangles in this graph by checking all combinations of three nodes. The triangles are as follows:
<2, 12, 15>
<2, 12, 20>
<2, 13, 21>
<2, 13, 21>
<3, 11, 14>
<3, 11, 25>
<3, 14, 18>
<3, 14, 25>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 16>
<5, 6, 21>
<5, 7, 24>
<6, 16, 23>
<6, 21, 28>
<7, 24, 19>
<9, 15, 18>
<9, 15, 20>
<9, 15, 22>
<17, 23, 29>
<18, 19, 24>
<18, 19, 29>
<23, 25, 29>

By counting the unique triangles and the total number of triangles, we get: 
[22] <2, 12, 15> <2, 12, 20> <2, 13, 21> <3, 11, 14> <3, 11, 25> <3, 14, 18> <5, 6, 7> <5, 6, 16> <5, 6, 21> <5, 7, 24> <6, 16, 23> <6, 21, 28> <7, 24, 19> <9, 15, 18> <9, 15, 20> <9, 15, 22> <17, 23, 29> <18, 19, 24> <18, 19, 29> <23, 25, 29>
