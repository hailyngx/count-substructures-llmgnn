Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here they are: 
<2, 4, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 7>

So, the total number of triangles is [4].
