Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 2) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 12) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 14) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 14) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 10)
