Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 0) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 0) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 11) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [4].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<7, 12, 14>
<10, 12, 4>
