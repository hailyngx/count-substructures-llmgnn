Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [6].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 0>
<6, 0, 8>
