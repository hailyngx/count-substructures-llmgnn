Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 8) (14, 17) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 19) (5, 14) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (8, 15) (8, 19) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 12) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 11) (10, 14) (10, 0) (10, 1) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 4) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 7) (2, 16) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 11) (13, 19) (13, 1) (13, 4) (11, 6) (11, 18) (11, 4)
