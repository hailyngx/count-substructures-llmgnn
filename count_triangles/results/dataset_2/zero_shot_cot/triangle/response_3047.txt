Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 18) (2, 8) (2, 5) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 12) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 10) (0, 8) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 6) (19, 3) (19, 8) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 7) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 16) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (12, 15) (12, 18) (16, 14) (16, 9) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 16) (4, 14) (4, 6)
