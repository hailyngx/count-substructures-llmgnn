Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 17) (9, 23) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 20) (26, 16) (3, 14) (15, 27) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 2) (27, 1) (1, 27) (1, 20) (1, 7) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 20) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 17) (2, 27) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 17) (29, 2) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 23) (20, 26) (20, 1) (20, 10) (20, 0) (18, 2) (18, 21) (18, 8) (8, 18) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 7) (13, 26) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 28) (28, 26) (28, 13) (28, 4) (28, 24) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 22) (21, 18) (21, 14) (21, 24) (19, 24) (19, 16) (19, 23) (12, 13) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 14) (16, 26) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 25) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 21) (14, 12) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (4, 28) (4, 5) (6, 11) (25, 0) (25, 8) (25, 16) (25, 22) (22, 7) (22, 25) (24, 28) (24, 21) (24, 19) (23, 9) (23, 0) (23, 19) 

Response:
You can analyze the graph to find the number of triangles present. 
Triangles are formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. 

Let's start by listing the unique triangles found: 
<1, 20, 10>
<1, 7, 20>
<1, 27, 2>
<2, 17, 27>
<5, 8, 25>
<5, 12, 16>
<4, 5, 28>
<9, 17, 23>
<12, 13, 16>
<13, 26, 28>
<14, 15, 21>
<19, 23, 24>

From the list above, we can see that there are 12 unique triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
