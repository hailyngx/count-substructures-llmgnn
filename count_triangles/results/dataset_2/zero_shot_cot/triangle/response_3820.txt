Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 1) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 14) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 3)
