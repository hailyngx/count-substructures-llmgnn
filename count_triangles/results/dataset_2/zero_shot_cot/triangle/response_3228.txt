Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (1, 15) (1, 19) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 1) (7, 15) (7, 14) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 13) (17, 8) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (18, 16) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 11) (8, 9) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 15) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 5) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 8) (12, 9) (12, 10) (16, 18) (16, 19) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 19) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 2) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
