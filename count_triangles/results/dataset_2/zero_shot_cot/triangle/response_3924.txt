Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 10) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 2) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 15) (2, 13) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 18) (12, 8) (16, 8) (16, 18) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 15) (11, 1) (11, 4) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 8) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 19) (19, 1) (19, 15) (18, 12) (18, 16) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 2) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 16) (8, 3) (8, 1)
