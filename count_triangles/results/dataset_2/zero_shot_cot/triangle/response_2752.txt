Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
[<0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 5, 7>, <6, 8, 1>, <6, 8, 5>, <8, 5, 2>]
