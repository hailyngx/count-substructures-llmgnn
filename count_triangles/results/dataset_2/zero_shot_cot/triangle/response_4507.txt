Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 20) (3, 9) (25, 3) (25, 5) (25, 26) (25, 12) (25, 18) (7, 29) (7, 24) (21, 27) (21, 20) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 26) (2, 16) (18, 25) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 20) (1, 2) (1, 26) (1, 11) (1, 14) (26, 25) (26, 2) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 4) (17, 29) (17, 28) (17, 22) (17, 4) (29, 7) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (28, 17) (28, 14) (24, 7) (24, 26) (24, 27) (24, 10) (4, 26) (4, 17) (27, 21) (27, 24) (27, 20) (20, 3) (20, 21) (20, 18) (20, 27) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 23) (15, 23) (15, 11) (12, 25) (12, 22) (12, 8) (16, 2) (16, 23) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 15) (5, 25) (5, 18) (5, 29) (5, 8) (8, 12) (8, 5) (8, 22) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 28) (23, 9) (23, 15) (23, 16) (19, 29) (19, 10) (10, 18) (10, 24) (10, 19) (22, 17) (22, 12) (22, 8) 

Response:
There are 30 nodes and 90 edges in the given graph.

Let's calculate the total number of triangles and list them step by step:

1. Count the total number of triangles:
\[ \binom{30}{3} = 4060 \]

2. Identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <2, 1, 26>
- Triangle 2: <2, 18, 25>
- ...

[Total number of triangles: 4060]
