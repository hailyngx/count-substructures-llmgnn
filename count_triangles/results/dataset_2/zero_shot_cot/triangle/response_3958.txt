Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 9) (15, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (2, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (17, 13) (17, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 19) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 0) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 16) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 6) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 14) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (14, 16) (14, 12) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 17) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) 

Response:

<4, 5, 13>
<4, 11, 0>
<7, 11, 5>
<7, 6, 1>
<7, 16, 18>
<11, 0, 19>
<12, 14, 16>
<14, 16, 18>
