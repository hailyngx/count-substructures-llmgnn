Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 8, 4>
<5, 3, 6>
<9, 6, 5>
<9, 4, 2>
<6, 0, 7>
<0, 7, 1>
