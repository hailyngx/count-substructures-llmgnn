Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 11) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 17) (12, 13) (12, 7) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 15) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 16) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (10, 5) (10, 9) (15, 2) (15, 14) (15, 19) (17, 13) (17, 7) (17, 2) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 18) (4, 9) (4, 3) (18, 19) (18, 11) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 6) (16, 9) (16, 2) (16, 14) (3, 6) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 18)
