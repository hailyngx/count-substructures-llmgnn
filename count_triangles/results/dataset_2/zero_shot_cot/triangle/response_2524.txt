Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 5) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 17) (13, 16) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 17) (7, 3) (7, 15) (16, 4) (16, 13) (16, 12) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 18) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 15) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 18) (1, 12) (2, 3) (2, 15) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 17) (15, 7) (15, 11) (15, 2) (15, 9) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 3) (17, 5) (17, 19) (17, 12) (17, 9) (18, 0) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [7], and the unique triangles found are <4, 16, 12>, <4, 5, 8>, <3, 15, 11>, <3, 18, 0>, <7, 11, 15>, <9, 17, 5>, <10, 12, 14>.
