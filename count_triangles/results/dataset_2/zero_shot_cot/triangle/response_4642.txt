Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 14) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 14) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 12)
