Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
[<0, 3, 6> <0, 3, 7> <0, 6, 8> <0, 7, 9> <1, 3, 4> <1, 3, 6> <2, 3, 6> <2, 3, 7> <2, 6, 9> <3, 4, 6> <3, 4, 7> <3, 6, 7> <4, 5, 9> <4, 6, 9> <5, 6, 8> <5, 6, 7> <6, 7, 9>]
