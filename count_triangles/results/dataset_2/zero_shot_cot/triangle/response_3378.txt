Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Check each node to see which triangles can be formed. 
   - <5, 9, 7>
   - <5, 9, 0>
   - <5, 9, 8>
   - <9, 6, 8>
   - <3, 6, 8>
   - <0, 9, 8>
   - <0, 9, 4>
   - <0, 9, 6>
   - <0, 2, 7>
   - <0, 2, 4>
   - <0, 7, 4>
   - <0, 7, 2>
   - <3, 1, 7>
   - <3, 1, 8>
   ...
   - Other possible triangles

2. Count the total number of triangles found in step 1.

Finally, calculate the total number of triangles:

Here are a few unique triangles found in the graph:
<5, 9, 7>, <5, 9, 0>, <5, 9, 8>, <9, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <0, 9, 8>, <0, 9, 4>, <0, 9, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 7, 4>, <3, 1, 7>
