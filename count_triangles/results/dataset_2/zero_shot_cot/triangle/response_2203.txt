Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 0) (10, 3) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 14) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 6) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 2) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1)
