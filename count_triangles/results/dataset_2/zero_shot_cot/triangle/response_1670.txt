Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 5) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2)
