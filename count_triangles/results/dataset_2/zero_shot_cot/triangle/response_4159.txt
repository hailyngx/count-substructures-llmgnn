Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 6) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 19) (10, 17) (10, 6) (17, 10) (17, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 19) (18, 4) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 14) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 7) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 1) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 7) (14, 6) (2, 17) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 18)
