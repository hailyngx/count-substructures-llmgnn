Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 13) (15, 2) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 8) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 10) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 19) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 1) (7, 13) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 17) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 13) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 19) (14, 18) (14, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 10) (10, 18) (10, 1) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 6) (19, 12) (19, 17)
