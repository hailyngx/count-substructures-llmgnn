Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0)
