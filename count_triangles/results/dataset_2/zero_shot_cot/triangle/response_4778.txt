Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 9) (10, 20) (11, 27) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 2) (1, 2) (1, 23) (1, 13) (1, 4) (26, 29) (26, 12) (28, 5) (28, 2) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 18) (6, 21) (6, 29) (6, 4) (21, 6) (21, 8) (8, 21) (8, 9) (8, 7) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 15) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 24) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 23) (16, 13) (16, 7) (16, 25) (16, 20) (24, 15) (24, 0) (19, 15) (22, 20) (18, 13) (18, 27) (18, 0) (29, 26) (29, 6) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 3) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 28) (20, 10) (20, 16) (20, 22) (27, 11) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 23) (0, 24) (0, 18) (0, 29) (14, 27) (14, 12) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 23) (4, 25) (23, 1) (23, 7) (23, 27) (23, 4) (12, 17) (12, 26) (12, 14) (12, 25) (12, 3) (25, 16) (25, 4) (25, 12) (3, 29) (3, 12) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can determine the total number of triangles by examining each set of three connected nodes.

Let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 5, 13>
<1, 7, 23>
<2, 17, 10>
<2, 28, 5>
<2, 1, 13>
<4, 6, 23>
<4, 25, 12>
<5, 7, 13>
<7, 16, 23>
<12, 17, 26>
<12, 14, 25>
<12, 3, 29>
<13, 16, 7>
<15, 19, 24>
<27, 18, 14>

Counting these unique triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
