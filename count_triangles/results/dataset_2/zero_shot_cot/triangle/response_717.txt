Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 22) (11, 13) (11, 5) (16, 14) (3, 25) (3, 7) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 6) (25, 29) (22, 11) (22, 23) (22, 24) (23, 22) (23, 6) (23, 19) (8, 19) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 29) (12, 20) (12, 18) (12, 0) (27, 4) (27, 9) (4, 27) (4, 18) (4, 10) (29, 25) (29, 13) (18, 12) (18, 4) (18, 6) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 21) (14, 16) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 24) (14, 10) (26, 28) (26, 10) (28, 26) (28, 1) (28, 24) (1, 8) (1, 28) (1, 15) (1, 2) (15, 1) (15, 19) (19, 23) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 24) (9, 25) (9, 27) (9, 20) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 26) (10, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 20) (6, 25) (6, 23) (6, 18) (6, 14) (6, 10) (2, 1) (2, 21) (20, 12) (20, 9) (20, 5) (20, 21) (21, 0) (21, 2) (21, 20) (21, 24) (24, 22) (24, 14) (24, 28) (24, 19) (24, 21) 

Response:
Let's start by counting the number of triangles in the given graph.

[The number of triangles in the graph is equal to the number of paths of length 2 between nodes.]

Given the edges of the graph, we can identify the triangles by finding nodes that are connected in such a way that they form a closed loop of 3 edges.

Let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:

[Total number of triangles: [46]]
