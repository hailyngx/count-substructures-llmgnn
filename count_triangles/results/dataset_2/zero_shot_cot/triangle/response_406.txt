Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 13) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 14) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 1)
