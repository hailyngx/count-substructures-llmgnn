Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 3) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 1)
