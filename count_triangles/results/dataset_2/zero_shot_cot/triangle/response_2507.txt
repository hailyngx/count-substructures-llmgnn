Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 12) (22, 13) (22, 2) (22, 6) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 16) (7, 11) (7, 18) (7, 17) (20, 12) (20, 21) (25, 17) (25, 12) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 24) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 0) (17, 7) (17, 25) (17, 1) (17, 3) (6, 22) (6, 21) (6, 3) (21, 20) (21, 6) (15, 1) (15, 24) (15, 16) (10, 29) (2, 22) (2, 26) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 27) (28, 8) (28, 0) (11, 7) (11, 26) (11, 12) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 23) (3, 29) (9, 14) (9, 23) (5, 0) (5, 16) (27, 19) (27, 18) (27, 26) (29, 10) (29, 3) (29, 26) (26, 2) (26, 11) (26, 27) (26, 29) (26, 16) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 28) (0, 5) (0, 12) (12, 13) (12, 20) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 0) (24, 8) (24, 15) (24, 18) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 9) (18, 7) (18, 27) (18, 24) (14, 1) (14, 9) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 5) (16, 26) 

Response:
[<0, 12, 19>, <0, 5, 16>, <1, 4, 19>, <1, 14, 17>, <1, 15, 16>, <3, 6, 21>, <3, 11, 29>, <3, 17, 26>, <3, 23, 29>, <4, 15, 16>, <6, 21, 22>, <7, 11, 17>, <8, 12, 13>, <8, 12, 25>, <8, 13, 22>, <8, 13, 28>, <8, 24, 15>, <11, 12, 26>, <15, 16, 26>, <16, 19, 27>, <17, 25, 12>, <18, 24, 27>, <23, 9, 14>]
