Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 12) 

Response:
There are a total of **23** triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 10>
<1, 6, 4>
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 10, 3>
<1, 10, 0>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 13>
<2, 6, 3>
<2, 6, 4>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 2>
<3, 6, 1>
<3, 6, 2>
<3, 6, 4>
<4, 6, 1>
<4, 6, 2>
<4, 6, 3>
<5, 8, 0>
<7, 8, 4>
<7, 8, 14>
<13, 1, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is **[23]**.
