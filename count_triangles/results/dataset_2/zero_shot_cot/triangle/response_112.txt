Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 10) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 14) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 13)
