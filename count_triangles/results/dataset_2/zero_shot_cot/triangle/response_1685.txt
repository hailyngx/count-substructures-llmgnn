Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 4) (13, 11) (22, 11) (22, 0) (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 23) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 19) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 26) (10, 11) (10, 23) (11, 13) (11, 22) (11, 10) (12, 27) (12, 8) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 14) (27, 19) (4, 13) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 12) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 26) (28, 29) (28, 26) (28, 25) (29, 28) (29, 20) (29, 16) (29, 14) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 17) (20, 9) (20, 29) (20, 15) (26, 3) (26, 8) (26, 28) (26, 16) (0, 22) (0, 8) (0, 16) (16, 29) (16, 26) (16, 0) (16, 2) (6, 4) (6, 25) (6, 18) (23, 9) (23, 10) (23, 7) (23, 24) (21, 25) (14, 3) (14, 27) (14, 29) (17, 15) (24, 23) (24, 7) (7, 23) (7, 24) (7, 18) (7, 2) (25, 28) (25, 6) (25, 21) (19, 1) (19, 12) (19, 27) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 7) (2, 16) (2, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 19>, <1, 9, 5>, <1, 9, 23>, <1, 19, 12>, <3, 9, 1>, <3, 9, 14>, <3, 9, 26>, <7, 18, 15>, <7, 18, 6>, <9, 19, 12>, <14, 27, 19>.
