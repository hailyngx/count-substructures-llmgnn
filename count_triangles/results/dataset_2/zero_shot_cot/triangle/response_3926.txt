Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (14, 11) (14, 6) (17, 18) (10, 16) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 2) (13, 19) (13, 6) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (6, 9) (6, 18) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 15) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 19) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 15) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 15) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 15) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 5) (16, 10) (16, 19) (19, 13) (19, 12) (19, 16)
