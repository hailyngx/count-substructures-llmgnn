Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be found by counting the unique triangles in the graph. 
Let's list out the unique triangles: 
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<4, 5, 1>
<6, 7, 0>
<6, 7, 2>

So, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
