Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <1, 2, 7>, <0, 7, 2>, <0, 2, 3>.
