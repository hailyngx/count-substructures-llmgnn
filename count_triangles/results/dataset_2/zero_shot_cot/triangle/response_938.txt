Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 10) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 18) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 15) (7, 19) (7, 10) (16, 13) (16, 18) (1, 6) (1, 9) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 15) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 15) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 19) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 17) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 17) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 17) (17, 9) (17, 2) (17, 11) (17, 3) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (13, 0) (13, 16) 

Response:
There are a total of 20 unique triangles in this graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 11>
<0, 6, 13>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 17>
<3, 8, 17>
<4, 6, 11>
<4, 6, 12>
<4, 11, 17>
<5, 6, 15>
<7, 10, 19>
<8, 10, 12>
<8, 12, 4>
<8, 12, 15>
<9, 17, 3>
<10, 14, 8>
<10, 16, 13>
<12, 15, 18>
<15, 18, 19>
<18, 15, 19>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [20].
