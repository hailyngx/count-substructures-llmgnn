Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 9) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 5) (14, 18) (14, 13) (14, 10) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 9) (2, 16) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 2) (18, 3) (18, 8) (3, 18) (3, 13) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 6) (15, 1) (15, 0) (8, 18) (8, 19) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 12) (12, 4) (12, 19) (12, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 6) (10, 14) (10, 2) (5, 16) (5, 4) (13, 16) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) 

Response:
There are total of 12 triangles in the given graph, and they are as follows:
[<11, 1, 6>, <11, 1, 15>, <11, 9, 12>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 6, 1>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 12, 19>, <4, 13, 14>, <7, 9, 12>, <7, 9, 19>, <13, 14, 18>, <16, 2, 18>]
