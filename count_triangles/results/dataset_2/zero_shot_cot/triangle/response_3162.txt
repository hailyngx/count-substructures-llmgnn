Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) 

Response:
Calculating the total number of triangles:

[<0, 2, 7> <2, 6, 7> <2, 3, 6> <5, 9, 1>]
