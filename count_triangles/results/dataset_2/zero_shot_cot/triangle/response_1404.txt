Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 11) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 0) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 15) (6, 10) (6, 11) (18, 3) (18, 13) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 10) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 0) (7, 3) (13, 18) (13, 19) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 19) (2, 16) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 3) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 9) (19, 13) (19, 16) (9, 11) (9, 15) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 9) (10, 6) (10, 1)
