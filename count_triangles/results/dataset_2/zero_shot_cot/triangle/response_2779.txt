Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 5) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 4) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 19) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 16) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 5) (1, 17) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 5) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 19) (0, 9) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 14) (9, 0) (9, 14) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 1) (13, 7) (13, 16) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 9) (16, 4) (16, 13) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 15) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 8) (6, 17) (6, 12)
