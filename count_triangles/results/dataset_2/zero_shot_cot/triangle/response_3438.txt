Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 3) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 19) (15, 19) (15, 7) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 8) (5, 14) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 14) (4, 8) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (7, 15) (7, 18) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 10) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 2) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 12) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 6) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 19) (13, 3) (13, 19) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 1) 

Response:
There are <8, 12, 0>, <0, 16, 11>, <0, 12, 8>, <1, 12, 8>, <1, 10, 2> triangles in the given graph.
Total number of triangles: [5]
