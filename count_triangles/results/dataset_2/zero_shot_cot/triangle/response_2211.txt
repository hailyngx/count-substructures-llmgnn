Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (5, 8) (5, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by listing all the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <6, 9, 1>
2. Triangle <6, 1, 3>
3. Triangle <6, 1, 7>
4. Triangle <6, 3, 0>
5. Triangle <6, 3, 8>
6. Triangle <6, 2, 7>
7. Triangle <9, 1, 7>
8. Triangle <9, 0, 3>
9. Triangle <9, 0, 4>
10. Triangle <9, 2, 7>
11. Triangle <1, 3, 7>
12. Triangle <3, 0, 8>
13. Triangle <3, 8, 4>
14. Triangle <4, 0, 7>
15. Triangle <8, 7, 5>

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in total. 
So, the total number of triangles is [15].
