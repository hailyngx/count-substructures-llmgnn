Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 14) (14, 15) (14, 18) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 17) (9, 6) (9, 1) (2, 13) (2, 7) (18, 14) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 10) (4, 17) (4, 6) (4, 10) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 2) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (19, 11) (19, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 19) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 2) (13, 1)
