Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<4, 0, 8>
<6, 2, 4>
<5, 1, 8>
