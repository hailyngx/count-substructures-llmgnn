Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 8>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 8, 2>, <5, 6, 9>
