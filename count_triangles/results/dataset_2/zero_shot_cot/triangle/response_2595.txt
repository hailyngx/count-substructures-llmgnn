Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 10) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 9, 13>
<1, 9, 12>
<2, 12, 13>
<2, 9, 13>
<4, 12, 13>
<9, 12, 13>
