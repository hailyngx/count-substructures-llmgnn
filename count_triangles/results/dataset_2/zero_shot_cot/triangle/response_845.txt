Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 1) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 1) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 16) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 19) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 15) (10, 17) (10, 0) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 19) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 15) (18, 9) (18, 4) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 16) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 4) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 15) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 16)
