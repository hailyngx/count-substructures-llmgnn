Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are 10 unique triangles in this graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 4>
<2, 1, 5>
<2, 6, 9>
<6, 5, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 4>
<6, 8, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [10].
