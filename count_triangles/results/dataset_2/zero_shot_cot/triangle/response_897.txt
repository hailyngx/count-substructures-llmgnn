Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 13) (1, 6) (1, 13) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 14) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 13) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3)
