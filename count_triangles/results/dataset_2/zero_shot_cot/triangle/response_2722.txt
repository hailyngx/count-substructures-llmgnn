Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 21) (17, 25) (17, 0) (17, 4) (22, 9) (22, 11) (23, 27) (23, 3) (23, 16) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 8) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 4) (20, 24) (25, 17) (25, 20) (25, 28) (0, 17) (0, 20) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 12) (15, 20) (15, 11) (15, 16) (2, 7) (21, 14) (21, 29) (21, 24) (28, 25) (28, 16) (28, 9) (28, 5) (9, 22) (9, 28) (9, 1) (9, 7) (3, 23) (3, 11) (11, 22) (11, 15) (11, 3) (24, 20) (24, 21) (24, 10) (26, 5) (26, 7) (16, 23) (16, 15) (16, 28) (16, 7) (16, 29) (5, 28) (5, 26) (5, 18) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 26) (7, 16) (4, 17) (4, 20) (4, 0) (19, 1) (19, 27) (19, 12) (29, 21) (29, 16) (29, 12) (27, 23) (27, 19) (6, 14) (6, 12) (18, 0) (18, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 19) (1, 10) (10, 24) (10, 1) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 29) (12, 6)
