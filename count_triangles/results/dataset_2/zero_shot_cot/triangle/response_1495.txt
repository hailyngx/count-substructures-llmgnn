Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Firstly, let's identify all the triangles in the graph:

Triangles:
<5, 1, 0>
<5, 1, 3>
<5, 3, 0>
<9, 4, 8>
<7, 1, 0>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 1, 3>
<2, 9, 8>
<2, 6, 0>

2. Now, let's count the number of triangles found:
Total number of triangles = [10]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 10.
