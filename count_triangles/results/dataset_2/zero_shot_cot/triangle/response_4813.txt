Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 19) (14, 8) (14, 16) (14, 13) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 18) (4, 16) (7, 3) (7, 6) (19, 5) (19, 9) (19, 1) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 16) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (6, 7) (15, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (1, 5) (1, 19) (1, 10) (1, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 13) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 18) (12, 17) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 0) (18, 17) (18, 11) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 4) (16, 8) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 0) (2, 17) (2, 10)
