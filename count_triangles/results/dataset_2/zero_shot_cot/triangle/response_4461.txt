Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 19) (6, 9) (6, 29) (6, 23) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 19) (2, 8) (2, 0) (29, 6) (29, 5) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 21) (23, 6) (23, 22) (23, 5) (0, 2) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 21) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 15) (3, 20) (3, 28) (3, 17) (4, 20) (4, 27) (4, 12) (4, 26) (27, 4) (27, 25) (27, 28) (27, 7) (12, 4) (12, 28) (12, 18) (12, 15) (7, 27) (7, 13) (26, 4) (26, 10) (26, 25) (28, 0) (28, 3) (28, 27) (28, 12) (28, 24) (10, 26) (10, 25) (25, 27) (25, 26) (25, 10) (25, 13) (25, 24) (5, 29) (5, 23) (5, 1) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 15) (1, 9) (1, 5) (21, 22) (21, 0) (21, 18) (13, 7) (13, 25) (13, 19) (18, 12) (18, 21) (18, 15) (24, 28) (24, 25) (15, 22) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 17) (15, 18) (19, 16) (19, 9) (19, 13) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [72].
The unique triangles found are <21, 22, 0>, <12, 15, 18>, <15, 18, 21>, <4, 12, 28>, <25, 27, 28>, <25, 27, 24>, <25, 10, 26>, <25, 10, 13>, <25, 26, 24>, <17, 15, 18>, <26, 25, 24>, <17, 9, 15>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 29>, <21, 0, 22>, <8, 6, 2>, <8, 6, 15>, <8, 2, 15>, <9, 6, 16>, <9, 6, 19>, <9, 16, 19>, <6, 23, 5>, <4, 12, 26>, <28, 12, 18>, <28, 12, 15>, <28, 12, 24>, <27, 10, 26>, <27, 10, 25>, <27, 13, 25>, <27, 13, 24>, <25, 13, 19>, <19, 9, 13>.
