Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 11) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (4, 19) (4, 6) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 7) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 3) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 15) (3, 5) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 17) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 12) (2, 12) (2, 16) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (19, 4) (19, 13) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 13) (13, 19) (13, 15) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Calculate the total number of triangles:

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i} \text{deg}(v_i)(\text{deg}(v_i)-1)(\text{deg}(v_i)-2) \]

where \text{deg}(v_i) represents the degree of node $v_i$.

2. Count the number of triangles by examining each node $v_i$ and its adjacent nodes.

- For node 0: (14, 10, 15)
- For node 2: (12, 16, 17)
- For node 3: (10, 12, 18)
- For node 4: No triangles
- For node 5: No triangles
- For node 6: (10, 12, 14)
- For node 7: (3, 8, 9) and (3, 10, 12)
- For node 8: No triangles
- For node 9: (0, 7, 11) and (0, 5, 7)
- For node 10: (0, 3, 12), (0, 6, 14), (3, 12, 18), (6, 12, 14)
- For node 11: No triangles
- For node 12: No triangles
- For node 13: No triangles
- For node 14: (0, 6, 10)
- For node 15: No triangles
- For node 16: No triangles
- For node 17: No triangles
- For node 18: (3, 10, 17)
- For node 19: No triangles

3. Calculating the total number of triangles:
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = 10(9)(8) + 3(16)(2) + 10(5)(3) + 2(10)(9) = 720 + 96 + 150 + 180 = 1146 \]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is **1146**.

The unique triangles found are:
- <0, 10, 14>
- <3, 10, 12>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <0, 10, 15>
- <1, 2, 3>
- <6, 10, 12>
- <10, 12, 14>
- <3, 10, 18>
- <0, 9, 11>
- <7, 8, 9>
