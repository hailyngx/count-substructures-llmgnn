Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
[<0, 4, 7>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 8, 7>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 7, 8>] [9 triangles]
