Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 12) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 12) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 13) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 11>
<3, 4, 14>
<3, 10, 12>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 10, 12>
<10, 12, 13> 

So, the total number of triangles is [10].
