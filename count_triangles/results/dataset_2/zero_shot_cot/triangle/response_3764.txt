Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 28) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 18) (27, 20) (10, 15) (17, 20) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 3) (23, 8) (23, 3) (23, 13) (23, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 25) (2, 4) (22, 26) (22, 11) (22, 21) (26, 22) (26, 5) (28, 15) (20, 27) (20, 17) (20, 18) (20, 9) (16, 12) (16, 18) (5, 26) (19, 6) (9, 23) (9, 20) (9, 21) (29, 6) (29, 14) (29, 11) (24, 0) (24, 7) (24, 21) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 19) (6, 29) (6, 1) (18, 15) (18, 27) (18, 20) (18, 16) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 14) (0, 15) (0, 24) (3, 8) (3, 23) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 24) (7, 3) (7, 13) (14, 8) (14, 29) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 25) (21, 27) (21, 22) (21, 9) (21, 24) (21, 25) (11, 22) (11, 29) (13, 23) (13, 7) (13, 14) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (25, 2) (25, 14) (25, 21)
