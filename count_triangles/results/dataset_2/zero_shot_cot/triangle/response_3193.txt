Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 9) (11, 5) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 0) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 9) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 14) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 5) (6, 12) (6, 14) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 6)
