Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6)
