Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 0) (6, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 10) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 9) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 11) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 2)
