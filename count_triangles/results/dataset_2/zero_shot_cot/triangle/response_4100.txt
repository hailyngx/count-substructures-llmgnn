Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 10) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 10) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 12)
