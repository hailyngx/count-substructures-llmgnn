Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 0) (6, 13) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 9) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 9) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 14)
