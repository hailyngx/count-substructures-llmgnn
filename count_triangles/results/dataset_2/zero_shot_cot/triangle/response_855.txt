Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 6) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 0) (6, 14) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12)
