Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) 

Response:
There are two triangles in this graph. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4> and <3, 4, 6>. 
So, the total number of triangles is [2].
