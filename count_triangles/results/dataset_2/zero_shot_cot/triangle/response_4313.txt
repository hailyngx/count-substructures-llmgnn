Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 8>
