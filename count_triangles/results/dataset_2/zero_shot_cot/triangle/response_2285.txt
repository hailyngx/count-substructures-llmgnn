Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 8) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 4) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 14) 

Response:
