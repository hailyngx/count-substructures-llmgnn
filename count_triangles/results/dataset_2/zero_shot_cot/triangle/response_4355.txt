Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 10) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 13) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12)
