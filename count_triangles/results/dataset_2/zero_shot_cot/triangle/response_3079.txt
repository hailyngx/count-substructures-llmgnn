Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 0) (22, 12) (18, 22) (18, 6) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 26) (23, 11) (23, 7) (23, 24) (23, 27) (26, 8) (26, 2) (26, 16) (26, 0) (1, 20) (1, 14) (1, 19) (17, 25) (17, 3) (17, 28) (11, 23) (11, 6) (11, 29) (11, 25) (10, 8) (10, 21) (10, 20) (21, 10) (21, 9) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 16) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 6) (25, 17) (25, 11) (25, 0) (16, 26) (16, 4) (16, 5) (24, 23) (24, 5) (24, 15) (3, 17) (3, 20) (7, 23) (29, 8) (29, 11) (29, 27) (20, 1) (20, 10) (20, 3) (20, 9) (27, 23) (27, 29) (2, 26) (2, 19) (9, 21) (9, 4) (9, 20) (9, 15) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 0) (28, 17) (28, 5) (15, 24) (15, 9) (15, 14) (5, 16) (5, 24) (5, 28) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 15) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 13) (0, 22) (0, 26) (0, 25) (0, 19) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [44].
The unique triangles found are <8, 10, 21>, <4, 9, 20>, <2, 19, 0>, <5, 15, 24>, <15, 9, 14>, <3, 17, 20>, <11, 25, 29>, <14, 4, 12>, <16, 26, 4>, <6, 12, 14>, <6, 11, 29>, <0, 19, 1>, <18, 6, 11>, <22, 13, 0>, <25, 0, 11>, <26, 16, 5>, <8, 29, 11>, <14, 15, 9>, <22, 12, 6>, <23, 11, 6>, <17, 28, 5>, <20, 3, 17>, <25, 17, 3>, <23, 11, 25>, <22, 18, 6>, <0, 26, 8>, <8, 26, 0>, <26, 0, 25>, <3, 20, 9>, <12, 22, 14>, <26, 2, 19>, <9, 20, 4>, <9, 15, 24>, <14, 1, 19>, <16, 5, 24>, <26, 16, 4>, <23, 24, 5>, <17, 3, 25>, <20, 9, 15>, <17, 25, 11>, <16, 4, 5>, <14, 12, 6>
