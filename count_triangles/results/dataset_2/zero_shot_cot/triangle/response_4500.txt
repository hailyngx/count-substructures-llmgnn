Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 2) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 1) (4, 8) (4, 14) (2, 10) (18, 8) (18, 5) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 5) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 9) (15, 10) (15, 1) (15, 12) (5, 18) (5, 14) (5, 19) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 7) (12, 15) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 3) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 14>, <1, 9, 7>, <1, 9, 15>, <1, 13, 10>, <1, 13, 17>, <1, 15, 12>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 14, 5>, <5, 14, 4>, <7, 9, 1>, <7, 9, 19>, <11, 17, 10>.
