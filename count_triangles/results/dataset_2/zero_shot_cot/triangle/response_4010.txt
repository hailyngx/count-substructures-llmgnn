Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 19) (14, 15) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 8) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 1) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 1) (5, 17) (5, 18) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 16) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 11) (1, 13) (15, 14) (15, 13) (15, 12) (16, 18) (16, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 15) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 9) (9, 0) (9, 19) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 3) (13, 19) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [6].
The unique triangles are <1, 11, 19>, <1, 13, 15>, <1, 17, 18>, <4, 8, 12>, <6, 10, 16>, <13, 15, 19>.
