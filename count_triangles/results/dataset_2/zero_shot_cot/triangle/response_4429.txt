Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 10) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 10) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14)
