Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 3) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 14) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 14) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 4)
