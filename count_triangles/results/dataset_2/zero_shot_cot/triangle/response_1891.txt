Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are:
<6, 9, 0>
<4, 9, 3>
<1, 3, 2>
<3, 8, 2>
