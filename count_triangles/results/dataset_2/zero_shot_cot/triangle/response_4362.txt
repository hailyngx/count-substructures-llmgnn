Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 12) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 9) (16, 6) (4, 16) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 0) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 6) (6, 16) (6, 4) (6, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 15) (10, 15) (15, 0) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 14) (17, 16) (17, 13) (18, 8) (19, 7) (19, 3) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 2) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 15) (14, 8) (14, 15) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [4].
The unique triangles found are: <1, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 13>, <5, 6, 16>, <7, 4, 6>.
