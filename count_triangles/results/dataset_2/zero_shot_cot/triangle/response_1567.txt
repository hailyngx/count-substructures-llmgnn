Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<5, 9, 4>
<5, 9, 7>
<1, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
