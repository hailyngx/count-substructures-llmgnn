Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 3) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 3) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 7) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 11) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 5) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 10) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 3) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 5)
