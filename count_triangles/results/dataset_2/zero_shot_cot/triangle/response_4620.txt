Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 7) (10, 13) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (20, 4) (21, 16) (21, 26) (21, 11) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 5) (26, 22) (26, 21) (26, 7) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 12) (7, 13) (7, 22) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 26) (3, 28) (3, 23) (8, 19) (9, 17) (9, 23) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 15) (27, 25) (27, 29) (27, 23) (16, 21) (16, 14) (5, 28) (5, 1) (5, 14) (29, 25) (29, 27) (29, 6) (29, 4) (29, 18) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 29) (14, 28) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 24) (15, 25) (15, 23) (15, 11) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 19) (23, 3) (23, 9) (23, 27) (23, 15) (2, 24) (4, 20) (4, 19) (4, 29) (4, 24) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 18) (11, 21) (11, 15) (24, 14) (24, 2) (24, 4) (18, 29) (18, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are connected by edges. Let's go step-by-step to find the total number of triangles:

1. Identify the triangles by checking all possible combinations of 3 connected nodes:
   - (13, 22, 7)
   - (13, 22, 26)
   - (13, 7, 0)
   - (13, 10, 7)
   - (13, 10, 6)
   - (13, 10, 17)
   - (22, 7, 26)
   - (22, 10, 7)
   - (22, 10, 17)
   - (22, 26, 21)
   - (10, 17, 12)
   - (10, 7, 0)
   - (10, 7, 6)
   - (17, 12, 19)
   - (7, 26, 21)
   - (3, 23, 27)
   - (3, 28, 14)
   - (8, 19, 4)
   - (9, 23, 15)
   - (25, 29, 27)
   - (16, 14, 24)
   - (5, 1, 0)
   - (1, 18, 29)
   - (11, 21, 15)

2. Count the total number of unique triangles and list them:
   - Total number of unique triangles: [23]
   - List of unique triangles: 
     - <13, 22, 7>
     - <13, 22, 26>
     - <13, 7, 0>
     - <13, 10, 7>
     - <13, 10, 6>
     - <13, 10, 17>
     - <22, 7, 26>
     - <22, 10, 7>
     - <22, 10, 17>
     - <22, 26, 21>
     - <10, 17, 12>
     - <10, 7, 0>
     - <10, 7, 6>
     - <17, 12, 19>
     - <7, 26, 21>
     - <3, 23, 27>
     - <3, 28, 14>
     - <8, 19, 4>
     - <9, 23, 15>
     - <25, 29, 27>
     - <16, 14, 24>
     - <5, 1, 0>
     - <1, 18, 29>
     - <11, 21, 15>
