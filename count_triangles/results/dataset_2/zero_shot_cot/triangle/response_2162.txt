Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 13) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 13) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12)
