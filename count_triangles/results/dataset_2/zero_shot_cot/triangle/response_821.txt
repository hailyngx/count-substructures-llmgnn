Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [12].
The unique triangles found are <3, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 1, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <5, 8, 9>, <5, 2, 8>, <5, 2, 6>, <5, 0, 3>, <6, 2, 8>.
