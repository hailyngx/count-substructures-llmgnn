Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (15, 11) (15, 12) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 2) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 1) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 8) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 0) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 1) (12, 16) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 6) (6, 12) (6, 14) (14, 6) (14, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 2) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 19) (1, 14) (1, 0) (18, 12) (18, 0) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 18)
