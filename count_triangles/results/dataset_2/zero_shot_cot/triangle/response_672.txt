Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
