Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 12) (11, 20) (16, 17) (16, 10) (2, 29) (2, 9) (2, 20) (2, 28) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 0) (3, 25) (3, 13) (3, 12) (25, 2) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 8) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 24) (23, 22) (23, 15) (18, 6) (18, 13) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 21) (8, 25) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 20) (7, 25) (7, 9) (7, 17) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 15) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 21) (6, 18) (6, 1) (21, 4) (21, 26) (13, 3) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 20) (17, 16) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 28) (17, 0) (19, 4) (19, 8) (27, 25) (27, 1) (1, 6) (1, 27) (1, 28) (14, 15) (10, 16) (10, 4) (10, 26) (10, 28) (0, 29) (0, 17) (0, 9) (5, 20) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (15, 23) (15, 12) (15, 14) (28, 2) (28, 17) (28, 1) (28, 10) (20, 11) (20, 2) (20, 8) (20, 13) (20, 5) (24, 22) 

Response:
There are 16 triangles in the graph:
[<0, 9, 29>, <0, 17, 28>, <2, 9, 25>, <2, 13, 20>, <4, 8, 25>, <4, 10, 26>, <4, 19, 21>, <4, 9, 10>, <6, 18, 13>, <6, 18, 1>, <7, 9, 25>, <7, 17, 13>, <8, 19, 4>, <10, 16, 26>, <12, 15, 23>, <15, 14, 23>]
