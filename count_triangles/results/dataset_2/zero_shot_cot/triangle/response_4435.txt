Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (14, 18) (14, 4) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 15) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 19) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 19) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 3) (19, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 12) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 3) (16, 10) (16, 13) (16, 7) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 3) (3, 19) (3, 7) (3, 18) (3, 4) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (12, 19) (12, 15) (12, 18)
