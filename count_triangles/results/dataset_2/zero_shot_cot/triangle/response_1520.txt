Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 8) (27, 4) (27, 24) (4, 27) (4, 5) (4, 29) (4, 6) (7, 15) (7, 6) (1, 26) (1, 25) (1, 16) (1, 5) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 18) (26, 20) (26, 17) (19, 26) (19, 9) (11, 23) (11, 17) (11, 2) (28, 8) (28, 13) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 13) (13, 28) (13, 5) (13, 29) (18, 26) (18, 29) (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 7) (21, 3) (21, 25) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 20) (3, 23) (10, 22) (10, 16) (23, 11) (23, 3) (23, 14) (23, 12) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 20) (2, 24) (2, 17) (12, 23) (12, 2) (12, 29) (22, 10) (8, 15) (8, 28) (8, 14) (0, 3) (0, 24) (9, 19) (9, 25) (9, 20) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 9) (20, 26) (20, 3) (20, 2) (20, 9) (20, 16) (14, 23) (14, 8) (24, 27) (24, 2) (24, 0) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 20) (17, 26) (17, 11) (17, 2) (29, 4) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 12) 

Response:
There are a total of 17 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

<1, 5, 13>
<2, 11, 17>
<2, 12, 23>
<2, 17, 26>
<3, 20, 26>
<4, 5, 13>
<4, 5, 29>
<4, 6, 15>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 13, 29>
<8, 14, 23>
<9, 19, 25>
<9, 20, 26>
<9, 20, 16>
<13, 28, 8>
<16, 20, 26>
<17, 11, 2> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
