Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 25) (4, 29) (7, 28) (3, 23) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 18) (25, 4) (25, 23) (25, 10) (10, 25) (10, 6) (10, 19) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 17) (22, 20) (22, 29) (28, 7) (28, 29) (29, 4) (29, 22) (29, 28) (29, 27) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 24) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 21) (8, 27) (5, 21) (5, 20) (13, 4) (1, 17) (1, 20) (1, 16) (1, 24) (1, 9) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 21) (14, 26) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 15) (26, 14) (26, 16) (26, 27) (0, 18) (0, 17) (0, 16) (16, 2) (16, 1) (16, 26) (16, 0) (16, 20) (12, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 24) (20, 22) (20, 5) (20, 1) (20, 16) (27, 29) (27, 8) (27, 26) (27, 6) (24, 2) (24, 1) (24, 9) (6, 10) (6, 27) (23, 3) (23, 25) (23, 21) (23, 19) (15, 17) (15, 14) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 23) (21, 8) (21, 5) (21, 17) (21, 23) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [10].
The unique triangles found are <4, 25, 29>, <3, 8, 27>, <3, 8, 21>, <17, 20, 21>, <17, 0, 18>, <25, 23, 10>, <20, 1, 16>, <26, 16, 1>, <14, 15, 17>, <19, 14, 23>.
