Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 21) (15, 9) (15, 24) (21, 15) (21, 8) (21, 18) (21, 14) (8, 21) (8, 23) (8, 18) (8, 27) (13, 17) (13, 14) (23, 8) (23, 3) (23, 19) (20, 7) (20, 11) (1, 5) (1, 12) (17, 13) (17, 25) (18, 21) (18, 8) (18, 26) (18, 0) (18, 3) (26, 18) (26, 14) (9, 15) (9, 29) (9, 27) (29, 9) (29, 6) (29, 24) (29, 11) (14, 21) (14, 13) (14, 26) (14, 25) (7, 20) (7, 16) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 5) (16, 10) (0, 18) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 19) (10, 16) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 19) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 11) (25, 17) (25, 14) (25, 28) (25, 24) (4, 16) (22, 11) (11, 20) (11, 29) (11, 5) (11, 22) (3, 23) (3, 18) (3, 0) (6, 29) (2, 16) (2, 28) (19, 23) (19, 0) (19, 10) (24, 15) (24, 29) (24, 25) (24, 27) (27, 8) (27, 9) (27, 24) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 28) (28, 25) (28, 2) (28, 12) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:
[<0, 10, 19>, <3, 0, 18>, <5, 1, 11>, <5, 11, 29>, <5, 11, 22>, <16, 4, 10>, <16, 4, 5>, <16, 10, 12>]
