Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 9) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 18) (0, 8) (0, 13) (13, 0) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 4) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 8) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 18) (16, 2) (16, 12) (9, 17) (9, 18) (18, 3) (18, 7) (18, 9) (18, 5) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 19) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 10) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 10) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 15) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 5) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 5) 

Response:
[<1, 3, 19>, <2, 4, 19>]
