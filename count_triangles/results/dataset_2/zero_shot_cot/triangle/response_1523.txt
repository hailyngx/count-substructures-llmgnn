Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 10) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 0) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14)
