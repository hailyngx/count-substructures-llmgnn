Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
With the given graph having 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's calculate the total number of triangles present.

In order to count the number of triangles, we need to find all the unique triangles formed by 3 connected nodes. Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:

1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <2, 3, 8>
3. <2, 6, 5>
4. <3, 4, 7>
5. <3, 6, 1>
6. <4, 1, 7>
7. <5, 2, 6>
8. <5, 4, 1>
9. <8, 3, 6>
10. <8, 9, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph. So, the number of triangles is [10].
