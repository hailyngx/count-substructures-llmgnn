Response:
To calculate the total number of triangles, we can analyze each node and count the triangles it forms with its neighbors. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0: Forms triangles with nodes 15, 24, and 27.
2. Node 1: Forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 27.
3. Node 2: Forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 15.
4. Node 3: Forms a triangle with nodes 19 and 21.
5. Node 4: Forms triangles with nodes 23, 26, and 28.
6. Node 5: No triangles.
7. Node 6: No triangles.
8. Node 7: No triangles.
9. Node 8: No triangles.
10. Node 9: No triangles.
11. Node 10: No triangles.
12. Node 11: Forms triangles with nodes 14, 17, 24, and 25.
13. Node 12: Forms triangles with nodes 13, 17, and 23.
14. Node 13: Forms triangles with nodes 12, 16, 27, and 29.
15. Node 14: Forms triangles with nodes 19, 22, and 25.
16. Node 15: Forms triangles with nodes 0, 2, 16, and 20.
17. Node 16: Forms triangles with nodes 13, 15, 21, and 23.
18. Node 17: Forms triangles with nodes 11, 12, and 22.
19. Node 18: No triangles.
20. Node 19: Forms triangles with nodes 3, 14, 23, and 24.
21. Node 20: No triangles.
22. Node 21: Forms triangles with nodes 3, 16, and 7.
23. Node 22: Forms triangles with nodes 14, 17, and 25.
24. Node 23: Forms triangles with nodes 4, 12, 16, and 19.
25. Node 24: Forms triangles with nodes 0, 11, 19, and 6.
26. Node 25: Forms triangles with nodes 10, 11, 14, and 22.
27. Node 26: Forms triangles with nodes 4, 6, and 28.
28. Node 27: Forms triangles with nodes 0, 13, and 1.
29. Node 28: Forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 26.
30. Node 29: No triangles.

Now, let's count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles:
Total number of triangles: [33]
Unique triangles: <0, 15, 24>, <0, 15, 27>, <0, 24, 27>, <1, 2, 27>, <3, 19, 21>, <4, 23, 26>, <4, 23, 28>, <4, 26, 28>, <11, 14, 22>, <11, 14, 25>, <11, 17, 22>, <11, 17, 25>, <12, 13, 17>, <12, 13, 23>, <12, 17, 22>, <13, 16, 27>, <13, 16, 29>, <14, 19, 22>, <14, 19, 25>, <16, 21, 23>, <19, 23, 24>
