Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 5) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 9) (4, 19) (4, 16) (7, 14) (7, 5) (2, 18) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 1) (8, 10) (8, 16) (3, 16) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (0, 18) (0, 15) (1, 18) (1, 15) (1, 5) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 1) (15, 9) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 9) (6, 11) (6, 19) (12, 17) (12, 10) (9, 17) (9, 15) (9, 13) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 12) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 13) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 1)
