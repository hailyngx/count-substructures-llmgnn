Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 6) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 6) (14, 12) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 0) 

Response:
