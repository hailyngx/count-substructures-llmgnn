Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (15, 16) (15, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 13) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 5) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 18) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 1) (11, 12) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 0) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 19) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 13) (1, 8) (1, 16) (6, 17) (6, 12) (18, 10) (18, 12) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 16) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 13) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 18)
