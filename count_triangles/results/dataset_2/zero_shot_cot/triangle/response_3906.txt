Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 27) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 29) (22, 0) (22, 20) (22, 7) (23, 20) (12, 20) (12, 17) (12, 1) (27, 9) (27, 13) (0, 9) (0, 22) (0, 20) (0, 7) (20, 22) (20, 23) (20, 12) (20, 0) (20, 19) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 28) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 18) (28, 8) (28, 21) (28, 3) (28, 18) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 11) (29, 26) (29, 1) (29, 6) (29, 24) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 17) (11, 5) (7, 22) (7, 0) (7, 16) (1, 12) (1, 29) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 14) (19, 9) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 13) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 24) (16, 7) (16, 4) (16, 6) (10, 21) (10, 13) (6, 29) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 16) (13, 27) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 10) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 24) (24, 29) (24, 5) (24, 4) (14, 15) (18, 21) (18, 28) (18, 17) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. First, let's identify all the triangles by finding nodes that have edges connecting them in a triangle formation.

The possible triangles are:
- (9, 26, 29)
- (9, 0, 22)
- (9, 0, 20)
- (9, 0, 7)
- (9, 27, 13)
- (9, 19, 20)
- (9, 19, 8)
- (9, 19, 13)
- (26, 29, 1)
- (0, 22, 20)
- (0, 22, 7)
- (0, 20, 19)
- (22, 20, 23)
- (12, 20, 17)
- (12, 20, 1)
- (27, 9, 11)
- (27, 9, 13)
- (8, 19, 20)
- (8, 19, 13)
- (21, 28, 18)
- (29, 6, 24)
- (3, 6, 15)
- (3, 5, 11)
- (3, 5, 4)
- (11, 17, 12)
- (7, 0, 22)
- (7, 0, 20)
- (7, 0, 16)
- (1, 29, 6)
- (1, 15, 14)
- (15, 6, 16)

2. Count the total number of unique triangles:
There are 29 unique triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, there are a total of 29 triangles in the graph.
The triangles are: 
<9, 26, 29>, <9, 0, 22>, <9, 0, 20>, <9, 0, 7>, <9, 27, 13>, <9, 19, 20>, <9, 19, 8>, <9, 19, 13>, <26, 29, 1>, <0, 22, 20>, <0, 22, 7>, <0, 20, 19>, <22, 20, 23>, <12, 20, 17>, <12, 20, 1>, <27, 9, 11>, <27, 9, 13>, <8, 19, 20>, <8, 19, 13>, <21, 28, 18>, <29, 6, 24>, <3, 6, 15>, <3, 5, 11>, <3, 5, 4>, <11, 17, 12>, <7, 0, 22>, <7, 0, 20>, <7, 0, 16>, <1, 29, 6>, <1, 15, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [29].
