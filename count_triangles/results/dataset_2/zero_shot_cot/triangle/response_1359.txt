Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 19) (17, 16) (17, 8) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 15) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 15) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 15) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 11) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 13) (3, 9) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 18) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 2) (16, 17) (16, 5) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 15) (2, 19) (2, 9) (15, 4) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 9) (5, 12) (5, 16) (5, 18) (18, 11) (18, 5) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [28].
The unique triangles found are <1, 6, 11>, <4, 8, 13>, <4, 8, 15>, <4, 13, 6>, <5, 12, 14>, <5, 16, 18>, <8, 1, 6>, <8, 1, 7>, <8, 4, 13>, <8, 4, 15>, <8, 17, 16>, <9, 2, 19>, <9, 3, 15>, <9, 3, 2>, <9, 15, 4>, <10, 13, 6>, <10, 19, 11>, <12, 1, 7>, <12, 1, 14>, <12, 5, 16>, <12, 5, 18>, <12, 7, 1>, <14, 0, 15>, <14, 12, 7>, <14, 15, 19>, <16, 17, 8>, <16, 5, 18>.
