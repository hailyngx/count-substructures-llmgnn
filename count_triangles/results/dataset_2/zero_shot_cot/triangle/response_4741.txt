Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 10) (16, 6) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (15, 19) (15, 17) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 5) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 2) (5, 14) (9, 4) (2, 17) (2, 12) (18, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 0) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 17) (8, 7) (1, 10) (1, 13) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 19) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 13) 

Response:
There are 24 unique triangles in the given graph. 

The list of unique triangles is as follows:
<6, 13, 16>
<0, 7, 12>
<0, 7, 18>
<0, 12, 19>
<0, 12, 2>
<0, 19, 4>
<1, 10, 13>
<1, 10, 4>
<10, 13, 4>
<11, 16, 6>
<11, 13, 6>
<12, 13, 6>
<12, 14, 17>
<12, 2, 17>
<13, 12, 6>
<13, 1, 10>
<13, 1, 12>
<14, 17, 8>
<14, 5, 17>
<17, 14, 2>
<17, 15, 19>
<17, 2, 12>
<4, 10, 13>
<4, 19, 0>

So, the total number of triangles is [24].
