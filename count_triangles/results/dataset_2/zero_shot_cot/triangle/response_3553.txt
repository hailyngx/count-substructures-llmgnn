Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 13) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 2) (0, 3) (0, 10) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 10)
