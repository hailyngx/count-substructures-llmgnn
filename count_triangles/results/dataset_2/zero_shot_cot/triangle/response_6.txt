Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3)
