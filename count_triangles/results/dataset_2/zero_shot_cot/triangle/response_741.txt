Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 1) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 8) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 3) (14, 3) (12, 0) (12, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 12)
