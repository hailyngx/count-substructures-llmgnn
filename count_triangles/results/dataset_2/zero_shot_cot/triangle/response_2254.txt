Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 0) (16, 7) (6, 11) (6, 10) (6, 19) (9, 15) (9, 0) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 5) (17, 8) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 18) (3, 14) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 4) (2, 8) (18, 1) (18, 0) (18, 12) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 10) (5, 14) (5, 17) (5, 13) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 19) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 13) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 18) (0, 4) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 10) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 10) (15, 11) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 7) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 7)
