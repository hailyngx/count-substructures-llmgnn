Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
[<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 9>]
There are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
