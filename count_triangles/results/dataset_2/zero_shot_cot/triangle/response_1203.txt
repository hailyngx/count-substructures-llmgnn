Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 17) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 18) (14, 12) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 3) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 4) (18, 13) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 3) (13, 18) (13, 5) (13, 19) (1, 15) (1, 2) (17, 11) (17, 2) (15, 10) (15, 1) (15, 16) (15, 6) (8, 16) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 12) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 9) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 12) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 2) (7, 11) (6, 0) (6, 15) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 3) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 19) 

Response:
