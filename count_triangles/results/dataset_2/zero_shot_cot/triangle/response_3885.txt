Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 15) (16, 3) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 18) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 18) (2, 14) (2, 12) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 18) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 19) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 19) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 9) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 15) (10, 0) (10, 9) (6, 11) (9, 1) (9, 10) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of 20 unique triangles in the given graph. 

List of unique triangles:
<2, 12, 14>
<1, 13, 15>
<0, 7, 12>
<1, 5, 13>
<0, 7, 18>
<11, 13, 16>
<3, 8, 18>
<4, 8, 18>
<7, 12, 14>
<4, 5, 13>
<3, 8, 18>
<0, 10, 19>
<1, 9, 10>
<1, 9, 10>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 9, 10>
<0, 7, 12>
<1, 5, 13>
<0, 7, 12>
<11, 13, 16>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [20].
