Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 9) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 10) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 10) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13)
