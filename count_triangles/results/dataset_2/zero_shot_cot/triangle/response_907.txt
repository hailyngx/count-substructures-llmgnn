Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 19) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 18) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (2, 13) (2, 18) (2, 9) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 14) (7, 6) (7, 17) (12, 5) (12, 19) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 17) (14, 18) (14, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 15) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 19) (19, 1) (19, 12) (19, 5) (16, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 14) (17, 3) (17, 7) (17, 0) (15, 13) (15, 4)
