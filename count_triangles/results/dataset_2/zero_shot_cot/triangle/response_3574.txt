Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 24) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (10, 17) (10, 3) (11, 6) (11, 20) (26, 13) (26, 15) (26, 16) (0, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 22) (13, 26) (13, 29) (13, 7) (4, 21) (27, 28) (27, 6) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (25, 15) (25, 18) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 22) (19, 21) (22, 8) (22, 19) (22, 6) (16, 14) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 5) (24, 1) (24, 16) (24, 23) (24, 20) (7, 13) (7, 9) (7, 29) (7, 6) (29, 13) (29, 7) (29, 12) (15, 26) (15, 0) (15, 25) (15, 28) (5, 8) (5, 16) (5, 18) (6, 11) (6, 27) (6, 22) (6, 7) (21, 4) (21, 19) (18, 25) (18, 5) (18, 12) (20, 11) (20, 24) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 29) (12, 18) (28, 27) (28, 15) (23, 24) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step by step.

1. Firstly, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
- (14, 0, 15)
- (14, 0, 12)
- (0, 12, 18)
- (0, 12, 29)
- (1, 2, 17)
- (1, 3, 10)
- (1, 3, 9)
- (2, 8, 22)
- (2, 8, 5)
- (2, 19, 21)
- (3, 9, 7)
- (6, 7, 11)
- (6, 7, 22)
- (6, 11, 20)
- (7, 13, 29)
- (12, 17, 10)
- (12, 18, 25)
- (15, 26, 16)
- (15, 26, 25)
- (16, 26, 24)
- (18, 25, 15)

2. Count the total number of unique triangles:
- <14, 0, 15>
- <14, 0, 12>
- <0, 12, 18>
- <0, 12, 29>
- <1, 2, 17>
- <1, 3, 10>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <2, 8, 22>
- <2, 8, 5>
- <2, 19, 21>
- <3, 9, 7>
- <6, 7, 11>
- <6, 7, 22>
- <6, 11, 20>
- <7, 13, 29>
- <12, 17, 10>
- <12, 18, 25>
- <15, 26, 16>
- <15, 26, 25>
- <16, 26, 24>
- <18, 25, 15>

3. Now, we determine the total number of triangles in brackets []:
[21] 

Therefore, there are 21 triangles in the given graph.
