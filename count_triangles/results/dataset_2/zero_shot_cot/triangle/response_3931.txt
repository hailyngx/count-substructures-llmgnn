Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in this graph by finding nodes that have edges connecting them in a triangular pattern. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <5, 1, 9>
2. <5, 1, 8>
3. <5, 0, 9>
4. <5, 0, 3>
5. <9, 4, 0>
6. <9, 7, 8>
7. <4, 6, 2>
8. <6, 2, 1>
9. <6, 2, 8>
10. <3, 7, 0>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in this graph. 

The total number of triangles in this graph is: [10]
