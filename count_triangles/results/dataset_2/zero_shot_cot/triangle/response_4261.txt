Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 10) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 10) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 11) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 11) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 11)
