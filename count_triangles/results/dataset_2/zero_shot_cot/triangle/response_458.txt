The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 19) (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 14) (18, 22) (18, 6) (18, 12) (20, 23) (20, 28) (25, 13) (25, 26) (25, 23) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 1) (2, 12) (2, 26) (2, 15) (8, 21) (8, 6) (8, 3) (26, 25) (26, 2) (7, 17) (15, 16) (15, 2) (15, 6) (15, 5) (9, 23) (29, 5) (29, 21) (3, 8) (3, 21) (3, 6) (21, 8) (21, 29) (21, 3) (21, 24) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 18) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 3) (6, 1) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 2) (19, 22) (19, 24) (19, 27) (10, 27) (27, 19) (27, 10) (27, 17) (14, 16) (14, 1) (4, 11) (4, 23) (17, 7) (17, 27) (17, 28) (17, 5) (28, 20) (28, 17) (28, 24) (28, 5) (24, 21) (24, 19) (24, 28) (23, 20) (23, 25) (23, 9) (23, 4) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 29) (5, 17) (5, 28) 

Response:
Let's first locate all the triangles in the given graph:
1. (11, 16, 0)
2. (11, 16, 12)
3. (11, 16, 14)
4. (11, 4, 23)
5. (16, 0, 12)
6. (16, 12, 2)
7. (16, 15, 2)
8. (18, 22, 19)
9. (18, 22, 12)
10. (18, 12, 2)
11. (25, 13, 26)
12. (25, 13, 23)
13. (25, 26, 2)
14. (0, 12, 2)
15. (8, 21, 3)
16. (8, 6, 15)
17. (8, 6, 1)
18. (21, 24, 19)
19. (1, 6, 12)
20. (1, 6, 14)
21. (12, 18, 2)
22. (19, 24, 27)
23. (17, 5, 28)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [23]. 
The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<11, 16, 0>, <11, 16, 12>, <11, 16, 14>, <11, 4, 23>, <16, 0, 12>, <16, 12, 2>, <16, 15, 2>, <18, 22, 19>, <18, 22, 12>, <18, 12, 2>, <25, 13, 26>, <25, 13, 23>, <25, 26, 2>, <0, 12, 2>, <8, 21, 3>, <8, 6, 15>, <8, 6, 1>, <21, 24, 19>, <1, 6, 12>, <1, 6, 14>, <12, 18, 2>, <19, 24, 27>, <17, 5, 28>
