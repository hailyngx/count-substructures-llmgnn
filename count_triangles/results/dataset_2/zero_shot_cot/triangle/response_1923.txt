Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 15) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 10) (17, 11) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 16) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 15) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 19) (7, 9) (7, 15) (7, 16) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 7) (18, 12) (18, 0) (19, 6) (19, 12) (14, 4) (14, 11) (0, 6) (0, 18) (2, 13) (2, 11) 

Response:

<9, 6, 4>
<9, 6, 17>
<9, 6, 0>
<6, 17, 10>
<6, 17, 8>
<6, 17, 11>
<6, 17, 3>
<8, 13, 4>
<13, 4, 14>
<15, 1, 7>
