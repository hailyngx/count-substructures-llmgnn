Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (10, 4) (10, 0) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 12) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 12) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 2) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 3) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:  
<0, 8, 14>  
<1, 4, 11>  
<1, 2, 13>  
<3, 4, 12>  
<5, 9, 12>  

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
