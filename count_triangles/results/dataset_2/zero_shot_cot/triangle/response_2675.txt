Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (2, 9) (2, 11) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 11) (1, 9) (1, 17) (17, 1) (17, 5) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 5) (15, 8) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 5) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 16) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 5) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 16) (12, 13) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 18) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 19) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 18) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 13) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 14)
