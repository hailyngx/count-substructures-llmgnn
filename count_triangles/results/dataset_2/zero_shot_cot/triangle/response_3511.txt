Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 17) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 16) (13, 5) (13, 3) (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 9) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 19) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 12) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 11) (16, 8) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 3) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 11) (14, 3) (12, 18) (12, 0) (3, 13) (3, 16) (3, 14) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph.

Given that the graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can directly calculate the total number of triangles using the formula for counting triangles in a simple graph:

Total triangles = 1/6 * Σ(degree of each node)^2 - Σ(number of triangles with 2 edges adjacent to the same node)

Calculating for each node's degree:
- Node 0: 4 edges
- Node 1: 4 edges
- Node 2: 4 edges
- Node 3: 3 edges
- Node 4: 2 edges
- Node 5: 3 edges
- Node 6: 2 edges
- Node 7: 2 edges
- Node 8: 3 edges
- Node 9: 3 edges
- Node 10: 2 edges
- Node 11: 3 edges
- Node 12: 2 edges
- Node 13: 2 edges
- Node 14: 4 edges
- Node 15: 3 edges
- Node 16: 4 edges
- Node 17: 4 edges
- Node 18: 2 edges
- Node 19: 3 edges

Using the formula above, we get:
Total triangles = 1/6 * (4^2 + 4^2 + 4^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 4^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 + 3^2) - (7)

Total triangles = 1/6 * (16 + 16 + 16 + 9 + 4 + 9 + 4 + 4 + 9 + 9 + 4 + 9 + 4 + 4 + 16 + 9 + 16 + 16 + 4 + 9) - 7

Total triangles = 1/6 * 181 - 7

Total triangles = 30 - 7

Total triangles = 23

Therefore, there are a total of 23 triangles in the graph.

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 16>, <0, 2, 16>, <0, 2, 16>, <0, 12, 16>, <2, 8, 14>, <2, 8, 16>, <2, 1, 9>, <2, 1, 15>, <2, 1, 15>, <3, 14, 16>, <4, 1, 9>, <5, 13, 19>, <7, 10, 17>, <7, 11, 17>, <14, 11, 17>, <14, 11, 17>, <14, 11, 17>, <15, 14, 19>, <16, 3, 14>, <16, 3, 14>, <16, 3, 14>, <16, 8, 14>, <17, 10, 11>.

Hence, the answer is [23].
