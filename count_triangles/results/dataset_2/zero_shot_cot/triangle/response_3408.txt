Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 15 total triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<5, 4, 9>
<5, 4, 0>
<5, 4, 3>
<5, 9, 1>
<5, 9, 3>
<5, 9, 6>
<5, 9, 8>
<5, 0, 7>
<5, 0, 8>
<9, 4, 6>
<9, 4, 1>
<9, 4, 7>
<9, 8, 1>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7> 

So, the total number of triangles is [15].
