Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 8) (14, 16) (14, 10) (17, 13) (1, 3) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 16) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 15) (12, 8) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 10) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (15, 12) (15, 10) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 15) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 11) (18, 9) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 2) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 2) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 4) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 11) (16, 14) (16, 3) (16, 9)
