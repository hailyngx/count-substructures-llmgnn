Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 15) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 3) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 17) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (15, 13) (15, 0) (15, 10) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 15) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 12) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 18) (17, 4) (17, 0) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 16) (19, 2) (19, 14) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 11) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 16) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 14) 

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in the given graph. 
A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. 
Let's list down the unique triangles found in the graph:

<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 8, 11>
<1, 9, 11>
<2, 10, 15>
<4, 8, 5>
<4, 8, 18>
<4, 8, 16>
<4, 16, 17>
<4, 16, 2>
<4, 16, 14>
<9, 10, 5>
<9, 10, 15>
<9, 12, 5>
<9, 12, 13>
<9, 12, 11>
<10, 5, 15>
<10, 5, 12>
<12, 13, 11>
<14, 16, 2>
<14, 16, 19>
<14, 16, 4>
<14, 18, 4>
<14, 18, 19>
<14, 18, 3>
<16, 2, 19>
<16, 4, 17>
<16, 4, 18>
<16, 14, 19>
<17, 0, 4>
<17, 0, 15>
<17, 4, 18>
<18, 3, 14>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph. 

As we have 34 unique triangles listed, the total number of triangles in the given graph is found to be [34].
