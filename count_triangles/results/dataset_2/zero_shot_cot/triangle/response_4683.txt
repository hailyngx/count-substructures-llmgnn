Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 10) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 5) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 10) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].

Unique triangles found in the graph are:

<1, 5, 14>
<1, 9, 0>
<1, 9, 8>
<7, 11, 14>
<7, 11, 5>
<3, 5, 12>
<3, 5, 10>
