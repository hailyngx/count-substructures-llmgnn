Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 19) (9, 18) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 15) (2, 3) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 15) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 19) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (7, 1) (19, 6) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 17) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 17) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 1) (17, 8) (17, 19) (17, 15)
