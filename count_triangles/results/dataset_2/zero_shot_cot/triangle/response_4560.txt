Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 12) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 11) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 14)
