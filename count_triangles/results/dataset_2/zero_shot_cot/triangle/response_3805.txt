Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (22, 9) (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 23) (16, 20) (18, 16) (18, 23) (18, 20) (18, 1) (10, 11) (10, 26) (10, 4) (1, 18) (1, 25) (26, 10) (26, 28) (26, 8) (17, 29) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 4) (29, 17) (29, 28) (29, 5) (28, 26) (28, 29) (28, 27) (9, 22) (9, 17) (9, 2) (6, 21) (6, 7) (21, 6) (21, 12) (21, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 0) (20, 16) (20, 18) (20, 19) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 25) (15, 14) (15, 19) (19, 20) (19, 15) (19, 3) (19, 12) (23, 16) (23, 18) (3, 19) (3, 24) (3, 5) (3, 8) (24, 3) (24, 8) (24, 12) (8, 26) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 24) (8, 27) (2, 9) (2, 27) (25, 1) (25, 14) (12, 13) (12, 21) (12, 19) (12, 24) (27, 28) (27, 8) (27, 2) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 29) (5, 21) (5, 3) (4, 10) (4, 17) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<8, 3, 24>
<11, 16, 18>
<5, 17, 29> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
