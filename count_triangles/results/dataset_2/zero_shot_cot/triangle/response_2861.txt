Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 18) (5, 17) (9, 11) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 3) (13, 14) (13, 6) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 10) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 2) (0, 16) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 19) (2, 15) (2, 4) (12, 0) (12, 19) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 12) (19, 4) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 7) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 4) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 17) (7, 14) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 6) (18, 16) (18, 0)
