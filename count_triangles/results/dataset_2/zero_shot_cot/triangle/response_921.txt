Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 26) (3, 22) (25, 0) (25, 10) (10, 25) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 29) (11, 10) (11, 13) (8, 23) (8, 16) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 28) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 22) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 20) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 27) (18, 24) (19, 7) (19, 26) (19, 14) (19, 0) (26, 3) (26, 18) (26, 19) (15, 23) (15, 20) (15, 17) (20, 12) (20, 15) (20, 2) (21, 0) (21, 5) (21, 14) (2, 20) (2, 6) (2, 0) (22, 3) (22, 7) (22, 17) (17, 15) (17, 22) (9, 28) (9, 14) (9, 0) (5, 21) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 29) (6, 16) (0, 25) (0, 19) (0, 21) (0, 2) (0, 9) (29, 10) (29, 6) (29, 13) (27, 18) (27, 16) (28, 23) (28, 9) (28, 13) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 27) (13, 11) (13, 29) (13, 28) (13, 24) (1, 10) (1, 24) (24, 23) (24, 18) (24, 13) (24, 1) (14, 19) (14, 21) (14, 9) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. 

These triangles are: 
<10, 11, 13>
<7, 12, 20>
<0, 19, 21>
<6, 16, 27>
<18, 24, 27>
<9, 14, 28>

So, the total number of triangles is [6].
