Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (5, 6) (5, 11) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 11) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 10) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 2) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 13)
