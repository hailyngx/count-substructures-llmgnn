Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 14) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 6) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 0) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 12)
