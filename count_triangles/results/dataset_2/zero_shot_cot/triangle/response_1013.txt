Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
We will find the triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. Check each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle.
2. Count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 4, 5> (Triangle 1)
2. <0, 1, 4> (Triangle 2)
3. <0, 1, 9> (Triangle 3)
4. <0, 4, 9> (Triangle 4)
5. <3, 4, 7> (Triangle 5)
6. <3, 4, 8> (Triangle 6)
7. <4, 7, 8> (Triangle 7)
8. <5, 8, 9> (Triangle 8)
9. <6, 7, 9> (Triangle 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
