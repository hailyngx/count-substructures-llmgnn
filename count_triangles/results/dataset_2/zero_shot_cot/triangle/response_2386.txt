Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [18].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 2>, <1, 2, 0>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 0, 5>, <4, 5, 0>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 3>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 2>, <4, 8, 2>, <4, 8, 7>, <5, 0, 3>, <5, 3, 7>.
