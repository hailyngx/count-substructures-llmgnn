Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (10, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The unique triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 8, 14>
<2, 7, 14>
<3, 4, 9>
<8, 12, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
