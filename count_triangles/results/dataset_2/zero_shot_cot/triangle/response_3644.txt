Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 18) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 7) (18, 8) (0, 17) (0, 9) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 19) (5, 3) (5, 10) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 15) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 7) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 9) (7, 2) (7, 15) (7, 16) (16, 12) (16, 7) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 12) (19, 1) (19, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 19) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 17 and 9.
2. Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 17, 4, and 6.
3. Node 2 forms triangles with nodes 8 and 10.
4. Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 2 and 5.
5. Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 8, 12, and 1.
6. Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 10 and 13.
7. Node 6 forms triangles with nodes 14, 17, 1, and 12.
8. Node 7 forms triangles with nodes 2, 15, and 16.
9. Node 8 forms triangles with nodes 2 and 10.
10. Node 9 forms triangles with nodes 14, 0, 12, and 19.
11. Node 10 forms triangles with nodes 8, 2, 5, 13, and 15.
12. Node 12 forms triangles with nodes 4, 13, 6, 9, and 16.
13. Node 13 forms triangles with nodes 12, 15, and 10.
14. Node 14 forms triangles with nodes 17 and 9.
15. Node 15 forms triangles with nodes 7 and 13.
16. Node 16 forms triangles with nodes 12 and 7.
17. Node 17 forms a triangle with node 14.
18. Node 19 forms a triangle with node 1 and 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 21.
