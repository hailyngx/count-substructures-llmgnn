Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 8) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 14)
