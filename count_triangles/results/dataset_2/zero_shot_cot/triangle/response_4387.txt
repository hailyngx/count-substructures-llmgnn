Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 6) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 9) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 5) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 1) 

Response:
There are four triangles present in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<3, 7, 10>
<0, 9, 14>
<2, 6, 10>
<1, 5, 11>
So, the total number of triangles is [4].
