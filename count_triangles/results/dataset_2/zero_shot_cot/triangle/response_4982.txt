Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. 

Unique triangles are: 
<5, 9, 6>
<5, 9, 2>
<5, 9, 0>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 2, 0>
<9, 6, 4>
<9, 2, 0>
<6, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 7> 

So, the total number of triangles is [9].
