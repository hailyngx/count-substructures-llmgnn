Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 5) (2, 7) (2, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 12) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 12) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are <6, 9, 10>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 8, 13>, <6, 10, 9>, <4, 7, 1>, <7, 8, 13>, <7, 5, 12>, <8, 13, 2>, and <10, 5, 12>.
