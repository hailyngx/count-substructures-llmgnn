Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 12) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 1) (4, 2) (4, 1) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 14) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 9, 14>
<1, 12, 13>
<1, 4, 9>
<6, 12, 13>
<7, 9, 14>
<8, 12, 13>
