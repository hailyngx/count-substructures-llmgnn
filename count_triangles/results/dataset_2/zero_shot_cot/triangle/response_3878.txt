Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 25) (7, 2) (21, 7) (21, 15) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 19) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 14) (23, 8) (23, 2) (28, 17) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 5) (29, 28) (29, 24) (29, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 23) (2, 13) (13, 2) (13, 26) (13, 11) (26, 10) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 20) (24, 29) (24, 26) (24, 12) (4, 16) (4, 15) (27, 22) (16, 28) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 9) (25, 7) (25, 19) (25, 6) (12, 24) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 15) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 25) (19, 18) (0, 16) (0, 9) (3, 14) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 20) (20, 26) (20, 14) (20, 22) (20, 9) (22, 27) (22, 20) (22, 6) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 20) (1, 10) (1, 14) (5, 28) (5, 18) (5, 15) (6, 25) (6, 22) (6, 11) (15, 21) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 5) (11, 29) (11, 13) (11, 6) 

Response:
In order to find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to check each set of three nodes to see if they form a triangle.

There are 6 triangles in the given graph, and they are as follows:
1. <7, 21, 15>
2. <10, 17, 19>
3. <28, 29, 11>
4. <2, 8, 23>
5. <2, 13, 26>
6. <16, 0, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
