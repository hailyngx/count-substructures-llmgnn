Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 9) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 1) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 9) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<2, 12, 13>
<4, 6, 14>
<4, 9, 14>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 0, 14>
<5, 7, 10>
<6, 7, 12>
<6, 8, 14>
<6, 9, 13>
<7, 9, 13>
<8, 9, 13>
<12, 9, 13>
