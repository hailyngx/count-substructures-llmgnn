Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 19) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 17) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (5, 19) (5, 14) (19, 9) (19, 5) (19, 3) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 18) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 2) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 15) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (3, 19) (3, 0) (3, 18) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 0) (16, 17) (16, 10) (1, 4) (1, 2) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 1) (15, 9) (15, 4) (14, 7) (14, 5) (18, 13) (18, 3) (10, 7) (10, 16) (10, 8) (8, 6) (8, 10) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [14].
The unique triangles found are <0, 9, 11>, <4, 12, 13>, <7, 10, 16>, <3, 18, 19>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 13>, <7, 12, 14>, <2, 13, 17>, <8, 10, 16>, <6, 8, 10>, <6, 9, 11>, <15, 4, 9>, <2, 1, 4>, <5, 14, 19>.
