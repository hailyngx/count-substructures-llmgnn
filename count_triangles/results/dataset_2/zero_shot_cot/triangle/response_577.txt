Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 27) (4, 22) (4, 29) (7, 0) (7, 29) (7, 20) (7, 14) (10, 21) (10, 14) (17, 22) (17, 18) (0, 7) (0, 20) (0, 5) (20, 7) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 5) (24, 26) (24, 1) (24, 19) (24, 2) (26, 24) (26, 2) (26, 25) (27, 4) (27, 25) (16, 1) (16, 25) (28, 22) (28, 2) (28, 23) (21, 10) (21, 9) (21, 14) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 16) (25, 13) (25, 29) (22, 4) (22, 17) (22, 28) (2, 24) (2, 26) (2, 28) (2, 6) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 9) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 13) (19, 24) (19, 15) (19, 9) (5, 0) (5, 20) (23, 28) (23, 29) (3, 20) (29, 4) (29, 7) (29, 25) (29, 23) (29, 14) (9, 21) (9, 12) (9, 19) (9, 11) (1, 24) (1, 16) (1, 18) (13, 25) (13, 15) (13, 11) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 6) (11, 12) (11, 9) (11, 13) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 18) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 21) (14, 29) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify triangles:
- Look for nodes that form a triangle when connected by edges.
- For example, if node A is connected to node B, node B is connected to node C, and node C is connected back to node A, then nodes A, B, and C form a triangle.

2. Count the number of triangles:
- Based on the given graph, we will identify the triangles and determine the total count.

Now, let's identify the unique triangles:

- <7, 0, 20>
- <7, 14, 29>
- <10, 14, 21>
- <24, 26, 25>
- <1, 16, 25>
- <2, 26, 28>
- <9, 12, 15>
- <9, 11, 13>
- <6, 15, 18>
- <4, 22, 28>
- <4, 29, 7>
- <5, 20, 0>
- <11, 13, 15>
- <1, 18, 24>
- <17, 18, 1>
- <20, 3, 5>
- <24, 2, 26>
- <25, 27, 4>
- <7, 29, 25>
- <16, 25, 13>
- <21, 9, 12>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
