Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 1) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 9) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [6]. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 4, 11>
<1, 5, 13>
<7, 9, 14>
<8, 10, 12>
<8, 10, 14>
<8, 12, 0>
