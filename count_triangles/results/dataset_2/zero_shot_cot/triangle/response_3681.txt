Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 2) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 9) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 14) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 1) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 10) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 1) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 10) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 8, 13>
<1, 8, 14>
<1, 13, 14>
<2, 6, 14>
<2, 11, 13>
<4, 8, 10>
<4, 8, 11>
<11, 13, 14>
