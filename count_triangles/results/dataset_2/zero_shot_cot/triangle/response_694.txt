Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 11) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 12) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
There are 23 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: <0, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 11>, <1, 4, 14>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 9, 4>, <5, 11, 2>, <6, 12, 11>, <7, 13, 3>, <7, 6, 11>, <8, 6, 12>, <8, 1, 14>, <9, 3, 4>, <9, 4, 5>, <10, 12, 1>, <10, 12, 8>, <11, 2, 5>, <11, 5, 4>, <11, 6, 7>, <11, 12, 6>, <13, 7, 3>, <13, 7, 9>, <13, 8, 1>
