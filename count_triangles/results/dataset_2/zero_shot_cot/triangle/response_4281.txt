Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in terms of adjacency list format: 

0: 1, 3, 8, 2, 7
1: 0, 3, 8
2: 9, 0, 7
3: 6, 9, 1, 0, 5, 8
4: 5
5: 6, 3, 4, 7
6: 9, 5, 7, 3, 8
7: 6, 9, 5, 0, 2
8: 6, 1, 3, 0
9: 6, 2, 3, 7

Next, let's calculate the number of triangles and list them:

[10]

<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
