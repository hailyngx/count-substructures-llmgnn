Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented by the following adjacency list:

0: 5, 9, 7, 1, 3, 6
1: 9, 3, 0, 8
2: 5, 6, 8
3: 4, 7, 1, 0
4: 5, 9, 6, 3
5: 6, 2, 8, 4, 0
6: 5, 4, 2, 0
7: 0, 3
8: 9, 1, 2, 5
9: 8, 4, 1, 0

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph.

[Answer: Total number of triangles in the graph is 6]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
