Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 14) (5, 8) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (3, 7) (3, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 13) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is:

[<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 3>, <9, 11, 13>, <9, 11, 14>, <9, 13, 14>, <1, 10, 13>, <1, 10, 12>, <1, 12, 7>]
