Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 17) (26, 10) (26, 2) (26, 17) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 5) (21, 7) (21, 15) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 11) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 25) (6, 23) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 29) (10, 26) (10, 8) (10, 20) (15, 21) (15, 5) (15, 4) (23, 5) (23, 6) (23, 11) (23, 25) (2, 26) (2, 22) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 1) (18, 9) (18, 19) (18, 0) (18, 12) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 20) (25, 6) (25, 23) (25, 27) (25, 29) (27, 25) (27, 16) (12, 18) (12, 17) (12, 28) (1, 22) (1, 29) (29, 11) (29, 25) (29, 1) (14, 22) (14, 8) (14, 20) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 13) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 28) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 4) (13, 28) (16, 27) (17, 9) (17, 26) (17, 19) (17, 12) (28, 12) (28, 4) (28, 13) (20, 10) (20, 19) (20, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of [30] triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are <5, 7, 11>, <6, 5, 23>, <6, 25, 23>, <10, 20, 14>, <11, 5, 7>, <11, 23, 5>, <11, 23, 25>, <11, 29, 25>, <13, 0, 4>, <13, 3, 4>, <13, 28, 4>, <15, 5, 21>, <17, 12, 18>, <17, 19, 18>, <17, 26, 19>, <22, 1, 29>, <22, 2, 26>, <22, 8, 14>, <25, 27, 16>.
