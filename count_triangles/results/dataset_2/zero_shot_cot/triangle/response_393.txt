Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 3) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 5) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 2) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 5)
