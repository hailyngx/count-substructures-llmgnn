Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 15) (13, 0) (1, 17) (1, 18) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (15, 13) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 18) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 2) (7, 19) (7, 18) (0, 13) (0, 3) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 10) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 2) (9, 16) (9, 14) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 5) (5, 3) (5, 10) (18, 1) (18, 15) (18, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [18].
The unique triangles found are <2, 4, 16>, <2, 12, 16>, <2, 12, 13>, <2, 4, 13>, <2, 13, 16>, <1, 17, 15>, <0, 3, 13>, <0, 3, 17>, <0, 13, 15>, <6, 8, 14>, <6, 10, 14>, <6, 10, 5>, <1, 17, 18>, <7, 18, 19>, <1, 15, 18>, <3, 5, 10>, <8, 12, 13>, <8, 14, 9>.
