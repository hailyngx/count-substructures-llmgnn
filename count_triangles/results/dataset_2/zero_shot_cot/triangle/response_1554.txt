Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 10) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 10) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (11, 0) (11, 9) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 10) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 3)
