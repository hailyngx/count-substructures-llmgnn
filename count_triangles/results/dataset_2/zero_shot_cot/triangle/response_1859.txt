Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node is part of. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

- Node 0: <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>
- Node 1: <1, 6, 2>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 7>
- Node 2: <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 7, 8>
- Node 3: <3, 7, 1>
- Node 4: <4, 1, 9>, <4, 1, 7>, <4, 7, 9>
- Node 5: <5, 6, 7>
- Node 6: <6, 1, 2>, <6, 1, 7>
- Node 7: <7, 1, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [(number of unique triangles) = 13].
