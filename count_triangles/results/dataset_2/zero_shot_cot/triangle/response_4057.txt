Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 15) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 8) (17, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 10) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (15, 14) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 18) (16, 15) (16, 18) (16, 4) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 1) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 7) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 16) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 3) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 4) (12, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (4, 17) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 2)
