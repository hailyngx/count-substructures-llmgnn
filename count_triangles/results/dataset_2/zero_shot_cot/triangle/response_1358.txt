Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

Here are the unique triangles found:
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 0>
<4, 6, 9>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 2>

So, the total number of triangles is [8].
