Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (6, 7) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 13) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [7].

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 5, 7>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 12, 14>
<1, 13, 14>
<1, 8, 14>
<1, 10, 14>
<9, 12, 13>
