Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
[<0, 5, 9>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 8>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 0>, <2, 7, 0>, <3, 1, 7>]
