Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2)
