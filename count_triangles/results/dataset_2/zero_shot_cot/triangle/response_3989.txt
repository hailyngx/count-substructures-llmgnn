Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 14) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 12) (0, 7) (0, 9) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 1) (10, 15) (10, 16) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 9) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 13) (18, 19) (11, 19) (11, 2) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 16) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 2) (2, 11) (2, 16) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 13) (1, 19) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 1)
