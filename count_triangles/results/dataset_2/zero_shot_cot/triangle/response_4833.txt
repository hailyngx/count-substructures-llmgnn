Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 5) (13, 19) (13, 14) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 4) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 17) (17, 2) (17, 12) (17, 4) (17, 7) (8, 15) (8, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 17) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 4) (0, 12) (9, 2) (9, 16) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 18) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 4) (16, 9) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 10) (18, 3) (18, 12)
