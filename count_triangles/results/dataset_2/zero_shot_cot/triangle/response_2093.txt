Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 17) (4, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 14) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 12) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 19) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 1) (10, 15) (10, 19) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 1) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 18) (18, 15) (18, 9) (18, 12) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 16) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (1, 7) (1, 19) (1, 16)
