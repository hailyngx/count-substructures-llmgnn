Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 12) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 4) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 4) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 0) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 4) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 12) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 1) 

Response:
