Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 12 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are as follows: 
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 4>
<6, 4, 0>
<6, 8, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [12].
