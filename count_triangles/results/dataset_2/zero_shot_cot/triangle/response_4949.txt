Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
Number of triangles: [18]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 0>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 1, 4>, <3, 9, 4>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 8, 5>, <4, 8, 6>, <4, 0, 6>, <5, 4, 8>, <6, 8, 9>
