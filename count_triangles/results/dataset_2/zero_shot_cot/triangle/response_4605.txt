Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<3, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
