Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 1) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 1) (10, 13) (10, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 11)
