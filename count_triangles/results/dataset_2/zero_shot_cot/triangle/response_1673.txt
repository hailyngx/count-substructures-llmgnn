Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are:

<0, 1, 4>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<3, 1, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 1, 6>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
