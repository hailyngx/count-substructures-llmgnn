Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 2) (15, 8) (14, 17) (14, 0) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 11) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 6) (13, 8) (10, 17) (10, 19) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 19) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 11) (12, 9) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 19) (4, 1) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 16) (19, 10) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 9) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 18) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 18) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 19) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 5)
