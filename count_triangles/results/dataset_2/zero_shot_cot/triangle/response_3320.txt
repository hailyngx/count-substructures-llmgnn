Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 13) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 10) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14)
