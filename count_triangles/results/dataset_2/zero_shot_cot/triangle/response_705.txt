Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 16) (15, 14) (15, 4) (2, 16) (2, 11) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 18) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (10, 5) (4, 15) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (6, 1) (6, 16) (6, 0) (16, 3) (16, 2) (16, 6) (9, 13) (9, 12) (18, 8) (18, 17) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 1) (19, 4) (19, 14) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 11) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 0) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 19) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) 

Response:
The total number of triangles [] found in the given graph is  **<0, 11, 12> <0, 6, 12> <1, 6, 7> <4, 12, 19> <5, 7, 13> <7, 13, 17> <7, 13, 19>**.
