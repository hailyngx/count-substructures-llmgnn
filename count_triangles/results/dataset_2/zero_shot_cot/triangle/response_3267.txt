Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's look for triangles formed by three connected nodes.

There are 2 triangles found in this graph:
<1, 5, 8>
<0, 2, 6>

So the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
