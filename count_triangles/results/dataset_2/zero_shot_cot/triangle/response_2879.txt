Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 3) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 9) 

Response:
We will count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 7, 14>
2. <0, 9, 14>
3. <0, 14, 1>
4. <1, 8, 14>
5. <1, 9, 14>
6. <2, 3, 6>
7. <2, 3, 7>
8. <2, 5, 6>
9. <2, 5, 7>
10. <2, 7, 11>
11. <2, 7, 13>
12. <3, 4, 6>
13. <4, 9, 10>
14. <4, 9, 13>
15. <6, 7, 11>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] triangles in the given graph.
