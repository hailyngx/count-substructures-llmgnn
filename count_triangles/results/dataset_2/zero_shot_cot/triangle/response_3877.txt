Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 15) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 15) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 3) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 14) (7, 15) (7, 13) (8, 18) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 13) (10, 15) (10, 3) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 18) (9, 2) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 18) (6, 2) (6, 13) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 1) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 10) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 13) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 6) (13, 12)
