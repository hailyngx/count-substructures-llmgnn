Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 0) (1, 8) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12)
