Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 2) (14, 8) (14, 12) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 12)
