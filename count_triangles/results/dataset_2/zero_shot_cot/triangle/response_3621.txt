Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 7>.
