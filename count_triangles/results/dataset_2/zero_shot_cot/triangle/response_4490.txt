Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 4) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 2) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 1) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14)
