Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 12) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 4) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 7) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 13) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
Number of triangles: [12]
Unique triangles: <0, 9, 12>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 10>, <1, 5, 12>, <2, 4, 14>, <3, 4, 10>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 10, 11>, <5, 6, 10>, <5, 12, 14>, <6, 7, 13>, <8, 9, 12>
