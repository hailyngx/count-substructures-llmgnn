Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 15) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 18) (9, 2) (9, 7) (3, 4) (7, 9) (7, 10) (6, 14) (6, 19) (6, 4) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 11) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 18) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 12) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 16) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 1) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 6) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 18) (15, 5) (15, 13) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 0) (16, 14) (16, 10) (12, 19) (12, 1) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 11) (18, 0) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 16) 

Response:
[<0, 11, 18>, <0, 15, 17>, <1, 2, 12>, <4, 6, 13>, <4, 6, 19>, <5, 10, 18>, <6, 14, 19>, <8, 14, 16>, <8, 15, 18>, <9, 2, 7>]
