Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 13) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 15) (17, 18) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (8, 14) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 0) (6, 5) (6, 15) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 19) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 16) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (2, 8) (2, 19) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 10) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 16) (19, 0) (19, 2) (12, 18) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 7) (7, 1) (7, 18) (7, 11) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 10) 

Response:
[<0, 11, 14>, <0, 11, 13>, <0, 13, 9>, <0, 14, 18>, <0, 14, 11>, <0, 14, 13>, <1, 4, 18>, <1, 4, 15>, <1, 15, 17>, <3, 4, 13>, <4, 13, 18>, <10, 15, 17>, <10, 15, 6>, <10, 15, 1>, <10, 16, 9>, <10, 16, 4>, <10, 16, 15>, <13, 0, 9>, <14, 8, 2>, <14, 11, 0>]
[<0, 11, 14>, <0, 11, 13>, <0, 13, 9>, <0, 14, 18>, <0, 14, 11>, <0, 14, 13>, <1, 4, 18>, <1, 4, 15>, <1, 15, 17>, <3, 4, 13>, <4, 13, 18>, <10, 15, 17>, <10, 15, 6>, <10, 15, 1>, <10, 16, 9>, <10, 16, 4>, <10, 16, 15>, <13, 0, 9>, <14, 8, 2>, <14, 11, 0>]
There are [20] triangles in the graph.
