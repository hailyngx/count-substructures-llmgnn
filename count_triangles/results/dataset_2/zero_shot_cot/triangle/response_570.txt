Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 1) (11, 5) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 7) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 12) (10, 12) (10, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 12) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 10) 

Response:
Calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:
1. Find all triangles formed by each node:
- Node 8 forms triangles with nodes 0, 7, and 14.
- Node 13 forms triangles with nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 4 forms a triangle with node 9.
- Node 3 forms a triangle with node 5.
- Node 11 forms a triangle with node 1.
- Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 7 and 12.
- Node 1 forms a triangle with node 9.
- Node 6 forms a triangle with node 12.
- Node 0 forms a triangle with node 12.
- Node 10 forms a triangle with node 9.

2. Count the total number of triangles:
There are 10 unique triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [10]
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <1, 6, 12>, <0, 8, 14>, <3, 5, 13>, <1, 9, 11>, <4, 6, 12>, <4, 6, 1>, <0, 8, 7>, <9, 10, 12>, <4, 6, 0>, <3, 5, 7>.
