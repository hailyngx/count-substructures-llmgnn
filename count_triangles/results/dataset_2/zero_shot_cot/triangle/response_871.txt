Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 4) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 5) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 3) (10, 19) (10, 12) (10, 9) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 4) (16, 0) (16, 9) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 17) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 18) (6, 18) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 3) (17, 8) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 6) (17, 9) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 6) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 0) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 17) (12, 10) (12, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [20].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 11, 12>
<0, 4, 19>
<1, 15, 5>
<6, 7, 18>
<3, 13, 19>
<3, 6, 17>
<9, 16, 17>
<10, 12, 11>
<9, 10, 16>.
