Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 10) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9)
