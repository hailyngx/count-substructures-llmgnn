Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (0, 9) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

Unique triangles found in the graph are:
<5, 6, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
