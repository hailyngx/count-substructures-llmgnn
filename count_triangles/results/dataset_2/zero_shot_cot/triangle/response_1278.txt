Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 15) (0, 24) (0, 2) (27, 24) (27, 20) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 21) (22, 23) (22, 15) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 25) (23, 28) (2, 0) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 13) (18, 2) (18, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 17) (28, 23) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 4) (28, 10) (21, 3) (21, 28) (11, 17) (11, 29) (19, 5) (19, 24) (19, 13) (19, 20) (9, 2) (9, 29) (9, 10) (29, 11) (29, 9) (29, 25) (29, 4) (7, 18) (7, 16) (7, 15) (16, 7) (26, 23) (26, 8) (15, 0) (15, 22) (15, 7) (15, 25) (17, 6) (17, 11) (20, 27) (20, 19) (20, 14) (20, 10) (12, 8) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 14) (24, 0) (24, 27) (24, 19) (24, 25) (25, 23) (25, 29) (25, 15) (25, 24) (8, 1) (8, 26) (8, 12) (14, 20) (14, 13) (14, 10) (4, 5) (4, 28) (4, 29) (10, 28) (10, 9) (10, 20) (10, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [34].
Unique triangles found are <0, 2, 18>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 2, 13>, <1, 3, 21>, <1, 5, 19>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 9, 10>, <2, 13, 14>, <2, 18, 7>, <2, 18, 7>, <3, 21, 28>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 19>, <4, 5, 28>, <4, 5, 28>, <4, 28, 21>, <5, 6, 17>, <7, 15, 22>, <8, 12, 26>, <11, 17, 6>, <11, 17, 6>, <13, 14, 20>, <13, 19, 14>, <15, 22, 23>, <15, 22, 23>, <15, 23, 26>, <15, 23, 26>, <19, 20, 14>, <19, 24, 25>, <19, 24, 25>, <20, 14, 10>, <20, 14, 10>, <20, 24, 27>.
