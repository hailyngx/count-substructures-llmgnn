Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 4) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 2) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) 

Response:
There are a total of 18 triangles in the given graph. 

Here are the unique triangles found:
<1, 3, 12>
<1, 5, 14>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 11, 9>
<2, 4, 14>
<2, 5, 14>
<2, 5, 4>
<2, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 11>
<4, 6, 14>
<4, 5, 14>
<4, 5, 6>
<8, 6, 14>
<8, 6, 11>
<8, 6, 5>
<11, 6, 7>
<11, 6, 0>
<13, 8, 12> 

So, the total number of triangles is [18].
