Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2)
