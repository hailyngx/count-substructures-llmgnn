Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 8) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (15, 18) (15, 8) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 8) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 9) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 5) (6, 13) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 16) (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 6) (5, 3) (5, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 7) (14, 5) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 15) (8, 18) (16, 18) (16, 3) (16, 9)
