Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9)
