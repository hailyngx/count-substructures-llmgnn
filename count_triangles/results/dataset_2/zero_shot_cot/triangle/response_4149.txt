Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 20) (1, 2) (1, 7) (21, 10) (21, 17) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 3) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 28) (27, 20) (4, 27) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 16) (2, 1) (2, 12) (6, 28) (28, 27) (28, 6) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 20) (14, 0) (14, 15) (17, 21) (17, 29) (17, 23) (17, 11) (29, 17) (29, 7) (29, 5) (11, 28) (11, 17) (11, 24) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 26) (16, 8) (16, 28) (16, 13) (16, 26) (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 20) (22, 4) (22, 9) (22, 10) (13, 16) (13, 25) (13, 24) (26, 3) (26, 16) (10, 21) (10, 22) (10, 19) (10, 23) (12, 2) (24, 11) (24, 13) (24, 7) (24, 5) (7, 1) (7, 29) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 5) (15, 4) (15, 14) (15, 9) (15, 19) (19, 10) (19, 15) (25, 13) (20, 1) (20, 27) (20, 28) (20, 9) (20, 23) (5, 8) (5, 29) (5, 24) (5, 7) (23, 17) (23, 10) (23, 20) 

Response:
There are a total of 30 unique triangles in the given graph. 
The triangles are: 
<0, 14, 15>
<4, 8, 16>
<0, 3, 7>
<4, 8, 5>
<0, 14, 19>
<2, 1, 7>
<13, 16, 24>
<0, 14, 9>
<1, 20, 27>
<10, 22, 23>
<4, 15, 9>
<7, 5, 24>
<7, 3, 0>
<29, 5, 7>
<20, 23, 17>
<9, 15, 19>
<4, 15, 9>
<27, 0, 14>
<11, 17, 23>
<16, 8, 4>
<13, 24, 7>
<16, 8, 5>
<5, 29, 7>
<22, 10, 23>
<16, 13, 24>
<20, 1, 7>
<16, 28, 11>
<27, 4, 15>
<5, 24, 7>
<26, 16, 13>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [30].
