Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 25) (9, 15) (26, 24) (26, 15) (26, 11) (1, 21) (1, 11) (1, 28) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 20) (3, 2) (15, 9) (15, 26) (7, 22) (20, 21) (20, 25) (25, 9) (25, 20) (25, 0) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 24) (10, 23) (10, 29) (11, 26) (11, 1) (11, 10) (8, 1) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 28) (23, 10) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 17) (4, 8) (4, 23) (4, 22) (4, 19) (4, 24) (0, 25) (0, 14) (0, 24) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 16) (24, 26) (24, 10) (24, 4) (24, 0) (18, 5) (18, 17) (22, 7) (22, 4) (22, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 17) (12, 22) (12, 2) (12, 16) (28, 1) (28, 8) (28, 27) (16, 14) (16, 12) (16, 19) (29, 10) (29, 27) (6, 10) (6, 0) (27, 28) (27, 29) (27, 13) (13, 2) (13, 27) (13, 19) (19, 4) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 17) (5, 18) (17, 23) (17, 18) (17, 2) (17, 19) 

Response:
Let's count the triangles step-by-step:

1. Identify the triangles by looking for nodes that have edges connecting them in a cycle or loop.
2. Count the total number of triangles in the graph and list the unique triangles found.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [42] and the unique triangles found are:
