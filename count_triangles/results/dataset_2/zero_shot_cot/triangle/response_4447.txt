Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 28) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 1) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 23) (26, 3) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 5) (7, 12) (7, 22) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (3, 26) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 27) (4, 20) (4, 15) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 23) (25, 6) (25, 23) (28, 16) (28, 9) (28, 10) (9, 3) (9, 28) (9, 24) (29, 27) (29, 23) (10, 28) (10, 21) (10, 8) (10, 22) (21, 10) (21, 15) (21, 17) (5, 26) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 8) (23, 26) (23, 27) (23, 25) (23, 29) (19, 14) (22, 7) (22, 10) (22, 17) (6, 11) (6, 25) (6, 17) (17, 21) (17, 22) (17, 6) (17, 15) (8, 0) (8, 10) (8, 5) (20, 4) (20, 13) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 20) (13, 24) (24, 9) (24, 13) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 21) (15, 17) 

Response:
Let's determine the triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the vertices that form triangles:
  
There are several triangles evident from the given edges:
- Triangle 1: vertices 1, 2, and 18
- Triangle 2: vertices 1, 15, and 17
- Triangle 3: vertices 3, 4, and 15
- Triangle 4: vertices 3, 4, and 20
- Triangle 5: vertices 3, 9, and 24
- Triangle 6: vertices 5, 7, and 12
- Triangle 7: vertices 5, 8, and 10
- Triangle 8: vertices 13, 20, and 24
- Triangle 9: vertices 21, 22, and 17

2. Count the total number of triangles:

By counting the identified unique triangles, we have found 9 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [9]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 2, 18>, <1, 15, 17>, <3, 4, 15>, <3, 4, 20>, <3, 9, 24>, <5, 7, 12>, <5, 8, 10>, <13, 20, 24>, <17, 21, 22>.
