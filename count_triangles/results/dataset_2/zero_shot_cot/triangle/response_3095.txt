Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 16 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<5, 9, 2> 

So, the total number of triangles is [16].
