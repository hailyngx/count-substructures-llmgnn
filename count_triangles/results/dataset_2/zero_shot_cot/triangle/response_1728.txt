Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 18) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 0) (11, 6) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 15) (12, 7) (12, 15) (12, 3) (2, 18) (5, 6) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 3) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 3) (19, 15) (19, 14) (1, 4) (1, 6) (9, 13) (9, 18) (9, 3) (3, 12) (3, 18) (3, 0) (3, 9) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 19) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 16) (16, 17) (16, 14)
