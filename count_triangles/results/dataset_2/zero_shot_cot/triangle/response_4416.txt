Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0: <0, 3, 4>
2. Node 1: <1, 5, 7>
3. Node 2: <2, 4, 9>
4. Node 3: <3, 7, 8>
5. Node 4: <0, 3, 4>
6. Node 5: <1, 5, 7>
7. Node 6: <0, 1, 6>
8. Node 7: <1, 5, 7>
9. Node 8: <3, 6, 8>
10. Node 9: <2, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
