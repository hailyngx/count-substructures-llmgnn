Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 0) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (17, 10) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 0) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 13) (4, 13) (4, 1) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 1) (18, 3) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 16) (3, 7) (3, 18) (3, 11) (11, 3) (19, 0) (19, 16) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 18) (1, 16) (2, 9) (2, 5) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 16) (16, 18) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 1) (16, 15)
