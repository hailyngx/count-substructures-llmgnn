Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 11) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 6) 

Response:
Let's go step-by-step to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. First, identify the triangles in the graph based on the given edges.

The triangles are formed when three nodes are connected to each other. It is a triangle if each node is connected to the other two nodes.

- The possible triangles in the graph are: (5, 9, 14), (5, 2, 13), (4, 7, 12), (4, 1, 10), (7, 1, 8), (1, 3, 0), (3, 2, 10), (2, 8, 6), (0, 14, 13), (9, 11, 12), (7, 14, 0), (9, 12, 7), (2, 11, 3), (5, 13, 2), (8, 6, 11).

2. Count the number of unique triangles:

There are 15 unique triangles in the graph:

<5, 9, 14>, <5, 2, 13>, <4, 7, 12>, <4, 1, 10>, <7, 1, 8>, <1, 3, 0>, <3, 2, 10>, <2, 8, 6>, <0, 14, 13>, <9, 11, 12>, <7, 14, 0>, <9, 12, 7>, <2, 11, 3>, <5, 13, 2>, <8, 6, 11>.

3. Calculate the total number of triangles:

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
