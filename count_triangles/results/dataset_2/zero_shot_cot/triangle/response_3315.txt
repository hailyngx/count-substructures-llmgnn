Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 14) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 10) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [4].

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 2, 7>
<4, 8, 14>
<4, 5, 8>
<11, 13, 12>
