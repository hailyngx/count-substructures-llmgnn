Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 12) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 11) (8, 18) (0, 5) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 18) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 7) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 16) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 16) (4, 9) (4, 11) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 11) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 16) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 7) (16, 18) (18, 3) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 16) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 12)
