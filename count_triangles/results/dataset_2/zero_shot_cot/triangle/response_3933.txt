Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (15, 3) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 19) (4, 15) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 19) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (18, 19) (18, 5) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 17) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 13) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 16) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 18) (7, 10) (7, 2) (13, 14) (13, 16) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7)
