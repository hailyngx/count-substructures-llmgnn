Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 19) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 17) (1, 3) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (14, 3) (14, 16) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 15) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 19) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 14) (16, 12) (16, 18) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 19) (19, 9) (19, 6) (19, 2) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 6) (15, 18) (18, 16) (18, 15) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<9, 15, 17>
<4, 9, 11>
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 10, 2>
<3, 7, 17>
<3, 8, 10>
<6, 12, 16>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
