Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. 

Unique triangles found in the graph are:
<5, 9, 1>
<5, 9, 2>
<5, 9, 0>
<5, 4, 1>
<5, 4, 0>
<9, 4, 1>
<1, 4, 3>
<1, 3, 6>
<0, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
