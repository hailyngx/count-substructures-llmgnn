Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
[<0, 4, 5>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 8, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 9>]
