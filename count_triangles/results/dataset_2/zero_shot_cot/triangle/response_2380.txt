Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [8]. The unique triangles found in the graph are <1, 3, 9>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 1>, <3, 6, 8>, and <6, 7, 8>.
