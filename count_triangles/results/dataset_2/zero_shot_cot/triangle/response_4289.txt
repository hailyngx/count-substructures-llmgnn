Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 17) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 17) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 19) (7, 0) (7, 15) (5, 2) (5, 18) (19, 14) (19, 10) (19, 6) (1, 13) (1, 9) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 7) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 6) (6, 4) (6, 19) (6, 12) (6, 3) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 12) (10, 19) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 1) (9, 14) (9, 1) (3, 8) (3, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
The unique triangles found in the graph are:
