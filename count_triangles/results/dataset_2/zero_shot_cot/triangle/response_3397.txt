Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 1) (4, 8) (4, 14) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 5)
