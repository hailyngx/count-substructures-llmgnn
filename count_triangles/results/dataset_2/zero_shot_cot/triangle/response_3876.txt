Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 15) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 1) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 18) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 19) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 17) (15, 13) (15, 19) (4, 0) (4, 19) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 2) (19, 14) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 4)
