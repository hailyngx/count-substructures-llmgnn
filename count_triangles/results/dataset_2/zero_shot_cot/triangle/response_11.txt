Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (22, 28) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 29) (15, 20) (15, 6) (0, 27) (0, 7) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 9) (27, 16) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 21) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 18) (21, 2) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 29) (1, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (17, 25) (17, 23) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 28) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 20) (20, 15) (20, 8) (20, 11) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 18) (19, 26) (19, 11) (18, 21) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 10) (29, 3) (29, 1) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 28) (9, 27) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 23) (24, 25) (2, 21) (2, 11) (16, 27) (16, 9) (16, 6) (25, 27) (25, 17) (25, 24) (25, 23) (11, 20) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 2) (6, 15) (6, 14) (6, 16) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 28) (10, 18) (10, 12) (23, 3) (23, 7) (23, 17) (23, 9) (23, 25) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 5) (28, 12) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
The unique triangles found are: <3, 1, 29>, <3, 7, 23>, <3, 9, 27>, <5, 1, 13>, <5, 12, 28>, <7, 21, 23>, <8, 4, 18>, <8, 9, 20>, <9, 11, 20>, <9, 16, 27>, <11, 2, 21>, <11, 9, 20>, <15, 6, 16>, <25, 23, 27>.
