Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 10) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 11) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 11) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 1) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 12)
