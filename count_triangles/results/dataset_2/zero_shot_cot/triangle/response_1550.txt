Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 4) (16, 18) (16, 4) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (15, 18) (15, 17) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 18) (19, 11) (19, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 17) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (18, 16) (18, 15) (18, 8) (18, 5) (17, 15) (17, 8) (17, 5) (17, 12) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 17) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 0) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 14)
