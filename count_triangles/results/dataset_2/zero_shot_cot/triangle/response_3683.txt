Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 16) (21, 1) (21, 15) (21, 4) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 10) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 22) (17, 18) (2, 29) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 23) (29, 11) (6, 17) (6, 10) (9, 15) (9, 24) (0, 17) (0, 20) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 13) (20, 4) (20, 19) (28, 12) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 22) (19, 15) (26, 5) (26, 12) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 11) (4, 21) (4, 20) (4, 25) (12, 28) (12, 26) (7, 29) (7, 23) (7, 5) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 25) (5, 26) (5, 7) (5, 10) (11, 14) (11, 29) (11, 8) (11, 27) (22, 17) (22, 19) (22, 24) (15, 21) (15, 9) (15, 19) (13, 20) (13, 16) (3, 20) (3, 24) (3, 18) (24, 9) (24, 22) (24, 3) (24, 18) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 5) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 24) (18, 27) (23, 29) (23, 7) (23, 27) (27, 11) (27, 18) (27, 23) (25, 2) (25, 4) (25, 16) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [8]. 
The unique triangles found are <1, 21, 4>, <17, 6, 10>, <17, 11, 29>, <17, 18, 27>, <20, 4, 25>, <20, 8, 19>, <3, 18, 24>, <7, 23, 27>.
