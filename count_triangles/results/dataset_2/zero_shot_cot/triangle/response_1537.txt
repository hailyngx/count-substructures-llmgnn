Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the triangles found in the given graph:
<5, 9, 13>
<5, 9, 14>
<9, 8, 11>
<9, 8, 1>
<9, 13, 10>
<8, 7, 12>
<8, 11, 10>
<13, 10, 11>
<13, 1, 8>
<7, 12, 6>
<7, 2, 12>
<12, 6, 14>
<12, 6, 2>
<12, 3, 4>
<10, 0, 11>
<10, 0, 14>
<0, 14, 5>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 7>
<14, 5, 9>
<14, 5, 12>
<14, 6, 2>
<2, 11, 8>
<2, 11, 1>
<2, 7, 12>
<2, 1, 13>
<2, 6, 12>
<6, 10, 0>
<6, 10, 13>
<6, 12, 14>
<6, 2, 7>
<1, 8, 7>
<1, 13, 9>
<1, 0, 14>
<4, 9, 13>
<4, 9, 3>

Counting the triangles found, we get a total of 35 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [35].
