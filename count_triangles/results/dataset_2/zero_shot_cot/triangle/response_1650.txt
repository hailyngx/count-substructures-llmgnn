Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2)
