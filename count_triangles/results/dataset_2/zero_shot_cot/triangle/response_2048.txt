Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 4) (5, 11) (6, 18) (6, 16) (4, 10) (4, 17) (18, 6) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 19) (8, 15) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 9) (19, 8) (19, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 15) (12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 3) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 9) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 7) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (7, 14) (7, 19) (7, 9) (15, 8) (15, 0) (15, 13)
