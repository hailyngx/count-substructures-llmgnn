Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 7) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2)
