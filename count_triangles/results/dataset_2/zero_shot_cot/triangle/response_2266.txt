Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
[<0, 4, 8> <0, 4, 9> <0, 5, 8> <0, 5, 9> <0, 7, 9> <1, 4, 8> <1, 4, 9> <1, 8, 9> <2, 3, 5> <2, 5, 8>]
