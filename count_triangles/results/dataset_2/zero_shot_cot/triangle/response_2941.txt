Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 10) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(d_i)(d_i-1)(d_i-2) \]
where \(d_i\) represents the degree of node \(i\) in the graph.

First, let's determine the degree of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 7
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4

Now, let's substitute the degrees into the formula to find the total number of triangles.

Calculations:
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6}[(3)(2)(1) + (5)(4)(3) + (5)(4)(3) + (5)(4)(3) + (5)(4)(3) + (3)(2)(1) + (4)(3)(2) + (4)(3)(2) + (3)(2)(1) + (5)(4)(3) + (7)(6)(5) + (2)(1)(0) + (4)(3)(2) + (4)(3)(2) + (4)(3)(2)] \]

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6}[6 + 60 + 60 + 60 + 60 + 6 + 24 + 24 + 6 + 60 + 210 + 0 + 24 + 24 + 24] \]

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6}[624] = 104 \]

Therefore, there are 104 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<1, 10, 4>
<1, 10, 14>
<1, 12, 3>
<1, 12, 9>
<1, 2, 13>
<1, 4, 10>
<1, 4, 14>
<1, 4, 3>
<2, 13, 3>
<3, 10, 4>
<3, 10, 14>
<3, 12, 9>
<3, 13, 2>
<4, 10, 14>
<4, 11, 10>
<4, 11, 14>
<4, 14, 10>
<4, 14, 13>
<7, 9, 5>
<7, 9, 13>
<10, 11, 4>
<10, 14, 4>
<12, 1, 0>
<12, 1, 2>
<12, 3, 2>  

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [104].
