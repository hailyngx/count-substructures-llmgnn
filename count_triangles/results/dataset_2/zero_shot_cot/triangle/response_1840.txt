Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 2) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 19) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 12) (10, 11) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 2) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 1) (1, 18) (1, 2) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 7) (0, 16) (0, 13) (0, 5) (6, 17) (6, 12) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 19) (9, 15) (9, 17) (19, 16) (19, 2) (19, 14) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 6) (14, 5) (14, 19) (7, 13) (7, 18) (7, 17) 

Response:
There are 18 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<11, 10, 5>
<16, 8, 13>
<16, 0, 13>
<16, 8, 5>
<16, 15, 12>
<16, 0, 5>
<3, 4, 18>
<11, 18, 4>
<11, 2, 4>
<18, 4, 1>
<17, 7, 13>
<17, 7, 18>
<17, 12, 6>
<9, 15, 12>
<19, 2, 14>
<14, 5, 19>
<6, 12, 17>
<17, 7, 18> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [18].
