Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <2, 6, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 5>, <4, 0, 5>, <5, 0, 4>, <5, 0, 3>.
