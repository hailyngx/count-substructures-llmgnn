Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
