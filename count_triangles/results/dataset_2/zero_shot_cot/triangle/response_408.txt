Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 9) (21, 7) (21, 28) (7, 21) (7, 24) (7, 23) (22, 14) (22, 6) (22, 8) (23, 7) (23, 11) (23, 0) (0, 23) (0, 14) (0, 15) (20, 6) (20, 10) (20, 16) (14, 22) (14, 0) (14, 15) (14, 5) (17, 1) (17, 29) (17, 4) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 25) (28, 21) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 2) (5, 1) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 8) (13, 5) (13, 25) (8, 22) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 28) (9, 8) (11, 23) (11, 26) (11, 2) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (2, 28) (2, 11) (2, 12) (6, 22) (6, 20) (6, 24) (24, 7) (24, 6) (24, 18) (24, 10) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 26) (15, 18) (26, 11) (26, 15) (26, 27) (3, 4) (3, 18) (27, 29) (27, 26) (27, 19) (25, 29) (25, 13) (25, 16) (16, 1) (16, 20) (16, 25) (18, 24) (18, 15) (18, 3) (10, 20) (10, 24) (19, 28) (19, 27) 

Response:
After examining the given graph, we can list the unique triangles present:
<1, 5, 14>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 9, 28>
<2, 11, 26>
<2, 14, 15>
<2, 12, 28>
<4, 12, 2>
<5, 8, 22>
<5, 13, 25>
<6, 20, 24>
<7, 21, 28>
<9, 8, 22>
<9, 28, 19>
<11, 2, 12>
<14, 5, 13>
<15, 18, 24>
<16, 1, 5>
<16, 1, 20>
<16, 25, 29>
<17, 1, 5>
<17, 4, 12>
<19, 27, 28>
<22, 6, 20>
<23, 7, 24>
<26, 11, 15>

Counting these unique triangles, we find that there are a total of [26] triangles in the given graph.
