Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 18) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 16) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 17) (0, 5) (0, 16) (14, 4) (14, 16) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 11) (4, 14) (4, 16) (4, 17) (18, 13) (18, 6) (18, 15) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 10) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 4) (17, 1) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 1) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 14) (16, 4) (11, 5) (11, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 19) (19, 3)
