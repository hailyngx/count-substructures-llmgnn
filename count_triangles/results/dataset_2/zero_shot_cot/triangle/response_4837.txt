Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 27) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 18) (6, 24) (9, 14) (9, 13) (2, 5) (2, 26) (2, 1) (2, 28) (29, 17) (29, 11) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 21) (0, 5) (20, 0) (4, 27) (4, 22) (4, 26) (18, 15) (17, 29) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 21) (22, 4) (22, 26) (22, 1) (26, 2) (26, 4) (26, 22) (26, 13) (26, 11) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 26) (13, 10) (13, 27) (27, 3) (27, 4) (27, 13) (28, 2) (28, 10) (21, 3) (21, 0) (21, 17) (21, 19) (21, 25) (11, 29) (11, 26) (11, 23) (11, 1) (23, 17) (23, 11) (23, 7) (23, 12) (8, 19) (8, 12) (19, 17) (19, 21) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 1) (7, 23) (7, 19) (7, 25) (7, 14) (25, 21) (25, 7) (24, 6) (24, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 17) (1, 2) (1, 22) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 24) (14, 9) (14, 7) (10, 13) (10, 28) (12, 23) (12, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [26].
The unique triangles found are <0, 15, 21>, <2, 13, 26>, <2, 19, 26>, <2, 22, 26>, <3, 13, 27>, <5, 17, 21>, <7, 14, 19>, <7, 23, 25>, <11, 22, 26>, <11, 23, 26>, <11, 23, 29>, <13, 26, 27>, <19, 21, 25>, <1, 11, 24>, <1, 19, 22>, <1, 19, 26>, <1, 22, 26>, <1, 23, 26>, <1, 23, 29>, <5, 17, 19>, <5, 17, 21>, <5, 19, 21>, <17, 19, 21>, <18, 15, 21>, <23, 7, 19>, <23, 11, 26>, <27, 13, 4>
