Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 17) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 18) (18, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 6) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 13) (0, 6) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 1) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 3) (15, 4) (15, 0) (3, 10) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 3) (16, 17) (16, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 16) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 0)
