Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 3) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 0) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
