Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the graph.

We can see that a triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. To count the number of triangles, we look for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes in the set.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<5, 9, 6>
<6, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 1, 2>
<4, 2, 6>
<4, 2, 8>
<6, 2, 8>
<6, 4, 8>
<8, 7, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
