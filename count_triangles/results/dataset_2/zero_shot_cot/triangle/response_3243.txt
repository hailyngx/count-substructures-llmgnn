Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node to identify potential triangles.

- Node 0: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 4
- Node 2: Degree 5
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 5
- Node 5: Degree 4
- Node 6: Degree 3
- Node 7: Degree 4
- Node 8: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 5
