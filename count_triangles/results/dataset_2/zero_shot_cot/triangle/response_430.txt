Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 3) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 1)
