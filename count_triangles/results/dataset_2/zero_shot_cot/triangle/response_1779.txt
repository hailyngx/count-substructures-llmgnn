Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 8) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1)
