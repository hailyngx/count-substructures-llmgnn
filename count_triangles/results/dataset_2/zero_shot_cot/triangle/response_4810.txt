Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 15) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 19) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 7) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 0) (2, 4) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 0) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 15) (1, 0) (1, 17) (17, 9) (17, 8) (17, 1) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 14) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 19) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 16) (16, 12) (16, 7) (3, 14) (3, 19) (6, 18) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 3)
