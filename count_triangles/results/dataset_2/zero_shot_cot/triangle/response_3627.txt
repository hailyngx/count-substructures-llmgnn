Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [18].
The unique triangles found are <3, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <5, 8, 2>, <5, 9, 6>, <5, 9, 7>, <5, 2, 7>, <5, 4, 1>, <5, 8, 6>, <9, 6, 1>, <9, 7, 4>, <6, 8, 7>, <6, 1, 2>, <4, 7, 2>, <0, 3, 1>.
