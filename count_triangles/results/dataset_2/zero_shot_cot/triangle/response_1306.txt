Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 11) (2, 5) (8, 5) (8, 7) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 13) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 14) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 14>
<1, 4, 13>
<1, 11, 12>
<5, 9, 11>
<6, 10, 14>
