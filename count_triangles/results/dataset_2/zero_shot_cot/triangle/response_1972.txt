Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 2) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 14) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 4) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 13>
<0, 4, 13>
<0, 1, 3>
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 3, 14>
<2, 6, 10>
<3, 8, 14>
