Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [16].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 1>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 1>, <5, 9, 3>, <6, 4, 1>, <7, 5, 3>.
