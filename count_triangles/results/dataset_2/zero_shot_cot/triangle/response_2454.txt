Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 14) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 2) (14, 3) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 14) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 5) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 19) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 5) (18, 14) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 0) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 10) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (2, 15) (2, 9) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 12)
