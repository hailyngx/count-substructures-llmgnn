Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 18) (5, 9) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 18) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 15) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 1) (10, 17) (10, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (18, 16) (18, 6) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 7) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 12) (7, 16) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 19) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 0) (12, 2) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 14) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 13) (13, 3) 

Response:

The unique triangles found are: 
<8, 11, 16>
<1, 7, 17>
<2, 4, 12>
<3, 14, 15>
<0, 2, 12>
<0, 3, 12>
<3, 14, 16>
<3, 14, 18>
