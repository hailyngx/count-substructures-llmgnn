Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 5) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 0) (15, 13) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 19) (5, 16) (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 19) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 2) (8, 16) (8, 10) (6, 11) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 13) (1, 14) (1, 17) (1, 0) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 18) (19, 17) (19, 9) (19, 4) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 10) (0, 15) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (7, 9) 

Response:
The total number of triangles present in the given graph is [42].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<2, 4, 14>
<0, 1, 15>
<0, 10, 12>
<2, 12, 18>
<5, 13, 17>
<1, 14, 17>
<5, 9, 13>

There are a total of 7 unique triangles in the graph.
