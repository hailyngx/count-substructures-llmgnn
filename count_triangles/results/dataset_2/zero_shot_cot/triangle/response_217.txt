Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 16) (2, 7) (4, 18) (4, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 12) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 18) (1, 5) (1, 17) (17, 0) (17, 1) (17, 15) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 17) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 6) (16, 2) (16, 0) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 6) (11, 13) (11, 18) (6, 13) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 14) (14, 6) (14, 12) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 12) (3, 8) (3, 12) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 3) 

Response:
There are 16 triangles in the given graph. 

Unique triangles found:
<2, 5, 13>
<0, 4, 16>
<0, 17, 1>
<2, 7, 18>
<2, 9, 15>
<6, 13, 15>
<6, 9, 12>
<0, 12, 14>
<3, 8, 13>
<1, 5, 17>
<6, 14, 12>
<6, 15, 19>
<4, 7, 18>
<5, 13, 11>
<9, 12, 14>
<10, 15, 19> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
