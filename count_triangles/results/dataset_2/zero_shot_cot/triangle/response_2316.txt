Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 5) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 14) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 14) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

1. <4, 9, 14>
2. <5, 9, 13>
3. <8, 9, 13>
4. <10, 12, 0>
5. <10, 2, 14>
