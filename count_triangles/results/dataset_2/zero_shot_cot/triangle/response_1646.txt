Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 19) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 15) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 12) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 8) (15, 9) (15, 1) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 10) (19, 16) (19, 7) (19, 0) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (12, 3) (12, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 11) (5, 4) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 2) (18, 12) (18, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 18)
