Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are 13 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are as follows:
<4, 1, 5>
<4, 1, 6>
<4, 1, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 1>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 6, 1>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 6>
<4, 7, 9>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 8, 0> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [13].
