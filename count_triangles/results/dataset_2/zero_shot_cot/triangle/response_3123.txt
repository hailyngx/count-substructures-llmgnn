Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 19) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 17) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 12) (12, 8) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 10) (17, 0) (1, 14) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 18) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 13) (18, 13) (18, 3) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 14) (5, 3) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 5) 

Response:

<3, 4, 18>
<4, 13, 18>
<5, 14, 16>
<5, 14, 15>
<7, 15, 19>
<9, 14, 16>
<9, 14, 15>
