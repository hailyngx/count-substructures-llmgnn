Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 11) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 12) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 14) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 15 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 13, 14>
<1, 10, 13>
<3, 9, 12>
<1, 3, 14>
<5, 10, 12>
<3, 6, 11>
<1, 3, 5>
<3, 6, 13>
<4, 7, 9>
<8, 10, 12>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 0>
<0, 4, 9>
<4, 7, 14>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
