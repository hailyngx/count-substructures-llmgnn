Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 10) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 10) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14)
