Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Nodes 1, 4, and 7 form a triangle.
2. Nodes 1, 2, and 4 form a triangle.
3. Nodes 1, 5, and 7 form a triangle.
4. Nodes 2, 4, and 5 form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <1, 4, 7>, <1, 2, 4>, and <1, 5, 7>.
