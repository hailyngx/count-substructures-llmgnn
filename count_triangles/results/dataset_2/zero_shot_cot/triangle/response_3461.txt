Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [10].

The unique triangles found are <1, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <0, 2, 8>.
