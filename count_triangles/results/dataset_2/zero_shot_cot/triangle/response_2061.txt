Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 20) (16, 21) (16, 29) (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 4) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 26) (27, 23) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (20, 11) (20, 12) (20, 8) (20, 23) (25, 6) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 12) (23, 27) (23, 20) (23, 22) (12, 15) (12, 27) (12, 20) (12, 22) (4, 15) (4, 22) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 20) (8, 19) (8, 29) (29, 16) (29, 8) (29, 9) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 24) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 7) (21, 16) (21, 6) (21, 26) (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 18) (6, 25) (6, 4) (6, 21) (6, 26) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 24) (2, 22) (2, 24) (5, 11) (5, 26) (5, 24) (26, 27) (26, 21) (26, 6) (26, 5) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 7) (0, 15) (0, 13) (14, 19) (14, 18) (24, 10) (24, 19) (24, 2) (24, 5) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 13) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be calculated by counting the number of triangles a node is involved in and dividing by 6 since each triangle is counted three times (one for each node).

After counting the number of triangles each node is involved in, we get the following:
- Node 0 is involved in 3 triangles.
- Node 1 is involved in 1 triangle.
- Node 2 is involved in 1 triangle.
- Node 3 is involved in 2 triangles.
- Node 4 is involved in 5 triangles.
- Node 5 is involved in 4 triangles.
- Node 6 is involved in 7 triangles.
- Node 7 is involved in 3 triangles.
- Node 8 is involved in 6 triangles.
- Node 9 is involved in 4 triangles.
- Node 10 is involved in 4 triangles.
- Node 11 is involved in 3 triangles.
- Node 12 is involved in 8 triangles.
- Node 13 is involved in 3 triangles.
- Node 14 is involved in 3 triangles.
- Node 15 is involved in 3 triangles.
- Node 16 is involved in 3 triangles.
- Node 17 is involved in 3 triangles.
- Node 18 is involved in 3 triangles.
- Node 19 is involved in 6 triangles.
- Node 20 is involved in 4 triangles.
- Node 21 is involved in 3 triangles.
- Node 22 is involved in 8 triangles.
- Node 23 is involved in 5 triangles.
- Node 24 is involved in 3 triangles.
- Node 25 is involved in 1 triangle.
- Node 26 is involved in 6 triangles.
- Node 27 is involved in 5 triangles.
- Node 28 is involved in 0 triangles.
- Node 29 is involved in 5 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 84 (since 504/6=84).

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<6, 22, 29>
<8, 20, 29>
<8, 19, 24>
<8, 20, 23>
<12, 20, 22>
<6, 21, 26>
<4, 6, 22>
<12, 15, 27>
<4, 6, 25>
<12, 20, 22> 

So, there are 10 unique triangles found in the given graph.
