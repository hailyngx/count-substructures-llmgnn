Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 17) (10, 11) (10, 18) (17, 9) (17, 15) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (1, 15) (1, 0) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 19) (18, 10) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 0) (19, 15) (19, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 0) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (7, 18) (7, 19) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 2) (0, 12) (3, 16) (3, 12) (14, 16) (14, 4) (14, 18) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 2)
