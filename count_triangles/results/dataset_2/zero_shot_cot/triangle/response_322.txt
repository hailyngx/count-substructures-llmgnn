Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [20]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 2>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 9>.
