Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles: [14]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 2>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 1>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 1>, <7, 8, 9>, <8, 9, 2>
