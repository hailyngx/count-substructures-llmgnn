Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 4) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 0) (26, 7) (5, 9) (5, 23) (2, 29) (2, 20) (2, 7) (29, 9) (29, 2) (29, 25) (7, 26) (7, 2) (21, 19) (21, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 28) (3, 1) (3, 27) (10, 11) (10, 22) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 0) (12, 17) (12, 22) (6, 1) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 15) (6, 8) (28, 1) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 27) (28, 13) (13, 28) (13, 16) (13, 23) (0, 26) (0, 11) (0, 28) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 27) (17, 4) (25, 29) (25, 6) (19, 21) (19, 22) (22, 10) (22, 12) (22, 19) (22, 24) (24, 11) (24, 22) (24, 8) (24, 23) (23, 5) (23, 13) (23, 24) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 24) (8, 15) (4, 9) (4, 21) (4, 17) (18, 20) (27, 9) (27, 3) (27, 28) (27, 17) (16, 13) (16, 20) (16, 15) (20, 2) (20, 18) (20, 16) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 16)
