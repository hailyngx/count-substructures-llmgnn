Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 15) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 13) (17, 1) (17, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 18) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 1) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 12) (7, 14) (16, 13) (16, 6) (16, 14) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 18) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 3) (19, 18) (19, 2) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 7) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 12) (6, 16) (12, 9) (12, 14) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2)
