Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) 

Response:
