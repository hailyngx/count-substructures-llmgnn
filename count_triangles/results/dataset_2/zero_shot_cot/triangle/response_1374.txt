Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 8) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 13) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 9) 

Response:
There are 15 triangles in total that can be formed in this graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 0>
<3, 2, 8>
<3, 5, 11>
<3, 9, 12>
<10, 11, 12>
<4, 8, 14>
<4, 13, 0>
<4, 13, 7>
<8, 6, 11>
<8, 14, 4>
<0, 13, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [15].
