Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 4) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 5) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 15) (8, 6) (8, 18) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 9) (15, 16) (15, 2) (15, 18) (13, 1) (12, 16) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 18) (14, 11) (14, 10) (14, 4) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 0) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 6) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 19) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 12) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 9)
