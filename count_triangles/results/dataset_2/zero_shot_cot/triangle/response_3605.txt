Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 16) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 0) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 13) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 11) (16, 17) (16, 1) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 11) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 9) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 13) (11, 7) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 12) (9, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 10) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 18)
