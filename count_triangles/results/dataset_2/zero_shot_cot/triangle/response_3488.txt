Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (14, 10) (14, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [12].

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 2>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 5, 1>, <4, 5, 10>, <4, 5, 13>, <4, 5, 9>, <8, 9, 11>.
