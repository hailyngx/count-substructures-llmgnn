Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 15) (5, 17) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (4, 16) (4, 14) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 6) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 19) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 15) (19, 18) (0, 13) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 2) (2, 16) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 14) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 7) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 12) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 7) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 12) 

Response:
[<1, 9, 15>, <1, 2, 10>, <1, 2, 16>, <1, 15, 19>, <1, 16, 15>, <2, 8, 6>, <2, 10, 12>, <2, 10, 13>, <2, 12, 10>, <2, 13, 7>, <3, 7, 12>, <4, 14, 12>, <5, 7, 3>, <5, 17, 11>, <6, 7, 3>, <6, 8, 10>, <6, 7, 13>, <6, 18, 19>, <7, 13, 2>, <8, 10, 12>, <8, 10, 6>, <9, 11, 17>, <12, 10, 2>, <12, 14, 4>]
