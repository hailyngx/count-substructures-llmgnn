Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 15) (17, 10) (17, 11) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 0) (4, 13) (4, 19) (4, 16) (18, 9) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 14) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 0) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 19) (16, 4) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 15) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 3) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 9) (15, 11) (15, 6) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 5) 

Response:
There are <0, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 11, 15>, <1, 6, 15>, <1, 6, 12>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 11, 17>, <1, 5, 19>, <1, 6, 12>, <1, 6, 15>, <1, 11, 17>, <1, 6, 12>, <2, 0, 19>, <2, 1, 5>, <2, 1, 11>, <2, 1, 6>, <2, 1, 11>, <2, 1, 6>, <2, 19, 4>, <2, 19, 5>, <2, 0, 13>, <2, 0, 19>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 7, 12>, <3, 9, 18>, <4, 13, 19>, <4, 13, 14>, <4, 19, 5>, <5, 14, 19>, <6, 12, 15>, <7, 10, 11>, <7, 10, 17>, <7, 9, 18>, <11, 10, 17> triangles. 
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [36].
