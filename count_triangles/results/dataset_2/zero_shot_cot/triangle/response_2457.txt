Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 3) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 9) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 14) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 2) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2)
