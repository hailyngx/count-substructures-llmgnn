Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 7) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 8) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 8) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <0, 8, 10>
3. <0, 8, 14>
4. <4, 6, 14>
5. <5, 8, 14>
6. <7, 10, 13>
