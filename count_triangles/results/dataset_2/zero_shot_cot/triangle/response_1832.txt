Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 9) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 12) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (15, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 3) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (16, 4) (16, 7) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 6) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (6, 18) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 2) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 12) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 19) (10, 12) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 10) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 11)
