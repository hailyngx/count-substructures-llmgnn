Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 8) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 1)
