Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 10) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 0) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 4) 

Response:
[<0, 1, 4>, <0, 8, 10>, <0, 8, 14>, <1, 4, 13>, <2, 12, 14>, <3, 8, 13>, <4, 5, 9>]
