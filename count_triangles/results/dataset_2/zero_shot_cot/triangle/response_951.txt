Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of 2 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 8> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
