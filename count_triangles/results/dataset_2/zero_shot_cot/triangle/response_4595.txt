Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph. 
A triangle in a graph occurs when three nodes are connected to each other by edges.

Next, we will list the unique triangles found in the graph. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is: [6]

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 6, 12>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 12>
<0, 5, 13>
<0, 9, 12>
<2, 3, 13>
