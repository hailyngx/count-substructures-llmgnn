Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [8].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, <4, 8, 5>.
