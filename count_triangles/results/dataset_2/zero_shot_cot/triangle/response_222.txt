Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's identify the triangles one by one:

1. Triangle <1, 5, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 6, 9>
3. Triangle <1, 8, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 6, 2>
5. Triangle <1, 8, 2>
6. Triangle <1, 4, 6>
7. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
8. Triangle <2, 5, 9>
9. Triangle <2, 6, 9>
10. Triangle <2, 3, 4>
11. Triangle <2, 6, 4>
12. Triangle <2, 8, 4>
13. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
14. Triangle <4, 6, 9>
15. Triangle <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
