Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 5>
<4, 7, 3>
<4, 7, 6>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 5>
<2, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
