Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 14) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 19) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (14, 16) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 18) (1, 15) (1, 10) (3, 9) (3, 15) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 0) (15, 1) (15, 3) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 7) (18, 16) (18, 17) (18, 7) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 0) (13, 9) (13, 14) (4, 9) (4, 14) (0, 6) (0, 19) (0, 8) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 0) 

Response:
There are total [14] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<6, 14, 16>
<6, 8, 12>
<6, 8, 0>
<6, 14, 4>
<10, 17, 18>
<10, 17, 1>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 16>
<0, 8, 12>
<0, 8, 17>
<0, 8, 19>
<0, 10, 19>
<2, 10, 17>
<2, 10, 19>
