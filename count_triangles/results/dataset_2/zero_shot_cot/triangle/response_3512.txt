Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 10) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 10)
