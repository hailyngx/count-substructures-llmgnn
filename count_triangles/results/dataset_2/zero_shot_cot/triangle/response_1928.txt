Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in this graph.

The unique triangles are:
<5, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 1>
<4, 0, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<4, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
