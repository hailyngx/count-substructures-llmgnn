Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 16) (14, 3) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 14) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 19) (11, 8) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 19) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 19) (2, 1) (2, 12) (9, 18) (9, 13) (9, 0) (18, 12) (18, 9) (18, 7) (6, 4) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 12) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 18) (7, 8) (13, 12) (13, 9) (0, 9) (0, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].

The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<3, 5, 14>

<3, 10, 14>
<1, 2, 14>
<1, 2, 12>
<4, 5, 12>
<4, 12, 19>
<5, 8, 16>
<7, 8, 18>
<9, 13, 12>
<9, 13, 18>
<0, 5, 9>
