Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 5) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 7) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 11) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (12, 16) (12, 10) (16, 3) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 6) (9, 7) (18, 15) (19, 15) (6, 13) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 0) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 4) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 5) (4, 14) (4, 16) (4, 5) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 6) (10, 12) (10, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9)
