Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 11) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 0) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 1) (3, 12) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 11) (10, 4) (10, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 14>
<1, 2, 11>
<1, 3, 12>
<4, 7, 12>
