Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 7) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 14) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 5) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 0) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 13)
