Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 11) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 15) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 0) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 19) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (11, 17) (11, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (0, 18) (0, 4) (0, 15) (0, 19) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 14) (16, 10) (16, 13) (19, 9) (19, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13)
