Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Starting with each node, we will count the number of triangles it belongs to. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected with each other. 

Node 0: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 8>
Node 1: <1, 3, 4>, <1, 2, 5>
Node 2: <2, 5, 6>, <2, 0, 1>
Node 3: <3, 1, 4>, <3, 0, 9>
Node 4: <4, 1, 5>, <4, 3, 6>
Node 5: <5, 2, 8>, <5, 1, 4>
Node 6: <6, 2, 9>, <6, 4, 8>
Node 7: <7, 5, 8>
Node 8: <8, 0, 5>, <8, 6, 7>
Node 9: <9, 0, 6>, <9, 2, 5>

Total number of triangles inside brackets: [20]
