Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 4) (15, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (17, 19) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 12) (18, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (16, 4) (16, 6) (8, 10) (8, 19) (8, 12) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 12) (1, 10) (1, 18) (14, 2) (14, 19) (14, 13) (4, 3) (4, 16) (4, 9) (4, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 4) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 4) (13, 10) (13, 14) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 0) (6, 16) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) 

Response:
