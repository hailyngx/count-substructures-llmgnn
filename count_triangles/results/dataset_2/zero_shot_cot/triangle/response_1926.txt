Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. For each node, find its neighbors.
2. Check for each pair of neighbors whether they are connected.
3. If the pair of neighbors is connected, check if there is an edge connecting the third node to both of them. If so, we have found a triangle.

Let's calculate the number of triangles:

1. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 18, and 27.
   - Triangle <4, 7, 18> found.

2. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 12, 25, 11, and 24.
   - No triangles found with node 12.
   - No triangles found with node 25.
   - No triangles found with node 11.
   - Triangle <7, 25, 26> found.

3. Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 20, and 24.
   - No additional triangles found with node 20.

4. Node 18 is connected to nodes 4, 26, and 29.
   - No additional triangles found with node 26.

5. Node 26 is connected to nodes 18, 13, 15, and 25.
   - Triangle <26, 13, 14> found.

   - No triangles found with nodes 0 or 25.

8. Node 25 is connected to nodes 7, 26, 21, and 1.
   - Triangle <25, 21, 0> found.
   - No additional triangles found with node 1.

9. Node 16 is connected to node 26.
   - No triangles found with node 16.

10. Node 28 is connected to nodes 8, 17, and 20.
   - No additional triangles found with nodes 8 or 17.

11. Node 27 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 23.
   - No additional triangles found with node 3.

13. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 19, and 20.
   - No additional triangles found with node 19.

14. Node 19 is connected to nodes 6, 5, and 10.
   - No additional triangles found with node 10.

15. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 11.
   - No additional triangles found with node 1.

16. Node 8 is connected to nodes 28, 10, and 1.
   - No additional triangles found with node 10.

19. Node 3 is connected to nodes 27, 9, and 29.
   - No additional triangles found with nodes 9 or 29.

20. Node 15 is connected to nodes 26, 23, and 9.
   - No additional triangles found with node 9.

21. Node 14 is connected to nodes 13 and 22.
   - Triangle <14, 13, 26> found.

22. Node 22 is connected to nodes 14, 17, and 14.
   - No additional triangles found with node 14.

23. Node 20 is connected to nodes 12, 13, 28, and 5.
   - No additional triangles found with node 5.

24. Node 23 is connected to nodes 27, 17, 15, and 29.
   - No additional triangles found with node 29.

25. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 15, and 14.

27. Node 10 is connected to nodes 19, 8, and 24.
   - No additional triangles found with node 8.

28. Node 29 is connected to nodes 18, 3, and 23.

Therefore, the unique triangles found are:
<4, 7, 18>
<7, 25, 26>
<25, 21, 0>
<14, 13, 26>
<24, 12, 7>

There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph.
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
