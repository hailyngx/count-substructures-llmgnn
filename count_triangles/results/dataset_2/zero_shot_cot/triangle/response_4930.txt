Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 11) (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 16) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 19) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 17) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 15) (18, 19) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 12) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 4) (0, 6) (0, 16) (0, 11) (16, 9) (16, 0) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 11) (1, 13) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 19) (14, 8) (14, 12)
