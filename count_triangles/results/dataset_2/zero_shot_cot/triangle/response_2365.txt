Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
I will find the total number of triangles in the graph by examining all possible combinations of three nodes that can form a triangle.

The total number of triangles is [9].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
