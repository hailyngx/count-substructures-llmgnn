Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 2) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 2) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 12) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 9)
