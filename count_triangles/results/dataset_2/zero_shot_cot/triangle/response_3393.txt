Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 1) (7, 17) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (18, 14) (18, 0) (18, 8) (5, 11) (5, 2) (6, 11) (6, 2) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 15) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 0) (12, 4) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 9) (15, 17) (15, 19) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 9) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 13) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 16) (14, 4) (14, 18) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 19) 

Response:
There are a total of 12 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 10, 11>
<1, 17, 7>
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 10, 19>
<1, 0, 18>
<1, 0, 13>
<7, 17, 1>
<3, 11, 10>
<3, 11, 6>
<9, 4, 14>
<9, 4, 19>
<4, 14, 18> 

So the total number of triangles is [12].
