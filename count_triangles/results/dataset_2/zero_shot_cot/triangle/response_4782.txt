Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 5) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 12) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 2) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (5, 16) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (4, 10) (18, 10) (18, 9) (18, 3) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 0) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 9) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 2) (9, 14) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (15, 11) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 3) (2, 10) (2, 7) (3, 16) (3, 18) (3, 12) (0, 5) (0, 19) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [10].

The unique triangles are:

<5, 16, 11>
<6, 1, 19>
<8, 7, 9>
<8, 10, 18>
<9, 1, 19>
<9, 7, 2>
<10, 4, 2>
<10, 18, 3>
