Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 3) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 0) (8, 7) (8, 2) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 1) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 12) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [10]. 
The unique triangles are <5, 9, 10>, <5, 3, 10>, <5, 3, 0>, <5, 1, 14>, <9, 6, 14>, <9, 7, 10>, <6, 4, 7>, <4, 11, 10>, <7, 11, 10>, <1, 13, 0>.
