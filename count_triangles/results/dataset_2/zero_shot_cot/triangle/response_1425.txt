Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8)
