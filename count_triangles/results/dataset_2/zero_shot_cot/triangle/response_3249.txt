Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 14) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 7) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 13) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [20].
The unique triangles found are <6, 1, 9>, <11, 4, 2>, <8, 5, 10>, <11, 12, 13>, <0, 10, 12>, <1, 3, 14>, <5, 10, 14>, <6, 7, 10>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 11>, <8, 10, 12>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 11>, <1, 4, 11>, <4, 8, 11>, <8, 12, 9>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 10, 14>, <13, 5, 14>, <2, 13, 11>.
