Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected by edges. Let's start by listing all the unique triangles found in this graph:

1. <4, 7, 9>
2. <4, 5, 8>
3. <4, 5, 7>
4. <4, 5, 9>
5. <5, 6, 7>
6. <5, 6, 8>
7. <5, 7, 9>
8. <1, 5, 9>
9. <0, 3, 6>
10. <0, 2, 9>

Now, counting the total number of triangles gives us:
