Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 8>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 9, 8>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 2, 8>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>.
