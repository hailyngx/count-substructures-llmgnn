Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 18) (21, 14) (3, 25) (3, 17) (3, 20) (3, 5) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 29) (25, 15) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 7) (23, 1) (23, 8) (23, 16) (23, 10) (0, 20) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 0) (20, 28) (28, 20) (28, 27) (28, 5) (29, 25) (29, 6) (14, 21) (14, 5) (10, 21) (10, 23) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 24) (17, 3) (17, 25) (17, 10) (17, 6) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 12) (4, 15) (4, 2) (27, 28) (27, 22) (15, 1) (15, 25) (15, 4) (15, 24) (18, 21) (18, 9) (18, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 26) (12, 18) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 23) (16, 12) (16, 24) (16, 6) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 29) (6, 17) (6, 16) (6, 22) (24, 10) (24, 15) (24, 16) (5, 3) (5, 28) (5, 14) (5, 2) (22, 27) (22, 6) (22, 11) (11, 9) (11, 22) (7, 8) (7, 9) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [28].
The unique triangles found are <1, 21, 14>, <1, 21, 10>, <1, 15, 25>, <1, 15, 4>, <1, 15, 24>, <1, 15, 2>, <1, 23, 8>, <1, 23, 16>, <1, 23, 10>, <21, 10, 17>, <21, 10, 2>, <21, 10, 24>, <21, 18, 12>, <21, 14, 5>, <21, 14, 5>, <3, 25, 17>, <3, 25, 15>, <3, 17, 6>, <20, 3, 25>, <20, 3, 5>, <20, 8, 0>, <20, 8, 28>, <20, 28, 5>, <25, 15, 4>, <25, 17, 10>, <25, 29, 6>, <15, 4, 2>, <18, 12, 26>.
