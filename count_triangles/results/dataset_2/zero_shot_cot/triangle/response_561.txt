Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 10) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 7) (8, 14) (8, 2) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 18) (10, 11) (10, 16) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 15) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 4) (19, 5) (19, 4) (15, 9) (15, 2) (0, 16) (0, 12) (7, 16) (7, 17) (7, 9) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 19) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 0) (3, 2)
