Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 19) (14, 4) (14, 5) (17, 12) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 2) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 19) (0, 16) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 9) (5, 14) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 6) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 16) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 4) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 3) (16, 2) (16, 9) (18, 7) (18, 15) (18, 3) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 9) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 19) (6, 8) (6, 15) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 16) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 16) (3, 18)
