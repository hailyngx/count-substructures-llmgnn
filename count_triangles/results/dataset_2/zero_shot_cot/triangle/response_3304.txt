Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 23) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 2) (27, 20) (27, 19) (18, 12) (18, 28) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 21) (20, 27) (20, 7) (20, 28) (23, 0) (23, 22) (5, 4) (5, 17) (6, 0) (6, 22) (6, 15) (19, 27) (19, 26) (19, 17) (19, 24) (19, 3) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 13) (26, 10) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 28) (9, 11) (9, 16) (28, 18) (28, 20) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 7) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 15) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 3) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 11) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 19) (17, 13) (10, 0) (10, 26) (10, 21) (21, 22) (21, 10) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 14) (2, 27) (12, 18) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 24) (24, 19) (24, 8) (24, 11) (3, 19) (3, 13) (7, 20) (7, 28) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 15) (1, 12) (1, 14) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 14)
