Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are: 
<4, 1, 6>
<4, 5, 8>
<6, 1, 7>
<6, 2, 9>
<9, 3, 0>
<9, 2, 5>
