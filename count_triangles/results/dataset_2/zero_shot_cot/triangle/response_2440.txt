Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (4, 6) (4, 12) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 10) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 2) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5)
