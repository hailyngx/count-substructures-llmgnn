Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 5) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 10) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 17) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 11) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 2) (10, 11) (10, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 18) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 13) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 0) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 19) (0, 12) (0, 18) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 18) (1, 0) (1, 19) (2, 17) (2, 19) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 19) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 6) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 3) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 15) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are <2, 17, 14>, <2, 17, 9>, <5, 10, 11>, <5, 15, 8>, <7, 3, 6>, <12, 0, 1>, <13, 4, 12>, <18, 0, 1>.
