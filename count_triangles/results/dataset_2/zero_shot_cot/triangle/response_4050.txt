Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 11) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 10) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 10) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 2) (12, 3) (12, 11) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 7) (7, 1) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 11) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 11) 

Response:
There are 25 unique triangles in the given graph. 
The triangles are as follows: 
<4, 8, 1>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 10, 1>
<0, 10, 14>
<0, 14, 2>
<0, 14, 3>
<10, 14, 7>
<10, 8, 4>
<10, 7, 11>
<10, 7, 14>
<10, 0, 1>
<14, 2, 13>
<14, 7, 11>
<8, 1, 4>
<8, 1, 10>
<8, 4, 13>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 7, 10>
<1, 7, 14>
<1, 7, 11>
<1, 0, 14>
<5, 6, 9>
<3, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [25].
