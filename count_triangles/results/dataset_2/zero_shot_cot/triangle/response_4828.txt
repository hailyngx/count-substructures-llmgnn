Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 8) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 17) (5, 17) (5, 7) (0, 14) (0, 16) (14, 0) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 10) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 2) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 16) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 11) (8, 12) (16, 0) (16, 17) (10, 19) (10, 7) (10, 4) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 3) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 12) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 11) (3, 17) (3, 18) (1, 2) (1, 11) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 10) (12, 13) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 15) (4, 10) (4, 11)
