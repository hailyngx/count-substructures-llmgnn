Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 15) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 18) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 10) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 17) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 4) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 4) (15, 12) (15, 17) (19, 2) (19, 10) (4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 16) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 18) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 19) (1, 18) (14, 5) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 18) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 16) (16, 4) (16, 18) 

Response:
