Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 7) (14, 3) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 8) (7, 16) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 19) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 3) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 3) (19, 13) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 0) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 18) (15, 7) (15, 1) (15, 4) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 10) (0, 8) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 13) (4, 16) (4, 15) (4, 2) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 19) (18, 1) (18, 10) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 10)
