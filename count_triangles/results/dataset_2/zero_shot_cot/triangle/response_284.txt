Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 13) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 5) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 7) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are as follows:
<6, 10, 11>
<0, 3, 14>
<0, 8, 12>
<0, 9, 11>
<2, 8, 12>
<2, 7, 10>
