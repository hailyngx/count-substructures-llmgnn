Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 2) (7, 19) (7, 14) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 8) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 15) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 17) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 18) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 18) (15, 14) (15, 9) (8, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 8) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 19) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 6) (6, 19) (6, 17) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 6) (17, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 16) (16, 4)
