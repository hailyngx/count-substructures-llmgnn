Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 14) (15, 10) (15, 7) (7, 15) (7, 16) (7, 13) (7, 8) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 18) (19, 4) (19, 14) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 13) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 11) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 11) (4, 19) (4, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (2, 6) (2, 17) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 18) (0, 5) (11, 17) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 13) (3, 12) (18, 16) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 11) (14, 10) (14, 19) (14, 4)
