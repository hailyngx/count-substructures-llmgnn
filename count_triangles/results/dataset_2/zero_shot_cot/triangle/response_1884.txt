Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 5) (11, 2) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 12) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 6) (1, 10) (1, 9) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 13) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 9)
