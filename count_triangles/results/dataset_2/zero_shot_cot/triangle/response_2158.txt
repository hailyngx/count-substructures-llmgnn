Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 18) (16, 9) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 15) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 15) (9, 12) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 13) (17, 19) (17, 12) (17, 15) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 10) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 17) (18, 16) (18, 5) (18, 14) (12, 9) (12, 17) (10, 19) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 13) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 4) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 0) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:
<4, 10, 13>
<4, 10, 14>
<5, 15, 17>
<9, 15, 17>
