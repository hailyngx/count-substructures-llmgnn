Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10]. 
The unique triangles found are <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 2, 3>, and <6, 7, 8>.
