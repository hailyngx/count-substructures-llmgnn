Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0)
