Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (1, 0) (1, 18) (3, 16) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 17) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 15) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 17) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 17) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 15) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 18) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 15) (14, 7) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 13) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 16) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 19) (17, 11) (18, 6) (18, 1) (18, 7) (18, 16) (18, 15) (0, 6) (0, 1)
