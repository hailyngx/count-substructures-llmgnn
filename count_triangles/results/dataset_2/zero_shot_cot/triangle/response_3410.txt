Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
