Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5)
