Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 12) (16, 2) (16, 14) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (10, 17) (10, 13) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 2) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 18) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 17) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 18) (15, 6) (19, 7) (7, 19) (7, 13) (14, 16) (14, 10) (14, 12) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 4) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 18) (12, 11) (12, 14) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 1) (18, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [24].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 16>, <0, 2, 17>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 13>, <1, 8, 17>, <1, 8, 18>, <1, 13, 7>, <2, 16, 14>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 13>, <5, 18, 1>, <6, 9, 13>, <6, 9, 3>, <6, 9, 4>, <6, 13, 7>, <6, 18, 8>, <10, 13, 7>, <10, 13, 9>, <10, 14, 16>, <11, 12, 14>, <12, 14, 16>, <1, 5, 18>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 17, 10>.
