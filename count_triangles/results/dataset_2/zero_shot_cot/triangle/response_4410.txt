Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 0) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 2) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 4) 

Response:
Let's start by counting the number of triangles in the given graph.

To count the number of triangles, we need to find all the sets of 3 nodes that are fully connected by edges.

After analyzing the graph, we find that the triangles are formed by the following nodes:
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 3, 12>
<1, 11, 4>
<1, 12, 3>
<3, 11, 13>
<3, 12, 8>
<3, 12, 4>
<3, 8, 13>
<5, 8, 0>
<5, 8, 13>
<10, 14, 8>
<9, 14, 6>
<9, 14, 10>
<9, 12, 4>
<2, 4, 14>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph and list the unique triangles:
Total number of triangles: [14]
Unique triangles: <1, 3, 11>, <1, 3, 12>, <1, 11, 4>, <1, 12, 3>, <3, 11, 13>, <3, 12, 8>, <3, 12, 4>, <3, 8, 13>, <5, 8, 0>, <5, 8, 13>, <10, 14, 8>, <9, 14, 6>, <9, 14, 10>, <9, 12, 4>
