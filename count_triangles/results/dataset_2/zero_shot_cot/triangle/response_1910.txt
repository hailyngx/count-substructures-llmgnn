Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [28].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 7, 8>.
