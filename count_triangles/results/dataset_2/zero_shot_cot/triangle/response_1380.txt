Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 5) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 14) (10, 4) (10, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 10) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 8>, <5, 11, 13>, <6, 9, 12>, <6, 7, 13>, <4, 8, 14>, <2, 9, 10>.
