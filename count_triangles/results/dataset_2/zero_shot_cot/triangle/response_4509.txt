Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 14) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 14) (9, 15) (9, 5) (9, 18) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 8) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 0) (11, 1) (11, 17) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 13) (17, 11) (17, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 16) (16, 7) (16, 4) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 19) (18, 9) (18, 6) (18, 12) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 4) (14, 15) (14, 5) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 8) (4, 16) (4, 2)
