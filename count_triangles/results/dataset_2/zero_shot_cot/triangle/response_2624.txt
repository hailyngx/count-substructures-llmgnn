Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 0) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 11) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 18) (19, 11) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (7, 10) (16, 17) (16, 14) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 5) (14, 6) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 16) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 0) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 11) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 18) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of 24 triangles in this graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 8, 18>
<0, 13, 18>
<1, 3, 17>
<2, 3, 10>
<5, 11, 15>
<6, 10, 14>
<6, 12, 14>
<10, 14, 16>
<10, 15, 14>
<11, 15, 5>
<11, 15, 10>
<11, 15, 14>
<11, 19, 15>
<11, 19, 5>
<12, 4, 5>
<12, 6, 14>
<13, 0, 18>
<13, 3, 9>
<15, 11, 5>
<17, 0, 18>
<17, 1, 3>
<16, 14, 17>
<16, 14, 6>
<18, 0, 8> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [24].
