Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 3) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 4) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 13) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 13) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [40]. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
