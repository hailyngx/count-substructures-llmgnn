Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 12) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 0) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0)
