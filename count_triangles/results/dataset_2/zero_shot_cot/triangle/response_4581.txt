Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
