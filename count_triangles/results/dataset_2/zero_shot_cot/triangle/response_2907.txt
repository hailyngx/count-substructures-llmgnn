Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14)
