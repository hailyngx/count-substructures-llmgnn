Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 7) (10, 3) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 15) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 1) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 5) (0, 5) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 4) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 18) (4, 16) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 19) (19, 2) (19, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 18) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 16) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [6].
The unique triangles are: <6, 9, 7>, <6, 12, 5>, <4, 18, 16>, <2, 11, 5>, <2, 14, 8>, <1, 18, 16>.
