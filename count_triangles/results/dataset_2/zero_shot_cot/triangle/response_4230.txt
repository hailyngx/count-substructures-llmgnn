Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (13, 12) (13, 14) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 4) (3, 11) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 12) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 7) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
[<1, 4, 12>, <2, 4, 6>]
