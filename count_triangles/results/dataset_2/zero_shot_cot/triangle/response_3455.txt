Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 4) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 10) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 6) (10, 5) (10, 7) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 6) 

Response:
[<0, 2, 14> <0, 3, 12> <0, 4, 6> <2, 7, 8> <3, 5, 14> <3, 6, 12> <3, 9, 12> <4, 6, 12> <4, 5, 14>]
