Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 12) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 2) (8, 14) (3, 4) (3, 14) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [22].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <4, 5, 7>, <2, 10, 11>, <1, 13, 14>, <0, 4, 12>, <2, 7, 13>, <3, 14, 1>, <2, 7, 10>, <5, 11, 4>, <5, 12, 6>, <6, 5, 4>, <6, 12, 0>, <7, 13, 14>, <7, 13, 1>, <6, 12, 5>, <2, 11, 10>, <9, 2, 7>, <9, 2, 11>, <0, 12, 5>, <0, 12, 4>, <7, 13, 1>, <3, 14, 10>, <1, 13, 14>.
