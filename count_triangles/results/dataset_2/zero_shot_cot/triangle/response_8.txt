Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (12, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 6) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are <3, 4, 9>, <1, 2, 13>, <1, 3, 14>, <1, 8, 5>, <2, 0, 5>, <2, 11, 13>, <7, 10, 11>, <14, 6, 12>.
