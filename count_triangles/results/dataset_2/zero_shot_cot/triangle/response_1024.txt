Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5)
