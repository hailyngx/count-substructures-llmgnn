Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 19) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 13) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 10) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 17) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (5, 8) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 19) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 16) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 13) (11, 1) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 16) (14, 3) (16, 9) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 10) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 15) (15, 18) (15, 4) (15, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 16) (13, 18) (13, 7) (13, 19) 

Response:
There are a total of 18 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<9, 17, 18>
<9, 17, 16>
<9, 17, 4>
<9, 17, 6>
<9, 16, 3>
<9, 16, 17>
<9, 16, 10>
<9, 16, 18>
<9, 17, 4>
<9, 17, 18>
<9, 18, 6>
<17, 4, 0>
<17, 4, 15>
<17, 16, 3>
<4, 0, 15>
<16, 3, 10>
<18, 2, 15>
<18, 2, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [18].
