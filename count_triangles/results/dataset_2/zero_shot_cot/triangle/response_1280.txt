Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 15) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 1) (17, 10) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 6) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 18) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 6) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 13) (4, 19) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 0) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 4) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 18) (0, 6) (0, 18) (0, 19) (19, 4) (19, 0) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 0)
