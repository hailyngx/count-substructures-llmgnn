Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 9) (14, 4) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 2) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 12) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 15) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 7) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 19) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 10) (5, 4) (8, 17) (8, 10) (6, 2) (7, 18) (7, 13) (7, 15) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 7) (9, 14) (9, 16) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 19) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 19) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 0) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph step-by-step:

1. Look for common neighbors of each node pair to identify triangles.

- For edge (1, 11): Common neighbors are node 2. Thus, a triangle <1, 11, 2>.
- For edge (1, 13): Common neighbors are node 4. Thus, a triangle <1, 13, 4>.
- For edge (1, 12): No common neighbors, so no triangle.
- For edge (11, 2): Common neighbors are node 1. Thus, a triangle <11, 2, 1>.
- For edge (11, 15): Common neighbors are node 7. Thus, a triangle <11, 15, 7>.
- For edge (13, 17): Common neighbors are node 4. Thus, a triangle <13, 17, 4>.
- For edge (13, 1): Common neighbors are node 4. Thus, a triangle <13, 1, 4>.
- For edge (13, 4): No new triangle since it was already covered by (1, 13) and (13, 17) edges.
- For edge (11, 1): No new triangle since it was already covered by (1, 11) edge.
- For edge (2, 11): No new triangle since it was already covered by (11, 2) edge.
- For edge (2, 3): No common neighbors, so no triangle.
- For edge (2, 6): No common neighbors, so no triangle.
- For edge (2, 10): Common neighbors are node 8. Thus, a triangle <2, 10, 8>.
- For edge (5, 4): No common neighbors, so no triangle.
- For edge (4, 13): No new triangle since it was already covered by (1, 13) and (13, 17) edges.
- For edge (4, 14): No common neighbors, so no triangle.
- For edge (4, 0): Common neighbors are node 18. Thus, a triangle <4, 0, 18>.
- For edge (4, 5): No common neighbors, so no triangle.
- For edge (4, 18): No new triangle since it was already covered by (4, 0) edge.
- For edge (4, 1

Hence, there are 5 unique triangles which are <1, 11, 2>, <11, 2, 1>, <11, 15, 7>, <13, 17, 4>, and <4, 0, 18>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
