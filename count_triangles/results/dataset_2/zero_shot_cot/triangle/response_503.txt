Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 10) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 13) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 1)
