Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [8].
The unique triangles found are <3, 4, 5>, <4, 6, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 8, 1>.
