Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 19) (0, 3) (0, 15) (2, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 9) (17, 5) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 7) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 16) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 9) (16, 19) (16, 6) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 1) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 16) (6, 15) (3, 0) (3, 18) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (14, 4) (14, 8) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 7) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 6) (5, 17) (5, 3)
