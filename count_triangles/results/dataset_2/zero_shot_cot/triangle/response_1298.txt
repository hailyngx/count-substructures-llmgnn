Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and 40 edges in the given graph. To find the total number of triangles, we need to identify all the triangles present in the graph. 

Let's start by listing the triangles found in the graph:

<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
