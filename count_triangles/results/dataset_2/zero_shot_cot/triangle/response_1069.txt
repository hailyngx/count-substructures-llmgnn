Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 10) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 1) (3, 5) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 1) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14)
