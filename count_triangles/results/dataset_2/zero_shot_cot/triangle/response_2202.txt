Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 2) (16, 9) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 11) (17, 14) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 15) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 13) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 10) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 15) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 13) (15, 12) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 8) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 2) (2, 16) (2, 12) (3, 16) (3, 5) (1, 5) (1, 13) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 1) 

Response:
[<0, 7, 13> <0, 10, 15> <2, 12, 16> <4, 12, 15> <5, 6, 19> <5, 7, 19> <5, 3, 16> <6, 10, 19> <8, 6, 14> <9, 4, 12>]
