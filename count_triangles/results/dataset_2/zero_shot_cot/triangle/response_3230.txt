Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 10) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 11) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 12) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 18) (2, 0) (18, 17) (18, 8) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 12) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 12) (8, 16) (8, 18) (19, 14) (19, 4) (19, 7) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 15) (12, 13) (3, 5) (3, 0) (4, 19) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 7) (10, 16) (7, 14) (7, 19) (7, 13)
