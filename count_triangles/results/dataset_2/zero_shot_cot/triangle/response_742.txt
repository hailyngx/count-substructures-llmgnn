Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (12, 8) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 0) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 0) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 1)
