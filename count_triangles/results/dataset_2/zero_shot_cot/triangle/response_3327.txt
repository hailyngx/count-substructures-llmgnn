Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 15) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 17) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 12) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 8) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (15, 16) (15, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 5) (5, 7) (5, 10) (17, 7) (17, 3) (19, 11) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 12) (14, 16) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 19) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 14) (12, 8) (8, 6) (8, 18) (8, 3) (8, 12)
