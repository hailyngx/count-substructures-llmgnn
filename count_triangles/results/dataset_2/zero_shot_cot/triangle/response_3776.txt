Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 10) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 2) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 2) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 11) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 12)
