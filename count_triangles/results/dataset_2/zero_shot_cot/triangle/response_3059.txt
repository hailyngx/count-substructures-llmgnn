Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 15) (9, 6) (9, 8) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 10) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 8) (18, 14) (18, 13) (17, 15) (17, 1) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 10) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 13) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 2) (16, 4) (16, 2) (12, 8) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 11) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 12) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 10) (13, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 13)
