Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 12) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 17) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 7) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 17) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 19) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (16, 8) (18, 19) (18, 14) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 14) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 12) (14, 7) (4, 11) (7, 8) (7, 14)
