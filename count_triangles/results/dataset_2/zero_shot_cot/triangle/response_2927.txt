Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 15) (16, 0) (16, 14) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 16) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 10) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 13) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 5) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 18) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 19) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 19) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 5) (18, 9) (18, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 10) (19, 7) (19, 1) 

Response:
[<0, 3, 18>, <4, 9, 10>, <5, 7, 12>, <7, 10, 19>, <8, 1, 2>, <8, 2, 6>, <8, 2, 15>, <9, 10, 13>, <9, 3, 4>, <11, 12, 15>, <14, 16, 17>]
