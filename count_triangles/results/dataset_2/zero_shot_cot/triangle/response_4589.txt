Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 9) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 2) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 9) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 4) (14, 8) (14, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 10) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [7].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<4, 6, 10>
<7, 8, 12>
<2, 9, 11>
<1, 2, 13>
<6, 8, 14>
<0, 1, 12>
<3, 4, 6>
