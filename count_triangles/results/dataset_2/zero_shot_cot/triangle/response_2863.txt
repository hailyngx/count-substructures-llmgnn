Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 11) (9, 18) (9, 10) (9, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 11) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 18) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 8) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 16) (15, 10) (15, 11) (13, 17) (13, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 7) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 4) (4, 19) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 2) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 8) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 8) (2, 1) (2, 12) (18, 5) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 0) (6, 4) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 15) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 14, 1>
<7, 8, 10>
<10, 16, 17>
<10, 16, 8>
<10, 11, 15>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
