Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 11) (9, 3) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 11) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 11) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 12)
