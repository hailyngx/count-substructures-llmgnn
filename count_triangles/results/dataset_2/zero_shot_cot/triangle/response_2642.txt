Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 12) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 14)
