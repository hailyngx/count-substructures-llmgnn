Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 22) (16, 10) (4, 11) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 15) (20, 3) (20, 18) (20, 23) (14, 27) (14, 12) (14, 24) (2, 5) (17, 18) (17, 21) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 8) (28, 6) (28, 3) (28, 9) (28, 18) (9, 28) (9, 8) (22, 16) (22, 8) (3, 11) (3, 20) (3, 28) (3, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 19) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 19) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 24) (19, 23) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 22) (8, 25) (8, 1) (18, 20) (18, 17) (18, 28) (24, 14) (24, 6) (24, 19) (10, 16) (10, 0) (10, 25) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 23) (29, 26) (29, 21) (27, 14) (26, 29) (26, 12) (15, 4) (15, 0) (15, 23) (23, 20) (23, 19) (23, 1) (23, 15) (25, 8) (25, 10) (25, 21) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 26) (12, 21) (21, 17) (21, 29) (21, 25) (21, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles in the graph
- A triangle is formed when there are three nodes connected by edges to each other.
