Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 13) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 11) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 1) (14, 4) (14, 9) (14, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [9].

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 12, 7>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 6, 3>
<7, 5, 6>
<7, 5, 8>
<12, 7, 0>
<5, 11, 3>
<9, 14, 1>
<0, 2, 10>
