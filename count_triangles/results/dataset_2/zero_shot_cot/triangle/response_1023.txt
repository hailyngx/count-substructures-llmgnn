Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 11) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 13) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 13) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 12) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 6) 

Response:

<0, 4, 13>
<3, 7, 11>
<4, 6, 13>
<6, 12, 14>
<8, 10, 11>
<8, 10, 0>
<8, 10, 6>
