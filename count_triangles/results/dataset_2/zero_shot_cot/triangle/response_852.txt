Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 14) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 8) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 18) (13, 17) (13, 8) (10, 15) (10, 14) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 16) (2, 0) (18, 8) (18, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (1, 15) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 6) (7, 16) (16, 2) (16, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 5) (19, 10) (19, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 6) (12, 3) (12, 6)
