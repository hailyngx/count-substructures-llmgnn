Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 24) (5, 21) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (15, 19) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 11) (27, 29) (27, 26) (0, 7) (0, 28) (24, 5) (24, 22) (24, 28) (24, 14) (26, 27) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (13, 1) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 28) (6, 29) (10, 9) (10, 19) (10, 20) (19, 15) (19, 10) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 3) (22, 24) (22, 19) (22, 12) (4, 26) (4, 21) (4, 2) (16, 23) (29, 27) (29, 6) (29, 8) (29, 12) (11, 15) (11, 7) (11, 8) (18, 19) (18, 8) (25, 15) (25, 12) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 2) (14, 24) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 8) (28, 0) (28, 24) (28, 1) (28, 17) (23, 16) (23, 21) (23, 20) (8, 29) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 14) (12, 22) (12, 29) (12, 25) (12, 20) (20, 10) (20, 23) (20, 12) (21, 5) (21, 26) (21, 4) (21, 23) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (17, 15) (17, 26) (17, 28) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other, forming a triangle. 

Let's start by listing the unique triangles we find:

<5, 9, 10>
<5, 9, 2>
<5, 21, 26>
<5, 21, 24>
<9, 2, 4>
<15, 19, 10>
<15, 19, 22>
<15, 19, 3>
<15, 19, 18>
<15, 19, 11>
<15, 25, 12>
<15, 25, 17>
<15, 25, 23>
<27, 26, 4>
<0, 7, 11>
<0, 7, 8>
<24, 5, 21>
<24, 5, 22>
<24, 14, 1>
<24, 14, 3>
<1, 13, 14>
<19, 10, 20>
<19, 10, 18>
<19, 22, 12>
<19, 22, 24>
<19, 18, 8>
<22, 12, 29>
<22, 12, 20>
<4, 26, 21>
<4, 26, 17>
<26, 17, 28>
<7, 0, 11>
<7, 11, 8>
<13, 1, 14>
<11, 8, 18>
<25, 15, 12>
<25, 12, 20>
<3, 19, 14>
<28, 24, 1>
<28, 24, 17>
<16, 23, 20>
<29, 6, 8>
<29, 27, 26>

Now, let's count the total number of unique triangles:
