Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 14) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 7) (2, 18) (2, 9) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 17) (0, 5) (14, 16) (14, 9) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 19) (12, 16) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 19) (6, 1) (6, 19) (6, 13) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 3) (19, 3) (19, 1) (19, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 15) (5, 10) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (10, 1) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 8) (17, 18) (13, 6) (13, 15) (13, 9) 

Response:
