Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 10) (27, 11) (27, 26) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 29) (8, 11) (13, 20) (13, 10) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 20) (11, 27) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 1) (23, 8) (23, 1) (22, 6) (22, 17) (22, 12) (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 20) (6, 22) (6, 28) (6, 17) (6, 12) (28, 6) (28, 16) (28, 12) (28, 15) (28, 20) (4, 5) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 16) (3, 19) (21, 25) (21, 2) (1, 11) (1, 23) (1, 15) (1, 9) (15, 28) (15, 1) (15, 29) (15, 14) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 2) (19, 5) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 24) (2, 21) (2, 16) (12, 22) (12, 6) (12, 28) (17, 22) (17, 6) (17, 4) (17, 7) (9, 1) (9, 20) (9, 7) (25, 21) (25, 19) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 29) (24, 8) (24, 19) (24, 7) (7, 17) (7, 9) (7, 24) (29, 8) (29, 15) (29, 14) (20, 13) (20, 10) (20, 5) (20, 28) (20, 9) (26, 27) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
<8, 11, 10>
<7, 24, 29>
<5, 20, 28>
<1, 11, 10>
<4, 17, 6>
<1, 15, 28>
<1, 11, 27>
<20, 9, 7>
<15, 28, 16>
<19, 25, 21> 

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
