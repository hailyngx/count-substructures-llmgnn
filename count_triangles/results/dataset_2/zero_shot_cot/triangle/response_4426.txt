Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 5) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [22].
The unique triangles found are <1, 6, 12>, <1, 7, 12>, <1, 9, 14>, <2, 6, 10>, <2, 6, 11>, <2, 6, 13>, <2, 8, 10>, <2, 8, 12>, <2, 8, 13>, <2, 10, 11>, <2, 13, 6>, <2, 13, 7>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 0, 10>, <4, 0, 8>, <4, 2, 13>, <4, 3, 5>, <4, 5, 11>, <5, 3, 4>, <5, 11, 14>, <5, 14, 9>, <8, 10, 2>.
