Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 8) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 14) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) 

Response:
