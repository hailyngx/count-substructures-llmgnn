Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 14) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 10) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) 

Response:
