Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) 

Response:
[<0, 2, 4> <0, 2, 6> <0, 2, 1> <0, 4, 6> <0, 7, 3> <0, 7, 6> <0, 1, 6> <2, 4, 1> <2, 4, 6> <2, 0, 6> <3, 5, 8> <3, 7, 8> <5, 8, 2>]
