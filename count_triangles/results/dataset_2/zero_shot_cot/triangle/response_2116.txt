Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 12) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 6) (12, 7) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 13) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7)
