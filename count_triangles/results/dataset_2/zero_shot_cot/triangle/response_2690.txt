Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
Following the steps to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Calculate the total number of triangles:
Given that the graph has 10 nodes, we need to find all possible triangles using the provided edges.

2. Identify unique triangles (cycles of length 3) in the graph:
By examining the given edges, we can identify the unique triangles present in the graph. Let's list them: 
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 7, 8>

3. Calculate the total number of triangles:
From the identified unique triangles, we can see that there are 6 unique triangles present in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [6]
