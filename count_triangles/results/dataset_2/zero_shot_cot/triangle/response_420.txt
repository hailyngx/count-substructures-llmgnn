Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 16) (9, 3) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 4) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 2) (7, 0) (7, 18) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 18) (16, 5) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 19) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 12) (11, 0) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 14) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 2) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 2) (14, 13) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 11) (15, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14)
