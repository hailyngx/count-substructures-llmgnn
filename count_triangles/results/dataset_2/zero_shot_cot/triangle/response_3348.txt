Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2)
