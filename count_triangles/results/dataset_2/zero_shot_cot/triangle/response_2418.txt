Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 23) (1, 19) (1, 27) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 1) (6, 28) (6, 0) (28, 6) (28, 16) (28, 24) (28, 18) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 16) (0, 2) (14, 23) (22, 26) (22, 27) (22, 5) (26, 22) (26, 15) (11, 9) (11, 17) (11, 20) (17, 11) (17, 2) (29, 21) (7, 3) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 18) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 8) (16, 28) (16, 0) (10, 9) (10, 5) (21, 29) (21, 18) (2, 0) (2, 17) (2, 9) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 4) (12, 20) (12, 8) (12, 23) (27, 1) (27, 22) (27, 25) (15, 26) (19, 1) (19, 13) (20, 11) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 8) (20, 13) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 25) (13, 19) (13, 20) (13, 9) (13, 24) (8, 25) (8, 12) (8, 20) (23, 1) (23, 14) (23, 12) (5, 22) (5, 10) (5, 4) (18, 28) (18, 7) (18, 21) (18, 24) (24, 28) (24, 13) (24, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph.

A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected. For example, in the given graph, the nodes (1, 3, 6) form a triangle because there are edges connecting all three nodes.

We will list the triangles in the graph by determining all unique sets of three nodes forming triangles.

The total number of triangles and the unique triangles are as follows:

Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 17>
<0, 2, 9>
<7, 13, 20>
<12, 13, 25>
<18, 21, 24>
