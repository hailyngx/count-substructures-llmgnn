Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) 

Response:
[<0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <5, 6, 7>]
There are total of 4 triangles.
