Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 7) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 7) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 1) (3, 10) (3, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles connecting three nodes in the graph. 

In this graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 4, 11>   
<0, 6, 10>  
<0, 10, 14>   
<0, 10, 3>   
<0, 10, 6>  
<1, 2, 7>  
<1, 7, 13>   
<1, 7, 14>  
<2, 13, 12>   
<3, 10, 0>    
<4, 8, 12>    
<4, 8, 14>  
<6, 10, 12>    
<9, 12, 13>   

Counting these unique triangles, we can see that there are [14] triangles in the given graph.
