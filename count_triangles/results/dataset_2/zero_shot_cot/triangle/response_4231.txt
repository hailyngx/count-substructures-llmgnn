Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 16) (3, 13) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 15) (17, 0) (17, 18) (10, 15) (10, 14) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 12) (13, 3) (13, 11) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 11) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 14) (18, 5) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 0) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 19) (14, 11) (12, 15) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 17) (0, 18)
