Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 2) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 14) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 6) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 1) 

Response:
[<0, 3, 12> <0, 7, 14> <1, 6, 9> <2, 6, 11> <5, 8, 13>]
