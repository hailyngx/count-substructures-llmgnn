Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 22) (17, 4) (3, 25) (3, 24) (25, 14) (25, 3) (25, 15) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 18) (5, 2) (5, 29) (5, 20) (6, 21) (6, 11) (6, 27) (11, 6) (11, 23) (11, 9) (28, 13) (28, 20) (13, 17) (13, 28) (13, 7) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 15) (21, 6) (21, 16) (21, 23) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 18) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 23) (23, 11) (23, 26) (23, 21) (23, 9) (23, 20) (7, 13) (7, 18) (7, 2) (16, 21) (16, 8) (4, 17) (4, 22) (4, 24) (22, 17) (22, 4) (22, 29) (19, 2) (19, 10) (10, 26) (10, 8) (10, 19) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 19) (2, 15) (15, 25) (15, 26) (15, 2) (15, 24) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 18) (24, 3) (24, 4) (24, 15) (24, 29) (20, 5) (20, 28) (20, 23) (27, 6) (29, 5) (29, 22) (29, 24) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of 14 unique triangles in this graph. 

The triangles found are:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 1, 18>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 7, 15>
<2, 15, 24>
<2, 19, 10>
<4, 22, 29>
<5, 20, 29>
<6, 11, 23>
<6, 21, 23>
<8, 10, 19>
<8, 16, 21>
<8, 18, 0>
<13, 17, 28>

The total number of triangles is [14].
