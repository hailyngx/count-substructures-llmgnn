Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 2) (4, 3) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 7) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14)
