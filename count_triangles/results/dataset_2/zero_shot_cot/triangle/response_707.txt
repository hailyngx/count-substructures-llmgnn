Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 13) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 4) (3, 6) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [10].

1. <5, 0, 2>
2. <5, 0, 13>
3. <5, 2, 7>
4. <5, 2, 0>
5. <4, 1, 13>
6. <4, 1, 11>
7. <4, 7, 14>
8. <4, 7, 12>
9. <0, 6, 14>
10. <0, 13, 14>
