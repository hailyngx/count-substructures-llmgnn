Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 5) (16, 15) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 19) (4, 2) (4, 10) (0, 18) (0, 5) (10, 4) (10, 18) (18, 0) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 1) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 18) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 6) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 15) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 19) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 0)
