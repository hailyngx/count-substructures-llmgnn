Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 22) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (20, 25) (20, 12) (20, 22) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 19) (25, 21) (25, 14) (10, 7) (10, 21) (10, 5) (17, 29) (17, 3) (17, 11) (8, 28) (8, 15) (29, 17) (29, 11) (29, 18) (19, 25) (19, 5) (19, 18) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 28) (9, 21) (9, 24) (9, 0) (22, 4) (22, 20) (22, 28) (22, 0) (1, 4) (1, 15) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 22) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 13) (18, 29) (18, 19) (18, 24) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 14) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 21) (3, 13) (21, 25) (21, 10) (21, 9) (21, 3) (21, 24) (12, 20) (12, 16) (16, 2) (16, 12) (16, 23) (28, 8) (28, 2) (28, 22) (11, 17) (11, 29) (11, 5) (23, 16) (14, 20) (14, 25) (14, 5) (27, 6) (6, 25) (6, 27) (24, 9) (24, 18) (24, 21) (24, 13) (13, 15) (13, 3) (13, 24) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [16]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 7, 22>, <0, 9, 21>, <0, 22, 4>, <1, 15, 13>, <2, 3, 28>, <2, 16, 12>, <3, 13, 24>, <3, 17, 11>, <5, 10, 21>, <5, 11, 17>, <5, 14, 25>, <6, 25, 27>, <8, 15, 1>, <9, 21, 24>, <10, 7, 21>, <18, 19, 24>.
