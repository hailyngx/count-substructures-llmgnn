Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7)
