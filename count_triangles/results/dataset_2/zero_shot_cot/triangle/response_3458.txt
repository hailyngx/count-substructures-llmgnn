Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are: <1, 2, 3>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 8, 2>, <4, 5, 9>, <8, 0, 3>.
