Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (10, 2) (10, 12)
