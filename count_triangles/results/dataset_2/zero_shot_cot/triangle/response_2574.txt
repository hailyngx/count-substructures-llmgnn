Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph.

By checking the given edges, we can identify the triangles formed by the nodes. 

The possible triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 7>

Counting the number of unique triangles: [15] 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
