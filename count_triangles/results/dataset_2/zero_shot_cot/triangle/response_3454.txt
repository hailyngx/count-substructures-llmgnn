Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 20) (1, 19) (1, 22) (21, 9) (21, 12) (21, 15) (12, 21) (12, 27) (12, 10) (12, 22) (27, 12) (27, 8) (28, 29) (28, 5) (29, 28) (29, 9) (29, 22) (15, 21) (15, 20) (15, 7) (15, 16) (20, 1) (20, 15) (20, 23) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 25) (18, 3) (7, 15) (7, 25) (7, 23) (7, 14) (7, 5) (25, 18) (25, 7) (25, 8) (9, 21) (9, 29) (9, 11) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 8) (0, 13) (16, 15) (16, 22) (16, 8) (5, 28) (5, 7) (5, 26) (5, 22) (26, 5) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 8) (2, 6) (23, 20) (23, 7) (23, 26) (6, 2) (6, 24) (24, 6) (24, 3) (24, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 14) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 11) (10, 12) (10, 26) (10, 24) (3, 18) (3, 24) (3, 19) (19, 1) (19, 3) (22, 1) (22, 12) (22, 29) (22, 16) (22, 5) (8, 27) (8, 25) (8, 17) (8, 16) (8, 26) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph.

Unique triangles found: 
<7, 14, 25>
<7, 14, 11>
<7, 14, 13>
<7, 14, 5>
<7, 14, 23>
<11, 14, 13>
<11, 14, 7>
<3, 19, 24> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
