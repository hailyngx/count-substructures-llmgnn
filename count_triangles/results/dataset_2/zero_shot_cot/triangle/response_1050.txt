Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 15) (27, 0) (27, 17) (27, 8) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 23) (3, 12) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 16) (10, 21) (10, 1) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 20) (22, 11) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 6) (22, 5) (23, 3) (23, 22) (23, 28) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 29) (12, 26) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 26) (1, 6) (26, 12) (26, 1) (26, 29) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 4) (8, 27) (8, 15) (4, 22) (4, 2) (4, 18) (4, 9) (18, 4) (18, 17) (13, 17) (13, 28) (17, 27) (17, 25) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 13) (21, 0) (21, 10) (21, 20) (19, 15) (6, 22) (6, 1) (24, 28) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 29) (16, 25) (9, 25) (9, 4) (14, 28) (20, 11) (20, 12) (20, 21) (29, 12) (29, 26) (29, 15) (5, 22) (5, 7) (5, 28) (28, 23) (28, 13) (28, 24) (28, 14) (28, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are <0, 21, 10>, <0, 27, 8>, <3, 25, 17>, <3, 25, 16>, <3, 11, 22>, <7, 12, 1>, <12, 26, 1>, <15, 15, 29>.
