Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 22 unique triangles in the given graph. The triangles are as follows:

<3, 6, 9>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 6>
<4, 9, 6>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 9, 7>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 4>
<3, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [22].
