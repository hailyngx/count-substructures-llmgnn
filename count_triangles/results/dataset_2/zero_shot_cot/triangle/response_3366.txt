Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 5: (5, 9, 6), (5, 9, 8), (5, 9, 1), (5, 6, 8), (5, 6, 1), (5, 8, 1), (5, 9, 7), (5, 6, 7), (5, 8, 7)
2. Node 9: (9, 6, 7)
3. Node 6: (6, 3, 2)
4. Node 1: (1, 4, 8), (1, 4, 3)
5. Node 3: (3, 4, 7)
6. Node 4: (4, 2, 8)
7. Node 8: (8, 2, 7)

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11], and the unique triangles found are <5, 9, 6>, <5, 9, 8>, <5, 9, 1>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 1>, <5, 8, 1>, <5, 9, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 8, 7>, <9, 6, 7>, <6, 3, 2>.
