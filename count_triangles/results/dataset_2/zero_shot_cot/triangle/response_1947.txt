Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 13) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 20) (26, 25) (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 28) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 25) (3, 25) (3, 23) (25, 26) (25, 21) (25, 3) (25, 16) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 18) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 7) (15, 1) (15, 20) (15, 22) (15, 14) (15, 12) (20, 26) (20, 15) (20, 8) (4, 6) (18, 11) (18, 23) (18, 29) (7, 10) (7, 17) (12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 8) (5, 26) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (23, 3) (23, 10) (23, 18) (2, 17) (2, 22) (2, 19) (22, 15) (22, 2) (22, 28) (22, 29) (16, 25) (16, 12) (16, 27) (14, 15) (14, 8) (14, 28) (14, 19) (0, 1) (0, 8) (28, 1) (28, 22) (28, 14) (8, 20) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 0) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 29) (19, 27) (27, 21) (27, 16) (27, 19) (29, 18) (29, 22) (29, 19) (13, 9) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Look for each node that has two edges connecting it to two other nodes. This will form a triangle.

From the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:

<1, 5, 15>
<1, 21, 25>
<1, 15, 20>
<1, 15, 28>
<1, 20, 26>
<2, 17, 22>
<5, 6, 26>
<8, 12, 14>
<8, 14, 19>
<10, 17, 23>
<11, 18, 23>
<15, 20, 26>
<15, 20, 28>
<16, 25, 27>
<19, 22, 29>

2. Now, let's count the total number of triangles mentioned above:

[15]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 15.
