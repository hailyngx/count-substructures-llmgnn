Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (12, 14) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 0) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 13) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 10) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
We can count the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each possible triangle formed by three nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other by edges.

Let's list out all the unique triangles found in the graph:

<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 11>
<1, 3, 0>
<1, 6, 4>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 11>
<3, 5, 10>
<3, 6, 4>
<5, 6, 4>
<8, 7, 2>
<9, 14, 13>
<4, 6, 10>
<12, 14, 9>
<2, 13, 0>
<11, 13, 0>
<7, 13, 2>
<10, 14, 2>
<5, 0, 9>
<0, 13, 9>

From the list above, we can see there are 19 unique triangles in the graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [19].
