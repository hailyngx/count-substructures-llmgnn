Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 1) (6, 7) (6, 14) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 2) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 1) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 1)
