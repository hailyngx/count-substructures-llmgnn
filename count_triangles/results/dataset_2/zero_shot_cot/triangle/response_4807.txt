Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 22) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 29) (20, 2) (25, 29) (25, 28) (28, 6) (28, 25) (28, 29) (29, 3) (29, 25) (29, 28) (29, 14) (18, 23) (19, 26) (19, 8) (19, 10) (26, 19) (26, 14) (26, 15) (26, 0) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 11) (15, 26) (15, 12) (7, 1) (7, 24) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 22) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 27) (16, 21) (16, 2) (16, 5) (21, 16) (21, 22) (21, 2) (2, 20) (2, 16) (2, 21) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 11) (23, 18) (23, 13) (23, 27) (0, 6) (0, 26) (0, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 13) (24, 7) (24, 27) (24, 5) (5, 12) (5, 16) (5, 0) (5, 24) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 22) (22, 1) (22, 8) (22, 21) (22, 11) (27, 14) (27, 23) (27, 24) (27, 13) (13, 23) (13, 10) (13, 27)
