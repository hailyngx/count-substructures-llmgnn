Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 11 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are as follows:
<4, 1, 6>
<4, 1, 9>
<4, 8, 5>
<4, 0, 2>
<4, 6, 1>
<4, 8, 2>
<1, 9, 6>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 9, 1>
<2, 8, 4>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [11].
