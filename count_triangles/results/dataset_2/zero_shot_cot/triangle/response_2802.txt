Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 11) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are 13 triangles in the given graph. 

Unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 11>
<1, 4, 13>
<1, 13, 10>
<1, 6, 4>
<2, 3, 13>
<2, 11, 4>
<4, 7, 10>
<6, 3, 4>
<7, 10, 0>
<9, 14, 7>
<11, 12, 2>
<11, 13, 14>
<11, 14, 4> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [13].
