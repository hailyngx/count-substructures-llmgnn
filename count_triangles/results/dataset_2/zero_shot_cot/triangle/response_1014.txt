Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 3) 

Response:
We will count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Let's denote the nodes as follows:
0 = A, 1 = B, 2 = C, 3 = D, 4 = E, 5 = F, 6 = G, 7 = H, 8 = I, 9 = J, 10 = K, 11 = L, 12 = M, 13 = N, 14 = O.

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
<4, 0, 7>
<4, 6, 13>
<4, 13, 5>
<5, 8, 14>
<5, 10, 14>
<6, 1, 14>
<6, 2, 13>
<12, 3, 2>
<12, 10, 11>

There are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
