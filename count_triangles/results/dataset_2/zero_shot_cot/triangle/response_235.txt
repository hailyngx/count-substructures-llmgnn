Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (25, 5) (25, 21) (22, 23) (22, 10) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 13) (7, 2) (12, 24) (12, 19) (19, 12) (19, 24) (26, 23) (26, 5) (26, 11) (5, 25) (5, 26) (5, 8) (5, 21) (13, 23) (13, 9) (28, 0) (28, 14) (28, 18) (28, 15) (9, 13) (9, 24) (9, 1) (29, 27) (29, 16) (29, 0) (27, 29) (27, 11) (27, 2) (18, 28) (18, 21) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 8) (17, 23) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 24) (8, 20) (8, 21) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 17) (0, 15) (16, 29) (16, 17) (16, 1) (20, 8) (20, 21) (24, 12) (24, 19) (24, 9) (24, 8) (15, 28) (15, 6) (15, 0) (15, 4) (21, 25) (21, 5) (21, 18) (21, 8) (21, 20) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 10) (14, 28) (14, 1) (11, 26) (11, 27) (10, 22) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (2, 7) (2, 27) (2, 10) (4, 15) (4, 10) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [32].
The unique triangles found are <8, 5, 21>, <8, 5, 26>, <9, 13, 24>, <9, 13, 1>, <9, 24, 12>, <9, 24, 8>, <6, 15, 0>, <6, 15, 28>, <21, 5, 25>, <21, 5, 8>, <17, 6, 15>, <17, 6, 8>, <17, 16, 1>, <17, 16, 29>, <0, 15, 28>, <0, 15, 6>, <0, 15, 4>, <25, 5, 21>, <26, 5, 8>, <26, 5, 11>, <10, 1, 9>, <10, 1, 14>, <23, 22, 10>, <23, 22, 13>, <23, 22, 17>, <23, 26, 5>, <23, 26, 11>, <28, 15, 6>, <28, 15, 4>, <28, 18, 21>, <1, 10, 4>.
