Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 7) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 11) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 14) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 10) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10)
