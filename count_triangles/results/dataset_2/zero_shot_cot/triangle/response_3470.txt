Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 5) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 14) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 9) 

Response:
