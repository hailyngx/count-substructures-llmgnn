Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 9) (17, 10) (17, 3) (1, 5) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 17) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 13) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (7, 14) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 15) (13, 11) (13, 16) (19, 4) (19, 12) (16, 5) (16, 13) (16, 4) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 12) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 4) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 9) (18, 1) (18, 15) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 19) (12, 15)
