Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 10) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 11) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 7) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 10) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 3)
