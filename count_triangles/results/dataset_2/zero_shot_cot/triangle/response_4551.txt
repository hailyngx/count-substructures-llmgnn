Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 14) (17, 9) (17, 2) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 12) (3, 7) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 15) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 14) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 6) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 14) (16, 5) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 12) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 15) (5, 8) (5, 16) (5, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 5) (18, 1) (4, 3) (4, 11) (13, 9) (14, 10) (14, 15) (14, 19) (14, 16)
