Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 9) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 15) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 19) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 18) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 5) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 19) (19, 9) (19, 17) (19, 11) (5, 14) (5, 17) (5, 12) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 18) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 10) (12, 0) (12, 5) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 16) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 10) (18, 13) (18, 6) (18, 10)
