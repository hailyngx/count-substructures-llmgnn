Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 6) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 13) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 14) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 9) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 13) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 9)
