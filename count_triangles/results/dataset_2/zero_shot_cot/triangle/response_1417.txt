Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 19) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 4) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 1) (13, 17) (13, 4) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 7) (18, 19) (18, 7) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 1) (0, 15) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 5) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 12) (1, 8) (1, 19) (11, 7) (11, 9) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 6) (7, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 4) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 14) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 5) (16, 8) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 12)
