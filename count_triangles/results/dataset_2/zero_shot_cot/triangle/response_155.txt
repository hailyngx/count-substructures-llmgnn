Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 3) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 0) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 9) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 8, 13>
<0, 12, 2>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 4>
<7, 1, 6>
<7, 5, 2>
<9, 4, 2>
<9, 3, 12>
