Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 1) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 11) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 2) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 10) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 3) (13, 2) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, 3, 12, 6, 10, 11, 14, 8, 2, and 13.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5, there are 5 neighboring nodes: 9, 6, 8, 12, 10.
So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center.
The 3-stars with node 5 as the center are: <5, (9, 12, 10)>, <5, (9, 6, 10)>, <5, (6, 8, 10)>, <5, (6, 8, 12)>, <5, (8, 12, 10)>.

Similarly, calculating for the other nodes, we get:
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars, uniquely: <9, (4, 2, 1)>, <9, (4, 2, 14)>, <9, (4, 1, 12)>, <9, (4, 1, 14)>, <9, (2, 1, 14)>.
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars, uniquely: <4, (7, 11, 9)>, <4, (7, 11, 1)>.
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars, uniquely: <7, (4, 11, 12)>, <7, (4, 12, 10)>.
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars, uniquely: <1, (3, 14, 12)>, <1, (3, 14, 6)>.
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars, uniquely: <3, (14, 6, 8)>.
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars, uniquely: <12, (7, 1, 5)>, <12, (7, 1, 9)>.
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars, uniquely: <6, (3, 11, 5)>.
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars, uniquely: <10, (7, 8, 5)>.
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars, uniquely: <11, (7, 14, 4)>.
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars, uniquely: <14, (1, 11, 9)>, <14, (1, 11, 3)>.
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars, uniquely: <8, (5, 6, 10)>.
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars, uniquely: <2, (9, 14, 0)>.
- Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 0 = 72.
Therefore, the final answer is: [72].
