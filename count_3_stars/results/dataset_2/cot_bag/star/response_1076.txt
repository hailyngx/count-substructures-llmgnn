Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 1 and node 6.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1:
There are 5 neighbors of node 1: 3, 6, 5, 9, and 8. 
So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 1 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 6:
There are 5 neighbors of node 6: 4, 7, 1, 9, and 0.
So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 6 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 = 20 \), which we can write as \( [20] \).

The unique 3-stars formed in this graph are: 
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 6)>
