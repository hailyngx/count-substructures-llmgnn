Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 26) (9, 24) (9, 20) (9, 1) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 0) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 28) (23, 19) (12, 22) (12, 17) (12, 3) (27, 24) (27, 8) (15, 22) (15, 10) (20, 9) (20, 17) (20, 8) (0, 22) (0, 21) (0, 17) (0, 19) (14, 10) (14, 21) (19, 23) (19, 0) (26, 6) (26, 10) (26, 25) (26, 17) (21, 0) (21, 14) (21, 3) (28, 23) (28, 16) (28, 1) (4, 10) (4, 11) (5, 13) (5, 25) (5, 29) (13, 5) (13, 7) (17, 12) (17, 20) (17, 0) (17, 26) (17, 7) (16, 28) (16, 1) (16, 25) (16, 2) (3, 12) (3, 21) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (10, 15) (10, 14) (10, 26) (10, 4) (7, 13) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 29) (1, 9) (1, 28) (1, 16) (1, 29) (1, 25) (29, 5) (29, 7) (29, 1) (8, 27) (8, 20) (24, 9) (24, 27) (25, 26) (25, 5) (25, 16) (25, 1) (25, 2) (2, 6) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 25) 

Response:
There are several nodes with more than 3 neighbors, so we need to consider each of them for forming 3-stars.

1. Node 0:  It has 4 neighbors (22, 17, 19, 21). 
   Number of 3-stars formed with node 0: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   3-stars: <0, (22, 17, 19)>, <0, (22, 17, 21)>, <0, (22, 19, 21)>, <0, (17, 19, 21)>

2. Node 1: It has 5 neighbors (9, 28, 16, 25, 29). 
   Number of 3-stars formed with node 1: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   3-stars: <1, (9, 28, 16)>, <1, (9, 28, 25)>, <1, (9, 28, 29)>, <1, (9, 16, 25)>, <1, (9, 16, 29)>, 
           <1, (9, 25, 29)>, <1, (28, 16, 25)>, <1, (28, 16, 29)>, <1, (28, 25, 29)>, <1, (16, 25, 29)>

3. Node 2: It has 4 neighbors (6, 3, 25, 16). 
   Number of 3-stars formed with node 2: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   3-stars: <2, (6, 3, 25)>, <2, (6, 3, 16)>, <2, (6, 25, 16)>, <2, (3, 25, 16)>

4. Node 7: It has 4 neighbors (13, 17, 11, 29). 
   Number of 3-stars formed with node 7: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   3-stars: <7, (13, 17, 11)>, <7, (13, 17, 29)>, <7, (13, 11, 29)>, <7, (17, 11, 29)>

5. Node 9: It has 3 neighbors (24, 20, 1). 
   Number of 3-stars formed with node 9: 1
   3-star: <9, (24, 20, 1)>

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 23\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].
