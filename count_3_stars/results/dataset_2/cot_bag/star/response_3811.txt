Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 29) (7, 1) (21, 3) (21, 10) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 27) (10, 21) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 2) (20, 5) (28, 29) (28, 22) (28, 14) (28, 24) (29, 7) (29, 28) (29, 16) (22, 28) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 6) (22, 24) (26, 22) (26, 2) (26, 3) (3, 21) (3, 13) (3, 26) (3, 12) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 27) (19, 12) (4, 22) (4, 12) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 4) (12, 25) (16, 29) (16, 2) (16, 6) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 18) (9, 14) (25, 12) (25, 6) (25, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 5) (2, 17) (2, 26) (2, 16) (2, 25) (24, 28) (24, 22) (24, 0) (24, 5) (0, 13) (0, 24) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 6) (14, 28) (14, 9) (27, 13) (27, 19) (5, 10) (5, 20) (5, 1) (5, 24) (6, 22) (6, 16) (6, 25) (6, 18) (6, 23) (23, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 7, 8, 13, 5
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 17, 26, 16, 25
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 21, 13, 26, 12
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 22, 12, 24
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 10, 20, 1, 24
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 22, 16, 25, 18, 23
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 13, 19, 11, 1, 27
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 21, 17, 18, 5
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 8, 19, 18, 6
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 3, 19, 4, 25
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 8, 3, 1, 0, 27
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 29, 2, 6
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 8, 11, 27, 12
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors: 28, 26, 4, 6, 24
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: 28, 22, 0, 5
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors: 12, 2, 6
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: 22, 3, 2
- Node 27 has 2 neighbors: 13, 19
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: 29, 22, 14, 24

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (4 nodes), there are no 3-stars.
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors (14 nodes), we'll apply the combination formula: \( \binom{n}{3} \)
  - \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 103 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [103].

Some of the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (7, 8, 13)>, <2, (17, 26, 16)>, <3, (21, 13, 26)>, <4, (22, 12, 24)>, <5, (10, 20, 1)>, <6, (22, 16, 25)>, <8, (13, 19, 11)>, <10, (21, 17, 18)>, <11, (8, 19, 18)>, <12, (3, 19, 4)>, <13, (8, 3, 1)>, <16, (29, 2, 6)>, <19, (8, 11, 27)>, <22, (28, 26, 4)>, <24, (28, 22, 0)>, and more.
