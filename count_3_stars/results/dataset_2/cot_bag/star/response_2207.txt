Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 4) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 2) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

For node 0: 
- Number of 3-stars = $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $

For node 2: 
- Number of 3-stars = $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $

For node 5: 
- Number of 3-stars = $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $

For node 7: 
- Number of 3-stars = $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $

For node 8: 
- Number of 3-stars = $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $

For node 9: 
- Number of 3-stars = $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $

For node 10: 
- Number of 3-stars = $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $

For node 11: 
- Number of 3-stars = $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $

For node 12: 
- Number of 3-stars = $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $

For node 13: 
- Number of 3-stars = $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $

For node 14: 
- Number of 3-stars = $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $

Summing up the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes, we get: 
4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 55

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [55].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 12, 13)>, <2, (4, 5, 13)>, <5, (2, 12, 13)>, <7, (1, 3, 14)>, <8, (0, 6, 10)>, <9, (2, 7, 10)>, <10, (0, 11, 14)>, <11, (1, 3, 14)>, <12, (0, 2, 13)>, <13, (2, 5, 12)>, <14, (7, 10, 11)>
