Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 10) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 10) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 9, 4, 14, 11, 1, 13.
- Node 2 has neighbors: 5, 13, 3, 12, 7.
- Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 14, 11.
- Node 8 has neighbors: 5, 4, 10, 12.
- Node 9 has neighbors: 7, 13, 0, 12.
- Node 10 has neighbors: 8, 14, 13, 1, 7.
- Node 11 has neighbors: 5, 6, 0, 14.
- Node 12 has neighbors: 9, 8, 14, 2.
- Node 13 has neighbors: 9, 0, 2, 10.
- Node 14 has neighbors: 6, 0, 11, 3, 12, 10.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.

Summing these up gives a total of 52 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (9, 4, 14)>, <0, (9, 1, 13)>, <0, (4, 1, 13)>, <0, (14, 11, 6)>, <2, (5, 13, 3)>, <8, (5, 4, 10)>, <9, (7, 13, 0)>, <10, (8, 14, 13)>, <11, (5, 6, 0)>, <12, (9, 8, 14)>, <13, (9, 0, 2)>, <14, (6, 11, 0)>.
