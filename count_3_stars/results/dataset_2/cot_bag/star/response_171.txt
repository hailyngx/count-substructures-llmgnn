Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (0 neighbors counted)
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 51

The total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [51].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (8, 9, 2)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
