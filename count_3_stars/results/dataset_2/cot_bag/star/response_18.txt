Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 1) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 6) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 4) (18, 11) (18, 8) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 19) (13, 17) (13, 7) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 15) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 11) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 10) (3, 10) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 12) (19, 2) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 12) (15, 0) (15, 16) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 0) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 10) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 12) (8, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
1: 5, 9, 1, 6
2: 5, 19, 6, 4
3: 10
4: 9, 14, 2, 0
5: 2, 12, 1
6: 17, 2, 1, 11
7: 13, 16, 10
8: 18
9: 4, 1
10: 7, 3, 19, 12
11: 18, 6, 12
12: 5, 11, 19, 10
13: 17, 7
14: 17, 0, 4
15: 0, 16
16: 0, 7, 15
17: 14, 13, 6
18: 11, 8
19: 2, 0, 10, 12

Based on the neighbors of each node, we can see that the nodes 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 19 have three or more neighbors, thus potentially forming 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 10: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 12: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 14: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For node 16: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For node 19: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 26 3-stars in the graph.

So, the final answer is [26].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (4, 6, 19)>, <4, (9, 14, 0)>, <6, (17, 2, 1)>, <10, (7, 3, 19)>, <12, (5, 11, 19)>, <14, (17, 0, 4)>, <16, (7, 15, 0)>
