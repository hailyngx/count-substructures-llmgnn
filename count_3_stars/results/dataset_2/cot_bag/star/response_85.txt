Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 15) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 3) (1, 17) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 14) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 12) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 15) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 19) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 15) (19, 0) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 15) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 15) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 14) (13, 10) (13, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, and 18.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = 1
- Node 7: has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: has 5 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: has 5 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: has 5 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 45 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <12, (16, 15, 14)>, <15, (14, 10, 12)>, <16, (17, 15, 12)>.
