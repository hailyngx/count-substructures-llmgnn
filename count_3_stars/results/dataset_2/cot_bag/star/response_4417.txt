Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 1) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 11. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 8, 11. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9. It can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 9, 2. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 1, 10, 11, 12, 14. It can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 10, 11, 12, 13, 2. It can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 11, 14. It can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 8, 14. It can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 64 3-stars.
Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in this graph is [64].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 9, 2)>, <6, (1, 10, 11)>, <7, (10, 12, 13)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <11, (0, 7, 14)>.
