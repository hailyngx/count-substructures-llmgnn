Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars at each node:
- Node 0: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 1: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 2: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 3: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 4: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 5: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 6: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 7: C(6, 3) = 20
- Node 8: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 9: C(4, 3) = 4

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 62

Therefore, there are a total of [62] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <5, 6, 7>
