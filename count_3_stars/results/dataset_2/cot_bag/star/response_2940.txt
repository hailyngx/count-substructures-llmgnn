Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (5, 1, 8), so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (9, 7, 3, 6, 0), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (4, 3, 8, 6), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3: 5 neighbors (5, 7, 1, 6, 2), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (9, 7, 6, 2), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (0, 3, 7), so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (4, 7, 1, 3, 2), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (5, 4, 3, 6, 1), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (4, 1, 9), so there is 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 51 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 51, and we can represent the unique 3-stars as follows:
\[ [51] \]
Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (5, 1, 8)>, <1, (9, 7, 3)>, <2, (4, 3, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 1)>, <4, (9, 7, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 1)>, <7, (5, 4, 3)>, <9, (4, 1, 9)>.
