Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 12) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 14) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 7, 12, 14.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (4, 1), (4, 3), (0, 6), (0, 7)
   Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <0, (4, 1, 3)>, <0, (4, 3, 7)> 

2. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 13), (14, 4)
   Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <4, (0, 1, 13)>, <4, (0, 3, 14)>, <4, (1, 3, 13)>, <4, (1, 3, 14)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 13, 14)>, <4, (1, 13, 14)>

3. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 11), (7, 12), (7, 8)
   Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <7, (0, 2, 12)>, <7, (0, 11, 12)>, <7, (0, 12, 8)>, <7, (2, 11, 12)>, <7, (2, 12, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 11)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 11, 8)>, <7, (2, 11, 8)>, <7, (11, 12, 8)>

4. Node 12 6 neighbors: (12, 3), (12, 6), (12, 7), (12, 8), (12, 13), (14, 12)
   Number of 3-stars with node 12 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
   <12, (3, 6, 13)>, <12, (3, 6, 14)>, <12, (3, 7, 13)>, <12, (3, 7, 14)>, <12, (3, 8, 13)>, <12, (3, 8, 14)>, <12, (6, 7, 13)>, <12, (6, 7, 14)>, <12, (6, 8, 13)>, <12, (6, 8, 14)>, <12, (7, 8, 13)>, <12, (7, 8, 14)>

5. Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (14, 2), (14, 4), (14, 8), (14, 12)
   Number of 3-stars with node 14 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <14, (2, 4, 8)>, <14, (2, 4, 12)>, <14, (2, 8, 12)>, <14, (4, 8, 12)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 48
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [48].
