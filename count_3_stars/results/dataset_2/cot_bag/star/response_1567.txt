Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given that the graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can create the following visualization:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (4, 6), (6, 2)
- 1: (9, 3), (9, 6)
- 2: (4, 3), (2, 0)
- 3: (5, 1), (1, 6), (3, 8)
- 4: (5, 4), (9, 4), (7, 4), (2, 4), (0, 4)
- 5: (9, 5), (5, 4), (7, 5), (3, 5)
- 6: (9, 6), (1, 6), (3, 6), (6, 8), (0, 6)
- 7: (5, 7), (9, 7), (4, 7)
- 8: (9, 8), (3, 8), (6, 8)
- 9: (5, 9), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 1), (9, 7), (8, 9)

For each node with three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars it's involved in:

- Node 4: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 44

So, there are 44 3-stars in the graph.

List of unique 3-stars found:
<4, (0, 6, 2)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 6)>
<9, (1, 8, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)> 

The final number of 3-stars is [44].
