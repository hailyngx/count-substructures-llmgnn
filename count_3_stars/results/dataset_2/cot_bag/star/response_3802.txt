Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
Node 0: 9, 4, 8
Node 1: 5, 3, 4, 8
Node 2: 5, 6, 3
Node 3: 1, 7, 2, 4, 8
Node 4: 1, 3, 7, 0
Node 5: 9, 6, 2, 1, 7
Node 6: 5, 7, 2, 8
Node 7: 5, 6, 3, 4, 8
Node 8: 6, 1, 3, 7, 0
Node 9: 5, 0

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
Node 1: 1 3-star
Node 3: 1 3-star
Node 4: 1 3-star
Node 5: 3 3-stars
Node 7: 3 3-stars
Node 8: 3 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 0)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (6, 1, 0)>
