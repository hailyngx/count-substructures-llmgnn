Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
Let's analyze each node:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
Node 1 has 6 neighbors.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For node 0, there are inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- For node 1, there are inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- For node 2, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- For node 3, there are inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- For node 4, there are inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- For node 7, there are inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Summing these up, we have a total of 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 64 3-stars. Hence, [64].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 2, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 4)>
<1, (6, 0, 3)>
<1, (6, 0, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 0, 2)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
