Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 11) (14, 6) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 1) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 4) (11, 15) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 17) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 16) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 16) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 8) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 12) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (12, 15) (12, 4) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 13) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 8) (16, 7) (18, 5) (18, 13) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 19.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 34\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].

Some of the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
- <0, 5, 19>
- <1, 3, 17>
- <4, 11, 15>
- <8, 10, 16>
- <13, 6, 18>
- <15, 11, 19>
