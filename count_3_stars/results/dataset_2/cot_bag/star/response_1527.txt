Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 3) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars and list them, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: neighbors {1, 5, 7, 8}, forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 7, 8, 9}, forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 4, 5, 6}, forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 5, 6, 9}, forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 7, 8}, forms 1 3-star
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}, forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: neighbors {2, 3, 5, 9}, forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5}, forms 1 3-star
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 9}, forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 3, 6, 8}, forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 36
So, there are 36 3-stars in this graph.
