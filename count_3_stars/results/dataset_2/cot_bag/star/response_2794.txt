Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 64 \)

Therefore, there are 64 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:

[64]
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
