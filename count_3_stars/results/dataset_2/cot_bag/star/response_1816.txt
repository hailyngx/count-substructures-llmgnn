Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 7) (9, 0) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 7) (18, 15) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 16) (14, 11) (14, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 19) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 11) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 18) (15, 10) (15, 4) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (8, 19) (8, 6) (8, 7) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 6) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 4) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 11) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 6) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 12) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 3) (12, 13) (12, 3) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: 5, 9, 16
- Node 1: 2, 10, 19
- Node 2: 1, 16, 17, 7
- Node 3: 14, 13, 7, 4, 12
- Node 4: 15, 13, 16, 3
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 8, 19, 11
- Node 7: 9, 2, 8, 3
- Node 8: 19, 6, 7
- Node 9: 7, 0
- Node 10: 1, 15, 19
- Node 11: 14, 17, 6, 11
- Node 12: 13, 3
- Node 13: 17, 4, 3, 12
- Node 14: 11, 3
- Node 15: 18, 10, 4
- Node 16: 2, 0, 4
- Node 17: 2, 13, 11
- Node 18: 15
- Node 19: 1, 10, 8, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 16, 17 and 7.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 4, and 12.
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes 13, 16, and 3.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 2, and 8.
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 6, and 14.
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 8, and 6.

Adding these up, we have a total of 6 unique 3-stars: 
<[2, 1, 16, 17], [3, 13, 4, 12], [4, 13, 16, 3], [7, 9, 2, 8], [11, 17, 6, 14], [19, 10, 8, 6]>,

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
