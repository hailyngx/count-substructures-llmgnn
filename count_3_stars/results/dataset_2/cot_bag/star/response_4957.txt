Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 16) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 8) (10, 7) (10, 2) (11, 0) (11, 18) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 1) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 16) (1, 2) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 4) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 14) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 4) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 19) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 18) (6, 17) (16, 9) (16, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, and 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 13: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 18: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 19: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 31

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<2, (5, 10, 12)>, 
<2, (5, 10, 1)>, 
<2, (5, 12, 4)>, 
<2, (5, 12, 0)>, 
<5, (2, 8, 14)>, 
<5, (9, 8, 15)>, 
<5, (9, 15, 3)>, 
<5, (9, 15, 8)>, 
<4, (3, 17, 12)>, 
<4, (3, 17, 19)>, 
<4, (17, 7, 13)>, 
<4, (17, 13, 8)>, 
<14, (5, 7, 16)>, 
<14, (5, 18, 16)>, 
<14, (7, 13, 17)>, 
<14, (7, 13, 16)>, 
<15, (9, 3, 8)>, 
<15, (9, 3, 18)>, 
<15, (9, 8, 14)>, 
<15, (9, 8, 14)>
