Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 9) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 14) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 15) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 8) (12, 16) (12, 0) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 15) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 18) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 4) (18, 11) (18, 13) (18, 19) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 4) (9, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 6) (2, 15) (4, 16) (4, 19) (4, 5) (15, 17) (15, 14) (15, 13) (15, 2) 

Response:
Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 10, 8
   - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   => Total 3-stars: 1

2. Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 11, 9
   - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   => Total 3-stars: 2

3. Node 10 has neighbors: 1, 19, 14
   - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   => Total 3-stars: 3

4. Node 17 has neighbors: 13, 8, 15
   - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   => Total 3-stars: 4

5. Node 7 has neighbors: 16, 6, 8
   - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   => Total 3-stars: 5

6. Node 12 has neighbors: 16, 0
   - inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars

7. Node 0 has neighbors: 12, 6
   - inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars

8. Node 14 has neighbors: 10, 15
   - inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars

9. Node 11 has neighbors: 3, 19, 18
   - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   => Total 3-stars: 6

10. Node 13 has neighbors: 17, 16, 15, 18
    - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
    => Total 3-stars: 10

11. Node 16 has neighbors: 7, 12, 13, 4
    - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
    => Total 3-stars: 14

12. Node 18 has neighbors: 11, 13, 19
    - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
    => Total 3-stars: 15

13. Node 19 has neighbors: 10, 11, 18, 4
    - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
    => Total 3-stars: 19

14. Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 17, 7, 5, 6
    - inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
    => Total 3-stars: 29

15. Node 6 has neighbors: 7, 0, 8, 2
    - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
    => Total 3-stars: 33

16. Node 4 has neighbors: 16, 19, 5
    - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
    => Total 3-stars: 34

17. Node 15 has neighbors: 17, 14, 13, 2
    - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
    => Total 3-stars: 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 10, 8)>, <3, (1, 11, 9)>, <10, (1, 19, 14)>, <17, (13, 8, 15)>, <7, (16, 6, 8)>, <11, (3, 19, 18)>, <13, (17, 16, 15)>, <16, (7, 12, 4)>, <18, (11, 13, 19)>, <19, (10, 11, 4)>, <8, (1, 17, 7)>, <6, (7, 0, 2)>, <4, (16, 19, 5)>, <15, (17, 14, 2)>
