Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) 

Response:
Let's analyze each node to see which ones can form 3-stars.

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors (6, 1, 3, 8, 7) 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (9, 2, 0, 8) 
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (9, 1, 8) 
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (7, 0, 4)
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (9, 3) 
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (6, 8, 7) 
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (9, 5, 0)
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (3, 5, 8, 0, 9) 
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors (9, 1, 5, 2, 0, 7) 
- Node 9 has 8 neighbors (6, 8, 4, 2, 1, 7, 0, 9) 

Now, let's count the 3-stars:

- For node 0, there are $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars 
- For node 1, there is only 1 3-star, <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- For node 7, there are $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars 
- For node 8, there are $\binom{6}{3} = 20$ 3-stars 
- For node 9, there are $\binom{8}{3} = 56$ 3-stars 

Summing them up: 
$10 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 56 = 97$

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [97]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <7, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 7)>
- <9, (1, 7, 8)>
- <9, (1, 8, 7)>
