Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 12) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13.

For each of these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding all these up gives a total of 61 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [61].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (5, 8, 10)>, <0, (5, 10, 13)>, <0, (5, 7, 2)>, <0, (5, 7, 1)>, <0, (10, 13, 2)>, <2, (7, 1, 13)>, <4, (9, 8, 6)>, <5, (0, 10, 13)>, <5, (9, 7, 5)>, <5, (9, 7, 1)>, <5, (9, 7, 2)>, <5, (9, 14, 6)>, <6, (10, 8, 11)>, <6, (10, 8, 4)>, <6, (12, 9, 14)>, <6, (12, 9, 6)>, <7, (5, 9, 7)>, <8, (5, 7, 2)>, <8, (5, 9, 4)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>, <10, (0, 13, 2)>, <12, (6, 9, 14)>, <12, (6, 9, 12)>, <12, (6, 14, 3)>, <12, (12, 14, 3)>, <13, (0, 10, 11)>.
