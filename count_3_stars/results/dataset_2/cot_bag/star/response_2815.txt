Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can represent the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 7), (1, 5), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 0), (1, 8), (3, 5), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 8), (4, 9), (4, 3), (4, 6), (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 7), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 0), (2, 1), (2, 0), (0, 1), (0, 6), (0, 2), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 6)}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph.

Node 0 has 2 neighbors
Node 2 has 2 neighbors
Node 4 has 2 neighbors
Node 7 has 4 neighbors
Node 8 has 4 neighbors
Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Calculating \( \binom{4}{3} \) for nodes 7, 8, and 9 gives:

\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<7, (5, 9, 8)>
<8, (9, 1, 3)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<9, (5, 1, 7)>
