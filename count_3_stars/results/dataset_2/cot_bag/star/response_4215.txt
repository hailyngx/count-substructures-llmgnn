Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 12) (16, 3) (16, 2) (14, 7) (14, 10) (17, 5) (17, 7) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 5) (6, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 18) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (15, 4) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 9) (2, 16) (2, 13) (2, 19) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 8) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 18) (9, 0) (18, 13) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 7) (3, 16) (3, 12) (8, 12) (8, 10) (8, 7) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 8) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 18) (0, 4) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 15) (4, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with number of neighbors are as follows:
Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 1: 3 neighbors
Node 2: 4 neighbors
Node 3: 2 neighbors
Node 4: 4 neighbors
Node 5: 4 neighbors
Node 6: 2 neighbors
Node 7: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 3 neighbors
Node 9: 4 neighbors
Node 10: 3 neighbors
Node 11: 2 neighbors
Node 12: 4 neighbors
Node 13: 4 neighbors
Node 14: 2 neighbors
Node 15: 1 neighbor
Node 16: 2 neighbors
Node 17: 2 neighbors
Node 18: 4 neighbors
Node 19: 4 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 18, 19 (12 nodes)
- Applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes: \( \binom{12}{3} = 220 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [220].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 15)>
<2, (13, 16, 19)>
<4, (1, 13, 18)>
<5, (6, 13, 17)>
<7, (8, 14, 18)>
<9, (1, 18, 19)>
<10, (8, 14, 19)>
<12, (3, 6, 8)>
<13, (2, 4, 18)>
<18, (9, 13, 19)>
<19, (9, 10, 18)>
