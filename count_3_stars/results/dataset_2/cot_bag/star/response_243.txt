Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 11) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (4, 19) (4, 6) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 7) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 3) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 15) (3, 5) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 17) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 12) (2, 12) (2, 16) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (19, 4) (19, 13) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 13) (13, 19) (13, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
Node 0: 9, 14, 10, 15
Node 1: No Neighbors
Node 2: 12, 16
Node 3: 5, 18, 7, 12
Node 4: 19, 6
Node 5: 3, 7
Node 6: 14, 10, 4, 12
Node 7: 5, 9, 8, 3
Node 8: 16, 15, 7
Node 9: 11, 7, 0
Node 10: 17, 0, 6, 12
Node 11: 9, 17
Node 12: 10, 3, 6, 2
Node 13: 19, 15
Node 14: 17, 0, 6
Node 15: 8, 18, 0, 13
Node 16: 17, 8, 2
Node 17: 14, 10, 16, 18, 11
Node 18: 17, 15, 3
Node 19: 4, 13

Calculating the number of 3-stars based on the node degrees:
[Node 0, degree 4]: 1 3-star
[Node 3, degree 4]: 1 3-star
[Node 6, degree 4]: 1 3-star
[Node 7, degree 4]: 1 3-star
[Node 10, degree 4]: 1 3-star
[Node 12, degree 4]: 1 3-star
[Node 14, degree 3]: 1 3-star
[Node 15, degree 4]: 1 3-star
[Node 16, degree 3]: 1 3-star
[Node 17, degree 5]: 6 3-stars
Total number of 3-stars = 14

Therefore, the answer is [14].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (9, 10, 15)>
<3, (5, 7, 18)>
<6, (4, 10, 12)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<10, (0, 12, 17)>
<12, (2, 3, 6)>
<14, (0, 6, 17)>
<15, (8, 13, 18)>
<16, (2, 8, 17)>
<17, (11, 16, 18)>
<17, (14, 16, 18)>
<17, (16, 18, 11)>
<17, (16, 18, 14)>
<17, (16, 18, 15)>
