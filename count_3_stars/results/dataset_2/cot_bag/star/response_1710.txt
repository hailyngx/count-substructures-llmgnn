This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 9) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 14) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the given information.

The nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

The edges are:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 12, 3, 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 6, 12, 9, 14.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 11, 13, 14.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 0, 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 12, 10, 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 10, 6, 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 11, 13, 5, 1.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 10, 13, 9, 12.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 0, 14, 3, 1.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 4, 12, 8, 13, 5.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 14, 6, 2.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 10, 8, 0, 1.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 10, 8, 2, 6.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11, 9, 1, 2.

To find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (exactly 3 neighbors).
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} + 1 + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 57 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [57].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (7, 9, 14)>, <4, (10, 12, 0)>, <5, (10, 6, 7)>, <6, (11, 13, 1)>, <9, (8, 14, 3)>, <10, (4, 12, 5)>, <10, (8, 13, 5)>, <10, (12, 8, 4)>, <10, (13, 8, 4)>, <12, (10, 8, 0)>
