Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 2) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 1) (4, 8) (4, 14) (2, 10) (18, 8) (18, 5) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 5) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 9) (15, 10) (15, 1) (15, 12) (5, 18) (5, 14) (5, 19) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 7) (12, 15) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 3) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we will count the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes. Let's start by listing the nodes with their neighbors:

1. Node 0: Neighbors - 3, 14, 16
2. Node 1: Neighbors - 9, 13, 15, 17
3. Node 3: Neighbors - 0, 7, 14, 16
4. Node 4: Neighbors - 8, 14
5. Node 5: Neighbors - 8, 14, 18, 19
6. Node 7: Neighbors - 3, 6, 9, 19
7. Node 8: Neighbors - 4, 11, 13, 18
8. Node 10: Neighbors - 2, 11, 13, 15, 17
9. Node 11: Neighbors - 8, 10, 17, 19
10. Node 13: Neighbors - 1, 8, 10, 16
11. Node 14: Neighbors - 0, 3, 4, 5
12. Node 15: Neighbors - 1, 10, 12
13. Node 16: Neighbors - 0, 3, 13
14. Node 17: Neighbors - 1, 10, 11
15. Node 19: Neighbors - 5, 7, 11

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

There are 4 nodes with 4 or more neighbors: Node 1, Node 3, Node 5, and Node 10.

For Node 1:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<1, (9, 15, 17)>, <1, (9, 13, 17)>, <1, (9, 13, 15)>, <1, (13, 15, 17)>

For Node 3:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<3, (0, 14, 16)>, <3, (0, 7, 16)>, <3, (0, 7, 14)>, <3, (7, 14, 16)>

For Node 5:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<5, (8, 14, 19)>, <5, (8, 18, 19)>, <5, (14, 18, 19)>, <5, (14, 18, 5)>

For Node 10:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<10, (2, 11, 17)>, <10, (2, 11, 15)>, <10, (2, 15, 17)>, <10, (11, 15, 17)>, <10, (11, 15, 10)>, <10, (11, 17, 10)>, <10, (15, 17, 10)>, <10, (15, 17, 11)>, <10, (15, 17, 1)>, <10, (17, 11, 1)>

Adding them up:
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].
