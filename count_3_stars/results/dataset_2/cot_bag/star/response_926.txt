Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 6) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 13) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors: Node 5, 9, 4, 7, 3, 11, 0, 8, 1, 6, 2, 12, 10, 14, and 13.

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [60] \]

Unique 3-stars:
\[ <5, (9, 3, 14)>, <9, (8, 4, 11)>, <4, (9, 7, 3)>, <7, (8, 0, 1)>, <3, (5, 4, 14)>, <11, (9, 6, 8)>, <0, (7, 12, 13)>, <8, (5, 9, 7)>, <1, (7, 6, 14)>, <6, (11, 1, 2)>, <2, (3, 0, 14)>, <12, (3, 0, 6)>, <10, (9, 1, 13)>, <14, (5, 3, 1)>, <13, (0, 1, 6)> \]
