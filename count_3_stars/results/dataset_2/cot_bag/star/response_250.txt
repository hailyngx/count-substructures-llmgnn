Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: nodes 5, 9, 4, and 3. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 38 \).

Thus, the final answer is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 3)>
<4, (1, 6, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 5)>
<3, (0, 7, 5)>
