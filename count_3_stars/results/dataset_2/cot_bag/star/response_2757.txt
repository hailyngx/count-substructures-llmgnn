Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 5 neighbors (0, 4, 9), there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for each node, totaling \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \) 3-stars.
- For nodes with 4 neighbors (3, 6, 7, 8), there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each node, totaling \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) 3-stars.

Putting these together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 30 + 16 = 46 \), which we represent as [46].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 9, 5)>
<0, (4, 9, 8)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 1, 7)>
<0, (6, 1, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (9, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (8, 9, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
