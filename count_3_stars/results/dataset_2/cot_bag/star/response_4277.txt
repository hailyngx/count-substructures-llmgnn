Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 17) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 8) (7, 26) (3, 25) (3, 2) (3, 12) (25, 5) (25, 3) (25, 16) (25, 15) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 20) (22, 17) (22, 8) (8, 7) (8, 22) (8, 23) (8, 29) (23, 8) (23, 1) (23, 21) (23, 28) (6, 28) (6, 11) (28, 23) (28, 6) (28, 2) (28, 20) (13, 26) (13, 20) (13, 15) (26, 7) (26, 18) (26, 13) (26, 14) (11, 6) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 2) (10, 1) (10, 2) (21, 23) (21, 19) (14, 26) (14, 15) (0, 11) (0, 17) (1, 23) (1, 10) (1, 29) (1, 27) (29, 8) (29, 1) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 21) (20, 5) (20, 18) (20, 28) (20, 13) (24, 17) (16, 25) (16, 15) (17, 9) (17, 22) (17, 0) (17, 24) (27, 1) (27, 2) (2, 3) (2, 28) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 27) (12, 3) (15, 4) (15, 25) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 16) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 5, 4, 7, 3, 25, 18, and 8.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 31 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [31].

The unique 3-stars are:

<4, (7, 15, 18)>
<7, (4, 8, 26)>
