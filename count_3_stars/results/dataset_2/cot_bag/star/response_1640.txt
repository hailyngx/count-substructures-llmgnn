Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 5) (11, 8) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 16) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 16) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 4) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 15) (7, 0) (7, 16) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 9) (12, 18) (18, 1) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 13) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 17) (19, 18) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 9) (15, 0) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 14) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 18) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 4, 5, 9, and 10. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 23 \).

So, the final answer is [23], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (8, 9, 18)>, <4, (3, 9, 16)>, <4, (9, 10, 16)>, <4, (16, 17, 18)>, <4, (16, 17, 9)>, <5, (10, 13, 18)>, <5, (10, 18, 19)>, <5, (18, 6, 13)>, <5, (18, 6, 19)>, <9, (1, 4, 16)>, <9, (1, 4, 14)>, <9, (4, 16, 9)>, <9, (16, 4, 9)>, <10, (3, 5, 19)>, <10, (5, 10, 18)>, <10, (5, 10, 19)>, <10, (5, 18, 19)>, <10, (10, 18, 19)>.
