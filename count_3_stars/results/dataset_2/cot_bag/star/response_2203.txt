Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 0) (10, 3) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 14) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 6) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 2) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
The node degrees are:
- Node 0 has degree 6,
- Node 1 has degree 3,
- Node 2 has degree 3,
- Node 3 has degree 5,
- Node 4 has degree 6,
- Node 5 has degree 4,
- Node 6 has degree 5,
- Node 7 has degree 2,
- Node 8 has degree 3,
- Node 9 has degree 5,
- Node 10 has degree 1,
- Node 11 has degree 4,
- Node 12 has degree 4,
- Node 13 has degree 6, and
- Node 14 has degree 4.

Now, for each node that has 3 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars it participates in:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: 
\( 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 94 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [94].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 4)>, 
<3, (0, 6, 5)>, 
<4, (9, 1, 13)>, 
<6, (5, 0, 14)>, 
<9, (4, 13, 1)>, 
<12, (8, 13, 14)>, 
<13, (0, 1, 4)>.
