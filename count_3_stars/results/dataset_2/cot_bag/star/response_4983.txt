Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 4) 

Response:
Given the edges provided and the fact that there are 15 nodes in the graph, we can count the degree of each node based on the given edges. The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 6

Identifying the nodes with degree 3 or more, we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier:
- Node 1 can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 11 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 14 can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.

Adding all the possibilities, we get a total of 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 100 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars inside brackets is [100].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (4, 12, 14)>
- <4, (1, 12, 14)>
- <8, (1, 4, 14)>
- <9, (1, 4, 12)>
- <11, (1, 4, 14)>
- <14, (1, 4, 8)>
