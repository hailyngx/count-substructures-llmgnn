Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 11) (26, 9) (26, 15) (26, 8) (26, 27) (13, 22) (13, 27) (13, 18) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 7) (22, 12) (14, 1) (14, 12) (17, 20) (17, 15) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 6) (7, 24) (21, 7) (21, 5) (21, 15) (20, 17) (25, 23) (25, 8) (25, 4) (11, 9) (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 6) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 27) (12, 19) (27, 26) (27, 13) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 8) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 1) (18, 13) (18, 27) (18, 2) (15, 26) (15, 17) (15, 21) (29, 1) (29, 10) (4, 25) (4, 0) (3, 16) (3, 19) (8, 26) (8, 25) (8, 27) (8, 28) (8, 10) (28, 8) (24, 7) (24, 10) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 29) (1, 23) (5, 21) (5, 11) (5, 2) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 10) (19, 12) (19, 3) (10, 29) (10, 8) (10, 24) (10, 6) (10, 23) (23, 25) (23, 1) (23, 10) (0, 4) 

Response:
There are 30 nodes in the graph with the following degrees:

- Node 0 has degree 1
- Node 1 has degree 5
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 2
- Node 10 has degree 5
- Node 11 has degree 4
- Node 12 has degree 4
- Node 13 has degree 4
- Node 14 has degree 2
- Node 15 has degree 3
- Node 16 has degree 3
- Node 17 has degree 2
- Node 18 has degree 3
- Node 19 has degree 2
- Node 20 has degree 2
- Node 21 has degree 3
- Node 22 has degree 4
- Node 23 has degree 3
- Node 24 has degree 2
- Node 25 has degree 3
- Node 26 has degree 4
- Node 27 has degree 5
- Node 28 has degree 1
- Node 29 has degree 3

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes, we get the following count of 3-stars:
1: 1 3-star
2: 1 3-star
5: 1 3-star
6: 4 3-stars
7: 4 3-stars
8: 10 3-stars
10: 10 3-stars
11: 4 3-stars
12: 4 3-stars
13: 4 3-stars
15: 1 3-star
16: 4 3-stars
21: 1 3-star
22: 4 3-stars
23: 4 3-stars
25: 1 3-star
26: 4 3-stars
27: 10 3-stars
29: 1 3-star

Summing up all the 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 65

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [65].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, 2, 5>
<6, 7, 8>
<10, 11, 12>
<13, 15, 21>
<16, 23, 29>
<22, 25, 26>
<27, 28, 10>
