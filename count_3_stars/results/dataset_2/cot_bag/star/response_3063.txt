Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \(4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 50\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].
