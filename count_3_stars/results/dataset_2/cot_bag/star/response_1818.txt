Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
2. Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
6. Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 72 \), so we have [72].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>

<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 8, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>

<8, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
