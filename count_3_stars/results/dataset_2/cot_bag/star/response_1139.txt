Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 18) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 17) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 18) (2, 17) (2, 5) (8, 9) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 7) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 18) (9, 8) (9, 12) (15, 6) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 6) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (18, 1) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 16) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 16) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 1, 3, 11, 17, 5, 19, 12, 18, 6, 13.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding them up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 56

So, there are 56 total 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, 7, 1>
<4, 7, 5>
<4, 7, 19>
<4, 7, 12>
<7, 1, 5>
<7, 1, 19>
<7, 1, 5>
<7, 1, 18>
<1, 5, 18>
<3, 6, 15>
<11, 19, 17>
<17, 19, 18>
<5, 19, 18>
<5, 19, 18>
<5, 19, 18>
<5, 19, 18>
<19, 18, 16>
<18, 16, 6>
<13, 16, 6> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [56].
