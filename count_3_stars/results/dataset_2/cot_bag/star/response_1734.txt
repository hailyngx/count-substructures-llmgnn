Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 46 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [46].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
1. <0, (1, 3, 8)>
2. <0, (1, 3, 9)>
3. <0, (1, 8, 9)>
4. <0, (3, 8, 9)>
5. <3, (0, 8, 9)>
6. <4, (1, 5, 7)>
7. <4, (1, 6, 7)>
8. <4, (3, 5, 7)>
9. <4, (3, 6, 7)>
10. <4, (5, 6, 7)>
11. <5, (2, 6, 7)>
12. <5, (2, 4, 7)>
13. <5, (2, 5, 8)>
14. <5, (4, 6, 7)>
15. <7, (2, 4, 5)>
16. <7, (2, 4, 6)>
17. <7, (2, 5, 8)>
18. <7, (4, 5, 6)>
19. <7, (4, 5, 9)>
