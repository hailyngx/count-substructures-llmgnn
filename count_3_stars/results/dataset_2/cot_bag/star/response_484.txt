Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 2}
- Node 1: {5, 4, 3, 6, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 1, 8, 6, 0}
- Node 3: {7, 1, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 0, 1}
- Node 5: {2, 1, 4}
- Node 6: {7, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 3, 6, 8, 2}
- Node 8: {7, 3, 2, 6}
- Node 9: {7, 0}

Based on the given edges, the graph looks like this: 

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 3, 6, 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 1, 8, 6, 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 0, 1.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 1, 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 2, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 3, 6, 8, 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 3, 2, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 0.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars: 

- Node 1 and Node 2 have 5 neighbors each, Node 4 and Node 7 have 6 neighbors each. So, let's calculate for these nodes: 
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (5, 2, 6)>
<2, (5, 1, 7)>
<4, (7, 0, 1)>
<7, (9, 3, 2)>
