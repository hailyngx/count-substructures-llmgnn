Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 24) (2, 14) (29, 2) (29, 16) (29, 8) (29, 10) (1, 3) (1, 28) (1, 10) (1, 27) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (22, 18) (23, 4) (23, 12) (18, 22) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 21) (18, 8) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 13) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 4) (20, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 23) (12, 26) (5, 3) (5, 18) (5, 20) (5, 6) (5, 25) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 24) (6, 17) (19, 26) (19, 8) (19, 27) (26, 20) (26, 12) (26, 19) (26, 25) (11, 14) (11, 17) (8, 29) (8, 18) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 21) (10, 29) (10, 1) (10, 3) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 28) (24, 2) (24, 6) (24, 9) (17, 6) (17, 11) (17, 25) (25, 5) (25, 26) (25, 17) (4, 23) (4, 20) (4, 9) (4, 21) (9, 24) (9, 4) (21, 18) (21, 8) (21, 4) (21, 27) (27, 1) (27, 19) (27, 21) (16, 29) (16, 18) (13, 0) (28, 1) (28, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 
- Node 2, which has neighbors 29, 24, 14 (3 neighbors)
- Node 1, which has neighbors 3, 28, 10, 27 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3, which has neighbors 1, 10, 6, 5 (4 neighbors)
- Node 29, which has neighbors 2, 16, 8, 10 (4 neighbors)
- Node 18, which has neighbors 22, 5, 16, 21, 8 (5 neighbors)
- Node 20, which has neighbors 0, 26, 4, 5 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5, which has neighbors 3, 18, 20, 6, 25 (5 neighbors)
- Node 6, which has neighbors 3, 5, 24, 17 (4 neighbors)
- Node 26, which has neighbors 20, 12, 19, 25 (4 neighbors)
- Node 8, which has neighbors 29, 18, 7, 19, 21 (5 neighbors)
- Node 4, which has neighbors 23, 20, 9, 21 (4 neighbors)
- Node 14, which has neighbors 2, 11, 28 (3 neighbors)
- Node 17, which has neighbors 6, 11, 25 (3 neighbors)
- Node 9, which has neighbors 24, 4 (2 neighbors)
- Node 21, which has neighbors 18, 8, 4, 27 (4 neighbors)
- Node 27, which has neighbors 1, 19, 21 (3 neighbors)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star (it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star
- Node 18 forms 2 3-stars
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 2 3-stars
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms 2 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17

Therefore, there are 17 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [17]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (29, 24, 14)>, <1, (3, 10, 27)>, <3, (1, 6, 5)>, <29, (2, 8, 10)>, <18, (22, 16, 21)>, <18, (5, 16, 8)>, <20, (0, 4, 5)>, <5, (3, 6, 25)>, <5, (18, 20, 6)>, <6, (3, 5, 24)>, <26, (20, 19, 25)>, <8, (29, 18, 21)>, <8, (18, 7, 19)>, <21, (18, 4, 27)>, <4, (23, 9, 21)>, <14, (2, 11, 28)>, <17, (6, 11, 25)>.
