Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 3) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 11) (22, 5) (22, 10) (15, 27) (15, 12) (15, 24) (15, 16) (27, 15) (27, 8) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 29) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 23) (17, 11) (7, 21) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 9) (21, 18) (0, 20) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (20, 0) (20, 23) (20, 28) (1, 17) (1, 26) (1, 5) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 8) (26, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 27) (8, 14) (8, 26) (29, 14) (29, 17) (29, 28) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 24) (28, 20) (28, 29) (3, 13) (3, 7) (11, 22) (11, 17) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 25) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 20) (23, 26) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 26) (12, 16) (12, 6) (9, 21) (18, 13) (18, 21) (18, 25) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 1) (24, 15) (24, 19) (24, 10) (10, 22) (10, 19) (10, 24) (4, 0) (4, 6) (25, 16) (25, 18) (6, 12) (6, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 13, 22, 15, 27, 14, 17, 7, 21, 0, 20, 1, 26, 8, 29, 19, 28, 3, 11, 16, 23, 12, 18, 5, 24, 10, 25, and 6.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 58 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58]. The unique 3-stars are: <13, (22, 3, 18)>, <22, (13, 11, 5)>, <15, (27, 12, 24)>, <15, (27, 12, 16)>, <27, (15, 8, 14)>, <14, (8, 12, 29)>, <14, (8, 12, 2)>, <17, (29, 1, 23)>, <7, (21, 3, 19)>, <7, (21, 23, 18)>, <21, (7, 9, 18)>, <21, (7, 9, 18)>, <0, (20, 4, 5)>, <0, (20, 4, 2)>, <1, (17, 26, 5)>, <26, (1, 23, 8)>, <26, (1, 23, 12)>, <26, (1, 23, 8)>, <8, (27, 14, 26)>, <8, (27, 14, 26)>, <8, (27, 14, 26)>, <29, (14, 17, 28)>, <19, (7, 10, 24)>, <19, (7, 10, 24)>, <19, (7, 10, 24)>, <28, (20, 29, 23)>, <23, (17, 7, 26)>, <12, (15, 14, 26)>, <12, (15, 14, 16)>, <12, (15, 14, 6)>, <18, (13, 21, 25)>, <18, (13, 21, 25)>, <18, (13, 21, 25)>, <5, (22, 0, 1)>, <5, (22, 0, 1)>, <24, (15, 19, 10)>, <10, (22, 19, 24)>, <25, (16, 18, 6)>.
