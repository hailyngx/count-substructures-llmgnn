Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 23) (26, 15) (26, 17) (15, 26) (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 18) (27, 28) (27, 7) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (20, 18) (20, 19) (20, 24) (25, 13) (25, 19) (25, 11) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 24) (2, 28) (8, 14) (8, 22) (17, 26) (17, 5) (17, 21) (29, 7) (29, 10) (1, 28) (1, 12) (19, 20) (19, 25) (19, 23) (23, 9) (23, 19) (23, 18) (0, 16) (0, 5) (16, 0) (16, 10) (22, 2) (22, 8) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 0) (7, 27) (7, 29) (7, 28) (14, 8) (14, 24) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 24) (3, 18) (24, 20) (24, 2) (24, 14) (24, 3) (24, 4) (18, 27) (18, 20) (18, 23) (18, 3) (18, 28) (13, 6) (13, 25) (13, 4) (12, 6) (12, 1) (10, 29) (10, 16) (10, 14) (4, 6) (4, 24) (4, 13) (4, 11) (11, 25) (11, 4) (11, 21) (28, 27) (28, 2) (28, 1) (28, 7) (28, 18) (21, 17) (21, 11) 

Response:
There are three nodes that have three or more neighbors: node 9, node 6, and node 27. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 9:
   - Node 9 has 3 neighbors (6, 3, 23).
   - Total number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Unique 3-star for node 9: <9, (6, 3, 23)>

2. Node 6:
   - Node 6 has 4 neighbors (9, 12, 4, 13).
   - Total number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars for node 6: <6, (9, 12, 4)>, <6, (9, 12, 13)>, <6, (9, 4, 13)>, <6, (12, 4, 13)>

3. Node 27:
   - Node 27 has 5 neighbors (15, 18, 28, 7, 18).
   - Total number of 3-stars with node 27 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars for node 27: <27, (15, 18, 28)>, <27, (15, 18, 7)>, <27, (15, 18, 18)>, <27, (15, 28, 7)>, <27, (15, 28, 18)>, <27, (15, 7, 18)>, <27, (18, 28, 7)>, <27, (18, 28, 18)>, <27, (18, 7, 18)>, <27, (28, 7, 18)>

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 1 + 4 + 10 = 15
Therefore, the final answer is [15].
