Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 18) (6, 17) (9, 10) (9, 27) (0, 27) (0, 1) (0, 19) (27, 9) (27, 0) (27, 20) (27, 8) (10, 17) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 24) (4, 5) (18, 17) (18, 25) (18, 29) (22, 26) (22, 2) (22, 15) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 21) (26, 7) (3, 11) (3, 24) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 29) (7, 10) (7, 26) (7, 1) (25, 18) (25, 5) (25, 19) (16, 2) (16, 15) (28, 5) (2, 22) (2, 16) (2, 1) (2, 20) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 20) (1, 5) (20, 27) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 1) (24, 10) (24, 3) (24, 13) (24, 5) (24, 23) (8, 27) (8, 29) (19, 0) (19, 25) (19, 29) (29, 18) (29, 11) (29, 8) (29, 19) (23, 24) (5, 4) (5, 25) (5, 28) (5, 1) (5, 24) (13, 24) (13, 15) (12, 17) (12, 21) (21, 26) (21, 12) (21, 15) (15, 22) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 13) (15, 21) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are: 1, 5, 7, 10, 15, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, and 29. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 69
Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [69].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
