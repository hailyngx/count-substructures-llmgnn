Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 11) (18, 14) (18, 22) (18, 20) (18, 0) (18, 3) (22, 18) (22, 4) (22, 5) (20, 18) (20, 21) (25, 19) (25, 15) (25, 0) (25, 12) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 27) (13, 5) (1, 26) (1, 12) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 10) (26, 7) (28, 26) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 27) (29, 12) (5, 14) (5, 22) (5, 13) (6, 16) (6, 27) (21, 20) (19, 14) (19, 25) (19, 23) (23, 19) (0, 18) (0, 25) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 24) (10, 26) (10, 0) (10, 3) (4, 22) (4, 24) (4, 16) (7, 14) (7, 26) (7, 11) (7, 15) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 24) (24, 0) (24, 4) (24, 16) (24, 9) (27, 8) (27, 29) (27, 6) (3, 18) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 25) (15, 7) (15, 11) (2, 11) (9, 11) (9, 24) (12, 25) (12, 1) (12, 29) (12, 3) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges. 
Here is the list of nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 18, 25, 8, 10, 24
- Node 1: 26, 12
- Node 2: 11
- Node 3: 18, 10, 12
- Node 4: 22, 24, 16
- Node 5: 14, 22, 13
- Node 6: 16, 27
- Node 7: 14, 26, 11, 15
- Node 8: 16, 0, 27
- Node 9: 11, 24
- Node 10: 26, 0, 3
- Node 11: 17, 7, 9, 2, 15
- Node 12: 25, 1, 29, 3
- Node 13: 5
- Node 14: 17, 18, 7, 19, 5
- Node 15: 25, 7, 11
- Node 16: 8, 6, 4, 24
- Node 17: 14, 11
- Node 18: 14, 22, 20, 0, 3
- Node 19: 25, 14, 23
- Node 20: 18, 21
- Node 21: 20
- Node 22: 18, 4, 5
- Node 23: 19
- Node 24: 0, 4, 16, 9
- Node 25: 19, 15, 0, 12
- Node 26: 1, 28, 10, 7
- Node 27: 8, 29, 6
- Node 28: 26, 29
- Node 29: 28, 27, 12

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0, 11, 14, and 26 have degree 5, so each contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has degree 4, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 16, 18, and 24 have degree 4, giving each 1 3-star.
- Node 5, 7, 10, 15, 17, 19, 22, and 25 have degree 3, so no 3-stars are formed.
- All other nodes have degree 2 or less, so they also don't contribute any 3-stars.

Summing up the contributions, we have a total of \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 33 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the final answer is [33]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 11, 26>
- <0, 11, 7>
- <0, 11, 14>
- <0, 11, 15>
- <0, 14, 17>
- <11, 7, 15>
- <11, 14, 17>
- <11, 14, 18>
- <11, 14, 19>
- <14, 17, 18>
- <14, 17, 19>
- <14, 18, 22>
- <14, 18, 20>
- <14, 18, 3>
- <14, 19, 25>
- <18, 3, 10>
- <25, 19, 23>
- <26, 28, 29>
