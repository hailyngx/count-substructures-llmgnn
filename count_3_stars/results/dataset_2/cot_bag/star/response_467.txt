Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can first construct the graph as described. 

The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 2, 6, and 3
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 7, and 6
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 3
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 2, 8, 6, and 0
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 2, 0, and 3
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 1, and 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 1, 0, and 3
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 1, and 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 3
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 7, and 4

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars. We find that nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9 have at least three neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars. 

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 6)>
<1, (9, 5, 7)>
<1, (9, 5, 8)>
<1, (9, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 2, 6)>
<3, (4, 2, 0)>
<3, (4, 8, 2)>
<3, (6, 1, 0)>
<4, (7, 2, 0)>
<4, (7, 2, 3)>
<4, (7, 2, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (7, 4, 1)>
<7, (5, 1, 9)>
<7, (5, 1, 6)>
<7, (9, 5, 4)>
<9, (5, 1, 7)>
<9, (5, 1, 6)>
