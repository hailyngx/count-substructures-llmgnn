Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 20) (16, 6) (18, 11) (18, 22) (18, 24) (18, 7) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 4) (7, 18) (7, 21) (7, 27) (21, 7) (21, 27) (21, 25) (21, 24) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 8) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 28) (8, 18) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 29) (13, 15) (2, 22) (2, 8) (2, 14) (29, 17) (29, 13) (29, 26) (29, 0) (19, 25) (26, 29) (26, 14) (26, 12) (15, 13) (28, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 26) (14, 20) (0, 29) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 24) (9, 4) (9, 27) (25, 21) (25, 19) (25, 6) (4, 23) (4, 5) (4, 9) (27, 7) (27, 21) (27, 9) (27, 6) (20, 16) (20, 14) (20, 6) (12, 22) (12, 26) (12, 24) (24, 18) (24, 21) (24, 5) (24, 12) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 25) (6, 27) (6, 20) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 8, 14, 17, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 8:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 14:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 17:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 18:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 21:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 22:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 24:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 25:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 26:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 27:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 29:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 76 \)

So, there are a total of [76] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (16, 20, 14)>, <6, (8, 27, 25)>, <6, (16, 20, 18)>, <6, (25, 27, 21)>, <6, (8, 18, 22)>, <8, (18, 22, 23)>, <8, (18, 7, 24)>, <8, (18, 7, 21)>, <8, (18, 24, 12)>, <8, (17, 10, 1)>, <8, (17, 10, 5)>, <14, (1, 10, 5)>, <14, (1, 3, 28)>, <14, (1, 10, 17)>, <14, (1, 10, 17)>, <14, (1, 10, 17)>, <14, (1, 10, 17)>, <14, (1, 10, 17)>, <14, (26, 2, 8)>, <14, (26, 2, 2)>, <14, (26, 2, 2)>, <14, (20, 16, 6)>, <14, (20, 16, 6)>, <14, (26, 2, 12)>, <14, (26, 2, 12)>, <22, (2, 8, 6)>, <22, (23, 4, 9)>, <22, (23, 4, 9)>, <22, (18, 7, 21)>, <22, (18, 7, 27)>, <22, (18, 7, 27)>, <22, (18, 7, 27)>, <22, (18, 24, 5)>, <22, (18, 24, 12)>, <22, (18, 24, 5)>, <24, (21, 7, 27)>, <24, (21, 7, 27)>, <24, (21, 7, 27)>, <24, (21, 7, 27)>, <24, (18, 7, 21)>, <24, (18, 7, 27)>, <24, (18, 7, 27)>
