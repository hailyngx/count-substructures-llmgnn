Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 16) (4, 7) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 16) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (10, 3) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 18) (16, 9) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 15) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 19) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 19) (17, 9) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 11) (1, 5) (1, 11) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 17) (11, 1) (11, 18) (2, 4) (2, 17) (19, 0) (19, 6) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 18) (14, 13) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes: 5, 9, 4, 7, 12, 16, 0, 17, 11, 6, and 18.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 34

Therefore, there are [34] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 12, 1)>
<9, (5, 15, 17)>
<4, (7, 17, 2)>
<7, (4, 12, 16)>
<12, (5, 7, 0)>
<16, (9, 7, 8)>
<0, (12, 11, 19)>
<17, (9, 4, 6)>
<11, (12, 0, 17)>
<6, (17, 3, 19)>
<18, (15, 11, 3)>
