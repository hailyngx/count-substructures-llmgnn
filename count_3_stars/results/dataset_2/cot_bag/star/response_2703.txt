Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 18) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 15) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (0, 17) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 15) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 3) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 14) (19, 2) (2, 19) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

1: {4, 8, 12}
2: {5, 13, 19}
3: {4, 5, 18}
4: {1, 3, 12}
5: {0, 2, 3, 10}
6: {8, 9, 13}
7: {12, 15}
8: {1, 6, 14}
9: {6, 18}
10: {5, 16, 17}
11: {14, 16}
12: {1, 4, 7, 13}
13: {2, 6, 12}
14: {0, 8, 11, 15}
15: {7, 14, 17}
16: {10, 11, 18}
17: {0, 10, 15, 18}
18: {3, 9, 16, 17}
19: {2}

There are 11 nodes with 3 or more neighbors. Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<3, (4, 5, 18)>, 
<5, (0, 2, 3)>, 
<5, (3, 4, 5)>, 
<5, (5, 10, 0)>, 
<5, (5, 2, 3)>, 
<10, (16, 17, 18)>, 
<12, (1, 4, 12)>, 
<12, (7, 12, 15)>, 
<14, (0, 8, 14)>, 
<15, (7, 14, 15)>, 
<18, (10, 17, 18)>, 
<18, (16, 17, 18)>.
