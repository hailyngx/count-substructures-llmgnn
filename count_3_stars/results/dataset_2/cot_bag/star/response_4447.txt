Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 28) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 1) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 23) (26, 3) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 5) (7, 12) (7, 22) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (3, 26) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 27) (4, 20) (4, 15) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 23) (25, 6) (25, 23) (28, 16) (28, 9) (28, 10) (9, 3) (9, 28) (9, 24) (29, 27) (29, 23) (10, 28) (10, 21) (10, 8) (10, 22) (21, 10) (21, 15) (21, 17) (5, 26) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 8) (23, 26) (23, 27) (23, 25) (23, 29) (19, 14) (22, 7) (22, 10) (22, 17) (6, 11) (6, 25) (6, 17) (17, 21) (17, 22) (17, 6) (17, 15) (8, 0) (8, 10) (8, 5) (20, 4) (20, 13) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 20) (13, 24) (24, 9) (24, 13) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 21) (15, 17) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29. 

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\(1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 56\)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, 1, 18>, <2, 1, 26>, <2, 1, 14>, <2, 18, 1>, <2, 18, 14>, <2, 1, 14>, <3, 26, 1>, <3, 26, 5>, <3, 26, 23>, <3, 26, 13>, <4, 3, 26>, <4, 3, 13>, <4, 3, 9>, <4, 3, 15>, <5, 26, 1>, <5, 26, 7>, <5, 26, 12>, <5, 26, 8>, <7, 12, 5>, <12, 7, 5>, <12, 7, 22>, <12, 5, 7>, <17, 6, 11>, <17, 6, 25>, <17, 6, 15>, <17, 6, 22>, <17, 21, 10>, <17, 21, 15>
