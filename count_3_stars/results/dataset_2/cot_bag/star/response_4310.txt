Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are:
Node 0: 5, 9, 8, 2
Node 1: 9, 4, 3, 6
Node 2: 9, 4, 3, 8, 0
Node 3: 5, 1, 2
Node 4: 5, 9, 7, 1, 2
Node 5: 9, 6, 8, 5, 4, 0, 3
Node 6: 5, 1
Node 7: 9, 4, 8
Node 8: 5, 7, 2, 0
Node 9: 5, 2, 1, 7, 0

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 5: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (5, 8, 2)>
<2, (9, 4, 5)>
<4, (9, 5, 0)>
<5, (9, 8, 3)>
<9, (5, 2, 0)>
