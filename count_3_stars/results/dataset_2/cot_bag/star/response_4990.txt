Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 3) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}.

Let's determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each relevant node:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: {5, 6, 4, 7, 14}. It forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: {5, 4, 8, 7, 13}. It forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: {9, 8, 3, 14, 1, 2}. It forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: {9, 1, 12, 0, 13}. It forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {11, 8, 3, 2, 1}. It forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: {11, 4, 3, 7, 1}. It forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {6, 4, 12}. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: {10, 14, 7, 8, 1}. It forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: {9, 6, 13, 0}. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: {6, 12, 1, 3}. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: {11, 4, 1}. It forms 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 74 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [74], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 6, 4)>
<3, (5, 4, 8)>
<4, (9, 8, 3)>
<6, (9, 1, 12)>
<7, (11, 8, 3)>
<8, (11, 4, 3)>
<9, (6, 4, 12)>
<11, (10, 14, 7)>
<12, (9, 6, 13)>
<13, (6, 12, 1)>
<14, (11, 4, 1)>
