Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 4) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 5) (8, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 8) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 5) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, thus \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, thus \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, thus \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, thus \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, thus \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, thus \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, thus \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, thus \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, thus \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 73.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [73].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 4, 13)>, <0, (4, 6, 11)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 12, 14)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 11)>, <4, (0, 6, 12)>, <4, (6, 9, 12)>, <4, (9, 6, 12)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 12, 13)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 10, 12)>, <6, (4, 9, 12)>, <6, (9, 4, 12)>, <7, (5, 8, 13)>.
