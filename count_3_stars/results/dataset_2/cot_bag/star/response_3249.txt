Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 14) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 7) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0, there are 4 neighbors: (0, 6), (0, 1), (0, 10), (0, 12). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center. Inside <>: <0, 6, 1, 10>, <0, 6, 1, 12>, <0, 1, 10, 12>, <0, 10, 12>.

For node 1, there are 5 neighbors: (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 14), (1, 0). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center. Inside <>: <1, 6, 9, 3>, <1, 6, 9, 14>, <1, 6, 9, 0>, <1, 6, 3, 14>, <1, 6, 3, 0>, <1, 6, 14, 0>, <1, 9, 3, 14>, <1, 9, 3, 0>, <1, 9, 14, 0>, <1, 3, 14, 0>.

Continuing this process for all nodes with three or more neighbors, we find the 3-stars and sum them up:
\[ [4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10] = [56] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 56.
