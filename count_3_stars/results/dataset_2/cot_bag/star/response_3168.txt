- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 28, 22, 19, 21
- Node 3: 27, 23
- Node 4: 6, 5
- Node 5: 4, 22
- Node 6: 28, 18, 26, 4
- Node 7: 15, 12, 11, 17
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 25, 1, 0
- Node 10: 28, 14, 20
- Node 11: 15, 7, 25
- Node 12: 7, 24, 17, 22, 26
- Node 13: 14
- Node 14: 13, 23, 10
- Node 15: 27, 7, 11, 24
- Node 16: 27, 26
- Node 17: 7, 12, 25, 22
- Node 18: 6, 0, 25
- Node 19: 2
- Node 20: 26, 10
- Node 21: 27, 2, 22
- Node 22: 12, 17, 2, 5, 21
- Node 23: 14, 3, 29
- Node 24: 15, 12, 0
- Node 25: 18, 17, 9, 11
- Node 26: 20, 6, 12, 16
- Node 27: 15, 21, 3, 16
- Node 28: 0, 2, 6, 10
- Node 29: 23

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 15 has exactly 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has exactly 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 22 \).
Putting this final number inside brackets gives us: \[  [22] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <15, 11, 25>
- <27, 21, 3>
- <12, 17, 25>
- <22, 17, 5>
