Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 6 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For node 0: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$
- For node 1: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- For node 2: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- For node 3: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- For node 4: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- For node 8: ${6 \choose 3} = 20$
- For node 9: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$

Adding these up, we have a total of $10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 50$ 3-stars in this graph. Hence, the final answer is [50].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 8, 7)>
- <0, (5, 8, 1)>
- <0, (5, 8, 3)>
- <0, (5, 9, 4)>
- <0, (6, 8, 1)>
- <0, (6, 8, 4)>
- <1, (8, 5, 0)>
- <1, (8, 5, 6)>
- <1, (8, 5, 3)>
- <1, (8, 5, 9)>
- <1, (8, 6, 0)>
- <1, (8, 6, 4)>
- <1, (8, 6, 5)>
- <1, (8, 6, 7)>
- <1, (8, 3, 0)>
- <1, (8, 3, 5)>
- <1, (8, 3, 6)>
- <1, (8, 3, 9)>
- <1, (8, 4, 0)>
- <1, (8, 4, 6)>
- <1, (8, 4, 5)>
- <1, (8, 4, 7)>
- <2, (9, 3, 1)>
- <3, (9, 4, 1)>
- <4, (9, 0, 5)>
- <4, (9, 0, 6)>
- <4, (9, 1, 8)>
