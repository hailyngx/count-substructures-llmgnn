Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 14) (16, 29) (16, 19) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 22) (5, 28) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 15) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 25) (12, 3) (27, 12) (27, 29) (27, 7) (27, 6) (4, 8) (4, 20) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 21) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 18) (0, 10) (0, 20) (0, 6) (20, 4) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 6) (18, 17) (18, 7) (22, 5) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 1) (13, 5) (13, 26) (26, 13) (26, 14) (1, 10) (1, 22) (1, 15) (15, 9) (15, 1) (15, 25) (15, 21) (23, 11) (23, 10) (29, 16) (29, 9) (29, 27) (29, 24) (14, 11) (14, 26) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 24) (24, 29) (24, 2) (28, 5) (28, 8) (6, 27) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 20) (6, 22) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 25) (3, 12) (3, 20) (3, 19) (25, 12) (25, 15) (25, 21) (7, 27) (7, 18) (19, 16) (19, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:
- Node 0: (10, 20, 6)
- Node 1: (10, 22, 15)
- Node 2: (12, 4, 24)
- Node 3: (12, 20, 19)
- Node 4: (8, 2, 20)
- Node 5: (9, 13, 22, 28)
- Node 6: (27, 17, 0, 20, 22)
- Node 7: (27, 18)
- Node 8: (4, 8, 21)
- Node 9: (5, 22, 29, 15)
- Node 10: (0, 1, 17, 23)
- Node 11: (23, 14)
- Node 12: (27, 2, 25, 3)
- Node 13: (5, 26)
- Node 14: (11, 26)
- Node 15: (9, 1, 25, 21)
- Node 16: (29, 19)
- Node 17: (10, 18)
- Node 18: (17, 7)
- Node 19: (16, 3)
- Node 20: (4, 0, 6, 3)
- Node 21: (8, 15, 25)
- Node 22: (5, 9, 6, 1)
- Node 23: (11, 10)
- Node 24: (29, 2)
- Node 25: (12, 15, 21)
- Node 26: (13, 14)
- Node 27: (6, 29, 7)
- Node 28: (5, 8)
- Node 29: (16, 27, 9, 24)

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
Node 12 forms 3 3-stars.
Node 15 forms 3 3-stars.
Node 22 forms 1 3-star.
Node 27 forms 5 3-stars.
Node 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 17, 29 do not form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 5 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (9, 22, 28)>
<9, (5, 22, 29)>
<12, (27, 2, 25)>
<15, (9, 1, 25)>
<22, (5, 9, 6)>
<27, (6, 17, 29)>
<27, (7, 18, 29)>
<27, (7, 29, 6)>
<27, (18, 7, 29)>
<27, (18, 29, 7)>
<29, (16, 27, 24)>
<29, (9, 27, 24)>
<29, (24, 27, 2)>
<29, (24, 27, 9)>
