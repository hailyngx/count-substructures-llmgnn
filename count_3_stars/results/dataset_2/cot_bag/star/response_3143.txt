Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 13) (17, 19) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 1) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 15) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 13) (13, 17) (13, 18) (4, 16) (4, 6) (4, 15) (12, 16) (12, 2) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 18) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 5) (3, 14) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 8) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (5, 18) (5, 7) (5, 0) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 1) 

Response:
There are some nodes with three or more neighbors. Let's identify those nodes first:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes. 

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 28 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

- <0, 6, 9>
- <1, 9, 10>
- <2, 12, 14>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <4, 6, 15>
- <5, 0, 7>
- <6, 0, 9>
- <7, 3, 5>
- <8, 1, 3>
- <9, 1, 10>
- <10, 1, 16>
- <12, 2, 16>
- <13, 17, 18>
- <14, 2, 19>
- <15, 2, 4>
- <18, 3, 19>
- <19, 14, 17>
- <16, 10, 4>
- <14, 3, 18>
- <4, 12, 16>
- <0, 9, 6>
- <9, 6, 4>
- <6, 4, 16>
- <8, 15, 3>
- <1, 10, 9>
- <10, 16, 4>
- <3, 18, 14>
