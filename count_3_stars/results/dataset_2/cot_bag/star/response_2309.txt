Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 5) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 9) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 6) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the possibilities, we have a total of 85 3-stars.

So, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [85].

Unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 14, 12)>
<2, (1, 8, 3)>
<4, (8, 1, 6)>
<5, (2, 7, 13)>
<6, (0, 10, 4)>
<7, (5, 13, 14)>
<8, (2, 12, 3)>
<9, (3, 1, 12)>
<10, (0, 7, 6)>
<12, (14, 0, 8)>
<13, (5, 7, 14)>
<14, (13, 9, 5)>
