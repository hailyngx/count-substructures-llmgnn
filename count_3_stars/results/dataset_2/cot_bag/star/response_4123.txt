Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 58

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58].
  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
