Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 16) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 14) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 12) (4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 2) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 15) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 15) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 5) (15, 11) (15, 0) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 3) (12, 1) (16, 6) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 12) (5, 14) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 3, and 15.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 13, 10, 19, and 12.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 10, 18, and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 7, 0, and 12.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 17, 2, and 14.
- Node 5 is connected to node 14.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 14, 4, and 16.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9 and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 13 and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 14, 7, and 0.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 17, 1, and 2.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 17, 19, and 15.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 13, 18, 3, and 1.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 12, 1, and 14.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 13, and 5.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 11, 0.
- Node 16 is connected to node 6.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 10, 11, and 4.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 2, 19, and 12.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 18, 11, and 1.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 2, 14, and 0. (1 3-star)
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 8, 12, and 1. (1 3-star)
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 13, 10, and 12. (1 3-star)

So, there are [3] 3-stars in total:
<9, (2, 14, 0)>, <13, (8, 12, 1)>, <1, (13, 10, 12)>
