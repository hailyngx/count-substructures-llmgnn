Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 17) (16, 13) (16, 14) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 15) (7, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 18) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 16) (13, 12) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 15) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 19) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 17) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 0) (15, 7) (15, 10) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 12) (19, 17) (19, 2) (19, 0) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1] = [38] \)

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (5, 11, 14)>, <0, (8, 10, 14)>, <0, (8, 14, 19)>, <0, (11, 14, 17)>, <0, (5, 14, 19)>, <1, (3, 6, 12)>, <1, (3, 9, 12)>, <3, (1, 9, 12)>, <4, (1, 5, 10)>, <4, (1, 3, 12)>, <12, (1, 3, 9)>, <12, (1, 8, 13)>, <14, (0, 5, 16)>, <17, (6, 11, 19)>, <19, (0, 2, 17)>.

So, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is 14.
