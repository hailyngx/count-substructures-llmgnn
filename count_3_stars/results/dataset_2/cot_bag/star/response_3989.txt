Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 14) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 12) (0, 7) (0, 9) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 1) (10, 15) (10, 16) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 9) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 13) (18, 19) (11, 19) (11, 2) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 16) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 2) (2, 11) (2, 16) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 13) (1, 19) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (3, 15), (3, 6), (6, 3). It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 5), (4, 14), (4, 17). It forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (5, 4), (5, 8), (5, 6), (6, 5). It forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 17), (6, 12). It forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (7, 4), (7, 0), (9, 7). It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 12). It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (9, 7), (9, 0), (9, 13). It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (12, 15), (12, 8), (12, 6), (12, 1). It forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: (13, 17), (13, 1), (13, 9). It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (14, 15), (14, 4), (14, 19), (14, 16). It forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: (15, 3), (15, 10), (15, 14), (15, 12). It forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: (16, 10), (16, 14), (16, 2). It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: (19, 18), (19, 11), (19, 14), (19, 1). It forms 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us: [1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [37].

Therefore, we have a total of 37 unique 3-stars in this graph. Those are:
<3, 6, 15>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 17>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 14>, <4, 14, 15>, <4, 14, 16>, <4, 17, 13>, <5, 6, 12>, <6, 12, 15>, <7, 0, 9>, <8, 12, 15>, <9, 13, 17>, <12, 1, 15>, <13, 1, 19>, <14, 15, 19>, <14, 16, 19>, <16, 2, 10>, <19, 11, 14>, <19, 11, 18>.
