Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) 

Response:
There are 15 nodes in the graph. Let's analyze the neighbors of each node to determine the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 7, 6, 2, 1}. Cannot form 3-stars.
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7, 5, 2, 14}. Can form 1 3-star: <1, (4, 2, 5)>.
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 1, 14, 0}. Can form 1 3-star: <2, (4, 1, 5)>.
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5, 13}. Cannot form 3-stars.
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 0, 1, 11, 3}. Can form 1 3-star: <4, (2, 1, 3)>.
- Node 5: Neighbors {11, 13, 2, 1, 3}. Can form 1 3-star: <5, (11, 2, 1)>.
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 8, 0}. Cannot form 3-stars.
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 11, 14, 8, 1}. Can form 1 3-star: <7, (0, 11, 1)>.
- Node 8: Neighbors {7, 6, 9, 10, 11}. Can form 1 3-star: <8, (7, 6, 9)>.
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 8, 14}. Cannot form 3-stars.
- Node 10: Neighbors {8, 13}. Cannot form 3-stars.
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 7, 5, 8, 12}. Can form 1 3-star: <11, (4, 7, 5)>.
- Node 12: Neighbors {11, 14}. Cannot form 3-stars.
- Node 13: Neighbors {10, 5, 3}. Cannot form 3-stars.
- Node 14: Neighbors {7, 9, 2, 1, 12}. Can form 1 3-star: <14, (7, 9, 2)>.

In total, there are 5 unique 3-stars: <1, (4, 2, 5)>, <2, (4, 1, 5)>, <4, (2, 1, 3)>, <5, (11, 2, 1)>, and <7, (0, 11, 1)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
