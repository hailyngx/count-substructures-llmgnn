Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 23) (13, 7) (13, 18) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 27) (22, 12) (3, 17) (3, 23) (3, 8) (15, 26) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 24) (9, 26) (9, 17) (9, 16) (26, 15) (26, 9) (26, 14) (4, 24) (4, 2) (7, 13) (0, 20) (0, 10) (0, 19) (20, 0) (20, 1) (20, 21) (20, 23) (20, 11) (1, 20) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 14) (10, 0) (21, 13) (21, 20) (21, 18) (14, 22) (14, 26) (14, 1) (14, 18) (2, 22) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 11) (12, 22) (12, 18) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 19) (11, 20) (11, 2) (6, 25) (6, 8) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 9) (5, 23) (5, 27) (23, 13) (23, 3) (23, 20) (23, 5) (27, 22) (27, 5) (27, 29) (27, 24) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 25) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 29) (18, 13) (18, 21) (18, 14) (18, 12) (24, 15) (24, 4) (24, 27) (25, 6) (25, 29) (25, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 25) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 62

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62].
