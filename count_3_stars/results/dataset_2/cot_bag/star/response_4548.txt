Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 8) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 12) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 4) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 10) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 6) 

Response:
There are some nodes with 3 or more neighbors for which we can form 3-stars. Let's identify these 3-stars:

Node 0: (0, 1, 6), (0, 1, 13)
Node 1: (1, 0, 5), (1, 2, 5), (1, 5, 9)
Node 2: (2, 1, 4), (2, 1, 6), (2, 1, 13)
Node 3: (3, 4, 5), (3, 5, 8), (3, 5, 10)
Node 5: (5, 1, 4), (5, 3, 4), (5, 14, 4)
Node 6: (6, 0, 13), (6, 0, 2), (6, 0, 10)
Node 8: (8, 5, 14), (8, 5, 3), (8, 5, 7)
Node 10: (10, 3, 14), (10, 3, 6), (10, 3, 12)
Node 11: (11, 7, 8), (11, 7, 9), (11, 7, 14)
Node 12: (12, 6, 14), (12, 6, 8), (12, 6, 10)
Node 13: (13, 0, 6), (13, 0, 2), (13, 0, 14)
Node 14: (14, 12, 8), (14, 12, 6), (14, 12, 10)

Now, summing up all the unique 3-stars we found, we get a total of 24 of them. So the answer is [24].
