Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars by summing up the possible combinations for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Since nodes 3 and 9 have exactly 3 neighbors each, they will each form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 42 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [42].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (1, 5, 2)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>
