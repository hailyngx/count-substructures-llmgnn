Response:
This graph has the following nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

1. Node 13: This node has 3 neighbors (22, 25, 27), so it can form 1 3-star.
2. Node 22: This node has 3 neighbors (13, 18, 12), so it can form 1 3-star.
3. Node 9: This node has 2 neighbors, which is fewer than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
4. Node 26: This node has 3 neighbors (9, 23, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
5. Node 18: This node has 3 neighbors (22, 21, 12), so it can form 1 3-star.
6. Node 10: This node has 2 neighbors, which is fewer than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
7. Node 11: This node has 4 neighbors (10, 14, 19, 25), so it can form 4 3-stars.
8. Node 17: This node has 4 neighbors (10, 28, 0, 2), so it can form 4 3-stars.
9. Node 8: This node has 3 neighbors (26, 23, 6), so it can form 1 3-star.
10. Node 23: This node has 3 neighbors (26, 8, 25), so it can form 1 3-star.
11. Node 4: This node has 2 neighbors, which is fewer than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
12. Node 0: This node has 2 neighbors, which is fewer than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
13. Node 5: This node has 4 neighbors (19, 29, 15, 14), so it can form 4 3-stars.
14. Node 19: This node has 3 neighbors (11, 5, 12), so it can form 1 3-star.
15. Node 20: This node has 2 neighbors, which is fewer than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
16. Node 3: This node has 2 neighbors, which is fewer than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
17. Node 21: This node has 3 neighbors (18, 4, 16), so it can form 1 3-star.
18. Node 14: This node has 4 neighbors (11, 5, 24, 2), so it can form 4 3-stars.
19. Node 16: This node has 1 neighbor, which is fewer than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
20. Node 28: This node has 2 neighbors, which is fewer than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
21. Node 25: This node has 5 neighbors (13, 9, 11, 23, 2), so it can form 10 3-stars.
22. Node 24: This node has 2 neighbors, which is fewer than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
23. Node 6: This node has 4 neighbors (8, 7, 15, 27), so it can form 4 3-stars.
24. Node 15: This node has 4 neighbors (5, 24, 6, 2), so it can form 4 3-stars.
25. Node 1: This node has 2 neighbors, which is fewer than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
26. Node 2: This node has 5 neighbors (17, 4, 14, 25, 15), so it can form 10 3-stars.
27. Node 12: This node has 4 neighbors (22, 19, 29, 28), so it can form 4 3-stars.
28. Node 27: This node has 3 neighbors (13, 6, 1), so it can form 1 3-star.
29. Node 7: This node has 1 neighbor, which is fewer than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
30. Node 29: This node has 3 neighbors (5, 20, 12), so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [51].
