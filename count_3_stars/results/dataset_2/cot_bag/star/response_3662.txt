Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 5) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 1) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 14) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 9) (2, 1) (2, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 3) (9, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 4, 7, 5, 13, 0, 12, 1, and 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 4, there are 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 7, there are 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
For node 5, there are 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
For node 13, there are 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
For node 0, there are 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
For node 12, there are 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
For node 1, there are 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
For node 6, there are 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 60 \).

Therefore, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<4, (7, 9, 6)>
<7, (4, 12, 1)>
<5, (8, 0, 12)>
<13, (11, 10, 14)>
<0, (7, 5, 12)>
<12, (9, 14, 4)>
<1, (2, 14, 6)>
<6, (8, 1, 4)>
