Response:
Given the information provided, let's first construct a visual representation of the graph:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 14.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 29, 12, 23, and 14.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 27, 12, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 18 and 28.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 22 and 15.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 15, 24, 14, and 22.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 17.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 12, 13, and 23.
- Node 11 is connected to node 10.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 10, and 27.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 29, 10, 18, and 21.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 1, and 25.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 7, 18, 5.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 26 and 20.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 29, 9, 0, and 19.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 4, 15, 13.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 17, 21, 22, and 20.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 16 and 19.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 13, 19, and 21.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 7, 5, 19, and 0.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 2, 10, and 24.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 7, 27, 23, 0.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 14, 0, and 28.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 16 and 20.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 3, 12, 24.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 4, 0, and 25.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 2, 17, 13.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 and node 14 have exactly three neighbors, so each of them forms 1 3-star.
Node 7, node 12, node 13, node 17, and node 19 each have more than three neighbors, so we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of them.
- For node 7, there are 4 3-stars.
- For node 12, there are 4 3-stars.
- For node 13, there are 4 3-stars.
- For node 17, there are 4 3-stars.
- For node 19, there are 4 3-stars.

Overall, we have \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 \) 3-stars which equals 22. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
