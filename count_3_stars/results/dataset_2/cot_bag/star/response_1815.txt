Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 12) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 12) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 13) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 1: 4 neighbors
Node 2: 3 neighbors
Node 3: 4 neighbors
Node 4: 5 neighbors
Node 5: 5 neighbors
Node 6: 5 neighbors
Node 7: 3 neighbors
Node 8: 3 neighbors
Node 9: 3 neighbors
Node 10: 5 neighbors
Node 11: 4 neighbors
Node 12: 5 neighbors
Node 13: 3 neighbors
Node 14: 4 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Number of 3-stars at node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 52 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars are:
