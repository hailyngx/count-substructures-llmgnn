Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 5) (12, 11) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 14) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 20 + 0 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 94 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [94], and the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 13)>, <1, (4, 7, 13)>, <1, (6, 7, 13)>, <1, (5, 9, 12)>, <1, (5, 9, 3)>, <1, (5, 12, 3)>, <1, (9, 12, 3)>, <5, (9, 4, 10)>, <5, (9, 4, 12)>, <5, (9, 4, 3)>, <5, (9, 10, 3)>, <5, (4, 10, 3)>, <6, (10, 11, 1)>, <6, (10, 11, 14)>, <6, (10, 1, 14)>, <6, (11, 1, 14)>, <7, (9, 10, 3)>, <7, (9, 10, 1)>, <7, (9, 10, 14)>, <7, (9, 3, 1)>, <7, (9, 3, 14)>, <7, (10, 3, 1)>, <7, (10, 3, 14)>.
