This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 10) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 4) (14, 11) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 11) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first construct the graph with the 15 nodes and 60 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
(5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 8), (5, 11), 
(9, 2), (9, 10), (9, 1), (9, 7), 
(1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 11), (1, 2), (1, 13), 
(3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 10), (3, 12), (3, 8), 
(10, 9), (10, 3), (10, 11), (10, 6), (10, 12), (10, 7), 
(11, 5), (11, 1), (11, 10), (11, 14), (11, 13), (11, 4), 
(7, 9), (7, 3), (7, 10), 
(12, 3), (12, 10), (12, 4), 
(2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 4), 
(8, 5), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 0), 
(0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 4), 
(14, 11), 
(6, 5), (6, 10), (6, 4),
(13, 5), (13, 1), (13, 11), 
(4, 11), (4, 12), (4, 2), (4, 0), (4, 6)

Now, let's analyze the nodes and their neighbors to identify the 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11

Calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: 
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 8
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>

Node 1: 
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 9, 11, 13
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Total 3-stars for Node 1: 10

Node 3: 
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 7, 8, 10, 12
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Total 3-stars for Node 3: 20

Node 4: 
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 11, 12
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Total 3-stars for Node 4: 10

Node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 6, 8, 11, 13
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Total 3-stars for Node 5: 4

Node 6: 
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 10, 13
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Total 3-stars for Node 6: 4

Node 7: 
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 3, 9, 10
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- <7, (3, 9, 10)>

Node 8:
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 2
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Total 3-stars for Node 8: 4

Node 10:
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors: 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Total 3-stars for Node 10: 20

Node 11:
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors: 1, 4, 10, 13, 14, 5
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Total 3-stars for Node 11: 20

Summing up the total number of 3-stars from each node:
1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 94

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 94. 
Therefore, the final answer is [94].
