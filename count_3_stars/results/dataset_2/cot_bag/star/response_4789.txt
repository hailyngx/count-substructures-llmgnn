Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 27) (22, 17) (23, 26) (23, 14) (23, 28) (23, 19) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 25) (1, 26) (1, 25) (26, 23) (26, 1) (26, 10) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 10) (21, 19) (21, 24) (28, 23) (28, 9) (28, 14) (28, 25) (27, 22) (27, 11) (7, 0) (7, 6) (25, 18) (25, 1) (25, 28) (25, 14) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 16) (17, 22) (17, 18) (17, 20) (20, 17) (20, 6) (0, 7) (0, 29) (0, 9) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 24) (11, 2) (11, 27) (11, 14) (14, 23) (14, 28) (14, 25) (14, 11) (14, 5) (12, 16) (12, 29) (12, 8) (10, 26) (10, 4) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 28) (9, 0) (9, 13) (6, 7) (6, 20) (24, 4) (24, 21) (24, 16) (24, 5) (24, 19) (29, 0) (29, 12) (29, 3) (19, 23) (19, 4) (19, 21) (19, 15) (19, 24) (3, 29) (8, 12) (5, 14) (5, 24) (13, 15) (13, 9) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 2, 4, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, and 29.

Let's count the number of 3-stars formed using these nodes:

For node 2: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)  
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \)  
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \)  
For node 11: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)  
For node 12: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)  
For node 14: \( \binom{5}{2} = 10 \)  
For node 15: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)  
For node 16: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)  
For node 17: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)  
For node 18: \( \binom{5}{2} = 10 \)  
For node 19: \( \binom{5}{2} = 10 \)  
For node 23: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)  
For node 24: \( \binom{5}{2} = 10 \)  
For node 25: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \)  
For node 26: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)  
For node 28: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)  
For node 29: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)

Summing up all these, we get: \( 3 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 + 10 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 10 + 10 + 3 + 10 + 6 + 3 + 3 = 74 \)

So there are 74 3-stars in total. 

Thus, the final answer is: [74]

And some of the unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (18, 9, 11)>
<4, (10, 19, 24)>
<9, (0, 13, 28)>
<11, (2, 14, 27)>
<14, (5, 11, 25)>
<15, (13, 16, 19)>
<16, (12, 15, 24)>
<17, (18, 20, 22)>
<18, (17, 25, 4)>
<19, (4, 21, 24)>
<23, (1, 19, 26)>
<24, (5, 16, 19)>
<25, (14, 18, 28)>
<26, (1, 10, 23)>
<28, (9, 14, 23)>
<29, (0, 3, 12)>
