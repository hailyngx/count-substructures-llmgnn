Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 13) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (9, 13) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighboring nodes are 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing these up, we get a total of 82 3-stars. So, the answer is [82].

The unique 3-stars are:
