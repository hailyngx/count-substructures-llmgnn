Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 19) (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 7) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 16) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 11) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 18) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 14) (15, 1) (15, 17) (15, 12) (10, 16) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 16) (17, 19) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 16) (12, 15) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 13) (14, 12) (16, 8) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 19) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 68 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [68].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<4, 6, 2>, 
<7, 19, 8>, 
<7, 19, 16>, 
<7, 19, 17>, 
<11, 6, 2>, 
<13, 9, 14>, 
<13, 9, 17>, 
<13, 9, 14>, 
<13, 17, 15>, 
<14, 18, 11>, 
<14, 18, 12>, 
<14, 18, 12>, 
<16, 8, 19>.
