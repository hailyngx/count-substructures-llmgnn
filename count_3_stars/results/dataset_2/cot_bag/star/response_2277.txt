Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 11) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (14, 16) (17, 3) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 11) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 10) (12, 2) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 18) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 5) (16, 14) (16, 13) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 5) (18, 0) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 11) (11, 15) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 0) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the nodes that are central nodes in 3-star graphs.

Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 15, 17, 4
Node 15 has 5 neighbors: 3, 19, 13, 11, 17
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 8
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 10, 5
Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 6, 17, 2, 10
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 4, 19, 8, 18
Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 3, 1, 19, 11
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 9, 10, 1, 0
Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 15, 17, 5, 11
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 6, 5, 0
Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 15, 16, 11
Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 8, 2, 18, 11
Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 15, 17, 13, 0
Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 9, 4, 7, 1

Calculating the number of 3-stars for the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 15: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 19: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44
Thus, there are 44 3-stars in total in this graph.
