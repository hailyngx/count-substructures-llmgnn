Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 9) (14, 10) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 4) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 1) (4, 17) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 19) (12, 9) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 19) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 18) (0, 16) (0, 2) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 18) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 11) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 15) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (19, 12) (19, 9) (15, 4) (15, 13) (15, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 18) (18, 13) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 18.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get: 
\(4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 43\)

Therefore, there are a total of 43 3-stars in the graph. 

Putting this final number inside brackets gives: \([43]\)

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 10, 17)>, <6, (1, 12, 18)>, <9, (8, 12, 19)>, <10, (1, 14, 17)>, <12, (6, 9, 19)>, <13, (15, 16, 17)>, <15, (11, 13, 15)>, <16, (3, 13, 18)>, <17, (13, 14, 18)>, <18, (3, 6, 16)>
