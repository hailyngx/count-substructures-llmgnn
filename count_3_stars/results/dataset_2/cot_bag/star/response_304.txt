Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 13) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 5) (10, 17) (10, 4) (11, 19) (11, 15) (17, 6) (17, 10) (17, 18) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 13) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 5) (7, 3) (7, 14) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 5) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 15) (15, 9) (15, 11) (15, 19) (14, 7) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 18) (13, 16) (13, 12) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 12) 

Response:
To solve this problem, we will first represent the graph with its nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 16)
(1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 12), (1, 13)
(2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 18)
(3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 19)
(4, 1), (4, 8), (4, 10), (4, 19)
(5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 12), (5, 16)
(6, 2), (6, 9), (6, 17)
(7, 3), (7, 14)
(8, 2), (8, 4)
(9, 6), (9, 13), (9, 15)
(10, 4), (10, 17)
(11, 15), (11, 19)
(12, 1), (12, 5), (12, 13)
(13, 1), (13, 9), (13, 12), (13, 16), (13, 18)
(14, 7)
(15, 9), (15, 11), (15, 19)
(16, 0), (16, 5), (16, 13)
(17, 6), (17, 10), (17, 18)
(18, 2), (18, 13), (18, 17)
(19, 3), (19, 4), (19, 11), (19, 15)

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 12, 13 -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 8, 10, 19 -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 12, 16 -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 9, 17 -> 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 6, 13, 15 -> 1 3-star
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 13 -> 1 3-star
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 1, 9, 12, 16, 18 -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 9, 11, 19 -> 1 3-star
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 6, 10, 18 -> 1 3-star
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 2, 13, 17 -> 1 3-star
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 11, 15 -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 32

Thus, there are 32 3-stars in this graph.
Putting the final number inside brackets gives us [32].

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 4, 12)>
<4, (1, 8, 10)>
<5, (0, 3, 12)>
<6, (2, 9, 17)>
<9, (6, 13, 15)>
<12, (1, 5, 13)>
<13, (1, 9, 12)>
<15, (9, 11, 19)>
<17, (6, 10, 18)>
<18, (2, 13, 17)>
<19, (3, 4, 11)>
