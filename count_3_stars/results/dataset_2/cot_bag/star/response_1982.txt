Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 17) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 12) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 2) (19, 15) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 0) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 19) (11, 1) (11, 18) (16, 3) (16, 17) (17, 15) (17, 8) (17, 16) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 18) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 13) (0, 19) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. We will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.

For node 3:
Node 3 has 5 neighbors (nodes 5, 8, 15, 16, and 18), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 15:
Node 15 has 4 neighbors (nodes 3, 17, and 19), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For nodes 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
These nodes each have 3 neighbors, so they can each form exactly 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( 10 + 4 + 13 = 27 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (5, 8, 15)>
<3, (5, 15, 16)>
<3, (5, 15, 18)>
<3, (8, 15, 16)>
<3, (8, 15, 18)>
<15, (3, 17, 19)>
<4, (7, 14, 1)>
<5, (3, 10, 19)>
<7, (4, 14, 13)>
<8, (3, 16, 17)>
<9, (7, 8, 12)>
<10, (5, 13, 19)>
<11, (1, 18, 19)>
<13, (10, 12, 18)>
<14, (4, 7, 13)>
<16, (3, 15, 17)>
<17, (15, 16, 8)>
<18, (3, 11, 13)>
<19, (15, 10, 11)>
TThe total number of unique 3-stars found is 19.
