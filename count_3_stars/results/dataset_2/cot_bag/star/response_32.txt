Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: Result: [1]
- Node 1: Result: [1]
- Node 2: Result: [4]
- Node 3: Result: [4]
- Node 4: Result: [1]
- Node 5: Result: [1]
- Node 6: Result: [1]
- Node 7: Result: [1]
- Node 8: Result: [1]
- Node 9: Result: [1]

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 3)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 0)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 6, 1)>
<4, (0, 6, 3)>
<5, (8, 0, 6)>
<6, (4, 9, 5)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
