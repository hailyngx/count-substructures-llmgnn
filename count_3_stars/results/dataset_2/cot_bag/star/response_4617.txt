Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 16) (9, 7) (14, 18) (14, 4) (17, 1) (17, 15) (10, 7) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 19) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 4) (1, 17) (1, 2) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 3) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 4) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 4) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 15) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (3, 12) (3, 18) (18, 14) (18, 11) (18, 5) (18, 3) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 13, 15, 16, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 2 3-stars: <5, (6, 13, 0)> and <5, (18, 15, 7)>.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 2 3-stars: <16, (9, 12, 4)> and <16, (12, 4, 15)>.
- Node 18 forms 2 3-stars: <18, (14, 11, 5)> and <18, (11, 5, 3)>.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.

Adding up these 3-stars gives a total of [12].
The unique 3-stars found are: <5, (6, 13, 0)>, <5, (18, 15, 7)>, <16, (9, 12, 4)>, <16, (12, 4, 15)>, <18, (14, 11, 5)>, <18, (11, 5, 3)>.
