Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 16) (6, 17) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 18) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 17) (8, 9) (8, 13) (13, 6) (13, 8) (1, 3) (1, 15) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 14) (16, 15) (16, 14) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 19) (17, 6) (17, 11) (17, 19) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 2) (14, 18) (14, 16) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 3-star each

Calculating for each applicable node:
- Node 0: 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 10 3-stars
- Node 6: 4 3-stars
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 4 3-stars
- Node 10: 4 3-stars
- Node 11: 4 3-stars
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 17: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star

Adding them together, the total number of 3-stars is:
\[ 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 35 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [35]. Listing the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
<0, (2, 12, 19)>, <3, (1, 15, 16)>, <4, (7, 11, 18)>, <6, (12, 17, 19)>, <7, (4, 10, 18)>, <9, (0, 8, 10)>, <10, (5, 7, 11)>, <11, (5, 10, 17)>, <12, (2, 6, 19)>, <17, (6, 11, 19)>, <18, (4, 7, 14)>, <19, (6, 12, 17)>
