Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 17) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 4) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 16) (4, 2) (4, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (17, 1) (17, 11) (17, 15) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 15) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 6) (15, 17) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 12) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 14) (14, 19) (14, 6) (14, 12) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 0) (16, 18) (16, 13) (12, 10) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (11, 12, 13)>, 
<0, (11, 13, 9)>, 
<0, (11, 12, 15)>, 
<0, (12, 15, 13)>, 
<1, (3, 7, 19)>, 
<1, (17, 11, 15)>, 
<1, (17, 15, 19)>, 
<1, (19, 14, 6)>, 
<2, (4, 9, 18)>, 
<6, (10, 8, 13)>, 
<6, (13, 16, 0)>, 
<6, (13, 16, 18)>, 
<12, (10, 15, 14)>, 
<15, (5, 17, 19)>.
