Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 13) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 13) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14.  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
For node 2: \(\binom{1}{3} = 0\)  
For node 3: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\)  
For node 5: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
For node 6: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\)  
For node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
For node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
For node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
For node 11: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
For node 12: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
For node 13: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
For node 14: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:  
1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 38

So, there are a total of 38 3-stars in this graph.  

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<1, 6, 2>  
<1, 7, 8>  
<1, 7, 9>  
<1, 7, 6>  
<2, 1, 13>  
<2, 13, 6>  
<3, 0, 14>  
<3, 14, 12>  
<5, 8, 11>  
<5, 8, 12>  
<5, 8, 10>  
<5, 12, 10>  
<6, 7, 1>  
<7, 6, 1>  
<8, 9, 7>  
<9, 8, 7>  
<11, 6, 5>  
<11, 2, 13>  
<12, 5, 10>  
<12, 5, 11>  
<13, 10, 6>  
<13, 9, 7>  

Therefore, the final answer is [38] <1, 6, 2>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 6>, <2, 1, 13>, <2, 13, 6>, <3, 0, 14>, <3, 14, 12>, <5, 8, 11>, <5, 8, 12>, <5, 8, 10>, <5, 12, 10>, <6, 7, 1>, <7, 6, 1>, <8, 9, 7>, <9, 8, 7>, <11, 6, 5>, <11, 2, 13>, <12, 5, 10>, <12, 5, 11>, <13, 10, 6>, <13, 9, 7>.
