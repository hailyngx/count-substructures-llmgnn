Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph with the given nodes and edges:
- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 0), (9, 6), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 0), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 3), (7, 0), (8, 3), (2, 1), (0, 7), (3, 9)

Now, let's analyze each node to find the total number of 3-star graphs:

Node 0: Degree 4 (neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 3) => 1 3-star
Node 1: Degree 4 (neighbors: 5, 6, 2, 3) => 1 3-star
Node 2: Degree 4 (neighbors: 5, 4, 8, 1) => 1 3-star
Node 3: Degree 5 (neighbors: 4, 7, 8, 9, 0) => 1 3-star
Node 4: Degree 4 (neighbors: 7, 8, 3, 2) => 1 3-star
Node 5: Degree 5 (neighbors: 9, 2, 8, 1, 0) => 1 3-star
Node 6: Degree 4 (neighbors: 9, 1, 8, 0) => 1 3-star
Node 7: Degree 3 (neighbors: 4, 0, 3) => 0 3-star
Node 8: Degree 5 (neighbors: 5, 6, 4, 2, 3) => 1 3-star
Node 9: Degree 4 (neighbors: 5, 6, 3, 0) => 1 3-star

There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph, which are:
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 2>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 7, 3>
<5, 9, 2>
<6, 9, 1>
