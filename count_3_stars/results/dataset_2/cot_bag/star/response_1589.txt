Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
1: {5, 9, 7, 3, 8}
2: {5, 6, 7, 3}
3: {5, 9, 1, 0, 2, 8}
4: {6, 8, 0}
5: {9, 6, 2, 1, 3}
6: {5, 9, 2, 4}
7: {4, 8, 1, 2, 0}
8: {4, 1, 3, 7}
9: {5, 6, 3, 1}

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:

1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
3: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Adding them up: 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 57

Therefore, there are 57 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (5, 7, 3)>
<1, (9, 7, 3)>
<1, (5, 9, 8)>
<1, (7, 3, 8)>
<1, (9, 3, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 3)>
<2, (5, 7, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 8)>
<3, (9, 0, 2)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<5, (6, 2, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 2)>
<7, (4, 8, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 3)>
