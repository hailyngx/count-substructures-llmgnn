Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {5, 6, 2}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 4, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 4, 0, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 4, 7, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 3, 1, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 1, 4, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 3}
- Node 8: {1}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 4, 7, 3}

Based on the information provided, the total number of 3-stars is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (5, 6, 2)>
<1, (5, 6, 4)>
<1, (5, 4, 2)>
<1, (6, 4, 2)>
<2, (6, 4, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 7)>
<3, (5, 4, 2)>
