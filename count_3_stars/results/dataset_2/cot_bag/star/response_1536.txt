Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 12) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 12) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (13, 7) (13, 9) (10, 2) (10, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 3, 7, 6, 9
- Node 1: 11, 7, 6, 14, 12
- Node 2: 8, 5, 6, 10, 3
- Node 3: 8, 2, 11, 7, 0
- Node 4: 8, 0, 5, 11
- Node 5: 4, 8, 2, 14, 12
- Node 6: 2, 0, 1
- Node 7: 3, 0, 10, 13, 1
- Node 8: 4, 2, 5, 11, 3
- Node 9: 0, 13, 12
- Node 10: 2, 7
- Node 11: 4, 8, 3, 14, 1
- Node 12: 1, 5, 9
- Node 13: 7, 9
- Node 14: 11, 1, 5

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 11: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 12: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 85

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [85].
Unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (6, 11, 14)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 11)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (2, 12, 14)>, <7, (1, 10, 13)>, <8, (3, 4, 11)>, <11, (1, 5, 14)>, <12, (1, 5, 9)>
