Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 26) (15, 9) (15, 17) (27, 23) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 9) (2, 29) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 1) (29, 6) (29, 19) (20, 25) (20, 18) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 16) (25, 8) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 21) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 24) (11, 28) (11, 7) (11, 21) (28, 11) (28, 3) (28, 12) (24, 17) (24, 26) (24, 6) (24, 4) (26, 15) (26, 24) (26, 3) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 22) (9, 8) (22, 9) (22, 1) (1, 29) (1, 22) (1, 23) (1, 19) (8, 25) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 0) (13, 3) (4, 24) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (19, 29) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 21) (16, 20) (16, 25) (21, 14) (21, 11) (21, 19) (12, 28) (12, 5) (12, 18) (3, 28) (3, 26) (3, 13) (6, 29) (6, 24) (6, 8) (6, 7) (7, 29) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 6) (18, 20) (18, 14) (18, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (23, 27) (23, 1) 

Response:
Using the information provided, we construct the graph based on the nodes and edges given. Here is the list of nodes with their neighbors:

0: 5, 9, 13
1: 19, 22, 23, 29  
2: 29
3: 13, 26, 28  
4: 24  
5: 0, 7, 10, 12, 19  
6: 7, 8, 24, 29  
7: 5, 6, 11, 29  
8: 6, 9, 10, 25  
9: 0, 8, 15, 22  
10: 5, 8  
11: 7, 21, 28  
12: 5, 18, 28  
13: 0, 3  
14: 17, 18, 21  
15: 9, 17, 26  
16: 20, 25  
17: 14, 15, 24  
18: 12, 14, 20  
19: 1, 5, 21, 29  
20: 16, 18, 25  
21: 14, 19, 11  
22: 1, 9  
23: 1, 27  
24: 4, 6, 17, 26  
25: 8, 16, 20  
26: 3, 15, 24  
27: 23  
28: 3, 11, 12  
29: 1, 2, 6, 7, 19  

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph by looking at each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 1: <1, (19, 22, 29)>
Node 5: <5, (0, 7, 19)> <5, (7, 10, 12)> <5, (12, 18, 14)> <5, (19, 29, 1)>
Node 6: <6, (7, 24, 29)>
Node 7: <7, (5, 11, 29)> <7, (6, 29, 1)>
Node 8: <8, (9, 10, 25)> <8, (6, 24, 29)>
Node 9: <9, (0, 15, 22)>
Node 12: <12, (5, 18, 14)>
Node 14: <14, (17, 18, 21)>
Node 15: <15, (9, 17, 26)>
Node 17: <17, (14, 15, 24)>
Node 18: <18, (12, 14, 21)>
Node 19: <19, (1, 5, 21)> <19, (5, 21, 11)>
Node 20: <20, (16, 18, 25)>
Node 21: <21, (11, 14, 19)>
Node 24: <24, (17, 26, 4)> <24, (6, 17, 29)>
Node 25: <25, (8, 16, 20)>
Node 26: <26, (15, 17, 24)>
Node 28: <28, (3, 11, 12)>
Node 29: <29, (1, 6, 7)> <29, (1, 19, 5)>  

Adding up the counts of the 3-stars, we get a total of [22].
