Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first find the nodes that have three or more neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars formed with each such node.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].
