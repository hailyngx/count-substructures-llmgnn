Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 17) (15, 11) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 18) (19, 8) (16, 0) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 6) (2, 7) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 11) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 13) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 18) (12, 3) (12, 5) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 18) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 13) (18, 11) (17, 15) (17, 4) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 13) (4, 17) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 18) (11, 9) (9, 14) (9, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 3, 15, 0, 7, 8, 16, 6, 14, 1, 10, 12, 13, 18, 4, 11, and 9.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there's 1 3-star. 
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there's 1 3-star. 
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there's 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there's 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there's 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there's 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so there's 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so there's 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 36 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars is [36].
