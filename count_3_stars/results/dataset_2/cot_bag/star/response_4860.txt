Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 14) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 13) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up all the 3-stars from the nodes with three or more neighbors: 
\[ 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
