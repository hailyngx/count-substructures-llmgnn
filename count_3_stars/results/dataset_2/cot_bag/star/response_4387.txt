Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 6) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 9) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 5) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 1) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 72

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [72].

Some of the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (12, 14, 9)>
<1, (11, 5, 6)>
<3, (10, 7, 14)>
<4, (6, 3, 2)>
<6, (1, 7, 2)>
<7, (3, 10, 12)>
<9, (8, 7, 0)>
<10, (5, 11, 1)>
<11, (1, 6, 5)>
<12, (7, 0, 3)>
<13, (8, 4, 6)>
<14, (11, 0, 3)>
