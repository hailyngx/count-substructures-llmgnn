Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
To identify the unique 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. 

Node 5, Node 9, Node 4, Node 8, and Node 2 each have 5 neighbors, while Node 0 and Node 1 have 4 neighbors. 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [58] \). 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <5, (9, 8, 1)>
- <5, (9, 8, 3)>
- <5, (9, 6, 2)>
- <5, (4, 7, 1)>
- <9, (5, 8, 3)>
- <9, (5, 8, 6)>
- <9, (5, 8, 4)>
- <4, (7, 2, 1)>
- <4, (7, 2, 6)>
- <8, (5, 9, 3)>
- <8, (5, 9, 4)>
- <8, (5, 9, 2)>
- <2, (5, 7, 6)>
- <0, (5, 2, 3)>
- <0, (5, 2, 1)>
- <1, (5, 4, 7)>
