- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 20, 27, 28
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 13
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 11, 25, 26
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 9, 26
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 8, 20, 29
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 12, 13

- Node 16 is connected to nodes 23, 27
- Node 17 is connected to node 24
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 19, 26
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 18, 20
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 19
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 0, 13, 14
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 28
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 16, 27
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 17
- Node 25 is connected to node 7
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 14, 18
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 5, 16, 23
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 5, 15, 22
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 1, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- For nodes 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 20, 22, 24, and 28, there are inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star each.
- For nodes 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 26, and 27, there are no 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 11, 29)>
<4, (1, 11, 22)>
<5, (8, 20, 27)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<15, (2, 13, 28)>
<20, (9, 19, 29)>
<22, (0, 4, 28)>
<24, (1, 2, 17)>
<28, (5, 15, 22)>
