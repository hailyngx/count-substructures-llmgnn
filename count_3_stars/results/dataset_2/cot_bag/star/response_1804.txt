Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 13) (11, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 10) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: 
\[ 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 65 \]

So, there are 65 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 9, 13)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 10, 14)>
<8, (0, 2, 10)>
<9, (1, 4, 12)>
<10, (0, 7, 13)>
<12, (4, 8, 14)>
<13, (4, 10, 14)>
<14, (7, 12, 13)>

Therefore, the final answer is [65].
