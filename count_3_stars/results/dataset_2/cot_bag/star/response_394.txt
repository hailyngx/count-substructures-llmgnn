Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are:  
- Node 1: 4 neighbors  
- Node 2: 3 neighbors  
- Node 3: 5 neighbors  
- Node 4: 5 neighbors  
- Node 5: 4 neighbors  
- Node 6: 3 neighbors  
- Node 7: 5 neighbors  
- Node 8: 3 neighbors  
- Node 9: 5 neighbors  
- Node 0: 3 neighbors  

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:  
\(4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 48\)

Therefore, there are a total of 48 unique 3-stars in the graph.  

The unique 3-stars found inside <> are:  
<1, 3, 5>  
<1, 3, 9>  
<1, 4, 8>  
<1, 5, 7>  
<3, 4, 6>  
<3, 4, 7>  
<3, 4, 9>  
<3, 5, 7>  
<3, 5, 9>  
<4, 6, 7>  
<4, 6, 9>  
<4, 7, 9>  
<5, 7, 9>
