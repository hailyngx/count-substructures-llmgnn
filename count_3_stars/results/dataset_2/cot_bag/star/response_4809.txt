Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
Node 0: 9, 1, 8
Node 1: 5, 9, 4, 3, 0
Node 2: 5, 9, 3, 6
Node 3: 7, 1, 6, 2
Node 4: 5, 7, 8, 1
Node 5: 2, 1, 4, 7
Node 6: 7, 3, 8, 2
Node 7: 5, 9, 4, 3, 6
Node 8: 4, 0, 6
Node 9: 2, 1, 7, 0

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 31. Put inside brackets: [31].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (2, 1, 4)>
<1, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 3)>
<3, (7, 6, 2)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 3, 8)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<9, (2, 1, 7)>
