Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 0) (14, 4) (14, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (2, 8) (18, 17) (18, 13) (18, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 17) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 19) (12, 9) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 12) (16, 19) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 4) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 0) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 16) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 13) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 4) (10, 14) (10, 6) (13, 18) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star formed
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star formed
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star formed
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star formed
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 11, 13)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 13, 1)>, <1, (4, 13, 1)>, <3, (19, 7, 12)>, <3, (19, 16, 12)>, <3, (19, 7, 15)>, <3, (19, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 6)>, <5, (0, 7, 12)>, <5, (0, 7, 19)>, <5, (0, 8, 3)>, <7, (19, 12, 16)>, <7, (19, 12, 9)>, <7, (19, 12, 17)>, <7, (19, 16, 12)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 12, 13)>, <12, (7, 16, 19)>, <12, (7, 16, 19)>, <12, (7, 16, 19)>, <13, (1, 4, 13)>, <18, (1, 13, 4)>, <18, (1, 13, 4)>, <18, (1, 13, 4)>, <19, (3, 12, 16)>, <19, (3, 12, 9)>, <19, (3, 16, 12)>

These are the unique 3-stars in the graph.
