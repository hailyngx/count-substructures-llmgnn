Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (5, 4) (5, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 100 \)

So, there are a total of 100 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer in brackets is [100].
