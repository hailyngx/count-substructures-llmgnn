The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 21) (9, 23) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 12) (15, 4) (15, 28) (27, 11) (27, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 28) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 25) (3, 8) (7, 27) (7, 19) (21, 9) (21, 24) (25, 3) (25, 6) (25, 16) (25, 24) (10, 17) (10, 22) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 28) (17, 2) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 13) (24, 21) (24, 25) (22, 10) (22, 12) (22, 8) (11, 27) (11, 1) (11, 28) (11, 18) (11, 4) (28, 15) (28, 1) (28, 17) (28, 11) (28, 5) (5, 26) (5, 28) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 4) (13, 17) (13, 14) (13, 2) (16, 25) (29, 0) (6, 25) (6, 14) (6, 23) (12, 9) (12, 26) (12, 22) (12, 18) (4, 15) (4, 11) (4, 19) (18, 14) (18, 11) (18, 12) (2, 17) (2, 13) (2, 23) (23, 9) (23, 10) (23, 6) (23, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 22) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: {(0, 14), (0, 8), (0, 29), (1, 3), (1, 8), (1, 11), (1, 19), (1, 28), (2, 13), (2, 17), (2, 23), (3, 1), (3, 25), (4, 11), (4, 15), (4, 19), (5, 26), (5, 28), (6, 14), (6, 23), (6, 25), (7, 19), (7, 27), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 22), (9, 12), (9, 21), (9, 23), (9, 26), (10, 17), (10, 22), (10, 23), (11, 1), (11, 4), (11, 18), (11, 27), (11, 28), (12, 9), (12, 18), (12, 22), (12, 26), (13, 14), (13, 2), (13, 17), (14, 0), (14, 13), (14, 18), (14, 6), (15, 4), (15, 28), (16, 25), (17, 10), (17, 13), (17, 28), (17, 2), (18, 11), (18, 12), (18, 14), (19, 1), (19, 4), (19, 7), (21, 9), (21, 24), (22, 10), (22, 12), (22, 8), (23, 2), (23, 6), (23, 9), (23, 10), (24, 21), (24, 25), (25, 3), (25, 24), (25, 6), (25, 16), (26, 5), (26, 9), (26, 12), (27, 7), (27, 11), (28, 1), (28, 5), (28, 11), (28, 15), (28, 17), (29, 0)}

By examining the nodes and their neighbors, we can identify which nodes form 3-stars and determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph. Let's now calculate the total number of 3-stars. 

Node 1 forms 3-stars with 3, 11, and 28.
Node 4 forms 3-stars with 11, 15, and 19.
Node 8 forms 3-stars with 1, 3, and 22.
Node 9 forms 3-stars with 12, 21, and 26.
Node 13 forms a 3-star with 17.
Node 14 forms 3-stars with 0, 6, and 18.
Node 17 forms 3-stars with 10, 28, and 2.
Node 23 forms 3-stars with 2, 6, and 10.
Node 25 forms 3-stars with 3, 16, and 24.
Node 26 forms a 3-star with 5.
Node 28 forms 3-stars with 1, 5, and 11.

Adding these up, we find a total of 16 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [16]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, 3, 11, 28>, 
<4, 11, 15, 19>, 
<8, 1, 3, 22>, 
<9, 12, 21, 26>, 
<13, 17>, 
<14, 0, 6, 18>, 
<17, 10, 28, 2>, 
<23, 2, 6, 10>, 
<25, 3, 16, 24>, 
<26, 5>, and 
<28, 1, 5, 11>.
