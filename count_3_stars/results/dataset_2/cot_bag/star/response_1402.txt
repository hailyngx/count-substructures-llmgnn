Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (15, 7) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 17) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 17) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 18) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 13) (6, 16) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 8) (0, 10) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 14) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 17) (1, 2) (1, 19) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 2) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 16) (14, 18) (8, 12) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 18) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, and 19. We will now calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.

For node 2:
There are 4 neighbors of node 2, so the number of 3-stars centered at node 2 is \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 4:
There are 4 neighbors of node 4, so the number of 3-stars centered at node 4 is \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 5:
There are 4 neighbors of node 5, so the number of 3-stars centered at node 5 is \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 6:
There are 4 neighbors of node 6, so the number of 3-stars centered at node 6 is \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 9:
There are 4 neighbors of node 9, so the number of 3-stars centered at node 9 is \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 10:
There are 3 neighbors of node 10, so the number of 3-stars centered at node 10 is 1.

For node 12:
There are 3 neighbors of node 12, so the number of 3-stars centered at node 12 is 1.

For node 14:
There are 4 neighbors of node 14, so the number of 3-stars centered at node 14 is \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 16:
There are 4 neighbors of node 16, so the number of 3-stars centered at node 16 is \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 17:
There are 4 neighbors of node 17, so the number of 3-stars centered at node 17 is \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 18:
There are 3 neighbors of node 18, so the number of 3-stars centered at node 18 is 1.

For node 19:
There are 4 neighbors of node 19, so the number of 3-stars centered at node 19 is \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 34 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 34. This can be expressed as [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (3, 1, 13)>
<4, (7, 9, 17)>
<5, (9, 12, 14)>
<6, (13, 16, 19)>
<10, (0, 12, 14)>
<18, (11, 14, 17)>
