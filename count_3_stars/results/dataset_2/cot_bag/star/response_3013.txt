Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 27) (3, 28) (3, 17) (3, 29) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 9) (11, 12) (0, 28) (0, 5) (14, 13) (14, 25) (26, 21) (26, 6) (26, 8) (28, 3) (28, 0) (28, 9) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 24) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 27) (13, 6) (7, 24) (7, 27) (25, 14) (25, 21) (8, 26) (8, 20) (8, 29) (8, 27) (19, 22) (19, 15) (19, 12) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 6) (22, 19) (22, 17) (22, 21) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 6) (29, 3) (29, 8) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 4) (17, 3) (17, 22) (17, 24) (16, 18) (24, 5) (24, 7) (24, 17) (24, 18) (18, 16) (18, 24) (18, 23) (18, 27) (23, 15) (23, 18) (23, 21) (23, 20) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 28) (20, 8) (20, 23) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 22) (21, 23) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 7) (27, 8) (27, 18) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 15) (6, 26) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, and 28.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up these results: 
1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 46

So, there are a total of 46 3-stars in this graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is: [46]
Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<3, (17, 28, 29)>
<5, (2, 13, 24)>
<8, (26, 27, 29)>
<9, (10, 11, 28)>
<10, (2, 4, 9)>
<12, (6, 19, 27)>
<13, (6, 27, 29)>
<15, (4, 19, 23)>
<18, (16, 23, 27)>
<19, (12, 15, 22)>
<21, (22, 23, 25)>
<22, (17, 19, 21)>
<24, (7, 17, 18)>
<26, (6, 8, 21)>
<27, (1, 13, 18)>
