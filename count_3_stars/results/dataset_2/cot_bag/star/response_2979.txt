Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 21) (11, 15) (11, 25) (16, 19) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 24) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 26) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 23) (6, 12) (6, 27) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 27) (0, 3) (0, 27) (0, 19) (27, 6) (27, 9) (27, 0) (20, 1) (20, 23) (25, 11) (25, 7) (25, 14) (25, 10) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 1) (23, 6) (23, 20) (23, 22) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 29) (7, 25) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (17, 5) (17, 2) (29, 4) (29, 19) (21, 11) (21, 28) (21, 14) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 18) (19, 16) (19, 0) (19, 29) (19, 26) (26, 15) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 2) (24, 3) (24, 26) (24, 8) (24, 14) (2, 17) (2, 26) (2, 13) (8, 7) (8, 28) (8, 24) (1, 20) (1, 22) (1, 7) (10, 25) (10, 13) (12, 6) (5, 17) (14, 25) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 21) (14, 24) (13, 2) (13, 10) (18, 3) (18, 28) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 3 has 5 neighbors, node 6 has 5 neighbors, and node 9 has 3 neighbors. Thus, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars using these nodes.

For node 3:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<3, (15, 6, 0)>, <3, (15, 6, 18)>, <3, (15, 6, 24)>, <3, (15, 18, 24)>, <3, (6, 0, 18)>, <3, (6, 0, 24)>, <3, (6, 18, 24)>, <3, (0, 18, 24)>, <3, (15, 6, 24)>, <3, (15, 18, 24)>

For node 6:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<6, (23, 20, 22)>, <6, (23, 20, 27)>, <6, (23, 22, 27)>, <6, (20, 22, 27)>, <6, (23, 22, 14)>, <6, (23, 27, 12)>, <6, (20, 27, 22)>, <6, (22, 14, 4)>, <6, (22, 27, 20)>, <6, (27, 12, 9)>

For node 9:
- Number of 3-stars = 1
<9, (27, 4, 7)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 1 = 21
So, the final number of 3-stars is [21].
