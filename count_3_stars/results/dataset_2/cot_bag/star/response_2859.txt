Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in this graph, let's first determine the number of neighbors each node has:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 8, 6, 1
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 9, 2
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 7, 1
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 5, 9
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 8, 5, 1, 6
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 4, 2, 1, 3, 7
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 0
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 8, 5, 6, 9, 2
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 4, 9, 0, 7
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 8, 2, 3, 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [41].

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (8, 1, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 2)>
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
<4, (8, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 3, 7)>
<7, (8, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 0, 7)>
<9, (2, 1, 3)>
<(5, 9, 1)>
<(5, 9, 2)>
<(5, 9, 7)>
<(7, 2, 1)>
<(7, 2, 5)>
<(7, 2, 9)>
<(7, 5, 6)>
<(7, 5, 9)>
