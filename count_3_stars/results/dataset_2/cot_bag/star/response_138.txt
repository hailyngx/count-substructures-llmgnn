Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 19) (0, 3) (0, 15) (2, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 9) (17, 5) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 7) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 16) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 9) (16, 19) (16, 6) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 1) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 16) (6, 15) (3, 0) (3, 18) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (14, 4) (14, 8) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 7) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 6) (5, 17) (5, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first construct the graph based on the nodes and edges given. Here is the visualization of the graph:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
- Edges: 
  - 0: {3, 15}
  - 1: {11, 6, 12, 17}
  - 2: {12}
  - 3: {0, 18, 8, 7, 5}
  - 4: {9, 14}
  - 5: {17, 3}
  - 6: {8, 1, 16, 15}
  - 7: {11, 13, 3, 9}
  - 8: {19, 14, 6, 3}
  - 9: {4, 17, 7}
  - 10: {11, 12}
  - 11: {10, 7, 1, 19}
  - 12: {10, 2, 18, 1}
  - 13: {18, 15, 7}
  - 14: {4, 8}
  - 15: {0, 13, 6}
  - 16: {19, 6}
  - 17: {1, 5, 9}
  - 18: {12, 3, 13}
  - 19: {8, 11, 16}

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars.

Nodes with degree 3 or more: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, 19

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 3: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 6: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 7: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 8: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 9: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 11: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 12: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 13: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 15: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 18: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 19: C(3, 3) = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (11, 19, 8)>
<3, (0, 15, 13)>
<6, (8, 16, 15)>
<7, (11, 13, 9)>
<8, (19, 14, 6)>
<9, (4, 7, 17)>
<11, (10, 1, 19)>
<12, (10, 18, 1)>
<13, (18, 15, 7)>
<15, (0, 13, 6)>
<18, (12, 3, 13)>
<19, (8, 11, 16)>
