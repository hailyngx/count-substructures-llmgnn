Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 25) (20, 15) (20, 29) (20, 6) (19, 1) (19, 14) (19, 13) (26, 7) (21, 5) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 29) (13, 19) (13, 27) (4, 27) (27, 13) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 17) (27, 6) (7, 26) (7, 25) (7, 11) (25, 15) (25, 7) (25, 9) (25, 23) (25, 8) (8, 24) (8, 25) (8, 9) (8, 29) (9, 25) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 12) (10, 22) (10, 28) (10, 5) (29, 20) (29, 24) (29, 27) (29, 8) (12, 9) (12, 6) (16, 22) (16, 3) (16, 23) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 22) (11, 2) (1, 19) (1, 11) (1, 28) (0, 28) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 5) (28, 10) (28, 1) (28, 0) (28, 14) (28, 5) (14, 19) (14, 28) (2, 24) (2, 11) (2, 3) (5, 21) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 28) (18, 0) (18, 6) (22, 10) (22, 16) (22, 11) (17, 27) (17, 0) (23, 25) (23, 16) (3, 9) (3, 16) (3, 2) (6, 20) (6, 27) (6, 12) (6, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are:  
Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19, Node 20, Node 22, Node 23, Node 24, Node 25, Node 27, Node 28, and Node 29. 
   
For these nodes, the total number of 3-stars can be calculated using the formula: \( \binom{n}{3} \)  
Where n is the number of neighbors for the node. The result is rounded to the nearest integer.

- For Node 0, there are 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} \) which equals 4.
- For Node 1, there are 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is possible with Node 1 as the center.
- For Node 2, there are also 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is possible with Node 2 as the center.
- For Node 3, there are 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is possible with Node 3 as the center.
- For Node 5, there are 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} \) which equals 4.
- For Node 6, there are 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} \) which equals 4.
- For Node 7, there are 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} \) which equals 4.
- For Node 8, there are 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} \) which equals 4.
- For Node 9, there are 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} \) which equals 4.
- For Node 10, there are 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is possible with Node 10 as the center.
- For Node 11, there are 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} \) which equals 4.
- For Node 12, there are 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is possible with Node 12 as the center.
- For Node 13, there are 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is possible with Node 13 as the center.
- For Node 14, there are 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is possible with Node 14 as the center.
- For Node 15, there are 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is possible with Node 15 as the center.
- For Node 16, there are 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is possible with Node 16 as the center.
- For Node 17, there are 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is possible with Node 17 as the center.
- For Node 18, there are 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is possible with Node 18 as the center.
- For Node 19, there are 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is possible with Node 19 as the center.
- For Node 20, there are 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is possible with Node 20 as the center.
- For Node 22, there are 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is possible with Node 22 as the center.
- For Node 23, there are 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is possible with Node 23 as the center.
- For Node 24, there are 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is possible with Node 24 as the center.
- For Node 25, there are 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} \) which equals 10.
- For Node 27, there are 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} \) which equals 10.
- For Node 28, there are 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} \) which equals 4.
- For Node 29, there are 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} \) which equals 4.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 59. Hence, the representation of the 3-star graph is: [59]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
