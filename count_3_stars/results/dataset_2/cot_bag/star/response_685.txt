Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 5) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (17, 19) (17, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 16) (8, 11) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 19) (18, 3) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 6) (5, 15) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 16) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 19) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 0) (6, 1) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 9) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 9) (19, 14) (16, 8) (16, 13) (14, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 18, and 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 15, 6, 18
Number of 3-stars with node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Unique 3-star with node 3: <3, (15, 6, 18)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 10, 17, 18, 19
Number of 3-stars with node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars with node 4: <4, (10, 17, 18)>, <4, (10, 17, 19)>, <4, (10, 18, 19)>, <4, (17, 18, 19)>

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 15, 13, 11, 0
Number of 3-stars with node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars with node 5: <5, (15, 13, 11)>, <5, (15, 13, 0)>, <5, (15, 11, 0)>, <5, (13, 11, 0)>

Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 3, 18, 0, 1
Number of 3-stars with node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars with node 6: <6, (3, 18, 0)>, <6, (3, 18, 1)>, <6, (3, 0, 1)>, <6, (18, 0, 1)>

Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 12, 0, 18, 2
Number of 3-stars with node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars with node 7: <7, (12, 0, 18)>, <7, (12, 0, 2)>, <7, (12, 18, 2)>, <7, (0, 18, 2)>

Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 13
Number of 3-stars with node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Unique 3-star with node 10: <10, (1, 4, 13)>

Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 10, 5, 16
Number of 3-stars with node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Unique 3-star with node 13: <13, (10, 5, 16)>

Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 3, 7, 4, 6
Number of 3-stars with node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars with node 18: <18, (3, 7, 4)>, <18, (3, 7, 6)>, <18, (3, 4, 6)>, <18, (7, 4, 6)>

Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 17, 4, 9, 14
Number of 3-stars with node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars with node 19: <19, (17, 4, 9)>, <19, (17, 4, 14)>, <19, (17, 9, 14)>, <19, (4, 9, 14)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 23
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 23, with the unique 3-stars being:
<3, (15, 6, 18)>
<4, (10, 17, 18)>
<4, (10, 17, 19)>
<4, (10, 18, 19)>
<4, (17, 18, 19)>
<5, (15, 13, 11)>
<5, (15, 13, 0)>
<5, (15, 11, 0)>
<5, (13, 11, 0)>

<19, (17, 9, 14)>
<19, (4, 9, 14)>
