Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 10) (27, 11) (0, 15) (0, 28) (0, 22) (0, 5) (10, 27) (10, 19) (10, 9) (11, 15) (11, 27) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 26) (23, 8) (23, 5) (23, 29) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 25) (17, 29) (17, 22) (17, 7) (29, 23) (29, 17) (29, 13) (29, 18) (19, 10) (19, 26) (19, 16) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 2) (9, 10) (22, 0) (22, 17) (24, 8) (24, 4) (24, 1) (24, 14) (5, 0) (5, 23) (5, 21) (13, 29) (16, 19) (16, 28) (16, 3) (28, 0) (28, 16) (28, 2) (20, 2) (20, 6) (7, 17) (7, 25) (7, 18) (25, 4) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 18) (1, 24) (1, 25) (1, 14) (1, 12) (6, 20) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (14, 24) (14, 1) (14, 3) (2, 26) (2, 28) (2, 20) (2, 3) (2, 21) (21, 5) (21, 2) (18, 29) (18, 7) (18, 25) (18, 12) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors
- Node 20 has 2 neighbors
- Node 21 has 2 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
For nodes with 4 neighbors:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For nodes with 3 neighbors:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [49] \]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (15, 11, 27)>
<2, (16, 3, 28)>
<3, (2, 12, 14)>
<4, (8, 24, 25)>
<5, (0, 21, 23)>
<7, (17, 18, 25)>
<8, (4, 23, 24)>
<10, (9, 19, 27)>
<14, (1, 3, 24)>
<17, (7, 22, 29)>
<18, (12, 25, 29)>
<19, (10, 16, 26)>
<20, (2, 6, 21)>
<22, (0, 17, 29)>
<23, (5, 8, 29)>
<24, (1, 14, 25)>
<25, (1, 7, 18)>
<26, (8, 19, 2)>
<27, (10, 11, 15)>
<28, (0, 16, 2)>
<29, (17, 18, 23)>
