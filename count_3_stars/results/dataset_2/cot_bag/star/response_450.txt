Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 20) (9, 7) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 20) (14, 17) (14, 11) (17, 14) (17, 11) (17, 7) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 21) (7, 22) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 19) (21, 8) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 13) (2, 29) (2, 18) (29, 2) (29, 0) (29, 5) (12, 27) (12, 24) (12, 28) (12, 25) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 6) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 0) (18, 3) (8, 21) (8, 10) (8, 15) (22, 26) (22, 7) (22, 4) (22, 16) (24, 26) (24, 12) (24, 1) (6, 21) (6, 27) (6, 25) (16, 22) (16, 28) (16, 0) (28, 12) (28, 16) (28, 0) (1, 24) (1, 15) (1, 20) (15, 8) (15, 1) (5, 10) (5, 29) (5, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 5) (0, 29) (0, 18) (0, 16) (0, 28) (0, 4) (4, 22) (4, 0) (3, 18) (3, 20) (20, 9) (20, 26) (20, 1) (20, 3) (23, 18) (25, 12) (25, 6) (25, 19) (19, 21) (19, 12) (19, 25) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- For node 0: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- For node 4: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
- For node 5: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For node 6: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For node 7: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- For node 8: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For node 10: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For node 11: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For node 12: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- For node 13: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For node 15: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
- For node 16: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For node 17: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For node 18: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- For node 19: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For node 20: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- For node 21: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- For node 22: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- For node 24: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For node 25: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For node 26: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For node 27: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
- For node 28: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For node 29: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  

The total number of 3-stars is 41.  
So, the final answer is [41].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<18, (0, 16, 3)>, <20, (1, 3, 20)>, <21, (7, 8, 10)>, <22, (4, 16, 22)>, <21, (6, 19, 25)>, <21, (7, 22, 26)>, <19, (12, 19, 25)>, <13, (5, 11, 13)>, <13, (5, 10, 13)>, <7, (9, 20, 26)>, <12, (6, 12, 25)>, <17, (7, 11, 17)>, <0, (4, 18, 23)>, <29, (2, 18, 29)>, <0, (29, 0, 4)>, <1, (1, 15, 20)>, <12, (12, 19, 25)>, <22, (7, 16, 22)>, <12, (12, 24, 26)>, <28, (0, 16, 28)>, <0, (0, 18, 29)>, <20, (9, 20, 26)>, <7, (7, 17, 22)>, <12, (12, 24, 1)>, <8, (8, 15, 1)>, <3, (18, 20, 3)>, <12, (12, 27, 6)>, <10, (5, 10, 8)>, <27, (6, 12, 27)>, <10, (10, 13, 5)>, <16, (0, 16, 28)>, <5, (10, 5, 13)>, <11, (7, 11, 13)>, <24, (1, 24, 26)>, <8, (8, 10, 15)>, <26, (22, 26, 24)>, <6, (6, 21, 27)>, <5, (13, 5, 29)>, <11, (11, 13, 5)>, <12, (19, 12, 28)>, and <29, (0, 5, 29)>.
