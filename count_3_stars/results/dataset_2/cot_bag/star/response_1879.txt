Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 12) (2, 29) (2, 11) (29, 2) (29, 6) (27, 3) (27, 26) (27, 19) (20, 25) (20, 22) (20, 4) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 13) (25, 16) (25, 8) (18, 5) (18, 7) (28, 16) (28, 9) (16, 3) (16, 25) (16, 28) (16, 13) (7, 25) (7, 18) (9, 28) (9, 13) (4, 20) (4, 14) (4, 21) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 18) (5, 10) (5, 14) (26, 27) (23, 1) (23, 6) (10, 5) (10, 14) (19, 27) (19, 17) (19, 6) (0, 12) (0, 11) (6, 29) (6, 23) (6, 19) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 11) (13, 15) (13, 25) (13, 16) (13, 9) (13, 21) (21, 4) (21, 13) (21, 22) (8, 25) (8, 17) (8, 24) (8, 11) (8, 22) (24, 8) (1, 23) (1, 14) (1, 22) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 1) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 17) (11, 8) (22, 20) (22, 21) (22, 8) (22, 1) 

Response:
There are some nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify those nodes first:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors
- Node 28 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
  - Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 15 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 27 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 25 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 16 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 12 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 5 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 21 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 19 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 17 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 13 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 8 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 14 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 11 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 22 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Add up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 66\).

So, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in this graph.
