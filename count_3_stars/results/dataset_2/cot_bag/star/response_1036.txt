Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 10) (5, 11) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (4, 13) (4, 17) (18, 7) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 19) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (15, 13) (15, 17) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 12) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 19) (12, 2) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 13) (17, 4) (17, 15) (13, 4) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 3) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 9, 6, 1, 0, 7, 2, 8, 19, 14, 13, and 10.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<11, (16, 14, 9)>, <11, (16, 9, 5)>, <11, (16, 9, 14)>, <11, (9, 14, 5)>

Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<16, (11, 9, 10)>, <16, (11, 9, 5)>, <16, (11, 10, 1)>, <16, (11, 1, 8)>

Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<9, (11, 8, 2)>, <9, (11, 8, 10)>, <9, (11, 2, 10)>, <9, (2, 10, 8)>

Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<6, (1, 0, 14)>, <6, (1, 0, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 14)>, <6, (14, 10, 0)>

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<1, (16, 7, 2)>, <1, (16, 6, 7)>, <1, (7, 2, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 19)>, <0, (7, 8, 19)>, <0, (8, 19, 0)>

Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<7, (18, 1, 0)>, <7, (18, 0, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (2, 3, 7)>

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<2, (9, 12, 3)>, <2, (9, 1, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>

Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<8, (16, 9, 3)>, <8, (16, 0, 3)>, <8, (9, 3, 2)>, <8, (0, 3, 19)>

Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<19, (0, 13, 12)>, <19, (0, 13, 19)>, <19, (13, 12, 19)>, <19, (12, 2, 19)>

Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<14, (11, 6, 10)>

Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<13, (4, 15, 19)>, <13, (4, 15, 3)>, <13, (15, 19, 3)>, <13, (19, 3, 12)>

Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<10, (16, 9, 14)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [34].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<11, (16, 14, 9)>, <11, (16, 9, 5)>, <11, (9, 14, 5)>, <16, (11, 9, 10)>, <16, (11, 9, 5)>, <16, (11, 10, 1)>, <16, (11, 1, 8)>, <9, (11, 8, 2)>, <9, (11, 8, 10)>, <9, (11, 2, 10)>, <9, (2, 10, 8)>, <6, (1, 0, 14)>, <6, (1, 0, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 14)>, <6, (14, 10, 0)>, <1, (16, 7, 2)>, <1, (16, 6, 7)>, <1, (7, 2, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 19)>, <0, (7, 8, 19)>, <0, (8, 19, 0)>, <7, (18, 1, 0)>, <7, (18, 0, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (2, 3, 7)>, <2, (9, 12, 3)>, <2, (9, 1, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (16, 9, 3)>, <8, (16, 0, 3)>, <8, (9, 3, 2)>, <8, (0, 3, 19)>, <19, (0, 13, 12)>, <19, (0, 13, 19)>, <19, (13, 12, 19)>, <19, (12, 2, 19)>, <13, (4, 15, 19)>, <13, (4, 15, 3)>, <13, (15, 19, 3)>, <13, (19, 3, 12)>
