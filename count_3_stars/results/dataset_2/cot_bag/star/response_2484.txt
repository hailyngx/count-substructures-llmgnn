Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 9) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 15) (9, 10) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 10) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 8) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 12) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (17, 19) (17, 13) (17, 4) (1, 5) (1, 14) (6, 12) (7, 13) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 6) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 13) (14, 1) (8, 5) (8, 18) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 18) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 3, 15, 19, 11.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 18, 12, 10.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 15, 0, 5, 12.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 11, 16, 13, 17.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 3, 19, 8, 1.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 9, 2, 18.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 11, 3, 2, 19, 6.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 17, 4, 14, 7.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 16, 13, 1.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 3, 0, 9.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 11, 4, 14.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 19, 13, 4.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 2, 10, 8.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 5, 17, 0, 12.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 10: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 12: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 15: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 16: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 17: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 18: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 19: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 36

Therefore, there are 36 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, 3, 15, 19>, <0, 3, 11, 12>, <0, 3, 11, 15>, <0, 15, 19, 12>, <2, 10, 18, 8>, 
<3, 11, 12, 19>, <3, 4, 11, 16>, <3, 4, 11, 17>, <3, 4, 13, 17>, <3, 5, 19, 8>, 
<4, 13, 14, 16>, <4, 13, 14, 7>, <5, 1, 14, 16>, <5, 3, 12, 19>, <5, 8, 18, 19>, 
<9, 10, 18, 2>, <12, 11, 16, 14>, <12, 11, 3, 19>, <12, 19, 5, 6>, <13, 14, 1, 16>, 
<13, 17, 4, 19>, <17, 4, 11, 16>. 

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].
