Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 3) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 
- Node 5 with 5 neighbors
- Node 9 with 4 neighbors
- Node 6 with 4 neighbors
- Node 8 with 3 neighbors
- Node 13 with 3 neighbors
- Node 7 with 3 neighbors
- Node 12 with 2 neighbors
- Node 0 with 5 neighbors
- Node 4 with 4 neighbors
- Node 11 with 5 neighbors
- Node 14 with 5 neighbors
- Node 3 with 3 neighbors
- Node 1 with 4 neighbors
- Node 2 with 5 neighbors
- Node 10 with 5 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 5: [10 3-stars]
- For Node 9: [4 3-stars]
- For Node 6: [4 3-stars]
- For Node 8: [1 3-star]
- For Node 13: [1 3-star]
- For Node 7: [1 3-star]
- For Node 0: [10 3-stars]
- For Node 4: [4 3-stars]
- For Node 11: [10 3-stars]
- For Node 14: [10 3-stars]
- For Node 3: [1 3-star]
- For Node 1: [4 3-stars]
- For Node 2: [10 3-stars]
- For Node 10: [10 3-stars]

Putting all the numbers together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [78].
