Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 24) (15, 2) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 7) (29, 20) (29, 5) (29, 24) (29, 11) (14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (13, 21) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 22) (1, 23) (1, 0) (26, 5) (26, 16) (6, 28) (6, 5) (6, 18) (28, 14) (28, 6) (28, 21) (21, 13) (21, 28) (21, 0) (21, 18) (5, 29) (5, 8) (5, 26) (5, 6) (5, 11) (4, 27) (4, 23) (27, 4) (27, 23) (20, 29) (20, 12) (11, 29) (11, 5) (11, 23) (11, 22) (11, 0) (23, 1) (23, 4) (23, 27) (23, 11) (19, 15) (19, 8) (24, 15) (24, 29) (24, 9) (22, 10) (22, 11) (22, 16) (0, 1) (0, 21) (0, 11) (0, 12) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 24) (12, 14) (12, 20) (12, 0) (16, 3) (16, 26) (16, 22) (16, 18) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 10) (18, 13) (18, 6) (18, 21) (18, 16) 

Response:
Based on the provided edges, we can construct the following 3-star graphs:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 6, 11, and 29: <5, (6, 11, 29)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 2, 19, and 24: <15, (2, 19, 24)>
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 4, and 11: <23, (1, 4, 11)>
- Node 29 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 5, 11, and 20: <29, (5, 11, 20)>

Calculate the number of 3-stars: \( [1 + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3}] = [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [4] \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4.
