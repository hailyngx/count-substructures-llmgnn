Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 6) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 11) (19, 15) (19, 12) (7, 14) (7, 18) (16, 2) (16, 13) (16, 10) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 19) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 18) (0, 2) (0, 17) (0, 3) (0, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 10) (9, 1) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 18) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 1) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 1) (11, 8) (11, 17) (12, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:
Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 1: 4 neighbors
Node 2: 5 neighbors
Node 3: 4 neighbors
Node 4: 2 neighbors
Node 5: 4 neighbors
Node 6: 3 neighbors
Node 7: 2 neighbors
Node 8: 3 neighbors
Node 9: 1 neighbor
Node 10: 4 neighbors
Node 11: 2 neighbors
Node 12: 1 neighbor
Node 13: 4 neighbors
Node 14: 3 neighbors
Node 15: 3 neighbors
Node 16: 3 neighbors
Node 17: 4 neighbors
Node 18: 3 neighbors
Node 19: 2 neighbors

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} \) to calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 33 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 17, 3)>
<1, (0, 14, 18)>
<2, (3, 16, 0)>
<5, (15, 13, 17)>
<8, (11, 2, 5)>
<10, (16, 6, 3)>
<13, (6, 16, 17)>
<15, (5, 19, 17)>
<16, (2, 10, 13)>
<17, (1, 0, 15)>
<18, (1, 7, 3)>
