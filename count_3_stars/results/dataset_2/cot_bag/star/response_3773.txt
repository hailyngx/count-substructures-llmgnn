Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 6, 9, 2, 7
- Node 1: 6, 9, 4, 2
- Node 2: 4, 8, 0, 1, 5
- Node 3: 9, 8, 7, 5
- Node 4: 6, 2, 1
- Node 5: 8, 2, 3
- Node 6: 9, 1, 7, 4, 0
- Node 7: 6, 8, 0, 3
- Node 8: 2, 5, 3, 7
- Node 9: 6, 3, 1, 0

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 40 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
