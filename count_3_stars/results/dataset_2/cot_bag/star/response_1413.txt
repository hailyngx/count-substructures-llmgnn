Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 7) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (4, 9) (4, 3) (12, 2) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 13) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their neighbors:

Node 0: 1, 2, 9, 10, 11
Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 8, 10
Node 2: 0, 12, 13, 14
Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10
Node 4: 3, 9
Node 5: 1, 3, 10, 11, 13
Node 6: 3, 8, 9, 13
Node 7: 9, 11, 13
Node 8: 1, 3, 6, 8, 13
Node 9: 0, 4, 6, 7
Node 10: 0, 1, 3, 5, 11, 14
Node 11: 0, 5, 7, 10, 14
Node 12: 2
Node 13: 2, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 14: 2, 10, 11

Now we can determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <0, (1, 10, 11)>
Node 2 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <2, (0, 12, 13)>
Node 3 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <3, (1, 5, 10)>
Node 5 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <5, (1, 10, 11)>
Node 6 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <6, (3, 8, 13)>
Node 8 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <8, (1, 3, 6)>
Node 9 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <9, (0, 4, 6)>
Node 10 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <10, (0, 1, 3)>
Node 13 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <13, (2, 5, 6)>
Node 14 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <14, (10, 11, 2)>

In total, there are 10 3-stars in this graph, so the answer is [10].
