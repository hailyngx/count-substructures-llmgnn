Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 16) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 19) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 18) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 4) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 13) (7, 11) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 14) (0, 2) (0, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 19) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 14) (15, 5) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 18) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 12) (16, 6) (16, 9) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 19) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, and 19. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- For node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- For node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- For node 11: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- For node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- For node 13: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- For node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- For node 16: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- For node 17: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- For node 18: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For node 19: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 61 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [61]. 

The unique 3-stars formed in this graph are: 
<0, (2, 8, 19)>, 
<2, (0, 8, 18)>, 
<4, (1, 2, 12)>, 
<5, (0, 15, 19)>, 
<8, (1, 2, 19)>,
<9, (4, 12, 16)>,
<11, (7, 17, 5)>, 
<12, (4, 9, 14)>, 
<13, (9, 17, 18)>, 
<14, (10, 12, 19)>,
<16, (6, 9, 16)>,
<17, (10, 11, 13)>, 
<18, (2, 13, 19)>,
<19, (3, 5, 14)>.
