Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 8
Node 2: 0, 6, 7
Node 3: 1, 5, 9
Node 4: 0, 7, 9
Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 7, 8
Node 6: 1, 2, 5, 7
Node 7: 2, 4, 6, 9
Node 8: 0, 1, 5
Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 50

There are 50 total 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
