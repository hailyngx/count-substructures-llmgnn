Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 14) (16, 10) (3, 15) (3, 1) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 7) (8, 11) (8, 19) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 14) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (17, 19) (17, 18) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 0) (18, 17) (18, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 0) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 9) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 13) (12, 10) (2, 0) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 19) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:\\

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19} \\
Edges: (11, 16), (11, 14), (11, 9), (11, 8), (16, 11), (16, 14), (16, 10), (3, 15), (3, 1), (15, 3), (15, 9), (15, 13), (15, 5), (1, 3), (1, 14), (1, 7), (8, 11), (8, 19), (13, 15), (13, 9), (13, 14), (10, 16), (10, 12), (10, 7), (10, 4), (17, 19), (17, 18), (5, 15), (5, 0), (5, 7), (6, 0), (4, 10), (4, 18), (4, 19), (4, 0), (18, 17), (18, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 2), (7, 1), (7, 10), (7, 5), (7, 0), (19, 8), (19, 17), (19, 4), (19, 9), (14, 11), (14, 16), (14, 1), (14, 13), (12, 10), (2, 0), (9, 11), (9, 15), (9, 13), (9, 19) \\

Next, we'll determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph. Let's consider each node individually:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (5, 4, 6, 7). There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0, and thus we have <0, (7, 4, 5)>, <0, (7, 4, 6)>, <0, (7, 4, 5)>, <0, (5, 4, 6)>.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (3, 14, 7). There is 1 3-star with node 1, giving <1, (3, 14, 7)>.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (10, 18, 19, 0). There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4, so we have <4, (18, 19, 10)>, <4, (18, 19, 0)>, <4, (18, 10, 0)>, <4, (19, 10, 0)>.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (15, 0, 7). There is 1 3-star with node 5, giving <5, (15, 0, 7)>.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (1, 10, 5, 0). There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7, so we have <7, (1, 10, 5)>, <7, (1, 0, 5)>, <7, (10, 0, 5)>, <7, (1, 10, 0)>.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (11, 15, 13, 19). There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9, giving <9, (11, 15, 13)>, <9, (11, 15, 19)>, <9, (11, 13, 19)>, <9, (15, 13, 19)>.

Summing these up, we have a total of \[4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 18\] 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 18.
