Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 22) (11, 0) (16, 11) (9, 26) (9, 20) (9, 10) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 2) (13, 4) (13, 29) (22, 11) (22, 27) (2, 26) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 28) (29, 13) (29, 2) (29, 28) (7, 18) (21, 3) (21, 6) (21, 15) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 0) (15, 21) (15, 20) (15, 17) (20, 9) (20, 15) (20, 3) (4, 13) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 17) (8, 2) (8, 24) (8, 17) (1, 26) (1, 4) (1, 19) (5, 6) (5, 28) (5, 27) (6, 21) (6, 5) (6, 25) (28, 2) (28, 29) (28, 5) (28, 3) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 24) (3, 21) (3, 20) (3, 28) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 25) (25, 6) (25, 17) (25, 23) (25, 12) (25, 14) (10, 9) (10, 14) (12, 25) (23, 26) (23, 25) (23, 24) (23, 27) (14, 11) (14, 25) (14, 10) (24, 8) (24, 0) (24, 23) (24, 19) (19, 1) (19, 24) (27, 22) (27, 5) (27, 23) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 61

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [61].
