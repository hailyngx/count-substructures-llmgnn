Response:
There are 30 nodes and 90 edges in this graph. Let's find and list the 3-stars in this graph.

For node 4, we have 3 neighbors: 7, 12, and 11. So, there are 1 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (7, 12, 11)>.

For node 7, we have 4 neighbors: 4, 29, 17, and 8. So, there are 4 3-stars centered at node 7: <7, (4, 29, 17)>, <7, (4, 29, 8)>, <7, (4, 17, 8)>, and <7, (12, 17, 8)>.

For node 18, we have 4 neighbors: 22, 15, 12, and 21. So, there are 4 3-stars centered at node 18: <18, (22, 15, 12)>, <18, (22, 15, 21)>, <18, (15, 12, 21)>, and <18, (22, 12, 21)>.

For node 22, we have 3 neighbors: 18, 26, and 24. So, there is 1 3-star centered at node 22: <22, (18, 26, 24)>.

For node 12, we have 3 neighbors: 4, 18, and 23. So, there is 1 3-star centered at node 12: <12, (4, 18, 23)>.

For node 20, we have 5 neighbors: 0, 17, 1, 13, and 6. So, there are 5 3-stars centered at node 20: <20, (0, 17, 1)>, <20, (0, 17, 13)>, <20, (0, 1, 13)>, <20, (17, 1, 13)>, and <20, (0, 1, 6)>.

For node 27, we have 3 neighbors: 25, 9, and 1. So, there is 1 3-star centered at node 27: <27, (25, 9, 1)>.

For node 0, we have 4 neighbors: 20, 16, 15, and 6. So, there are 4 3-stars centered at node 0: <0, (20, 16, 15)>, <0, (20, 16, 6)>, <0, (20, 15, 6)>, and <0, (16, 15, 6)>.

For node 1, we have 3 neighbors: 27, 20, and 17. So, there is 1 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (27, 20, 17)>.

For node 17, we have 5 neighbors: 7, 20, 1, 3, and 19. So, there are 5 3-stars centered at node 17: <17, (7, 20, 1)>, <17, (7, 20, 3)>, <17, (7, 3, 19)>, <17, (20, 1, 3)>, and <17, (20, 3, 19)>.

For node 3, we have 3 neighbors: 17, 11, and 28. So, there is 1 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (17, 11, 28)>.

For node 11, we have 3 neighbors: 4, 3, and 2. So, there is 1 3-star centered at node 11: <11, (4, 3, 2)>.

For node 21, we have 5 neighbors: 18, 9, 5, 29, and 13. So, there are 5 3-stars centered at node 21: <21, (18, 9, 5)>, <21, (18, 9, 29)>, <21, (18, 5, 29)>, <21, (18, 5, 13)>, and <21, (9, 29, 13)>.

For node 8, we have 4 neighbors: 7, 26, 25, and 6. So, there are 4 3-stars centered at node 8: <8, (7, 26, 25)>, <8, (7, 26, 6)>, <8, (7, 25, 6)>, and <8, (26, 25, 6)>.

For node 15, we have 3 neighbors: 18, 0, and 9. So, there is 1 3-star centered at node 15: <15, (18, 0, 9)>.

For node 9, we have 3 neighbors: 27, 15, and 21. So, there is 1 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (27, 15, 21)>.

For node 5, we have 3 neighbors: 2, 21, and 14. So, there is 1 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (2, 21, 14)>.

For node 29, we have 3 neighbors: 7, 24, and 21. So, there is 1 3-star centered at node 29: <29, (7, 24, 21)>.

For node 13, we have 3 neighbors: 20, 28, and 21. So, there is 1 3-star centered at node 13: <13, (20, 28, 21)>.

For node 25, we have 3 neighbors: 27, 8, and 6. So, there is 1 3-star centered at node 25: <25, (27, 8, 6)>.

For node 16, we have 1 neighbor: 0, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

For node 28, we have 3 neighbors: 3, 13, and 10. So, there is 1 3-star centered at node 28: <28, (3, 13, 10)>.

For node 6, we have 4 neighbors: 0, 20, 8, and 25. So, there are 1 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (0, 20, 8)>.

For node 10, we have 2 neighbors: 28 and 19, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

For node 19, we have 2 neighbors: 17 and 10, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

For node 14, we have 1 neighbor: 5, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].
