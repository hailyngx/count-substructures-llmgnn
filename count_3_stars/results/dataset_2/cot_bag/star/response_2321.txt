Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 28) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 28) (22, 29) (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 29) (27, 15) (27, 25) (27, 29) (27, 10) (27, 16) (6, 23) (9, 17) (9, 0) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 17) (21, 7) (21, 16) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 4) (20, 15) (20, 26) (20, 19) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 25) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 19) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 24) (17, 9) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 28) (5, 4) (5, 19) (19, 20) (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 14) (11, 4) (23, 6) (23, 26) (25, 27) (25, 12) (25, 10) (16, 13) (16, 27) (16, 21) (16, 1) (26, 20) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 3) (10, 27) (10, 25) (10, 26) (24, 1) (3, 7) (3, 26) (3, 18) (14, 19) (29, 22) (29, 15) (29, 27) (29, 0) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 28) (28, 13) (28, 22) (28, 17) (28, 18) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 29) (0, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 7, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with at least three neighbors:
- Node 0: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 12: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 13: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 15: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 16: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 17: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 19: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 20: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 22: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 26: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 27: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 28: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 29: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\(20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 68\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (13, 18, 29)>, <0, (13, 22, 28)>, <0, (13, 22, 29)>, <0, (13, 28, 18)>, <0, (22, 13, 29)>, <0, (18, 28, 29)>, <2, (7, 19, 2)>, <4, (5, 11, 19)>, <7, (2, 17, 7)>, <12, (4, 7, 12)>, <13, (16, 22, 28)>, <15, (20, 27, 29)>, <16, (1, 21, 16)>, <17, (1, 7, 17)>, <19, (2, 5, 19)>, <20, (15, 26, 20)>, <22, (13, 22, 28)>, <26, (3, 10, 26)>, <27, (10, 15, 27)>, <28, (17, 22, 28)>, <29, (15, 27, 29)>
