Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 4) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 2) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 50

Therefore, there are 50 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
