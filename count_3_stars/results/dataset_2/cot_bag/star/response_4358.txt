Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 17) (2, 9) (2, 13) (18, 15) (18, 4) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 16) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (4, 18) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 11) (19, 5) (19, 4) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 16) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 10) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (0, 3) (0, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 17) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 9) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (10, 6) (10, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with \( \geq 3 \) neighbors are: 3, 15, 6, 5, 4, 19, 1, 12, 16, 7, 9, 14, and 11. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 63

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [63].
