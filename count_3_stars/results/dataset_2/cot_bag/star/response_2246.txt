Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 0.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, and 6.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 1.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, and 8.
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 8.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 7, and 9.
- There is 1 3-star with node 5.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, and 9.
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 9.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 59 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [59].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (2, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
