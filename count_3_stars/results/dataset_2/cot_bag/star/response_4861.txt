Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 8) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 12) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 17) (12, 3) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 17) (0, 17) (0, 19) (14, 13) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 5) (1, 15) (1, 13) (15, 4) (15, 1) (15, 17) (9, 17) (19, 11) (19, 0) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 9) (3, 16) (3, 18) (3, 12) (3, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 11, 4, 7, 10, 2, 18, 12, 8, 17, 15, and 3.

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

1. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
2. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
5. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
7. Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8. Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
9. Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
10. Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
11. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\(4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 32\)

Therefore, there are a total of 32 3-stars in the graph. 

Putting the final number inside brackets: [32]

The unique 3-stars found are:

<11, (10, 11, 19)>
<11, (6, 11, 19)>
