Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: {5, 9, 2, 3, 6}
Node 1: {4, 7}
Node 2: {4, 7, 6, 0, 3}
Node 3: {9, 4, 8, 2, 0}
Node 4: {5, 7, 8, 1, 3, 2}
Node 5: {8, 4, 0}
Node 6: {9, 7, 2, 0}
Node 7: {4, 6, 2, 1}
Node 8: {5, 4, 3}
Node 9: {6, 3, 0}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars with each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<0, (5, 9, 2)> <0, (5, 9, 3)> <0, (5, 2, 6)> <0, (5, 3, 6)> <0, (9, 2, 3)> <0, (9, 2, 6)> <0, (9, 3, 6)> <0, (2, 3, 6)> <0, (5, 9, 2)> <0, (9, 2, 3)>

Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<2, (4, 7, 6)> <2, (4, 7, 0)> <2, (4, 6, 0)> <2, (7, 6, 0)> <2, (4, 7, 3)> <2, (4, 0, 3)> <2, (7, 0, 3)> <2, (4, 6, 3)> <2, (7, 6, 3)> <2, (0, 3, 6)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 10 = 20].
