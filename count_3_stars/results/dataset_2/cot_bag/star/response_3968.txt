Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 12) (16, 10) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 18) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 19) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 15) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 15) (2, 8) (2, 19) (0, 4) (0, 15) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 18) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 13) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 1) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 2) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 0) (18, 17) (18, 10) (18, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 15
- Node 1: 6, 13
- Node 2: 8, 19
- Node 3: 5, 9, 11, 18
- Node 4: 0, 14, 19
- Node 5: 3, 12, 13
- Node 6: 1, 7, 11, 14, 17
- Node 7: 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 9, 15
- Node 9: 3, 7, 8, 13
- Node 10: 16, 18, 19
- Node 11: 3, 6, 12
- Node 12: 5, 11, 13, 15
- Node 13: 1, 5, 9, 12
- Node 14: 4, 6, 17
- Node 15: 0, 8, 12
- Node 16: 10
- Node 17: 6, 14, 18
- Node 18: 3, 10, 17
- Node 19: 2, 4, 10

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, there are 11 3-stars in this graph, and they are:
<[0, 4, 15]>, <[1, 6, 13]>, <[2, 8, 19]>, <[3, 11, 6]>, <[3, 9, 13]>, <[4, 0, 19]>, <[6, 1, 14]>, <[9, 3, 13]>, <[11, 3, 6]>, <[12, 5, 13]>, <[18, 3, 10]>
