Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 1) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (8, 13) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 19) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 17) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 18) (15, 16) (15, 18) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 19) (6, 14) (6, 12) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 1) (19, 10) (19, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 15) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 12) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

Number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 1 neighbor
- Node 9: 1 neighbor
- Node 10: 5 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 15: 2 neighbors
- Node 16: 5 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 2 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: [1]
- For Node 1: [4]
- For Node 3: [1]
- For Node 4: [4]
- For Node 10: [10]
- For Node 11: [4]
- For Node 12: [3]
- For Node 13: [4]
- For Node 14: [4]
- For Node 16: [10]
- For Node 17: [4]
- For Node 18: [4]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [43] \]

Unique 3-stars:
