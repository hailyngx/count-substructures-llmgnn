Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 5) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 17) (13, 16) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 17) (7, 3) (7, 15) (16, 4) (16, 13) (16, 12) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 18) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 15) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 18) (1, 12) (2, 3) (2, 15) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 17) (15, 7) (15, 11) (15, 2) (15, 9) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 3) (17, 5) (17, 19) (17, 12) (17, 9) (18, 0) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 4, 5, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and then sum them up to find the total number of 3-stars.

For Node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 8, 9, 5, 16
- Number of 3-stars with Node 4 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For Node 5:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 4, 8, 17
- Number of 3-stars with Node 5 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For Node 8:
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 4, 19, 5
- Number of 3-stars with Node 8 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For Node 12:
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 16, 10, 17, 1
- Number of 3-stars with Node 12 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For Node 14:
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 10
- Number of 3-stars with Node 14 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For Node 15:
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 7, 11, 2, 9
- Number of 3-stars with Node 15 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For Node 16:
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 4, 13, 12
- Number of 3-stars with Node 16 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For Node 17:
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 5, 19, 12, 9
- Number of 3-stars with Node 17 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For Node 18:
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 11, 6
- Number of 3-stars with Node 18 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the number of 3-stars for each node: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 20 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (8, 9, 5)>
<12, (16, 10, 17)>
<14, (0, 6, 10)>
<15, (7, 11, 2)>
<17, (5, 19, 12)>
<18, (0, 3, 11)>
