Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 14) (16, 6) (4, 16) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 15) (8, 0) (13, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (1, 4) (1, 17) (1, 18) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 18) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 6) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 12) (14, 16) (14, 4) (14, 3) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 2) (6, 16) (6, 15) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 0) (12, 10) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 19) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 17) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 5, 8, 10, 12
- Node 1: 4, 17, 18
- Node 2: 3, 7, 13
- Node 3: 2, 14, 17
- Node 4: 1, 7, 14, 16
- Node 5: 0, 8
- Node 6: 15, 16
- Node 7: 2, 4, 9, 10
- Node 8: 0, 5, 15, 19
- Node 9: 7, 9, 17, 19
- Node 10: 0, 7, 10, 12
- Node 11: 16, 18
- Node 12: 0, 10
- Node 13: 2
- Node 14: 3, 4
- Node 15: 6, 8, 19
- Node 16: 4, 6, 11
- Node 17: 1, 3, 9, 18
- Node 18: 1, 11, 17
- Node 19: 8, 9, 15

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 * 12 = 12
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} \times 2 = 8 \) for Node 0
- Total: 12 + 8 = 20

Inside brackets: [20]

Unique 3-stars found: 
- <0, (5, 8, 10)>
- <1, (4, 17, 18)>
- <4, (1, 7, 14)>
- <7, (2, 9, 10)>
- <8, (5, 15, 19)>
- <9, (7, 17, 19)>
- <10, (0, 7, 12)>
- <15, (6, 8, 19)>
- <16, (11, 6, 4)>
- <17, (1, 9, 18)>
- <18, (1, 17, 11)>
- <19, (8, 9, 15)>
