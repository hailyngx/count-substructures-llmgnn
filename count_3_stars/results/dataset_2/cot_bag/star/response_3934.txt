Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 28) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 15) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 20) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 24) (18, 0) (18, 29) (15, 8) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 24) (20, 13) (20, 15) (20, 1) (17, 27) (29, 18) (19, 15) (19, 26) (19, 10) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 11) (26, 16) (26, 7) (6, 10) (6, 22) (28, 5) (28, 10) (28, 23) (0, 8) (0, 18) (7, 26) (7, 25) (7, 16) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 16) (25, 22) (25, 10) (11, 2) (11, 26) (11, 23) (23, 26) (23, 28) (23, 11) (23, 16) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 26) (16, 7) (16, 25) (16, 23) (16, 12) (1, 2) (1, 20) (1, 25) (1, 4) (27, 17) (27, 24) (27, 14) (3, 24) (14, 4) (14, 27) (24, 8) (24, 18) (24, 15) (24, 27) (24, 3) (10, 5) (10, 19) (10, 6) (10, 28) (10, 25) (22, 6) (22, 25) 

Response:
There are a few nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, and 25.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 11, 12, and 18.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 9, and 14.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 9, 10, and 28.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 16, 25, and 26.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 13, 15, and 24.
Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 5, 6, 19, 25, and 28.
Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 2, 23, and 26.
Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 8, 19, 20, and 24.
Node 16 has 5 neighbors: 7, 12, 23, 25, and 26.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 2, 18, 24, and 29.
Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 15, 20, and 26.
Node 24 has 5 neighbors: 3, 8, 15, 18, and 27.
Node 25 has 5 neighbors: 1, 7, 10, 16, and 22.
Node 26 has 5 neighbors: 7, 11, 16, 19, and 23.

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
Node 19 forms 1 3-star.
Node 24 forms 1 3-star.
Node 25 forms 1 3-star.
Node 26 forms 1 3-star.

Adding up all these 3-stars, we have a total of 14 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (1, 11, 18)>
<4, (1, 9, 14)>
<5, (9, 10, 28)>
<7, (16, 25, 26)>
<8, (0, 13, 15)>
<10, (5, 6, 19)>
<11, (2, 23, 26)>
<15, (8, 19, 20)>
<16, (7, 12, 23)>
<18, (2, 24, 29)>
<19, (15, 20, 26)>
<24, (3, 15, 27)>
<25, (1, 10, 22)>
<26, (7, 11, 23)>
