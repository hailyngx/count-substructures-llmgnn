Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 18) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 1) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 2) (16, 15) (16, 9) (17, 4) (17, 13) (17, 5) (19, 10) (19, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (14, 15) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 18) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 16) (10, 19) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 1) (2, 15) (2, 6) (18, 8) (18, 3) (5, 17) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 3) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 5
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 19: degree 2

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17.

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up we get the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 40 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].
