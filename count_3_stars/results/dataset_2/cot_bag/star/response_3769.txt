Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 10) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 7) (1, 19) (17, 0) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 11) (9, 8) (9, 2) (0, 17) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 19) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 5) (16, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 11) (19, 18) (19, 1) (19, 0) (19, 15) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 13) (7, 18) (7, 11) (7, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 2) (3, 14) (3, 13) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 6) (5, 16) (5, 2) (14, 12) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 13) (6, 18) (6, 2) (10, 4) (10, 16) (13, 4) (13, 15) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 45 \)

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [45]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (17, 15, 19)>, <0, (16, 19, 15)>, <0, (12, 14, 11)>, <0, (12, 14, 13)>, <2, (9, 11, 5)>, <2, (9, 11, 6)>, <4, (18, 13, 10)>, <8, (9, 11, 2)>, <11, (8, 12, 7)>, <11, (8, 12, 14)>, <13, (4, 15, 3)>, <13, (14, 15, 4)>, <14, (12, 13, 3)>, <16, (10, 5, 16)>, <18, (7, 6, 4)>, <19, (0, 18, 15)>.
