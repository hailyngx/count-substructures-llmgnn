Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 14) (4, 8) (4, 9) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 8) (17, 13) (17, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 18) (0, 6) (0, 5) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 2) (5, 0) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 10) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 12) (16, 3) (16, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 10) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 10) (12, 13) (12, 18) (18, 8) (18, 11) (18, 12) (10, 19) (10, 1) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, and 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars we obtain 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 49. So, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (7, 9, 10)>
<2, (11, 19, 10)>
<3, (15, 14, 16)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (15, 6, 1)>
<8, (4, 14, 18)>
<10, (1, 2, 19)>
<13, (6, 12, 17)>
<14, (3, 15, 8)>
<15, (3, 7, 14)>
<18, (8, 11, 12)>
<19, (2, 5, 10)>
