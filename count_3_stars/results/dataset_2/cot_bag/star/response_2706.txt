Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 9) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 1) (2, 0) (2, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 14, 5, 2
- Node 1: 12, 6, 2, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1
- Node 3: 8, 11, 6, 9, 5
- Node 4: 12, 0, 14, 11
- Node 5: 11, 0, 3, 1
- Node 6: 8, 11, 3, 1
- Node 7: 12, 10, 13
- Node 8: 13, 11, 6, 12, 3
- Node 9: 13, 12, 14, 3, 1
- Node 10: 7, 13
- Node 11: 4, 8, 3, 5, 6
- Node 12: 4, 7, 8, 1, 9
- Node 13: 7, 8, 10, 9, 1
- Node 14: 4, 0, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [4]
- Node 1: [10]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [4]
- Node 5: [10]
- Node 6: [4]
- Node 9: [1]
- Node 11: [10]
- Node 12: [10]
- Node 13: [1]
- Node 14: [4] 

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 59

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [59].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 14, 5)>
<1, (12, 6, 2)>
<1, (12, 6, 5)>
<1, (12, 2, 5)>

<1, (3, 6, 5)>
<3, (8, 11, 5)>
<4, (12, 8, 1)>
<4, (7, 8, 12)>
