Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 13) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 4) (3, 6) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: (5, 0), (9, 0), (4, 0), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 13), (0, 6), (0, 2)
- Node 1: (9, 1), (4, 1), (10, 1), (11, 1), (14, 1), (13, 1)
- Node 2: (5, 2), (7, 2), (0, 2), (2, 5), (2, 7)
- Node 4: (5, 4), (7, 4), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 1), (3, 4)
- Node 6: (10, 6), (0, 6), (14, 6), (6, 10), (6, 3)
- Node 7: (7, 2), (4, 7), (7, 12), (7, 11), (7, 14), (11, 7), (14, 7)
- Node 10: (10, 8), (10, 11), (10, 1), (11, 10), (6, 10)
- Node 11: (7, 11), (11, 7), (11, 10), (11, 1), (11, 8), (11, 12)
- Node 12: (4, 12), (7, 12), (12, 4), (12, 7), (12, 11), (12, 13)
- Node 13: (0, 13), (14, 13), (13, 12), (13, 0), (13, 14), (13, 1)
- Node 14: (7, 14), (14, 7), (10, 14), (14, 6), (14, 1), (14, 13)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding all the 3-stars up, we get \( 10 + 20 + 10 + 35 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 195 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [195].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 0, 9)>
<0, (5, 0, 6)>
<1, (9, 1, 13)>
<1, (4, 1, 11)>
<1, (4, 1, 13)>
<2, (5, 2, 7)>
<11, (7, 11, 12)>
<11, (7, 11, 14)>
<11, (11, 12, 13)>
<14, (14, 6, 10)>
