Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first look at each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 56.

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (7, 8, 4)>, <9, (7, 4, 6)>.
