Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 14) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 12) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 3) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 10) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 5
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 6
- Node 14: degree 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars based on the node degrees:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 7, Node 11
  Each node forms 1 3-star. So, there are 5 3-stars in this category.

- Nodes with 4 neighbors: Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, Node 12
  Each node forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. So, there are 4 * 4 = 16 3-stars in this category.

- Nodes with 5 neighbors: Node 3, Node 9, Node 10, Node 14
  Each node forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. So, there are 4 * 10 = 40 3-stars in this category.

Adding them up: 5 + 16 + 40 = 61

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [61].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (12, 9, 10)>, <1, (7, 6, 9)>, <2, (7, 13, 3)>, <5, (6, 1, 13)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 10)>, <8, (11, 3, 12)>, <9, (0, 1, 10)>, <10, (4, 5, 13)> 
<12, (0, 11, 3)>, <13, (5, 2, 3)>
