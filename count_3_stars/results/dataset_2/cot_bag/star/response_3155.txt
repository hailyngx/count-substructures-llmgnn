Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8
Node 1: 0, 5, 8, 9
Node 2: 3, 7, 9
Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 5: 1, 4, 9
Node 6: 0, 4, 7
Node 7: 2, 4, 6, 8
Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 7
Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
