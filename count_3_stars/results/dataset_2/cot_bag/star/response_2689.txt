Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 18) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 12) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 14) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 10) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (15, 14) (15, 12) (15, 17) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 19) (16, 4) (16, 6) (16, 19) (12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 19) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 18) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 15) (14, 3) (0, 1) (0, 5) (3, 14) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 12) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 5) (5, 0) (5, 10) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to node 1 and node 5.
- Node 1 is connected to node 0 and node 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 10, and 18.
- Node 3 is connected to node 14.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 14, 16, and 19.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 10.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9 and 16.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 18.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 11, and 17.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 12, and 19.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 18.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 8, 13, and 18.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 15, and 19.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 11, and 14.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 13, and 15.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 12, 14, and 17.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 19.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 8, 13, 15, and 19.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 10, and 11.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 4, 9, 12, 16, and 17.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, (4, 7, 18)>
- Node 4 forms five 3-stars: <4, (2, 7, 18)>, <4, (7, 2, 18)>, <4, (2, 7, 14)>, <4, (2, 14, 13)>, <4, (2, 14, 3)>
- Node 7 forms one 3-star: <7, (4, 2, 18)>
- Node 9 forms one 3-star: <9, (6, 16, 19)>
- Node 11 forms one 3-star: <11, (8, 13, 18)>
- Node 12 forms one 3-star: <12, (9, 15, 19)>
- Node 13 forms one 3-star: <13, (8, 11, 18)>
- Node 14 forms one 3-star: <14, (3, 4, 2)>
- Node 15 forms one 3-star: <15, (12, 14, 13)>
- Node 17 forms two 3-stars: <17, (8, 13, 11)>, <17, (8, 13, 15)>
- Node 18 forms one 3-star: <18, (7, 2, 4)>
- Node 19 forms three 3-stars: <19, (9, 16, 4)>, <19, (9, 12, 15)>, <19, (9, 17, 12)>

There are a total of 18 (shown in brackets) unique 3-stars:  [16].
