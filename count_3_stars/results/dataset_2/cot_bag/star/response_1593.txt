Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 8) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 6) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 10) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 8) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph given the nodes and edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 10, 12, 14, 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 13, 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 10, 11, 13.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 9, 11.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 13.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 11, 12, 14.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 11, 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 9, 10, 12.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, 10, 14.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 8, 9.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 7, 13.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 8, 13.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 11, 12.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, 9.

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors, as these nodes can potentially form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the contributions from each node, we have a total of \( 4+4+4+4+4+10+4+10+10+4+10+4 = 62 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62].
