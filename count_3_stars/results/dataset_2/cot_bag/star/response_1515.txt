Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 3, 8
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 1, 7, 0
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 9, 3, 2, 4, 7
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 6, 9, 1, 8, 4
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 0
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 6, 3, 4, 2, 5, 0

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 58, so [58].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- <9, (2, 1, 7)>
- <1, (3, 2, 7)>
- <3, (6, 1, 4)>
- <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- <8, (6, 4, 5)>
