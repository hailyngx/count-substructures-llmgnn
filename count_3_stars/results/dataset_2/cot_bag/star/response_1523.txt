Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 10) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 0) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 6
- Node 1: 5, 9, 7, 3, 14, 12
- Node 2: 9, 8, 13, 11
- Node 3: 5, 1, 11, 8
- Node 4: 5, 12, 0
- Node 5: 8, 1, 4, 3, 14
- Node 6: 13, 11, 0, 14
- Node 7: 1, 10, 0
- Node 8: 5, 3, 13, 2, 10
- Node 9: 2, 1, 13
- Node 10: 7, 8, 13, 12, 0
- Node 11: 3, 2, 6
- Node 12: 4, 1, 10
- Node 13: 9, 8, 2, 10, 6
- Node 14: 5, 1, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding all the possible 3-stars together: \(20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 69\)

Therefore, there are a total of [69] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 5, 14)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (11, 13, 14)>
<8, (3, 5, 13)>
<10, (0, 7, 13)>
<13, (6, 10, 14)>
<14, (1, 5, 6)>
