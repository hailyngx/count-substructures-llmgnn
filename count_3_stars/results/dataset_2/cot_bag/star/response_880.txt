Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 20) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 23) (20, 4) (20, 25) (20, 3) (20, 28) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 26) (25, 2) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 8) (12, 27) (12, 14) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 9) (23, 7) (23, 18) (23, 2) (1, 8) (1, 26) (26, 25) (26, 1) (26, 17) (18, 27) (18, 23) (18, 0) (18, 29) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 16) (17, 26) (17, 10) (17, 21) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 8) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 0) (9, 27) (9, 29) (29, 18) (29, 9) (29, 6) (29, 24) (21, 10) (21, 17) (21, 11) (2, 25) (2, 23) (2, 3) (11, 8) (11, 21) (11, 14) (11, 24) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 28) (24, 7) (24, 29) (24, 11) (3, 7) (3, 20) (3, 2) (3, 16) (0, 18) (0, 19) (6, 29) (6, 15) (6, 16) (16, 20) (16, 10) (16, 3) (16, 6) (28, 20) (28, 14) (15, 5) (15, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 20, 25, 8, 12, 27, 23, 26, 18, 17, 19, 9, 29, 21, 2, 11, 14, 24, 3, and 16.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: <4, (7, 5, 20)>.
2. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: <7, (4, 3, 24)>, <7, (4, 23, 24)>, <7, (20, 3, 23)>.
3. Node 20 has 5 neighbors: <20, (4, 25, 3)>, <20, (4, 28, 16)>, <20, (25, 2, 16)>.
4. Node 25 has 3 neighbors: <25, (20, 26, 2)>.
5. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: <8, (13, 19, 11)>.
6. Node 12 has 3 neighbors: <12, (27, 14, 19)>.
7. Node 27 has 3 neighbors: <27, (12, 18, 9)>.
8. Node 23 has 3 neighbors: <23, (7, 18, 2)>.
9. Node 26 has 3 neighbors: <26, (25, 1, 17)>.
10. Node 18 has 4 neighbors: <18, (27, 23, 0)>, <18, (27, 29, 0)>.
11. Node 17 has 3 neighbors: <17, (26, 10, 21)>.
12. Node 19 has 4 neighbors: <19, (8, 12, 5)>, <19, (8, 5, 0)>.
13. Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
14. Node 29 has 4 neighbors: <29, (18, 9, 24)>.
15. Node 21 has 3 neighbors: <21, (10, 17, 11)>.
16. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: <2, (25, 23, 3)>.
17. Node 11 has 4 neighbors: <11, (8, 21, 14)>, <11, (21, 24, 14)>.
18. Node 14 has 3 neighbors: <14, (12, 11, 28)>.
19. Node 24 has 3 neighbors: <24, (7, 29, 11)>.
20. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: <3, (7, 20, 2)>, <3, (7, 2, 16)>.
21. Node 16 has 4 neighbors: <16, (20, 10, 3)>, <16, (10, 6, 3)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [18].
