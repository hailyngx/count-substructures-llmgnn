Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are six nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up we get a total of [10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 36 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 3)>
