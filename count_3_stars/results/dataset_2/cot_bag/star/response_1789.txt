The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 21) (9, 3) (8, 28) (8, 10) (8, 25) (13, 23) (13, 14) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 29) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 28) (15, 6) (15, 20) (15, 28) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 14) (7, 27) (12, 7) (12, 29) (11, 2) (28, 8) (28, 20) (28, 15) (28, 18) (25, 8) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 19) (25, 22) (1, 6) (1, 14) (3, 9) (3, 21) (3, 29) (21, 9) (21, 3) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 10) (2, 6) (2, 11) (23, 13) (23, 5) (23, 18) (26, 0) (26, 25) (26, 29) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 1) (5, 23) (5, 4) (19, 25) (19, 4) (19, 17) (17, 19) (17, 22) (18, 28) (18, 23) (24, 29) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 19) (29, 0) (29, 12) (29, 3) (29, 26) (29, 24) (27, 20) (27, 7) (27, 10) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 27) (10, 22) (22, 25) (22, 16) (22, 17) (22, 10) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with only 2 neighbors, namely nodes {8, 13, 0, 12, 11, 5, 17, 24}. These nodes cannot form 3-stars since they do not have at least 3 neighbors.

Let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 6:
- Neighbors: {9, 1, 15, 2}
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star. So, there are 4 3-stars with node 6 as the center.

For node 9:
- Neighbors: {6, 4, 21, 3}
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star. So, there are 4 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

For node 15:
- Neighbors: {6, 20, 28}
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) way to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star. So, there is 1 3-star with node 15 as the center.

For node 20:
- Neighbors: {0, 15, 27, 28}
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star. So, there are 4 3-stars with node 20 as the center.

For node 28:
- Neighbors: {8, 20, 15, 18}
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star. So, there are 4 3-stars with node 28 as the center.

For node 25:
- Neighbors: {8, 7, 26, 19, 22}
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star. So, there are 10 3-stars with node 25 as the center.

For node 1:
- Neighbors: {6, 14}
- There are not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

For node 3:
- Neighbors: {9, 21, 29}
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) way to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star. So, there is 1 3-star with node 3 as the center.

For node 21:
- Neighbors: {9, 3}
- There are not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

For node 16:
- Neighbors: {0, 22, 10}
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) way to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star. So, there is 1 3-star with node 16 as the center.

For node 29:
- Neighbors: {0, 12, 26, 3, 24}
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star. So, there are 10 3-stars with node 29 as the center.

Add up all the 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 38. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars are:
