The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 21) (7, 4) (7, 20) (7, 23) (7, 2) (18, 22) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 28) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 6) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 26) (3, 29) (25, 5) (25, 8) (25, 14) (25, 11) (12, 24) (12, 17) (27, 10) (27, 1) (8, 25) (8, 5) (24, 12) (24, 26) (24, 2) (24, 15) (26, 3) (26, 24) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 15) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 19) (20, 7) (20, 2) (20, 23) (9, 15) (29, 3) (29, 1) (29, 0) (19, 17) (19, 21) (1, 27) (1, 29) (1, 16) (6, 4) (6, 22) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 29) (0, 10) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 26) (10, 0) (23, 7) (23, 26) (23, 20) (28, 18) (28, 3) (28, 13) (15, 24) (15, 26) (15, 9) (2, 7) (2, 24) (2, 20) (2, 6) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 25) (5, 8) (5, 2) (16, 22) (16, 17) (16, 1) (21, 4) (21, 19) (13, 28) (11, 18) (11, 25) (14, 25) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these are the potential central nodes of the 3-stars. Looking at the list of edges, we find such nodes are: 4, 7, 18, 22, 3, 25, 12, 24, 26, 17, 20, and 29.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed. Let's go through them one by one:

1. Node 4: Node 4 has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 7, 21), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
   <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 21)>, <4, (5, 7, 21)>, <4, (6, 7, 21)>

2. Node 7: Node 7 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 20, 23), so it can form 4 3-stars.
   <7, (2, 4, 20)>, <7, (2, 4, 23)>, <7, (2, 20, 23)>, <7, (4, 20, 23)>

3. Node 18: Node 18 has 4 neighbors (10, 11, 22, 28), so it can form 4 3-stars.
   <18, (10, 11, 22)>, <18, (10, 11, 28)>, <18, (10, 22, 28)>, <18, (11, 22, 28)>

4. Node 22: Node 22 has 3 neighbors (6, 16, 18), so it can form 1 3-star.
   <22, (6, 16, 18)>

5. Node 3: Node 3 has 4 neighbors (6, 26, 28, 29), so it can form 4 3-stars.
   <3, (6, 26, 28)>, <3, (6, 26, 29)>, <3, (6, 28, 29)>, <3, (26, 28, 29)>

6. Node 25: Node 25 has 4 neighbors (5, 8, 11, 14), so it can form 4 3-stars.
   <25, (5, 8, 11)>, <25, (5, 8, 14)>, <25, (5, 11, 14)>, <25, (8, 11, 14)>

7. Node 12: Node 12 has 2 neighbors (17, 24), so it cannot form any 3-star.

8. Node 24: Node 24 has 4 neighbors (2, 12, 15, 26), so it can form 4 3-stars.
   <24, (2, 15, 26)>, <24, (2, 12, 15)>, <24, (2, 12, 26)>, <24, (12, 15, 26)>

9. Node 26: Node 26 has 5 neighbors (3, 10, 15, 23, 24), so it can form 10 3-stars.
   <26, (3, 10, 15)>, <26, (3, 10, 24)>, <26, (3, 10, 23)>, <26, (3, 15, 24)>, <26, (3, 15, 23)>, 
   <26, (3, 24, 23)>, <26, (10, 15, 24)>, <26, (10, 15, 23)>, <26, (10, 24, 23)>, <26, (15, 24, 23)>

10. Node 17: Node 17 has 3 neighbors (12, 16, 19), so it can form 1 3-star.
   <17, (12, 16, 19)>

11. Node 20: Node 20 has 3 neighbors (2, 7, 23), so it can form 1 3-star.
   <20, (2, 7, 23)>

12. Node 29: Node 29 has 2 neighbors (0, 1), so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up all the unique 3-stars identified, we have a total of [24] 3-stars.
