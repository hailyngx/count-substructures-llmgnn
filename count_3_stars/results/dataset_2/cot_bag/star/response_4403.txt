Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated based on the connectivity of each node as follows:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 22, 2, 12 => [1]
2. Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 23, 24
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 7, 25, 0, 10 => [4]
4. Node 3 has 1 neighbor: 15
5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 15, 11, 29, 6 => [4]
6. Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 25, 13
7. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 4, 16, 29 => [1]
8. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 11, 24, 2 => [1]
9. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 20, 22, 29 => [1]
10. Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 17
11. Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 25, 13, 28, 27, 2 => [10]
12. Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 18, 23, 24 => [10]
13. Node 12 has 2 neighbors: 26, 0
14. Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 5, 16, 10 => [1]
15. Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 23, 17, 28 => [1]
16. Node 15 has 2 neighbors: 3, 4
17. Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 13, 6, 27 => [1]
18. Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 14, 28, 9 => [1]
19. Node 18 has 2 neighbors: 11, 21
20. Node 20 has 4 neighbors: 25, 26, 8, 28 => [4]
21. Node 21 has 3 neighbors: 18, 22, 26 => [1]
22. Node 22 has 4 neighbors: 0, 29, 21, 8 => [4]
23. Node 23 has 3 neighbors: 11, 14, 1 => [1]
24. Node 24 has 3 neighbors: 7, 11, 1 => [1]
25. Node 25 has 3 neighbors: 20, 5, 10 => [1]
26. Node 26 has 4 neighbors: 20, 27, 21, 12 => [4]
27. Node 27 has 4 neighbors: 16, 26, 28, 10 => [4]
28. Node 28 has 5 neighbors: 20, 14, 17, 27, 10 => [10]
29. Node 29 has 4 neighbors: 4, 22, 8, 6 => [4]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [1] + 4 + [1] + [1] + 4 + [1] + [1] + [1] + [1] + 10 + 10 + [1] + [1] + 4 + [1] + [1] + [1] + 4 + 4 + [1] + [1] + [1] + [1] + [1] + [1] + [1] = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (22, 2, 12)>, <2, (7, 25, 10)>, <4, (15, 11, 29)>, <6, (4, 16, 29)>, <7, (11, 24, 2)>, <8, (20, 22, 29)>, <10, (25, 13, 28)>, <11, (4, 7, 18)>, <14, (23, 17, 28)>, <16, (13, 6, 27)>, <18, (11, 21, 26)>, <20, (25, 26, 8)>, <21, (18, 22, 26)>, <23, (11, 14, 1)>, <24, (7, 11, 1)>, <25, (20, 5, 10)>, <26, (20, 27, 12)>, <27, (16, 26, 28)>, and <29, (4, 22, 8)>.
