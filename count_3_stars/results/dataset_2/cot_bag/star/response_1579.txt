Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 10) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 12) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 14) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 1) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 4) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 4) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 6, 9, 5, 3, 11, 13, 10, 12, 4, and 0.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using \( \binom{n}{3} \), we get:
- Node 6 has \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have \( 35 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 107 \). 

Therefore, there are 107 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are: <6, (9, 5, 10)>, <6, (9, 5, 2)>, <6, (9, 5, 11)>, <6, (9, 5, 0)>, <9, (6, 5, 13)>, <9, (6, 5, 12)>, <5, (6, 9, 3)>, <5, (6, 9, 7)>, <3, (9, 5, 13)>, <3, (9, 5, 12)>, <11, (6, 9, 3)>, <11, (6, 9, 7)>, <13, (5, 6, 3)>, <10, (6, 9, 3)>, <10, (6, 9, 4)>, <12, (5, 6, 0)>, <12, (5, 6, 11)>, <4, (9, 3, 11)>, <4, (9, 3, 13)>, <0, (6, 5, 2)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [107].
