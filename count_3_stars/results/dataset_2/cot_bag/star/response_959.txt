Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 8) (16, 19) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 13) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 8) (27, 5) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 9) (23, 22) (23, 28) (23, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 24) (4, 8) (4, 21) (8, 16) (8, 27) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 28) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 18) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 19) (14, 0) (14, 27) (17, 26) (17, 2) (29, 7) (29, 28) (29, 5) (26, 22) (26, 17) (26, 18) (9, 22) (9, 23) (9, 7) (9, 24) (9, 3) (28, 23) (28, 8) (28, 29) (6, 11) (6, 21) (21, 4) (21, 6) (21, 3) (21, 25) (18, 0) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 26) (18, 13) (3, 9) (3, 21) (3, 19) (25, 21) (19, 16) (19, 12) (19, 3) (15, 20) (2, 17) (5, 27) (5, 12) (5, 29) (1, 10) (20, 15) (20, 24) (24, 10) (24, 9) (24, 20) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 27, 14, 7, 18, 13
- Node 1: 10
- Node 2: 17
- Node 3: 9, 21, 19
- Node 4: 8, 21
- Node 5: 27, 12, 29
- Node 6: 11, 21
- Node 7: 0, 12, 29, 18, 9
- Node 8: 16, 27, 10, 4, 28
- Node 9: 22, 23, 7, 24, 3
- Node 10: 11, 8, 1, 24
- Node 11: 10, 13, 6
- Node 12: 7, 5, 19
- Node 13: 11, 0, 18
- Node 14: 0, 27
- Node 15: 20
- Node 16: 8, 19
- Node 17: 26, 2
- Node 18: 0, 27, 7, 26, 13
- Node 19: 16, 12, 3
- Node 20: 15, 24
- Node 21: 4, 6, 3, 25
- Node 22: 23, 26, 9
- Node 23: 22, 28, 9
- Node 24: 10, 9, 20
- Node 25: 21
- Node 26: 22, 17, 18
- Node 27: 0, 18, 14, 8, 5
- Node 28: 23, 8, 29
- Node 29: 7, 28, 5

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0, 27, and 18 form 1 3-star <0, 27, 18>
- Node 7, 12, and 29 form 1 3-star <7, 12, 29>
- Node 8, 27, and 28 form 1 3-star <8, 27, 28>
- Node 9, 24, and 20 form 1 3-star <9, 24, 20>
- Node 18, 26, and 13 form 1 3-star <18, 26, 13>
- Node 21, 6, and 25 form 1 3-star <21, 6, 25>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
