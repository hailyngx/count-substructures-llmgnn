Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 4, 6

Checking for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, and the possible 3-star combinations involving node 0 are: [<0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>] (4 in total)
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, and the possible 3-star combination involving node 1 is: [<1, (6, 8, 9)>] (1 in total)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, and the possible 3-star combination involving node 3 is: [<3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>] (2 in total)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, and the possible 3-star combination involving node 4 is: [<4, (3, 6, 7)>] (1 in total)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, and the possible 3-star combination involving node 5 is: [<5, (0, 2, 8)>] (1 in total)
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, and the possible 3-star combinations involving node 6 are: [<6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>] (4 in total)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, and the possible 3-star combination involving node 7 is: [<7, (0, 4, 6)>] (1 in total)
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, and the possible 3-star combination involving node 8 is: [<8, (1, 5, 7)>] (1 in total)
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, and no 3-star is possible with node 9.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of [14] 3-stars in the graph.
