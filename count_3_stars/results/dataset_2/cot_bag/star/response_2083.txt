Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 

For node 0: 
There are 4 neighbors connected to node 0 (nodes 3, 5, 6, and 9), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars including node 0. The 3-stars are: <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>.

For node 2: 
There are 4 neighbors connected to node 2 (nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars including node 2. The 3-stars are: <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>.

For node 5: 
There are 5 neighbors connected to node 5 (nodes 4, 6, 7, 8, and 0), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars including node 5. The 3-stars are: <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 0)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 0)>, <5, (4, 8, 0)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 0)>, <5, (6, 8, 0)>, <5, (7, 8, 0)>.

For node 6: 
There are 4 neighbors connected to node 6 (nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars including node 6. The 3-stars are: <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>.

For node 7: 
There are 5 neighbors connected to node 7 (nodes 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars including node 7. The 3-stars are: <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>.

For node 8: 
There are 5 neighbors connected to node 8 (nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars including node 8. The 3-stars are: <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>.

For node 9: 
There are 3 neighbors connected to node 9 (nodes 3, 7, and 0), so there is only 1 3-star including node 9. The 3-star is: <9, (3, 7, 0)>.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed at each node, we get a total of [4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1] = 43 3-stars.
