Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph and calculate the total number of 3-stars. 
[list the unique 3-stars inside <>]
<0, (13, 15, 27)>
<3, (8, 13, 7)>
<4, (6, 15, 22)>
<5, (11, 24, 26)>
<6, (21, 26, 6)>
<7, (13, 17, 18)>
<8, (19, 29, 8)>
<9, (22, 18, 29)>
<10, (19, 24, 10)>
<11, (17, 20, 11)>
<12, (20, 22, 27)>
<15, (0, 12, 27)>
