Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 9) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 0) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 8, 6, 2
- Node 1: 11, 2, 14
- Node 2: 1, 13, 11, 6, 0
- Node 3: 11, 10, 6, 9
- Node 4: 12, 9, 0, 14
- Node 5: 7, 13, 10
- Node 6: 3, 8, 13, 2, 0
- Node 7: 12, 10, 5, 8
- Node 8: 7, 13, 14, 0, 6
- Node 9: 4, 3, 12, 11
- Node 10: 7, 3, 5
- Node 11: 1, 3, 9, 2
- Node 12: 4, 7, 13, 9
- Node 13: 8, 5, 12, 2, 6
- Node 14: 4, 1, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 2: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 6: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 8: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 9: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 11: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 13: [5 choose 3] = 10

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 52 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 52 3-stars in this graph.
