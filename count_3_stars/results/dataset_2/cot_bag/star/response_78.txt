Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:  
1 -> {4, 6, 0, 9}   
2 -> {4, 6, 0}   
3 -> {7, 8, 5, 6, 9}   
4 -> {7, 8, 9, 5, 1, 2}   
5 -> {4, 6, 3}   
6 -> {7, 5, 4, 3, 2, 0}   
7 -> {4, 3, 6, 9}   
8 -> {4, 3}   
9 -> {4, 7, 3, 1}   
0 -> {6, 2, 1}   

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node and then sum them up:

1. \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4 \)  
2. \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1 \)  
3. \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10 \)  
4. \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10 \)  
5. \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1 \)  
6. \({{6}\choose{3}} = 20 \)  
7. \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4 \)  
8. \({{2}\choose{3}} = 0 \)  
9. \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4 \)  
0. \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1 \)  

Adding them up: 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 = 55

Therefore, there are 55 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are: <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 5, 4)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 3, 6)>, <9, (4, 7, 3)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 9, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 3)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <4, (5, 6, 3)>, <6, (1, 0, 2)>, <3, (8, 9, 7)>, <3, (7, 4, 1)>, <4, (9, 1, 6)>, <9, (1, 0, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [55].
