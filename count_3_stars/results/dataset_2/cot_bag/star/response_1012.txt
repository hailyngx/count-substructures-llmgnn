Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 9: There are 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

For node 4: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 7: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 1: There are 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

For node 3: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 2: There are 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

For node 8: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 48 \). So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
