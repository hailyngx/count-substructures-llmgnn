Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 12) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 27) (26, 7) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 24) (3, 11) (3, 27) (3, 22) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 21) (11, 15) (6, 21) (6, 27) (21, 11) (21, 6) (21, 27) (21, 12) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 19) (28, 1) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 23) (19, 22) (23, 19) (23, 7) (23, 10) (17, 9) (17, 25) (17, 27) (17, 15) (25, 26) (25, 17) (25, 15) (25, 18) (22, 3) (22, 19) (18, 25) (18, 20) (18, 12) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 24) (8, 29) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 10) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 0) (4, 29) (0, 4) (0, 2) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 25) (15, 14) (27, 26) (27, 3) (27, 6) (27, 21) (27, 17) (10, 23) (10, 14) (10, 1) (1, 28) (1, 14) (1, 10) (7, 26) (7, 23) (24, 13) (24, 5) (20, 18) (2, 16) (2, 0) (29, 8) (29, 4) (12, 9) (12, 21) (12, 18) 

Response:
There are some nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 22 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 13: \( 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 57 \)

Therefore, there are 57 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
