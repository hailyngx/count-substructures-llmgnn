Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 14) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 10) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of 12 nodes that have three or more neighbors: 4, 7, 8, 13, 12, 2, 5, 3, 11, 0, 9, and 1. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (4, 7, 0). Number of 3-stars formed = 1.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (7, 4, 12, 0). Number of 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: (13, 8, 12, 5). Number of 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors: (12, 7, 13, 2, 5, 0). Number of 3-stars formed = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (2, 13, 12, 0). Number of 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (5, 13, 12, 1, 11). Number of 3-stars formed = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (3, 5, 11). Number of 3-stars formed = 1.
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors: (11, 7, 8, 5, 3, 9). Number of 3-stars formed = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors: (0, 4, 7, 12, 2, 3). Number of 3-stars formed = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (9, 11, 1). Number of 3-stars formed = 1.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (1, 4, 5, 0). Number of 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Summing up the total number of 3-stars from each node = 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 89.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [89].
