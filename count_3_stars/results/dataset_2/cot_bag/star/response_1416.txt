Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has degree 4, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has degree 4, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has degree 3, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has degree 3, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has degree 4, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has degree 4, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has degree 4, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has degree 5, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has degree 4, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has degree 5, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Adding up all these cases:

\[ 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 46 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [46]. Some of the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
