Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 12) (21, 18) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 7) (22, 16) (22, 15) (22, 7) (23, 11) (23, 20) (23, 27) (5, 6) (5, 28) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 20) (26, 7) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 12) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 25) (4, 2) (18, 21) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 11) (13, 19) (13, 2) (13, 11) (27, 23) (7, 9) (7, 22) (7, 26) (7, 25) (7, 16) (25, 4) (25, 7) (25, 17) (25, 28) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 13) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 8) (16, 22) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 17) (17, 25) (17, 16) (17, 24) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (28, 5) (28, 25) (28, 15) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 24) (10, 29) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 10) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 20) (20, 23) (20, 26) (20, 2) (15, 22) (15, 28) (24, 17) (24, 10) (24, 29) (14, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (29, 10) (29, 24) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 6, 9, 26, 18, 7, 22, 23, 5, 19, 4, 13, 25, 11, 16, 0, 28, 10, 12, 2, 20, 15, 24, and 29.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 2 3-stars.

Total = 2 + 3*9 + 2*5 + 1*2 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [44].

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<1, (12, 19, 26)>, <6, (5, 9, 10)>, <9, (7, 18, 26)>, <18, (4, 9, 11)>, <26, (1, 19, 20)>, <7, (9, 16, 25)>, <22, (7, 15, 16)>, <23, (11, 19, 20)>, <5, (6, 26, 28)>, <19, (11, 12, 13)>, <4, (18, 14, 25)>, <13, (2, 11, 19)>, <25, (7, 17, 28)>, <11, (13, 18, 23)>, <16, (0, 17, 22)>, <0, (3, 8, 16)>, <28, (5, 15, 25)>, <10, (12, 24, 29)>, <12, (1, 10, 19)>, <2, (4, 13, 20)>, <20, (2, 23, 26)>, <15, (22, 28, 23)>, <24, (10, 17, 29)>, and <29, (10, 24, 29)>.
