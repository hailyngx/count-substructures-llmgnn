Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 4) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 14) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 4) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 14) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 4) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 14) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first construct the graph:
```
1 --- 2
|     | \
|     |  7
|     | / \
3 --- 0   8
|     |   |
|     |   14
|     |   |
5 --- 4   13
        /
      11

6 --- 10
|  \   |
|    \ |
9     12
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 7). Total 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Unique 3-stars: 
    - <0, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (1, 7, 4, 13). Total 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Unique 3-stars: 
    - <2, (1, 7, 4)>
    - <2, (1, 7, 13)>
    - <2, (1, 4, 13)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (5, 9, 10, 14). Total 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Unique 3-stars: 
    - <4, (5, 9, 10)>
    - <4, (5, 9, 14)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 8, 13). Total 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Unique 3-stars: 
    - <7, (1, 3, 8)>
    - <7, (1, 3, 13)>
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors (6, 11, 12, 4, 2). Total 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). No unique 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors (10, 0, 13, 8, 4). Total 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). No unique 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 36.

So, the final answer is [36].
