Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 17) (15, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (10, 13) (10, 16) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (2, 15) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 9) (4, 13) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 5) (11, 14) (9, 19) (9, 18) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 13) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 17) (6, 2) (6, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 16) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 18) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 5) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 3, 15, 1, 17, 2, 14, 12, 8, 18, and 5. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 36

So, there are 36 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:

<3, (15, 1, 18)>
<15, (3, 17, 2)>
<1, (3, 7, 5)>
<17, (15, 12, 7)>
<2, (15, 0, 8)>
<14, (0, 11, 12)>
<12, (17, 0, 14)>
<8, (2, 19, 5)>
<18, (3, 9, 16)>
<5, (1, 8, 12)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 36, and the unique 3-stars are <3, (15, 1, 18)>, <15, (3, 17, 2)>, <1, (3, 7, 5)>, <17, (15, 12, 7)>, <2, (15, 0, 8)>, <14, (0, 11, 12)>, <12, (17, 0, 14)>, <8, (2, 19, 5)>, <18, (3, 9, 16)>, <5, (1, 8, 12)>.
