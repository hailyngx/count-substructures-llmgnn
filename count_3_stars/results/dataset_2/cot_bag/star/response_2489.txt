Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 1) (3, 13) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 14) 

Response:
Applying the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with three or more neighbors:

For node 0: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 3 neighbors.
For node 1: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 4 neighbors.
For node 2: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 4 neighbors.
For node 3: 1 3-star can be formed.
For node 4: 1 3-star can be formed.
For node 5: 1 3-star can be formed.
For node 6: 5 3-stars can be formed.
For node 7: 3 3-stars can be formed.
For node 8: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 5 neighbors.
For node 9: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 2 neighbors.
For node 10: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 3 neighbors.
For node 11: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 2 neighbors.
For node 12: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 4 neighbors.
For node 13: 3 3-stars can be formed.
For node 14: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 3 neighbors.

The total number of 3-stars is: 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 3 = 14

So, the final answer is: [14]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (5, 0, 11)>
<4, (6, 7, 10)>
<5, (7, 4, 8)>
<6, (10, 2, 12)>
<7, (4, 5, 13)>
<13, (4, 8, 14)>
