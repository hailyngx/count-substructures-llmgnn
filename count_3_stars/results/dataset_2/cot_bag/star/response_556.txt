Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 19) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 12) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 0) (18, 11) (18, 12) (6, 2) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (10, 0) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 12) (19, 16) (19, 15) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 15) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 6) (1, 8) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 14) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 3) (13, 6) (13, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 40
Therefore, there are 40 unique 3-stars found in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
