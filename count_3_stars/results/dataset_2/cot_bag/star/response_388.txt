Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 2) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 4) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 1) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 5) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 5) (13, 17) (13, 1) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (19, 14) (19, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 6) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 3) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 0) (5, 12) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 6) (14, 4) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 4) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 different 3-stars)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 different 3-stars)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) (20 different 3-stars)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 different 3-stars)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 different 3-stars)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 different 3-stars)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 different 3-stars)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 different 3-stars)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 different 3-stars)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 different 3-stars)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 different 3-stars)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 different 3-stars)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 different 3-stars)
- Node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Summing all the 3-stars formed at each node, we get a total of [72] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (9, 16, 4)>, <3, (6, 12, 5)>, <3, (7, 2, 4)>, <3, (7, 18, 1)>, <4, (17, 2, 11)>, <4, (1, 13, 18)>, <4, (1, 18, 15)>, <5, (15, 17, 4)>, <5, (0, 6, 12)>, <5, (12, 6, 14)>, <5, (16, 3, 9)>, <6, (12, 5, 0)>, <6, (3, 16, 5)>, <9, (11, 2, 7)>, <11, (10, 17, 13)>.
