Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
This graph can be represented as follows:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 3.

Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.

Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 5.

Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 7, 0, and 8.

Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 7, and 8.

Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8, and 2.

Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 2, 4, 8, and 0.

Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 5.

Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9.

Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 4, 2, 0, 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed at each node:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]

Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]

Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]

Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]

Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]

Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]

Node 6: [inom{6}{3}] = [20]

Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]

Node 8: [inom{6}{3}] = [20]

Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get: 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 66.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [66].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<3, (6, 8, 0)>, <3, (6, 0, 9)>, <3, (6, 1, 8)>, <3, (6, 4, 8)>, <3, (6, 8, 4)>, <3, (6, 9, 4)>, <3, (8, 1, 6)>, <3, (8, 1, 5)>, <3, (8, 4, 6)>, <3, (8, 4, 5)>
