Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Here is the list of such nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

There are no other nodes with three or more neighbors, so we have a total of \( 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 60 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
