Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 11) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 5) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (10, 8) (10, 12) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 2) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 7, 12, 14. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<1, (3, 7, 14)>
<3, (1, 6, 4)>
<4, (3, 8, 13)>
<4, (7, 2, 0)>
<4, (13, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 12, 0)>
<7, (12, 6, 9)>
<12, (8, 7, 2)>
<12, (7, 6, 10)>
<12, (2, 12, 6)>
<12, (12, 10, 6)>
<14, (1, 5, 11)>
<14, (11, 6, 5)>
