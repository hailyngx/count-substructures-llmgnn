Only one node, Node 4, has less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed with Node 4.

For the rest of the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 13 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 21 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 22 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 25 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 26 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 28 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (12, 27, 3)>
<1, (17, 21, 5)>
<2, (9, 22, 10)>
<3, (13, 19, 15)>
<5, (8, 21, 17)>
<9, (2, 29, 13)>
<10, (19, 13, 15)>
<14, (7, 22, 24)>
<15, (18, 16, 23)>
<17, (5, 16, 21)>
<21, (8, 17, 27)>
<22, (7, 14, 2)>
<23, (1, 25, 15)>
<28, (13, 29, 14)>
