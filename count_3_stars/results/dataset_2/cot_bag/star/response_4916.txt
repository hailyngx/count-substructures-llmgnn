Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 0) (2, 7) (2, 16) (18, 4) (18, 11) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 16) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 3) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 1) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 17) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 6) (10, 4) (10, 0) (11, 18) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 12) (14, 13) (14, 3) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 6) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 16) (15, 4) (15, 9) (12, 11) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, and 19. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

- For node 0: There are 4 neighbors (4, 13, 10, 17), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 1: There are 3 neighbors (8, 5, 9), so there is 1 3-star.
- For node 2: There are 2 neighbors (7, 16), so no 3-star.
- For node 3: There are 3 neighbors (19, 14, 6), so there is 1 3-star.
- For node 4: There are 5 neighbors (7, 18, 0, 10, 15), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 5: There are 4 neighbors (7, 19, 1, 16), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 6: There are 3 neighbors (16, 11, 3), so there is 1 3-star.
- For node 7: There are 4 neighbors (4, 2, 5, 5), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 8: There are 2 neighbors (13, 1), so no 3-star.
- For node 9: There are 3 neighbors (15, 17, 1), so there is 1 3-star.
- For node 10: There are 2 neighbors (4, 0), so no 3-star.
- For node 11: There are 4 neighbors (18, 19, 6, 12), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 13: There are 4 neighbors (8, 19, 14, 0), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 16: There are 4 neighbors (2, 5, 17, 6), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 17: There are 4 neighbors (9, 0, 16, 6), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 18: There are 2 neighbors (4, 11), so no 3-star.
- For node 19: There are 4 neighbors (13, 5, 11, 3), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54]. The unique 3-stars are:
