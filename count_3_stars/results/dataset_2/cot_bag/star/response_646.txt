Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 15) (14, 0) (14, 10) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 13) (1, 6) (1, 8) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 19) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 19) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 18) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 15) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (9, 4) (9, 17) (5, 3) (5, 18) (5, 10) (18, 6) (18, 15) (18, 8) (18, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 4) (17, 7) (17, 8) (17, 9) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 19. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 34 in total.

Therefore, the final answer is [34]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (14, 15, 19)>, <2, (7, 12, 19)>, <3, (0, 6, 15)>, <3, (5, 11, 13)>, <6, (1, 18, 19)>, <7, (10, 12, 17)>, <8, (1, 12, 18)>, <10, (4, 5, 7)>, <13, (4, 11, 7)>, <17, (7, 8, 9)>
