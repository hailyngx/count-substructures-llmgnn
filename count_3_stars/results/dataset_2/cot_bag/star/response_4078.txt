Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
From the given edge list, we can see that the node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 6
- Node 8 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 4

Now, for each node that has three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it participates in.

- Node 0: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 56\).

Therefore, the final answer is \([56]\), and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (3, 8, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 8, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>.
