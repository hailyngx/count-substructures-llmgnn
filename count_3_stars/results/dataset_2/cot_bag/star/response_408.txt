Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 9) (21, 7) (21, 28) (7, 21) (7, 24) (7, 23) (22, 14) (22, 6) (22, 8) (23, 7) (23, 11) (23, 0) (0, 23) (0, 14) (0, 15) (20, 6) (20, 10) (20, 16) (14, 22) (14, 0) (14, 15) (14, 5) (17, 1) (17, 29) (17, 4) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 25) (28, 21) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 2) (5, 1) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 8) (13, 5) (13, 25) (8, 22) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 28) (9, 8) (11, 23) (11, 26) (11, 2) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (2, 28) (2, 11) (2, 12) (6, 22) (6, 20) (6, 24) (24, 7) (24, 6) (24, 18) (24, 10) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 26) (15, 18) (26, 11) (26, 15) (26, 27) (3, 4) (3, 18) (27, 29) (27, 26) (27, 19) (25, 29) (25, 13) (25, 16) (16, 1) (16, 20) (16, 25) (18, 24) (18, 15) (18, 3) (10, 20) (10, 24) (19, 28) (19, 27) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 2
- Node 20: degree 3
- Node 21: degree 3
- Node 22: degree 3
- Node 23: degree 3
- Node 24: degree 4
- Node 25: degree 3
- Node 26: degree 3
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 28: degree 4
- Node 29: degree 3

Based on the degrees of the nodes, the total number of three-stars can be calculated as follows:
\( \left[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \right] = [4+4+4+1+4+4+4] = [25] \)

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (14, 15, 23)><1, (5, 16, 17)><2, (11, 12, 28)><4, (3, 12, 17)><5, (8, 13, 14)><6, (20, 22, 24)><7, (21, 23, 28)><9, (8, 9, 28)><11, (2, 11, 26)><13, (5, 13, 25)><14, (0, 5, 15)><15, (18, 15, 24)><16, (16, 20, 25)><18, (3, 15, 24)><19, (19, 27, 28)><20, (10, 16, 20)><21, (21, 23, 28)><22, (6, 8, 22)><23, (7, 14, 21)><24, (10, 18, 24)><25, (16, 25, 29)><26, (11, 15, 26)><27, (19, 26, 27)><28, (2, 19, 28)><29, (25, 27, 29)>
