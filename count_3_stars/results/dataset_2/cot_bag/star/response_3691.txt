Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: (4, 1, 8, 2, 6)
- Node 1: (3, 2, 0, 5)
- Node 2: (7, 1, 3, 0)
- Node 3: (7, 6, 9, 1, 2, 8)
- Node 4: (7, 9, 0)
- Node 5: (7, 6, 1, 8)
- Node 6: (7, 5, 3, 0)
- Node 7: (4, 3, 6, 2, 5)
- Node 8: (3, 5, 0)
- Node 9: (4, 3)

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars based on the above information:
- Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 4: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)

Adding them up, the total number of 3-stars is [10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1] = 55

Therefore, there are 55 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 3)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 7, 4)>, <7, (5, 3, 6)>, <3, (6, 9, 4)>
