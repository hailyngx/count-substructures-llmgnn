Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {4, 2, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {8, 6, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 6, 1, 3, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 4, 2, 0, 7}
- Node 4: {9, 8, 0, 3}
- Node 5: {2, 3}
- Node 6: {8, 1, 7, 2}
- Node 7: {6, 0, 3}
- Node 8: {9, 4, 2, 6, 1}
- Node 9: {8, 4, 3}
  
Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 3: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Adding these up, we get a total of [4 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1] = 64 3-stars.

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 2, 7)>
<0, (4, 2, 3)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (5, 8, 6)>
<2, (5, 8, 1)>
<2, (8, 6, 1)>
<2, (6, 1, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<3, (5, 4, 2)>
<3, (4, 2, 0)>
<3, (9, 4, 0)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
<6, (8, 1, 7)>
<8, (9, 4, 2)>
<8, (4, 2, 6)>
