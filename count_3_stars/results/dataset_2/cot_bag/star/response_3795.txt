Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 9) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 20) (22, 29) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 21) (9, 13) (9, 5) (9, 28) (9, 17) (9, 16) (15, 14) (27, 12) (27, 8) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 10) (21, 5) (21, 7) (21, 19) (21, 11) (21, 14) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 12) (10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 6) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 23) (17, 10) (17, 1) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 0) (8, 27) (8, 4) (8, 29) (8, 25) (12, 27) (12, 23) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 26) (14, 13) (14, 15) (14, 21) (14, 18) (18, 4) (18, 14) (1, 17) (1, 24) (24, 1) (24, 26) (26, 5) (26, 0) (26, 24) (26, 29) (26, 25) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 25) (6, 10) (6, 2) (11, 7) (11, 21) (11, 2) (3, 20) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 26) (28, 9) (28, 19) (20, 22) (20, 3) (25, 23) (25, 8) (25, 26) (25, 2) (19, 7) (19, 21) (19, 28) (16, 9) 

Response:
The node degrees for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 1
- Node 16: degree 1
- Node 17: degree 5
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 19: degree 3
- Node 20: degree 2
- Node 21: degree 5
- Node 22: degree 3
- Node 23: degree 3
- Node 24: degree 2
- Node 25: degree 4
- Node 26: degree 5
- Node 27: degree 2
- Node 28: degree 2
- Node 29: degree 4

Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 unique 3-stars. 
Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 unique 3-stars.
Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 unique 3-stars.
Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 unique 3-stars.

Adding these up gives a total of 40 unique 3-stars. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40].    

The unique 3-stars are:
