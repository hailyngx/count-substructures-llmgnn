Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 11) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 6) (7, 14) (7, 6) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 19) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 1) (1, 15) (1, 8) (1, 13) (19, 12) (19, 8) (16, 14) (16, 12) (16, 18) (0, 15) (0, 13) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 13) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 16) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are:
Node 0: 2 neighbors
Node 1: 3 neighbors
Node 2: 3 neighbors
Node 3: 2 neighbors
Node 4: 3 neighbors
Node 5: 3 neighbors
Node 6: 5 neighbors
Node 7: 2 neighbors
Node 8: 4 neighbors
Node 9: 3 neighbors
Node 10: 4 neighbors
Node 11: 3 neighbors
Node 12: 3 neighbors
Node 13: 4 neighbors
Node 14: 3 neighbors
Node 15: 5 neighbors
Node 16: 3 neighbors
Node 17: 2 neighbors
Node 18: 3 neighbors
Node 19: 2 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
Node 1: [1]
Node 2: [1]
Node 4: [1]
Node 5: [1]
Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 9: [1]
Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 11: [1]
Node 12: [1]
Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 14: [1]
Node 15: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
Node 16: [1]
Node 18: [1]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 8, 13>
<2, 8, 19>
<4, 6, 13>
<5, 9, 18>
<6, 10, 11>
<6, 10, 8>
<6, 11, 17>
<6, 12, 16>
<8, 10, 1>
<8, 19, 12>
<10, 11, 17>
<13, 0, 15>
<14, 7, 6>
<15, 0, 13>
<15, 2, 8>
<16, 12, 6>
