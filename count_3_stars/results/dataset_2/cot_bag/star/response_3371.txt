Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 0) (16, 21) (16, 8) (16, 4) (13, 22) (13, 24) (13, 14) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 12) (22, 21) (6, 13) (6, 25) (6, 0) (9, 2) (18, 22) (18, 17) (18, 1) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 24) (1, 18) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 29) (21, 16) (21, 22) (21, 12) (4, 16) (4, 27) (4, 5) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 17) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 8) (29, 1) (29, 12) (28, 27) (28, 23) (28, 15) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 15) (27, 4) (27, 28) (27, 3) (27, 7) (27, 5) (15, 10) (15, 28) (15, 14) (15, 26) (23, 28) (23, 26) (26, 15) (26, 23) (26, 3) (7, 27) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 27) (20, 3) (20, 24) (2, 9) (2, 19) (2, 3) (19, 2) (12, 22) (12, 21) (12, 29) (3, 10) (3, 27) (3, 26) (3, 20) (3, 2) (25, 6) (25, 24) (24, 13) (24, 10) (24, 20) (24, 25) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we can first examine the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes could potentially be the centers of 3-stars. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 10, 11, 13, 16, 18, 21, 22, 24, 27, and 28.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For node 11: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- For node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For node 16: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- For node 18: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- For node 21: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- For node 22: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For node 24: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For node 27: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- For node 28: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].
