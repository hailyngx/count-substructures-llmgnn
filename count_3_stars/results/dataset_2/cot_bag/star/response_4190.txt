Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 12) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 2) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 1) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 2) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 9) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 5) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: {4, 10, 12, 6}  
Node 1: {7, 13, 5}  
Node 2: {13, 3, 6, 14}  
Node 3: {13, 11, 2}  
Node 4: {7, 0, 5}  
Node 5: {4, 11, 1, 12}  
Node 6: {7, 13, 0, 14, 2}  
Node 7: {4, 6, 14, 1}  
Node 8: {13, 14, 10, 12}  
Node 9: {10, 11, 12}  
Node 10: {8, 11, 0, 9}  
Node 11: {10, 3, 9, 5, 12}  
Node 12: {8, 11, 5, 0, 9}  
Node 13: {8, 1, 3, 6, 2}  
Node 14: {8, 7, 6, 2}  

Now, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 can form 4 3-stars
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star
- Node 7 can form 1 3-star
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star
- Node 10 can form 1 3-star
- Node 11 can form 1 3-star
- Node 12 can form 1 3-star
- Node 13 can form 1 3-star
- Node 14 can form 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 17

After listing the unique 3-stars found:
\[ [17] \]

<0, (4, 10, 12, 6)>, <1, (7, 13, 5)>, <2, (13, 3, 6, 14)>, <3, (13, 11, 2)>, <4, (7, 0, 5)>, <5, (4, 11, 1, 12)>, <6, (7, 13, 0, 14, 2)>, <7, (4, 6, 14, 1)>, <8, (13, 14, 10, 12)>, <10, (8, 11, 0, 9)>, <11, (10, 3, 9, 5, 12)>, <12, (8, 11, 5, 0, 9)>, <13, (8, 1, 3, 6, 2)>, <14, (8, 7, 6, 2)>
