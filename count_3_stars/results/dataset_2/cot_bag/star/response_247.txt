Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:  
1: {0, 4, 7}  
2: {1, 4, 8, 9}  
3: {1, 5, 6, 7}  
4: {1, 2, 7, 8, 9}  
5: {0, 3, 7, 9}  
6: {3, 7}  
7: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}  
8: {2, 4, 9}  
9: {0, 2, 4, 5, 8}  
0: {1, 5, 9}  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For node 1: [\[ \binom{3}{3} \] = 1]  
- For node 2: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]  
- For node 3: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]  
- For node 4: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]  
- For node 5: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]  
- For node 7: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]  
- For node 9: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]  

The total number of 3-stars is \[ 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 43 \].
Therefore, we have a total of [43] 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>
