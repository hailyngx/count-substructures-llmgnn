Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 18) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 0) (8, 14) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 19) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 17) (17, 13) (17, 9) (6, 8) (6, 14) (16, 3) (16, 7) (14, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 6) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 19) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 9) (12, 11) (12, 10) (10, 4) (10, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 7, 9, 14, 18.

For node 0, there are 5 choices for the three neighbors forming a 3-star with it. Hence, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 4, there are 5 choices for the three neighbors forming a 3-star with it. Hence, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 7, there are 4 choices for the three neighbors forming a 3-star with it. Hence, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 9, there are 4 choices for the three neighbors forming a 3-star with it. Hence, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 14, there are 4 choices for the three neighbors forming a 3-star with it. Hence, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 18, there are 4 choices for the three neighbors forming a 3-star with it. Hence, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36 \).

Therefore, there are [36] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (7, 14, 18)>
- <4, (5, 9, 19)>
- <7, (0, 11, 16)>
- <9, (4, 15, 17)>
- <14, (5, 6, 18)>
- <18, (0, 2, 14)>
