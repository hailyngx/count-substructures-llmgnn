Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 19) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 15) (1, 4) (1, 18) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 18) (18, 1) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 18) (15, 17) (15, 0) (8, 14) (8, 17) (19, 14) (19, 3) (19, 18) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (7, 5) (7, 16) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 10) (2, 9) (2, 11) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 0) (0, 9) (0, 15) (0, 12) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 18. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up all these 3-stars, we have a total of \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 31 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31].  

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 12, 15)>
<4, (1, 18, 13)>
<5, (7, 13, 17)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<10, (12, 16, 6)>
<12, (0, 6, 10)>
<13, (18, 5, 9)>
<14, (19, 17, 8)>
<16, (10, 18, 6)>
<17, (14, 15, 8)>
<18, (13, 16, 4)>
