Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 9) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 14) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 9) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 14) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

Node 0: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: 6 neighbors, so \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 10: 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 12: 6 neighbors, so \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 13: 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 14: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 76

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [76].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (8, 7, 12)>
<4, (13, 3, 12)>
<5, (7, 9, 1)>
<6, (8, 11, 14)>
<9, (4, 7, 1)>
<10, (13, 14, 0)>
<12, (4, 3, 6)>
<13, (8, 4, 2)>
<14, (10, 6, 9)>
