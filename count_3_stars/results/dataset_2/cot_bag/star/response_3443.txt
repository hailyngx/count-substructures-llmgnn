Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 10) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 12) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: nodes 9, 13, 0, 5, and 6.
- The number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Unique 3-stars with 4 as center: <4, (9, 13, 0)>, <4, (9, 0, 6)>, <4, (9, 13, 5)>, <4, (13, 0, 5)>, <4, (13, 5, 6)>.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: nodes 4, 7, 8, 13, and 10.
- The number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Unique 3-stars with 5 as center: <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 10)>, <5, (4, 8, 10)>, <5, (7, 8, 10)>, <5, (7, 8, 13)>.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: nodes 4, 9, 14, and 2.
- The number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Unique 3-stars with 6 as center: <6, (4, 9, 14)>, <6, (4, 9, 2)>, <6, (4, 14, 2)>, <6, (9, 14, 2)>.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: nodes 3, 5, 13, and 1.
- The number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Unique 3-stars with 7 as center: <7, (3, 5, 13)>, <7, (3, 5, 1)>, <7, (3, 13, 1)>, <7, (5, 13, 1)>.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: nodes 4, 6, 11, 0, and 12.
- The number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Unique 3-stars with 9 as center: <9, (4, 6, 11)>, <9, (4, 6, 0)>, <9, (4, 6, 12)>, <9, (4, 11, 0)>, <9, (4, 11, 12)>.

For node 13:
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: nodes 4, 7, 1, 5, and 12.
- The number of 3-stars with node 13 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Unique 3-stars with 13 as center: <13, (4, 7, 1)>, <13, (4, 7, 12)>, <13, (4, 1, 5)>, <13, (7, 1, 5)>, <13, (7, 5, 12)>.

Adding up all the unique 3-stars from the calculations above, we have a total of [38] unique 3-stars in the graph.
