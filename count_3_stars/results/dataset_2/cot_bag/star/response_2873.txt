Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
There are three nodes with more than 3 neighbors: node 4, node 8, and node 3. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around these nodes:

For node 4:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For node 8:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

For node 3:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

Adding these up:
\[ 10 + 20 + 20 = 50 \]

So, there are a total of 50 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 0, 4)>
<8, (5, 0, 8)>
<8, (5, 0, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 4)>
<3, (1, 8, 0)>
<3, (9, 4, 6)>
<3, (9, 4, 8)>
<3, (9, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 0, 4)>
<3, (5, 0, 8)> 

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50].
