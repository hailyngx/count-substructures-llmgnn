Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 2) (16, 0) (16, 25) (8, 22) (8, 7) (13, 7) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 23) (4, 18) (4, 22) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 1) (21, 10) (21, 26) (28, 1) (28, 27) (28, 20) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 3) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (20, 28) (20, 29) (20, 19) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 26) (0, 9) (22, 8) (22, 4) (22, 15) (22, 7) (14, 11) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 12) (23, 17) (23, 26) (23, 25) (23, 1) (26, 21) (26, 0) (26, 23) (26, 15) (9, 0) (9, 25) (9, 27) (24, 15) (25, 16) (25, 23) (25, 9) (25, 12) (15, 0) (15, 22) (15, 26) (15, 24) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 12) (19, 29) (19, 20) (27, 28) (27, 9) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 22) (7, 5) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 29) (5, 0) (5, 7) (12, 14) (12, 25) (12, 6) (1, 18) (1, 28) (1, 23) 

Response:
We can start by identifying the nodes that have at least three neighbors:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 31 \)

So, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <5, (0, 11, 18)>
- <5, (0, 7, 29)>
- <5, (11, 18, 29)>
- <5, (7, 18, 22)>
- <5, (7, 22, 29)>
- <10, (14, 17, 21)>
- <14, (10, 11, 12)>
- <18, (1, 4, 5)>
- <22, (4, 7, 8)>
- <22, (15, 22, 26)>
- <22, (7, 15, 23)>
- <22, (7, 15, 26)>
- <23, (1, 17, 26)>
- <26, (0, 15, 21)>
- <26, (1, 15, 23)>
- <26, (15, 21, 23)>
