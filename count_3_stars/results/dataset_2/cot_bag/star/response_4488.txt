Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) 

Response:
There are two nodes with 5 neighbors (node 5 and node 9), and one node with 4 neighbors (node 4). Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 8, 7)>

For node 9:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 7, 9)>

For node 4:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 = 24
So, the final answer is [24].
