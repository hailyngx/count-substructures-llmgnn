Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors so we can calculate the total number of 3-stars. 
The degrees of the nodes are:   
Node 0: degree 3  
Node 1: degree 4  
Node 2: degree 4  
Node 3: degree 4  
Node 4: degree 5  
Node 5: degree 4  
Node 6: degree 4  
Node 7: degree 5  
Node 8: degree 5  
Node 9: degree 4  

Now we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Nodes 4, 7, and 8 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
Nodes 1, 2, and 3 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
Node 0 has 3 neighbors so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these together, we get a total of 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 43 3-stars in this graph.

Thus, the final answer is [43].

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<4, (6, 1, 3)>
<7, (5, 8, 0)>
<8, (5, 9, 1)>
<7, (1, 0, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (5, 1, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 0)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (6, 1, 8)>
<8, (9, 2, 5)>
<8, (9, 2, 3)>
<4, (6, 1, 0)>
<8, (2, 5, 3)>
<7, (5, 1, 0)>
<4, (0, 6, 2)>
<8, (5, 2, 3)>
<8, (3, 5, 2)>
<7, (8, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 0, 3)>
<7, (1, 8, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 0)>
<7, (1, 8, 0)>
<8, (3, 2, 5)>
