Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 26) (22, 19) (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 1) (26, 22) (26, 9) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 27) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 23) (17, 27) (17, 11) (5, 0) (5, 27) (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 18) (10, 28) (11, 26) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 25) (28, 10) (28, 27) (28, 15) (29, 7) (4, 14) (4, 27) (4, 0) (4, 25) (27, 26) (27, 17) (27, 5) (27, 28) (27, 4) (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 8) (21, 14) (21, 10) (21, 12) (2, 3) (2, 24) (12, 14) (12, 21) (12, 25) (19, 22) (19, 3) (19, 15) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 15) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (15, 28) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 24) (7, 29) (20, 26) (20, 6) (6, 20) (6, 0) (24, 17) (24, 2) (24, 15) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) (23, 17) (23, 25) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 16) (8, 25) (16, 8) (25, 11) (25, 4) (25, 12) (25, 23) (25, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 3-stars: <1, (8, 11, 25)>
- Node 4: 3-stars: <4, (0, 25, 27)>, <4, (14, 25, 27)>
- Node 8: 3-stars: <8, (1, 25, 16)>, <8, (23, 25, 8)>
- Node 10: 3-stars: <10, (11, 18, 21)>
- Node 11: 3-stars: <11, (1, 8, 25)>, <11, (10, 25, 28)>
- Node 12: 3-stars: <12, (25, 14, 21)>
- Node 14: 3-stars: <14, (4, 25, 27)>, <14, (17, 25, 21)>
- Node 15: 3-stars: <15, (28, 18, 24)>
- Node 17: 3-stars: <17, (14, 21, 24)>, <17, (11, 23, 27)>
- Node 18: 3-stars: <18, (10, 15, 28)>, <18, (9, 15, 10)>
- Node 19: 3-stars: <19, (15, 3, 22)>, <19, (3, 15, 22)>
- Node 21: 3-stars: <21, (12, 14, 25)>, <21, (10, 12, 14)>
- Node 24: 3-stars: <24, (17, 15, 2)>, <24, (15, 17, 2)>
- Node 25: 3-stars: <25, (8, 12, 23)>, <25, (4, 12, 23)>
- Node 26: 1 3-star
- Node 27: 3-stars: <27, (4, 28, 14)>, <27, (11, 17, 23)>
- Node 28: 3-stars: <28, (27, 10, 15)>, <28, (15, 27, 10)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
1 (node 0) + 1 (node 1) + 2 (node 4) + 2 (node 8) + 1 (node 10) + 2 (node 11) + 1 (node 12) + 2 (node 14) + 1 (node 15) + 2 (node 17) + 2 (node 18) + 2 (node 19) + 2 (node 21) + 2 (node 24) + 2 (node 25) + 1 (node 26) + 2 (node 27) + 2 (node 28) = 29

So, the total number of 3-stars is [29].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<1, (8, 11, 25)>,  
<4, (0, 25, 27)>,  
<4, (14, 25, 27)>,  
<8, (1, 25, 16)>,  
<8, (23, 25, 8)>,  
<10, (11, 18, 21)>,  
<11, (1, 8, 25)>,  
<11, (10, 25, 28)>,  
<12, (25, 14, 21)>,  
<14, (4, 25, 27)>,  
<14, (17, 25, 21)>,  
<15, (28, 18, 24)>,  
<17, (14, 21, 24)>,  
<17, (11, 23, 27)>,  
<18, (10, 15, 28)>,  
<18, (9, 15, 10)>,  
<19, (15, 3, 22)>,  
<19, (3, 15, 22)>,  
<21, (12, 14, 25)>,  
<21, (10, 12, 14)>,  
<24, (17, 15, 2)>,  
<24, (15, 17, 2)>,  
<25, (8, 12, 23)>,  
<25, (4, 12, 23)>,  
<27, (4, 28, 14)>,  
<27, (11, 17, 23)>,  
<28, (27, 10, 15)>,  
<28, (15, 27, 10)>
