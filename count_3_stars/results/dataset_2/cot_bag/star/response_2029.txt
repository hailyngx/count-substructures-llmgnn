Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes and edges of the graph are as follows: 
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 4), (6, 0), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 0), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 0), (1, 7), (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 2), (3, 5), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 7), (2, 3), (2, 8), (2, 4), (8, 6), (8, 9), (8, 2), (0, 6), (0, 9), (0, 1), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 2)

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph: 

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 6, 1, 9. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 4, 0. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 9, 1, 7, 2, 5. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 6, 9, 1, 5, 2. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 6, 1, 3, 4, 7. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 5, 8, 4, 0. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 6, 9, 2. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 8, 4, 3, 0. So, it can form 1 3-star.

So, there are 8 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (6, 1, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 4)>, <3, (9, 1, 7)>, <4, (6, 5, 2)>, <5, (6, 1, 7)>, <6, (5, 8, 0)>, <8, (6, 9, 2)>, <9, (8, 4, 0)>
