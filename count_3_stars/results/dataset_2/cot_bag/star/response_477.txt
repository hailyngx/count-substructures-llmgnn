Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 6) (14, 17) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 2) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 14) (13, 10) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 19) (5, 7) (5, 18) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 10) (19, 1) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 0) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 19) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 6) (16, 4) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 4) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 5) (18, 9) (6, 15) (6, 0) (1, 8) (1, 19) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 17) (4, 16) (4, 11) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, the graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
- Node 0: {9, 11, 1, 6}
- Node 1: {8, 19, 0, 2}
- Node 2: {3, 14, 17}
- Node 3: {15, 2, 18}
- Node 4: {16, 11}
- Node 5: {7, 18}
- Node 6: {15, 0}
- Node 7: {15, 12, 5}
- Node 8: {11, 1}
- Node 9: {18, 11, 0}
- Node 10: {15, 13, 19}
- Node 11: {8, 9, 0, 4}
- Node 12: {7, 18, 19}
- Node 13: {14, 10}
- Node 14: {17, 2, 13}
- Node 15: {3, 10, 7, 6, 18}
- Node 16: {4}
- Node 17: {14, 19, 2}
- Node 18: {3, 15, 12, 5, 9}
- Node 19: {17, 12, 10, 1}

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph: 

For each node with 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars it contributes to:

- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
   - 3-stars: <3, (15, 2, 18)>, <3, (15, 6, 0)>... (total 10 3-stars)

- Node 15: inom{5}{3} = 10
   - 3-stars: <15, (3, 10, 7)>, <15, (3, 18, 6)>... (total 10 3-stars)

- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
   - 3-stars: <7, (15, 12, 5)>

- Node 18: inom{5}{3} = 10
   - 3-stars: <18, (3, 15, 12)>, <18, (3, 15, 5)>... (total 10 3-stars)

- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
   - 3-stars: <11, (8, 9, 0)>, <11, (8, 0, 4)>... (total 4 3-stars)

Adding up the total, we have 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 35 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [35].
