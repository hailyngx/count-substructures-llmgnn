Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:

- Node 0: [C(4, 3) = 4]
- Node 1: [C(6, 3) = 20]
- Node 3: [C(5, 3) = 10]
- Node 6: [C(5, 3) = 10]
- Node 8: [C(5, 3) = 10]
- Node 9: [C(5, 3) = 10]

Summing up the 3-stars formed with each node: 
Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 64]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 64.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
