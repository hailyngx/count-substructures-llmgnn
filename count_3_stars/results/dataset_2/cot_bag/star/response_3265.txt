Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: [1, 8, 26, 7, 2]
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: [10, 6, 11, 28]
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: [9, 7, 12]
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: [1, 2, 11, 29]
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: [1, 21, 22]
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors: [6, 1, 22]
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors: [0, 4, 18, 19, 1]
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: [11, 18, 20]
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: [9, 11, 28, 29]
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors: [12, 13, 28]
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: [5, 8, 14, 26]
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors: [0, 10, 29, 27]
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: [15, 23, 25, 28]
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: [14, 17, 27, 23]

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
1 (for 15) + 1 (for 16) + 1 (for 18) + 1 (for 20) + 5 (for 21) + 1 (for 22) + 4 (for 23) + 1 (for 25) + 4 (for 26) + 4 (for 27) + 4 (for 28) + 4 (for 29) = 31

So, the total number of 3-stars is [31].
