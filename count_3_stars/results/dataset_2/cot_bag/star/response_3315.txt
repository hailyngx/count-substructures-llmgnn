Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 14) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 10) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Now, for each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

For node 0: 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 4: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 5: 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 7: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 10: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 11: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 12: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 13: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 14: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 55

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55]. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (2, 7, 14)>
<1, (3, 14, 9)>
<2, (6, 4, 0)>
<4, (8, 12, 11)>
<5, (8, 13, 11)>
<6, (9, 1, 2)>
<7, (11, 14, 0)>
<8, (4, 14, 5)>
<9, (6, 1, 11)>
<10, (3, 13, 12)>
<11, (4, 12, 13)>
<12, (4, 11, 13)>
<13, (5, 12, 10)>
<14, (1, 8, 7)>
