Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 13) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) 

Response:
There are three nodes with 4 neighbors: nodes 5, 9, and 10. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<5, (9, 3, 10)>
<5, (9, 10, 14)>
<5, (3, 10, 14)>
<5, (9, 3, 14)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<9, (5, 4, 10)>
<9, (5, 10, 12)>
<9, (5, 1, 10)>
<9, (5, 12, 14)>
<9, (4, 10, 12)>
<9, (4, 10, 1)>
<9, (4, 10, 12)>
<9, (4, 1, 12)>
<9, (10, 1, 12)>
<9, (10, 12, 14)>

- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<10, (5, 9, 6)>
<10, (5, 6, 11)>
<10, (9, 6, 11)>
<10, (5, 6, 14)>

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 10 + 4 = 18 valid 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [18].
