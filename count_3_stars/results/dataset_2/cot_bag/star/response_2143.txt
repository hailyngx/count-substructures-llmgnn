Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 25) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 24) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 19) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 3) (23, 22) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 20) (4, 17) (4, 26) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 29) (26, 4) (26, 28) (26, 11) (26, 0) (28, 26) (28, 8) (28, 13) (17, 4) (17, 2) (20, 4) (20, 1) (20, 14) (20, 24) (3, 22) (3, 21) (21, 3) (21, 24) (7, 9) (25, 15) (25, 19) (25, 11) (6, 10) (6, 11) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 28) (11, 26) (11, 25) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 24) (14, 5) (14, 20) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (24, 5) (24, 20) (24, 21) (24, 11) (24, 13) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 19) (0, 26) (1, 20) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 12) (29, 18) (29, 16) (29, 13) (29, 12) (13, 28) (13, 24) (13, 29) (19, 9) (19, 25) (19, 2) (19, 1) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 16) (16, 18) (16, 29) (16, 10) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 29) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 4, 18, 26, 20, 14, 24, 2, 19, 1, 29, 13, 10, and 16.

For each of these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<5, (2, 8, 14)>
<5, (2, 8, 24)>
<5, (2, 14, 24)>
<5, (8, 14, 24)>

For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<4, (17, 18, 20)>
<4, (17, 18, 26)>
<4, (17, 20, 26)>
<4, (18, 20, 26)>
<4, (17, 18, 29)>
<4, (17, 20, 29)>
<4, (17, 26, 29)>
<4, (18, 20, 29)>
<4, (18, 26, 29)>
<4, (20, 26, 29)>

For the remaining nodes with three or more neighbors, as they have 3 neighbors each:
Node 18: 1 3-star: <18, (16, 29, 4)>
Node 26: 1 3-star: <26, (0, 11, 4)>
Node 20: 1 3-star: <20, (1, 24, 4)>
Node 14: 1 3-star: <14, (10, 11, 5)>
Node 24: 1 3-star: <24, (13, 14, 5)>
Node 2: 1 3-star: <2, (19, 5, 17)>
Node 19: 1 3-star: <19, (1, 2, 25)>
Node 1: 1 3-star: <1, (12, 29, 20)>
Node 29: 1 3-star: <29, (12, 16, 18)>
Node 13: 1 3-star: <13, (28, 14, 24)>
Node 10: 1 3-star: <10, (12, 14, 16)>
Node 16: 1 3-star: <16, (10, 18, 29)>

Adding up all 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 24.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [24].
