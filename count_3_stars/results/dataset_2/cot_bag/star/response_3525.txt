Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 1) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 13) (3, 10) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 3) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 0) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine which nodes have three or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars. 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, Node 1 has 5 neighbors, Node 2 has 4 neighbors, Node 3 has 4 neighbors, Node 4 has 5 neighbors, Node 5 has 4 neighbors, Node 6 has 5 neighbors, Node 7 has 4 neighbors, Node 8 has 5 neighbors, Node 9 has 4 neighbors, Node 10 has 4 neighbors, Node 11 has 4 neighbors, Node 12 has 3 neighbors, Node 13 has 2 neighbors, and Node 14 has 5 neighbors. 

Next, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars per node, so a total of  \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \) 3-stars.
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4  \) 3-stars per node, so a total of \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has exactly 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is \( [60 + 24 + 1] = 85 \)
