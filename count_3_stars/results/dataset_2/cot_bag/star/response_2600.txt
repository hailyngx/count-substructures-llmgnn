Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 28) (6, 3) (6, 27) (6, 20) (9, 29) (9, 19) (22, 23) (22, 28) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 0) (0, 23) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 10) (20, 6) (20, 0) (20, 13) (28, 6) (28, 22) (28, 12) (28, 7) (28, 10) (14, 0) (14, 7) (26, 24) (26, 18) (26, 5) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 4) (24, 26) (24, 27) (24, 25) (24, 21) (18, 23) (18, 26) (18, 1) (29, 9) (29, 16) (29, 12) (5, 26) (5, 1) (5, 25) (5, 11) (5, 7) (10, 0) (10, 28) (10, 2) (10, 7) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 17) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 25) (3, 6) (3, 27) (3, 4) (7, 28) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 10) (13, 20) (13, 21) (13, 1) (21, 24) (21, 13) (4, 2) (4, 3) (25, 24) (25, 5) (25, 19) (1, 18) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (16, 29) (27, 6) (27, 24) (27, 3) (27, 8) (12, 28) (12, 29) (17, 15) (11, 5) (8, 1) (8, 27) 

Response:
There are several nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify them and calculate the number of 3-stars each one forms.

Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors.
Node 19 has 3 neighbors.
Node 20 has 4 neighbors.
Node 22 has 2 neighbors.
Node 23 has 3 neighbors.
Node 24 has 4 neighbors.
Node 25 has 3 neighbors.
Node 26 has 3 neighbors.
Node 27 has 4 neighbors.
Node 28 has 5 neighbors.
Node 29 has 3 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed:
\[
\binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3}
\]
\[
= 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10
\]
\[
= 60
\]

So, there are a total of 60 3-stars in this graph.
