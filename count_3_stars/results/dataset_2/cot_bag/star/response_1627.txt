Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 11) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 17) (9, 6) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 18) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 15) (11, 17) (7, 15) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 18) (0, 3) (0, 7) (19, 7) (19, 18) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 17) (18, 1) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 14) (17, 6) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 4) (14, 16) (4, 14) (16, 10) (16, 13) (16, 14) (2, 3) (2, 17) 

Response:
In this graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these nodes can be centers of 3-stars.  
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 15, 6, 9, 1, 10, 11, 7, 12, 5, 13, 0, 19, 8, 18, 17 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 41
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 41, denoted as [41].

The unique 3-stars identified in this graph are:
<3, (15, 0, 2)>, <15, (3, 10, 7)>, <15, (3, 11, 17)>, <15, (3, 7, 19)>, <6, (9, 1, 17)>, <1, (6, 5, 18)>, <10, (15, 5, 16)>, <7, (15, 9, 12)>, <7, (15, 0, 19)>, <7, (9, 12, 17)>, <7, (9, 0, 19)>, <7, (12, 17, 8)>, <12, (7, 17, 8)>, <5, (1, 10, 13)>, <13, (5, 16, 18)>, <0, (3, 7, 19)>, <18, (1, 13, 19)>, <18, (1, 5, 14)>, <18, (13, 16, 14)>, <18, (13, 19, 14)>, <17, (6, 11, 8)>, <17, (6, 7, 2)>, <17, (11, 12, 8)>, <17, (2, 11, 8)>, <17, (2, 12, 8)>
