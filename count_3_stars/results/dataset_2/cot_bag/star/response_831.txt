The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 12) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 10) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 13) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 10) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors, as only these nodes can form 3-stars. Then, we will count the number of 3-stars each eligible node can form. Let's start by listing the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 8, 7, 11. (3 neighbors)
- Node 1: Neighbors are 12, 11, 10. (3 neighbors)
- Node 2: Neighbors are 9, 6, 8, 4, 12. (5 neighbors)
- Node 3: Neighbors are 5, 9, 6, 13. (4 neighbors)
- Node 4: Neighbors are 5, 6, 13, 14, 2. (5 neighbors)
- Node 5: Neighbors are 9, 4, 3, 10. (4 neighbors)
- Node 6: Neighbors are 3, 2, 4, 13. (4 neighbors)
- Node 7: Neighbors are 9, 0, 11. (3 neighbors)
- Node 8: Neighbors are 2, 0. (2 neighbors)
- Node 9: Neighbors are 5, 2, 11, 3, 7. (5 neighbors)
- Node 10: Neighbors are 5, 14, 12, 1. (4 neighbors)
- Node 11: Neighbors are 9, 13, 0, 14, 7, 1. (6 neighbors)
- Node 12: Neighbors are 13, 2, 10, 1. (4 neighbors)
- Node 13: Neighbors are 6, 4, 11, 3, 12. (5 neighbors)
- Node 14: Neighbors are 4, 11, 10. (3 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Nodes 2, 4, 9, 12, and 13 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Nodes 3, 5, 6, 10, and 11 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Nodes 0, 1, and 7 have 3 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 \times 5 + 4 \times 5 + 1 \times 3 = 50 + 20 + 3 = 73 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 73. 

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<2, (4, 9, 13)>, <4, (2, 9, 13)>, <9, (2, 4, 13)>, <12, (2, 10, 1)>, <13, (2, 4, 11)>
