Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 18) (0, 21) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 25) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 9) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 3) (18, 21) (18, 11) (18, 16) (26, 0) (26, 20) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 3) (28, 26) (28, 4) (4, 28) (4, 9) (4, 10) (27, 17) (27, 6) (25, 0) (25, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 5) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 11) (9, 20) (9, 4) (9, 11) (29, 1) (29, 26) (29, 3) (8, 25) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 17) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 23) (16, 18) (16, 22) (6, 12) (6, 27) (6, 15) (17, 27) (17, 8) (17, 5) (13, 21) (13, 12) (13, 24) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 22) (24, 8) (24, 13) (22, 0) (22, 16) (22, 5) (11, 18) (11, 15) (11, 9) (3, 2) (3, 26) (3, 29) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 23) (23, 1) (23, 19) (23, 14) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 21, 20, 22, 25, 26
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 21, 29, 23
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 26, 29
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 28, 9, 10
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 10, 15, 17, 22
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 12, 27, 15
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 25, 19, 24, 17
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 7, 13, 6
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 21, 12, 24
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 7, 19, 23
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 6, 5, 11
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 27, 8, 5
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 21, 11, 16
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 8, 14, 23
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors: 0, 26, 9
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: 1, 18, 13
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 16
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors: 1, 19, 14
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors: 0, 20, 28, 29, 3
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 1, 26, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- For Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- For Node 1: 1
- For Node 3: 1
- For Node 4: 1
- For Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For Node 6: 1
- For Node 8: 1
- For Node 12: 1
- For Node 13: 1
- For Node 14: 1
- For Node 15: 1
- For Node 17: 1
- For Node 18: 1
- For Node 19: 1
- For Node 20: 1
- For Node 21: 1
- For Node 22: 1
- For Node 23: 1
- For Node 26: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- For Node 29: 1

Adding up these results, we get a total of 36 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [36].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (20, 21, 22)>
<0, (20, 21, 25)>
<0, (20, 21, 26)>
<0, (20, 25, 26)>
<0, (21, 22, 25)>
<0, (21, 22, 26)>
<0, (21, 25, 26)>
<0, (22, 25, 26)>
<20, (0, 21, 26)>
<21, (0, 13, 18)>
<5, (10, 15, 17)>
<26, (0, 28, 29)>
