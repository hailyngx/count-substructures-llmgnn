Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 9) (2, 6) (18, 4) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 12) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 12) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 9) (16, 19) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 1) (19, 16) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) (8, 7) (8, 17) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 8) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 17) (10, 7) (10, 12) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 10) (17, 8) (17, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors: no 3-star
- Node 18 has 1 neighbor: no 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 46 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 8, 14)>
<3, (0, 12, 14)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (11, 15, 17)>
<6, (0, 2, 13)>
<7, (8, 9, 10)>
<9, (2, 7, 16)>
<11, (5, 6, 15)>
<12, (3, 9, 10)>
<14, (1, 3, 11)>
<15, (5, 12, 16)>
<16, (9, 11, 15)>
