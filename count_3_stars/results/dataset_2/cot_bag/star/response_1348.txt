Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 7) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 12.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 9

So the final answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 10, 12)>
<2, (1, 4, 14)>
<4, (8, 11, 14)>
<5, (1, 8, 11)>
<6, (0, 10, 12)>
<8, (4, 9, 13)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<11, (1, 4, 14)>
<12, (0, 6, 10)>
