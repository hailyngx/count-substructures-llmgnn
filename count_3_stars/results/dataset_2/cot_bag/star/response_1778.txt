Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 0) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 0) 

Response:
From the given information, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: {(5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 14), (9, 11), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 12), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 10), (8, 12), (13, 1), (13, 10), (10, 8), (10, 13), (10, 11), (10, 3), (10, 6), (10, 4), (11, 9), (11, 10), (11, 6), (11, 12), (4, 8), (4, 10), (4, 0), (4, 1), (7, 9), (7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 14), (12, 9), (12, 8), (12, 11), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 14), (0, 2), (0, 3), (14, 5), (14, 7), (14, 0), (2, 0), (6, 5), (6, 10), (6, 11), (6, 7), (6, 1), (1, 5), (1, 13), (1, 4), (1, 0), (1, 6), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 0)}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with their neighbors:
0: {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14}
1: {0, 4, 5, 6, 13}
3: {0, 5, 9, 10}
4: {0, 1, 8, 10}
5: {1, 3, 6, 8, 14}
6: {1, 5, 7, 10, 11}
7: {0, 6, 9, 14}
8: {4, 5, 10, 12}
9: {3, 7, 11, 12}
10: {3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13}
11: {6, 9, 10, 12}
12: {8, 9, 11}
13: {1, 10}
14: {0, 5, 7}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars formed are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars formed are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars formed are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars formed are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars formed are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars formed are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars formed are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars formed are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars formed are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars formed are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars formed are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed

Adding up the total number of 3-stars we get: 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 90

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [90].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 14)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (3, 5, 14)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 10, 13)>, <1, (5, 6, 14)>, <1, (5, 13, 14)>, <3, (5, 9, 10)>, <4, (8, 10, 12)>, <5, (6, 8, 14)>, <5, (6, 10, 14)>, <6, (7, 9, 11)>, <10, (8, 11, 13)>
