Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 14) (26, 10) (26, 12) (3, 18) (15, 1) (15, 17) (15, 21) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 28) (7, 27) (7, 22) (21, 15) (21, 2) (8, 23) (8, 11) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 19) (6, 10) (6, 20) (6, 13) (28, 5) (28, 18) (28, 10) (17, 15) (17, 19) (17, 22) (20, 6) (20, 29) (20, 12) (19, 5) (19, 23) (19, 17) (29, 20) (29, 13) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 4) (14, 26) (14, 22) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 13) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 27) (1, 15) (1, 11) (10, 26) (10, 6) (10, 28) (10, 25) (2, 5) (2, 21) (2, 27) (2, 24) (25, 10) (25, 22) (25, 18) (22, 7) (22, 17) (22, 14) (22, 16) (22, 25) (12, 26) (12, 20) (12, 13) (13, 6) (13, 29) (13, 0) (13, 12) (18, 3) (18, 28) (18, 25) (24, 9) (24, 2) (24, 4) (27, 7) (27, 16) (27, 2) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 24) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 5, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, and 28.  
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <5, (9, 19, 28)>, <5, (2, 19, 28)>, <5, (2, 21, 28)>, <5, (2, 21, 19)>
  
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <10, (26, 6, 28)>, <10, (26, 6, 25)>, <10, (26, 28, 25)>, <10, (6, 28, 25)>

- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <13, (6, 29, 0)>, <13, (6, 29, 12)>, <13, (6, 12, 0)>, <13, (29, 12, 0)>

- Node 14: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \)

- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <15, (1, 17, 21)>
  
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <16, (0, 22, 27)>
  
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <17, (15, 19, 22)>
  
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <18, (3, 25, 28)>
  
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <19, (5, 17, 23)>
  
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <20, (6, 12, 29)>

- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <22, (7, 17, 25)>, <22, (7, 16, 25)>, <22, (7, 25, 27)>, <22, (7, 14, 25)>, <22, (17, 25, 16)>, <22, (17, 25, 22)>, <22, (17, 14, 25)>, <22, (16, 25, 27)>, <22, (16, 14, 25)>, <22, (25, 27, 14)>

- Node 23: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <24, (2, 4, 9)>

- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <26, (9, 12, 14)>, <26, (9, 10, 12)>, <26, (9, 12, 10)>, <26, (14, 10, 12)>

- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <27, (7, 16, 2)>

- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <28, (5, 18, 10)>

The total number of 3-stars is 28.
So, the final answer is [28].
