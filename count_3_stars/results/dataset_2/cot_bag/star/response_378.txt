Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0: 3-stars = [1]
Node 1: 3-stars = [8 choose 3] = 56
Node 2: 3-stars = [3 choose 3] = 1
Node 3: 3-stars = [3 choose 3] = 1
Node 4: 3-stars = [4 choose 3] = 4
Node 5: 3-stars = [3 choose 3] = 1
Node 6: 3-stars = [4 choose 3] = 4
Node 7: 3-stars = [6 choose 3] = 20
Node 8: 3-stars = [3 choose 3] = 1
Node 9: 3-stars = [3 choose 3] = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 56 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 90

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [90].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (7, 8, 0)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
