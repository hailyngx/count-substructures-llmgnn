Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 14) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 6) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

We apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 112 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [112].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 12, 2)>, <1, (0, 12, 14)>, <2, (3, 12, 11)>, <3, (2, 12, 0)>, <6, (0, 10, 14)>, <9, (5, 13, 4)>, <10, (0, 6, 7)>, <11, (1, 2, 4)>, <12, (0, 2, 8)>, <13, <5, 9, 14>>, <14, (1, 6, 13)>.
