Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes in this graph that have 3 or more neighbors: node 0, node 1, node 2, node 3, and node 5.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 14 3-stars: \([14]\)

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 3, 5>
- <1, 2, 3, 6>
- <1, 2, 6, 8>
- <1, 3, 5, 6>
- <2, 3, 8, 9>
