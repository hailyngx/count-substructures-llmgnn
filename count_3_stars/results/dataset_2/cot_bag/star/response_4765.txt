Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6)
