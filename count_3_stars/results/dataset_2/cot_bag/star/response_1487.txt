Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 6) (13, 16) (13, 3) (13, 0) (10, 12) (10, 5) (17, 15) (17, 4) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 15) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 14) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 0) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 2) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 1) (1, 8) (1, 19) (2, 11) (2, 4) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 2) (4, 3) (9, 14) (9, 7) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 15) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 14) (18, 12) (18, 15) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 15) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 5) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 8, 16, 12, 6, 19, 1, 11, 4, 15, 0, 13, 5, 10, 17, 7, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 8, there are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 16, there are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 12, there are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 6, there are 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- For node 19, there are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For nodes 1, 11, 4, 15, 0, 13, 5, 10, 17, 7, and 14, there are also 4 neighbors each, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Add up all the 3-stars:
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 60 \)

So, there are a total of 60 3-stars in this graph. 

Thus, the answer is [60].

And a unique 3-star is: 
<8, (7, 1, 6)>
