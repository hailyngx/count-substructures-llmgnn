Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 18) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 11) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 14) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 18) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 19) (5, 17) (5, 8) (5, 11) (6, 15) (6, 16) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 16) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 0) (13, 16) (13, 11) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 2) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 13) (15, 6) (15, 9) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 16) (16, 6) (16, 18) (16, 13) (16, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed as follows:  
Node 0: 3, 14, 18  
Node 1: 2, 10, 12  
Node 2: 1, 3, 19  
Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 14  
Node 4: 3, 10, 19  
Node 5: 8, 11, 17  
Node 6: 9, 15, 16  
Node 7: 11, 18  
Node 8: 5, 14, 17, 19  
Node 9: 12, 15, 16  
Node 10: 1, 4, 17  
Node 11: 5, 7, 13, 17  
Node 12: 1, 9  
Node 13: 11, 16  
Node 14: 0, 3, 8  
Node 15: 6, 9  
Node 16: 6, 9, 13, 18  
Node 17: 5, 8, 10, 11  
Node 18: 0, 7, 16  
Node 19: 2, 4, 8  

Node 4 and Node 8 each have 3 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.  
Node 3, Node 10, Node 11, Node 16 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18 \).  
So, the total number of 3-stars is [18].  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<4, (3, 10, 19)>  
<8, (5, 17, 19)>  
<3, (0, 2, 14)>  
<10, (1, 4, 17)>  
<11, (5, 13, 17)>  
<16, (6, 9, 13)>
