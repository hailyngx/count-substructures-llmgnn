Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 9) (17, 10) (17, 3) (1, 5) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 17) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 13) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (7, 14) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 15) (13, 11) (13, 16) (19, 4) (19, 12) (16, 5) (16, 13) (16, 4) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 12) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 4) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 9) (18, 1) (18, 15) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 19) (12, 15) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 7, 14
- Node 1: 5, 8, 18
- Node 2: 4, 9, 10
- Node 3: 9, 11, 12, 17
- Node 4: 2, 9, 16, 19
- Node 5: 1, 6, 8, 16
- Node 6: 5, 7, 12
- Node 7: 0, 6, 14, 15
- Node 8: 1, 5
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 14, 15
- Node 10: 2, 17
- Node 11: 3, 13
- Node 12: 3, 6, 15, 19
- Node 13: 11, 16
- Node 14: 0, 7, 9
- Node 15: 7, 9, 12, 18
- Node 16: 4, 5, 13
- Node 17: 3, 10
- Node 18: 1, 15
- Node 19: 4, 12

Now let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 15: inom{3}{3} = 1

Summing up these counts, we get a total of 29 3-stars. So, the final answer is [29].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (9, 15, 4)>, <4, (2, 9, 16)>, <5, (1, 16, 8)>, <9, (14, 15, 4)>, <12, (3, 19, 15)>, <14, (0, 9, 7)>, <15, (7, 9, 12)>
