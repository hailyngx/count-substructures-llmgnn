Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 19) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 13) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 15) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 15) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 16) (12, 18) (12, 8) (16, 18) (16, 15) (16, 2) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 0) (7, 11) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 7) (2, 14) (2, 16) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 5, 6, 4, 18, 0, 14, 1, 17, 19, 13, 15, 12, and 16.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <5, (6, 1, 11)>, <5, (6, 19, 1)>, <5, (6, 19, 11)>, <5, (1, 19, 11)>

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <6, (5, 14, 0)>

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <4, (9, 13, 18)>, <4, (9, 13, 3)>, <4, (9, 13, 17)>, <4, (9, 18, 3)>, <4, (9, 18, 17)>, <4, (9, 3, 17)>, <4, (13, 18, 3)>, <4, (13, 18, 17)>, <4, (13, 3, 17)>, <4, (18, 3, 17)>

- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <18, (4, 16, 12)>, <18, (4, 16, 3)>, <18, (4, 12, 3)>, <18, (16, 12, 3)>

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <0, (6, 3, 19)>

- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <14, (6, 1, 2)>

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <1, (5, 17, 14)>

- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <17, (4, 1, 13)>

- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <19, (5, 0, 15)>

- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <13, (9, 17, 15)>, <13, (9, 17, 4)>, <13, (9, 15, 4)>, <13, (17, 15, 4)>

- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <15, (9, 19, 13)>, <15, (9, 19, 16)>, <15, (9, 13, 16)>, <15, (19, 13, 16)>, <15, (19, 13, 10)>, <15, (19, 16, 2)>, <15, (13, 16, 2)>, <15, (13, 16, 10)>, <15, (16, 2, 10)>, <15, (2, 10, 16)>

- Node 12 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <16, (18, 15, 2)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of 38 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [38].
