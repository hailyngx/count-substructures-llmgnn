Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
1: (3, 8)
2: (0, 5, 6, 9)
3: (1, 7, 8, 9)
4: (5, 6, 7, 8)
5: (0, 2, 4, 7, 9)
6: (0, 2, 4, 7)
7: (3, 4, 6, 9)
8: (0, 1, 3, 4)
9: (2, 3, 5, 7)
0: (2, 5, 6, 8)

Thus, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives us a total of 34 3-stars in this graph.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 5)>, <2, (0, 9, 5)>, <2, (6, 9, 5)>,
<3, (1, 8, 4)>, <3, (1, 8, 0)>, <3, (1, 8, 8)>, <3, (8, 4, 8)>,
<4, (5, 7, 6)>, <4, (5, 7, 6)>, <4, (5, 8, 7)>, <4, (7, 6, 8)>,
<5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, 
<5, (4, 7, 9)>,
<6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>,
<7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>,
<8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 8)>,
<9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (7, 5, 9)>.
