Response:
From the given information, we have 30 nodes and 90 edges in the graph. Let's analyze the nodes to determine which nodes have at least three neighbors and thus can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 22 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 25 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 27 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars per node, so a total of 4 * 5 = 20 3-stars.
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars per node, so a total of 10 * 2 = 20 3-stars.
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 3-star per node, so a total of 5 3-stars.

Combining all the 3-stars, we have a total of 20 + 20 + 5 = 45 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].
