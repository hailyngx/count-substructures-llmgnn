Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 12) (16, 10) (16, 15) (4, 7) (4, 15) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 9) (3, 19) (14, 8) (14, 13) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 5) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (18, 13) (18, 8) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 8) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 2) (19, 6) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 6) (15, 16) (15, 4) (15, 19) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 18) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 12) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 9) (13, 14) (13, 18) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 58.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 58, which we represent as [58].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, 7, 4>, <1, 7, 5>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 17>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 17>, <2, 5, 19>, <2, 5, 8>, <5, 17, 10>, <5, 17, 6>, <5, 17, 8>, <17, 10, 8>, <17, 10, 6>, <17, 10, 12>, <19, 5, 17>, <19, 5, 15>, <19, 5, 8>, <6, 17, 10>, <6, 17, 8>
