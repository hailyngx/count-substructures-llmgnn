Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 20) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 16) (2, 23) (2, 27) (29, 17) (29, 7) (20, 3) (20, 25) (20, 23) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 12) (25, 0) (25, 28) (25, 24) (28, 20) (28, 25) (28, 4) (17, 29) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 26) (7, 29) (12, 25) (12, 14) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 8) (26, 17) (26, 18) (26, 11) (26, 0) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 18) (8, 5) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 11) (5, 18) (5, 8) (5, 11) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (11, 26) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 1) (14, 12) (14, 24) (27, 2) (27, 23) (22, 16) (0, 25) (0, 17) (0, 26) (0, 4) (9, 10) (9, 16) (10, 18) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 13) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 23) (16, 15) (16, 22) (16, 9) (16, 4) (23, 2) (23, 20) (23, 27) (23, 13) (4, 28) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 16) (24, 25) (24, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes could potentially be centers of 3-stars. Then, we'll count the actual 3-stars formed by each of these nodes.

Let's start by listing the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 25, 17, 26, 4
- Node 1: 6, 11, 13
- Node 2: 23, 27
- Node 3: 15, 20, 8
- Node 4: 28, 0, 10, 16
- Node 5: 18, 8, 11
- Node 6: 1, 10
- Node 7: 29
- Node 8: 3, 15, 18, 5
- Node 9: 10, 16
- Node 10: 18, 6, 9, 4, 13
- Node 11: 26, 19, 5, 1
- Node 12: 25, 14
- Node 13: 1, 10, 23
- Node 14: 12, 24
- Node 15: 3, 19, 8, 16
- Node 16: 15, 22, 9, 4
- Node 17: 29, 0, 19, 26
- Node 18: 26, 5, 10, 8
- Node 19: 15, 17, 11, 1
- Node 20: 3, 25, 23, 28
- Node 23: 2, 27, 20, 13
- Node 25: 20, 12, 0, 28, 24
- Node 26: 17, 18, 11, 0
- Node 28: 20, 25, 4
- Node 29: 17, 7

Nodes 0, 10, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 each have three or more neighbors, so we need to count the 3-stars around these nodes:

- [\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \]] = [70]

Therefore, there are a total of 70 3-stars in this graph. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (25, 17, 4)>
<0, (26, 17, 4)>
<0, (25, 26, 4)>
<0, (25, 17, 26)>
<10, (18, 6, 4)>
<10, (18, 4, 16)>
<10, (18, 4, 13)>
<10, (18, 16, 13)>
<10, (6, 4, 13)>
<15, (3, 19, 16)>
<15, (8, 19, 16)>
<15, (3, 8, 16)>
<15, (3, 16, 22)>
<15, (8, 16, 22)>
<16, (15, 22, 9)>
<16, (15, 9, 4)>
<16, (15, 4, 10)>
<16, (22, 9, 4)>
<16, (9, 4, 10)>
<16, (4, 10, 13)>
<18, (26, 11, 5)>
<18, (5, 11, 1)>
<18, (5, 11, 13)>
<19, (17, 11, 1)>
<19, (17, 11, 5)>
<20, (25, 23, 13)>
<20, (25, 28, 4)>
<20, (23, 27, 2)>

This completes the analysis for the 3-stars in the given graph.
