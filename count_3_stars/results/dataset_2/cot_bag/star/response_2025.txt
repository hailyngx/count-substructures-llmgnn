Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (16, 12) (16, 29) (5, 21) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 20) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 18) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 28) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 22) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 1) (2, 6) (2, 18) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 8) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 26) (1, 17) (1, 27) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 29) (26, 0) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 19) (21, 5) (21, 28) (21, 23) (28, 4) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 19) (15, 10) (15, 20) (20, 9) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 27) (0, 26) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 29) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 24) (17, 22) (25, 9) (22, 7) (22, 17) (23, 26) (23, 21) (8, 18) (8, 28) (8, 0) (8, 3) (19, 12) (19, 28) (19, 14) (19, 24) (29, 16) (29, 26) (29, 14) (13, 4) (13, 20) (13, 27) (24, 17) (24, 19) (27, 1) (27, 20) (27, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 6, 8, 12, 19, 20, 21, 26, 28, 29.

Now let's go through each of these nodes to find the 3-stars:

- Node 1: <1, (6, 10, 27)> 
- Node 4: <4, (7, 12, 17)>
- Node 6: <6, (1, 2, 18)>
- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed.
- Node 12: <12, (4, 7, 19)>
- Node 19: <19, (12, 14, 28)>
- Node 20: <20, (9, 15, 27)>
- Node 21: No 3-star can be formed.
- Node 26: <26, (1, 29, 26)>
- Node 28: No 3-star can be formed.
- Node 29: No 3-star can be formed.

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
