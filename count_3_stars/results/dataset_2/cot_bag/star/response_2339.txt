Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 10) (17, 6) (10, 17) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 15) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 4) (18, 10) (18, 12) (5, 7) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 9) (13, 14) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 7) (15, 14) (15, 11) (15, 16) (16, 2) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 19) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 7) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 3) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 8) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 12) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 12) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (0, 11), (0, 6), (0, 8). So it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors which is less than 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (3, 16), (3, 19), (3, 12). So it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (4, 10), (4, 2), (4, 9). So it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (6, 17), (6, 0), (6, 13). So it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: (8, 19), (8, 0), (8, 12). So it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: (10, 17), (10, 11), (10, 18), (10, 4), (10, 9). So it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: (11, 10), (11, 0), (11, 13), (11, 2), (11, 15). So it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (12, 18), (12, 8), (12, 3), (12, 9). So it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: (13, 14), (13, 11), (13, 6), (13, 7). So it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: (15, 14), (15, 11), (15, 16). So it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: (16, 2), (16, 15), (16, 3), (16, 19). So it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: (19, 16), (19, 8), (19, 3). So it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 12, which can be represented as [].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (11, 6, 8)>, <3, (16, 19, 12)>, <4, (10, 2, 9)>, <6, (17, 0, 13)>, <8, (19, 0, 12)>, <10, (17, 11, 18)>, <11, (10, 0, 13)>, <12, (18, 8, 3)>, <13, (14, 11, 6)>, <15, (14, 11, 16)>, <16, (2, 15, 3)>, <19, (16, 8, 3)>.
