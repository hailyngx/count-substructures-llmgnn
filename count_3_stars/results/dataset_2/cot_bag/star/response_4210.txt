Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 14) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (10, 8) (10, 2) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 15) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 18) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 15) (1, 14) (15, 17) (15, 1) (5, 7) (5, 18) (5, 14) (19, 16) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 19) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 0) (3, 19) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 5) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 13) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 18) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are:

[11, (9, 6, 17)], [16, (4, 14, 19)], [6, (9, 12, 18)], [9, (11, 2, 1)], [4, (16, 8, 13)], [10, (8, 2, 0)], [17, (11, 12, 15)], [8, (10, 4, 7)], [0, (7, 13, 2)], [7, (8, 5, 0)], [1, (9, 15, 14)], [15, (17, 1, 5)], [5, (7, 18, 14)], [19, (16, 3, 12)], [12, (6, 17, 19)], [2, (9, 10, 0)], [3, (19, 12, 0)], [14, (16, 1, 5)], [18, (6, 8, 5)], [13, (4, 0, 18)]

This results in a total of [20] 3-stars in the graph.
