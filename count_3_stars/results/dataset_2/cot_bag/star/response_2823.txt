Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges described by the given edge list, let's first identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 50 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-star structures are:
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- <9, (3, 7, 8)>
- <9, (4, 5, 7)>
