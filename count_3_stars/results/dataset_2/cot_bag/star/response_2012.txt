Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 28) (6, 5) (6, 19) (15, 20) (15, 1) (15, 12) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 11) (4, 25) (4, 17) (18, 10) (18, 3) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 16) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 25) (0, 2) (0, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 28) (1, 7) (1, 13) (27, 9) (27, 10) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 21) (25, 4) (25, 28) (25, 11) (21, 16) (21, 19) (21, 12) (21, 14) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 29) (24, 3) (24, 12) (24, 19) (3, 18) (3, 24) (23, 14) (23, 29) (11, 20) (11, 25) (22, 5) (22, 17) (22, 12) (12, 15) (12, 21) (12, 24) (12, 22) (12, 14) (17, 4) (17, 2) (17, 22) (13, 20) (13, 1) (13, 29) (13, 14) (29, 10) (29, 23) (29, 13) (29, 14) (14, 21) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 29) (19, 6) (19, 21) (19, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 (neighbors: 15, 5, 28, 7, 13)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 6, 1, 22, 0, 16)
- Node 12 (neighbors: 15, 21, 24, 22, 14)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 21, 23, 12, 13, 29)
- Node 15 (neighbors: 20, 1, 12)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 5, 28, 21)
- Node 20 (neighbors: 15, 13, 11)

Now, let's determine the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 43 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [43].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (15, 5, 28)>
- <1, (15, 5, 7)>
- <1, (15, 5, 13)>
- <1, (15, 28, 7)>
- <1, (15, 28, 13)>
- <1, (5, 28, 7)>
- <1, (5, 28, 13)>
- <5, (6, 22, 0)>
- <5, (1, 22, 0)>
- <5, (1, 22, 16)>
- <5, (28, 22, 16)>
- <12, (15, 21, 24)>
- <12, (15, 22, 14)>
- <12, (15, 24, 14)>
- <12, (21, 24, 22)>
- <12, (21, 22, 14)>
- <14, (21, 23, 29)>
- <14, (21, 12, 13)>
- <14, (21, 24, 29)>
- <14, (23, 12, 13)>
- <14, (23, 12, 29)>
- <15, (20, 12, 21)>
- <16, (5, 28, 21)>
- <20, (15, 13, 11)>
