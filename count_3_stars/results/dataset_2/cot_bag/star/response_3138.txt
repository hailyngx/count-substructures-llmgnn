Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 13) (7, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 5) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 3) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 2) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) 

Response:
For this graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: {6, 14, 5, 1, 12}
Node 1 has 6 neighbors: {6, 4, 0, 2, 13, 12}
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {6, 11, 8, 13}
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {9, 14, 1}
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {11, 0, 14, 2}
Node 6 has 7 neighbors: {9, 1, 14, 3, 12, 0, 13}
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {6, 4, 10, 13}
Node 10 has 3 neighbors: {9, 11, 12}
Node 11 has 5 neighbors: {10, 3, 13, 5, 6}
Node 12 has 4 neighbors: {6, 10, 0, 1}
Node 13 has 5 neighbors: {9, 7, 11, 3, 1}
Node 14 has 5 neighbors: {6, 4, 0, 2, 5}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: There is 1 3-star with node 4 as the center.
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Sum of all 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 35 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 108

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [108] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (6, 1, 12)>
<1, (6, 4, 13)>
<3, (6, 13, 11)>
<6, (9, 1, 14)>
<6, (0, 14, 3)>
<11, (10, 13, 5)>
