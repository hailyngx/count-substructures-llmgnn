Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's find the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 5 has neighbors {9, 6, 2, 4, 0, 3}
- Node 6 has neighbors {9, 5, 1, 7, 3, 4}
- Node 4 has neighbors {5, 6, 0}
- Node 1 has neighbors {6, 8, 2, 7}
- Node 2 has neighbors {5, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 3 has neighbors {5, 6, 2, 7}
- Node 7 has neighbors {6, 8, 2, 1, 3}
- Node 0 has neighbors {5, 9, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 5 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 6 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 4 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 2 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 7 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 0 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Adding these up: 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 54

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<5, (9, 6, 4)>
<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<5, (6, 2, 4)>
<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 0)>
<1, (6, 8, 2)>
<2, (5, 1, 3)>
<3, (5, 6, 2)>
<7, (6, 8, 2)>
<0, (5, 9, 4)>
