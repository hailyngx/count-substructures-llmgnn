Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 12 3-stars in this graph. 
These 3-stars are:
<5, (1, 3, 0)>
<5, (1, 4, 3)>
<5, (1, 9, 0)>
<5, (1, 9, 4)>
<5, (3, 4, 1)>
<5, (3, 7, 4)>
<5, (3, 1, 0)>
<9, (6, 4, 7)>
<9, (6, 2, 8)>
<9, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 1, 0)>
<9, (4, 1, 7)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [12].
