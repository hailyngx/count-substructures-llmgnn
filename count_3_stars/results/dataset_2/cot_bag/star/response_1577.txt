Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 14) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 18) (15, 11) (15, 0) (15, 6) (4, 18) (4, 5) (18, 11) (18, 3) (18, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 9) (19, 7) (19, 17) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 0) (17, 19) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 5) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 7) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 7) (0, 15) (0, 6) (0, 17) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors.

Let's list the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
1 3-star from node 11
10 3-stars from node 7

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 10 = 11].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <11, (16, 18, 5)>
- <7, (3, 9, 14)>
- <7, (2, 9, 14)>
- <7, (2, 19, 17)>
- <7, (2, 14, 3)>
- <7, (2, 14, 8)>
- <7, (3, 14, 16)>
- <7, (9, 2, 16)>
- <7, (9, 2, 14)>
- <7, (9, 2, 3)>
- <7, (14, 2, 8)>
