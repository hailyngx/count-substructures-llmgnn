Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 14) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 2) (14, 3) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 14) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 5) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 19) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 5) (18, 14) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 0) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 10) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (2, 15) (2, 9) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 19. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 16: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 17: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 0 + 1 = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 13, 19)>
<3, (14, 15, 17)>
<4, (1, 5, 10)>
<6, (8, 9, 19)>
<8, (1, 6, 13)>
<9, (2, 6, 19)>
<10, (4, 6, 12)>
<12, (14, 16, 10)>
<14, (7, 12, 18)>
<15, (2, 3, 16)>
<16, (1, 10, 11)>
<19, (0, 6, 9)>
