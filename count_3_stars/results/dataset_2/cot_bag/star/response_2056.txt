Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 6) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 3) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 4) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 3) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, and 14.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 = 48 \]

Thus, there are a total of 48 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
\[ \begin{align*} &[0, 2, 7], [0, 2, 10], [0, 2, 12], [0, 2, 3], [0, 2, 6], [0, 3, 7], [0, 3, 10], [0, 3, 12], [0, 3, 6], [0, 7, 10], \\& [0, 7, 12], [0, 7, 6], [0, 10, 12], [0, 10, 6], [0, 12, 6], [2, 3, 6], [2, 7, 12], [2, 7, 10], [2, 7, 0], [2, 10, 12], \\& [2, 10, 0], [2, 12, 0], [3, 7, 10], [3, 7, 12], [3, 7, 0], [3, 10, 12], [3, 10, 0], [3, 12, 0], [7, 10, 12], [7, 10, 0], \\& [7, 12, 0], [10, 12, 0], [1, 4, 14], [1, 11, 3], [1, 11, 7], [1, 11, 0], [1, 11, 12], [4, 14, 5], [4, 14, 9], [14, 5, 6], \\& [14, 5, 9], [14, 9, 13], [7, 1, 11], [12, 1, 11], [5, 0, 6], [5, 0, 14], [9, 8, 13] \end{align*} \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 48, and the unique 3-stars found are as listed above.
