Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 27) (9, 21) (9, 24) (18, 20) (18, 29) (18, 13) (22, 2) (22, 12) (22, 3) (14, 17) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 8) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 25) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 1) (0, 15) (0, 5) (11, 1) (11, 21) (28, 8) (28, 5) (28, 23) (21, 9) (21, 11) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 23) (25, 4) (25, 15) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 16) (15, 0) (15, 25) (15, 10) (13, 18) (13, 29) (13, 19) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 3) (2, 22) (2, 23) (2, 27) (2, 24) (24, 9) (24, 2) (24, 27) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 11) (20, 18) (20, 26) (20, 19) (20, 5) (26, 8) (26, 20) (26, 29) (23, 28) (23, 7) (23, 2) (23, 3) (29, 18) (29, 13) (29, 26) (27, 6) (27, 2) (27, 24) (27, 19) (19, 14) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 20) (19, 27) (3, 22) (3, 16) (3, 23) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 28) (5, 10) (5, 20) (12, 22) 

Response:
Considering the given information about the nodes and edges, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the formula provided. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 2, with neighbors 22, 12, 3, 23, 27, 24
- Node 4, with neighbors 8, 5, 1, 25
- Node 5, with neighbors 4, 0, 28, 10, 20
- Node 8, with neighbors 17, 4, 28, 26, 1
- Node 13, with neighbors 18, 29, 19
- Node 15, with neighbors 0, 25, 10
- Node 18, with neighbors 20, 29, 13
- Node 19, with neighbors 14, 7, 13, 20, 27
- Node 20, with neighbors 18, 26, 19, 5
- Node 22, with neighbors 2, 12, 3, 27, 24

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around these nodes:
\[ \text{Total} = \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3}  \]

\[ \text{Total} = 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 67 \]

Therefore, we found a total of 67 3-stars in the given graph.
Putting this final number inside brackets, we have: [67]

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (22, 12, 3)>
<4, (8, 5, 1)>
<5, (4, 0, 28)>
<8, (17, 4, 1)>
<13, (18, 29, 19)>
<15, (0, 25, 10)>
<18, (20, 29, 13)>
<19, (14, 7, 13)>
<20, (18, 26, 19)>
<22, (2, 12, 3)>
