Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (6, 5) (6, 10) (0, 9) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 12) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 11) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 5, 9, 1, 3, 8, 13, 4, 6, 0, 14, 11, 7, 2, 12, and 10. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{9}{3} = 84 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 84 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 155\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the provided graph is [155]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 11, 12)>
<9, (5, 11, 14)>
<1, (3, 10, 13)>
<3, (1, 0, 4)>
<8, (5, 13, 14)>
<13, (9, 1, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<11, (5, 9, 14)>
<7, (8, 11, 13)>
<2, (4, 7, 10)>
<12, (5, 1, 11)>
<1, (3, 4, 10)>
<10, (9, 1, 4)>
<11, (9, 5, 7)>
