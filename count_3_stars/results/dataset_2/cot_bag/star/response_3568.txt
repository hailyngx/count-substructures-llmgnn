Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 2) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 2) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 12) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 9) 

Response:
To begin, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, and 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for each.
- For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
There is no node with exactly 4 or more neighbors, so we don't need to consider those cases.

The total number of 3-stars is: \( 10 \times 7 + 1 = 71 \)

So, the final answer is [71].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 10)>, <1, (3, 5, 14)>, <1, (3, 7, 10)>, <1, (3, 7, 14)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 10)>, <1, (4, 5, 14)>, <1, (5, 7, 10)>, <1, (5, 7, 14)>, <1, (5, 10, 14)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 10)>, <3, (1, 5, 14)>, <3, (1, 7, 10)>, <3, (1, 7, 14)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 10)>, <3, (4, 5, 14)>, <3, (5, 7, 10)>, <3, (5, 7, 14)>, <3, (5, 10, 14)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 10)>, <4, (1, 5, 14)>, <4, (1, 7, 10)>, <4, (1, 7, 14)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 10)>, <4, (3, 5, 14)>, <4, (5, 7, 10)>, <4, (5, 7, 14)>, <4, (5, 10, 14)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 10)>, <5, (1, 3, 14)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 10)>, <5,...
