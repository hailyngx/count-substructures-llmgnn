Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 10) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 10) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes which have 3 or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 4, 2, 12, 7, 10, 13, 5, 14, 3, and 0.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
1. Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
4. Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
5. Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
6. Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
7. Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
8. Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (has exactly 3 neighbors)
9. Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (has exactly 3 neighbors)
10. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (has exactly 3 neighbors)
12. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (has exactly 3 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10+10+10+10+10+10+10+1+1+4+1+1 = 68

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

Unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (9, 2, 12)>
<9, (6, 4, 14)>
<4, (9, 2, 12)>
<2, (6, 4, 10)>
<12, (6, 4, 0)>
<7, (6, 9, 3)>
<10, (1, 4, 14)>
<13, (9, 3, 5)>
<5, (6, 13, 12)>
<14, (9, 7, 10)>
<3, (1, 7, 13)>
<0, (12, 2, 11)>
