Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
   1 - 6 - 8
   |   |   |
   3 - 5 - 2 - 7
   |     |   |
   0 - 4 - 9
```

Based on the provided edges, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph:  

- Node 0: <0, (1, 4, 7)>  
- Node 1: <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>  
- Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 0)>  
- Node 3: <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>  
- Node 4: <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>  
- Node 5: <5, (2, 8, 3)>, <5, (0, 9, 6)>  
- Node 6: <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>  
- Node 8: <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (4, 7, 0)>  
- Node 9: <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>  

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us [18].
