Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 14) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 6) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 18) (18, 16) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 15) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 0) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 17) (17, 19) (17, 12) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 1) (2, 0) (14, 16) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 10) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 15) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 15) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 6) (15, 9) (10, 14) (10, 6) (12, 8) (12, 17) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 2, 4, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16, 18, and 19.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 1, 19)>
<4, (8, 13, 9)>
<8, (13, 14, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 15)>
<13, (7, 18, 8)>
<15, (6, 14, 9)>
<16, (18, 14, 11)>
<18, (19, 15, 16)>
<19, (17, 2, 18)>
