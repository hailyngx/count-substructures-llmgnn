Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed around them.

- Node 0 has 7 neighbors
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form $ \binom{7}{3} = 35 $ 3-stars
- Node 1 can form $ \binom{6}{3} = 20 $ 3-stars
- Node 2 can form $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars
- Node 3 can form $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars
- Node 4 can form $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars
- Node 5 can form $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars
- Node 6 can form $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars
- Node 9 can form $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars

Adding all the possible 3-stars gives us a total of $ 35 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 85 $ 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [85]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
