Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 17) (12, 14) (12, 11) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 9) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 5) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 0) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 13) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 18) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 19) (0, 2) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (18, 9) (18, 5) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 10) (17, 7) (17, 3) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 16) (5, 14) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 16) (13, 15) (16, 5) (16, 14) (6, 4) (6, 15) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 14) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 7, and node 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
There are 5 neighbors of node 0: 1, 8, 10, 19, and 2. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center. These 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 10, 19)>, <0, (1, 10, 2)>, <0, (1, 19, 2)>, <0, (10, 19, 2)>, 
<0, (1, 10, 8)>, <0, (1, 19, 8)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (10, 19, 8)>,
<0, (10, 2, 8)>, <0, (19, 2, 8)>

For node 7:
There are 4 neighbors of node 7: 1, 8, 10, and 17. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center. These 3-stars are:
<7, (1, 10, 17)>, <7, (1, 8, 10)>, <7, (1, 8, 17)>, <7, (10, 8, 17)>

For node 14:
There are 5 neighbors of node 14: 1, 2, 5, 16, and 12. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 14 as the center. These 3-stars are:
<14, (1, 5, 16)>, <14, (1, 5, 2)>, <14, (1, 5, 12)>, <14, (1, 16, 2)>,
<14, (1, 16, 12)>, <14, (1, 2, 12)>, <14, (5, 16, 2)>, <14, (5, 16, 12)>,
<14, (5, 2, 12)>, <14, (16, 2, 12)>

Adding up the 3-stars for each node, we get a total of 10 + 4 + 10 = 24 3-stars. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].
