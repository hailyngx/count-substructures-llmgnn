Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 9 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For Node 9: \( \binom{9}{3} = 84 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 84 = 124 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [124].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
