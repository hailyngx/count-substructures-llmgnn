Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 11) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 3) (9, 16) (9, 13) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 10) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 8) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 11) (0, 8) (0, 16) (16, 9) (16, 0) (16, 2) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 4) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 10) (11, 15) (11, 4) (11, 19) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 18) (18, 1) (18, 10) (18, 17) (17, 5) (17, 18) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then we determine how many 3-stars are centered at each of these nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 15, 9, 4, 7, 13, 1, 8, 0, 16, 12, 2, 6, 10, and 18.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <3, (15, 9, 12)>
  - <3, (15, 9, 4)>
  - <3, (15, 12, 4)>
  - <3, (9, 12, 4)>

- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <15, (3, 9, 12)>
  - <15, (3, 9, 11)>
  - <15, (3, 12, 11)>
  - <15, (9, 12, 11)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <9, (3, 15, 16)>
  - <9, (3, 16, 13)>
  - <9, (15, 16, 13)>
  - <9, (3, 15, 13)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (3, 12, 11)>
  - <4, (3, 12, 6)>
  - <4, (3, 11, 19)>
  - <4, (12, 6, 11)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <7, (6, 10, 13)>

- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <13, (9, 7, 10)>

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <1, (15, 18, 8)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (1, 18, 19)>
  - <8, (1, 18, 0)>
  - <8, (1, 19, 6)>
  - <8, (18, 19, 0)>

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <0, (8, 16, 2)>

- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <16, (9, 0, 2)>

- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <12, (3, 15, 4)>
  - <12, (3, 15, 11)>
  - <12, (3, 4, 11)>
  - <12, (15, 4, 11)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (5, 16, 6)>
  - <2, (5, 16, 10)>
  - <2, (5, 6, 10)>
  - <2, (16, 6, 10)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <6, (4, 7, 8)>
  - <6, (4, 7, 2)>
  - <6, (4, 8, 2)>
  - <6, (7, 8, 2)>

- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <10, (7, 13, 18)>
  - <10, (7, 13, 2)>
  - <10, (7, 18, 2)>
  - <10, (13, 18, 2)>

- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <18, (1, 17, 10)>

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated for each node, we have a total of [38] 3-stars in the graph.
