Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 17) (7, 8) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 16) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 0) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 0) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 9) (15, 12) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 5) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (16, 2) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 10) (18, 5) (18, 16) (13, 10) (13, 6) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 9) (6, 13) 

Response:
Given the information provided, here is the calculation for the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 17}
- Node 1: {0, 11, 16, 17}
- Node 2: {8, 9, 16}
- Node 3: {7, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 4: {7, 11}
- Node 5: {0, 18, 19}
- Node 6: {13}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 8, 17, 19}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 11, 13, 18}
- Node 11: {1, 4, 10}
- Node 12: {9, 14, 15}
- Node 13: {6, 10}
- Node 14: {9, 12, 19}
- Node 15: {12}
- Node 16: {1, 2, 18}
- Node 17: {1, 7, 0}
- Node 18: {5, 10, 16}
- Node 19: {5, 7, 14}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [Unnecessary to calculate since it has less than 3 neighbors]
- Node 1: [Unnecessary to calculate since it has less than 3 neighbors]
- Node 2: [Unnecessary to calculate since it has less than 3 neighbors]
- Node 3: [Unnecessary to calculate since it has less than 3 neighbors]
- Node 4: [1] -> <4, 7, 11>
- Node 5: [Unnecessary to calculate since it has less than 3 neighbors]
- Node 6: [Unnecessary to calculate since it has less than 3 neighbors]
- Node 7: [Unnecessary to calculate since it has exactly 3 neighbors]
- Node 8: [Unnecessary to calculate since it has less than 3 neighbors]
- Node 9: [1] -> <9, 12, 14>
- Node 10: [1] -> <10, 11, 3>
- Node 11: [1] -> <11, 1, 4>
- Node 12: [1] -> <12, 9, 14>
- Node 13: [Unnecessary to calculate since it has less than 3 neighbors] 
- Node 14: [1] -> <14, 9, 12>
- Node 15: [Unnecessary to calculate since it has less than 3 neighbors]
- Node 16: [Unnecessary to calculate since it has less than 3 neighbors]
- Node 17: [Unnecessary to calculate since it has exactly 3 neighbors]
- Node 18: [Unnecessary to calculate since it has less than 3 neighbors]
- Node 19: [1] -> <19, 7, 14>

Summing up the 3-stars generated by each node: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
