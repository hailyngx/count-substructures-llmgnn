Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 9) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 9) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 11) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 15) (2, 4) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 12) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 18) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 8) (12, 4) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 6) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 15) (18, 9) (18, 15) (15, 2) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 17) (19, 15) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 10, 17, 0, 14, 2, 11, 4, 6, 7, 15, 9, 5, 8, 16, and 18.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (3, 11, 13)>
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <10, (17, 4, 9)>
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <17, (10, 19, 11)>, <17, (10, 19, 7)>, <17, (10, 11, 7)>, <17, (19, 11, 7)>
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (14, 5, 13)>
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (6, 15, 4)>
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <11, (17, 13, 1)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <4, (10, 12, 6)>, <4, (10, 12, 2)>, <4, (10, 6, 2)>, <4, (12, 6, 2)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <6, (2, 7, 4)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <7, (17, 16, 6)>, <7, (17, 16, 8)>, <7, (17, 6, 8)>, <7, (16, 6, 8)>
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <15, (2, 18, 19)>, <15, (2, 18, 16)>, <15, (2, 19, 16)>, <15, (18, 19, 16)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <9, (3, 18, 10)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 15, 14)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <8, (7, 16, 12)>
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <16, (8, 15, 7)>
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 (from node 1) + 1 (node 10) + 4 (node 17) + 1 (node 0) + 1 (node 2) + 1 (node 11) + 4 (node 4) + 1 (node 6) + 4 (node 7) + 4 (node 15) + 1 (node 9) + 1 (node 5) + 1 (node 8) + 1 (node 16) = 24

Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in the graph.
