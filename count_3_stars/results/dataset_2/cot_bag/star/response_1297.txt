Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 9) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 14) (7, 10) (8, 4) (8, 0) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 0) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 1) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 12) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 9) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 17) (6, 15) (6, 12) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 2) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 2) (14, 13) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (12, 19) (12, 6) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 17) (9, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
   - <0, (16, 8, 18)>, <0, (16, 8, 17)>, <0, (18, 8, 4)>, <0, (18, 4, 17)>

- Node 2: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
   - <2, (5, 1, 17)>, <2, (5, 1, 14)>, <2, (5, 1, 2)>, <2, (5, 14, 17)>

- Node 3: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
   - <3, (11, 15, 4)>, <3, (11, 15, 6)>, <3, (11, 15, 10)>, <3, (4, 15, 10)>

- Node 4: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
   - <4, (18, 14, 2)>, <4, (18, 14, 3)>, <4, (18, 14, 13)>, <4, (18, 14, 17)>

- Node 9: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
   - <9, (16, 10, 1)>, <9, (16, 10, 17)>, <9, (16, 10, 9)>, <9, (16, 10, 7)>

- Node 10: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
   - <10, (15, 7, 9)>, <10, (15, 7, 10)>, <10, (15, 6, 9)>, <10, (15, 6, 12)>

- Node 11: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
   - <11, (19, 5, 1)>, <11, (19, 5, 2)>, <11, (19, 5, 12)>, <11, (19, 12, 6)>

- Node 14: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
   - <14, (18, 13, 2)>, <14, (18, 13, 4)>, <14, (18, 13, 17)>, <14, (18, 13, 14)>

- Node 15: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
   - <15, (3, 4, 8)>, <15, (3, 4, 18)>, <15, (3, 4, 14)>, <15, (4, 18, 14)>

- Node 16: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
   - <16, (0, 8, 17)>, <16, (0, 8, 4)>, <16, (0, 8, 18)>, <16, (0, 18, 17)>

- Node 17: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
   - <17, (9, 1, 2)>, <17, (9, 1, 5)>, <17, (9, 1, 14)>, <17, (9, 2, 14)>

- Node 18: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
   - <18, (11, 4, 14)>, <18, (11, 4, 18)>, <18, (11, 4, 3)>, <18, (14, 4, 3)>

- Node 19: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
   - <19, (11, 5, 2)>, <19, (11, 5, 1)>, <19, (11, 5, 12)>, <19, (5, 12, 6)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52

Therefore, there are 52 3-stars in this graph, which we put inside brackets: [52].
