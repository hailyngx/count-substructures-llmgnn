Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 9) (25, 20) (25, 17) (25, 23) (25, 18) (8, 13) (8, 27) (13, 8) (13, 23) (15, 2) (15, 24) (6, 28) (6, 2) (6, 27) (6, 19) (28, 6) (28, 21) (17, 25) (17, 29) (17, 11) (17, 26) (29, 17) (29, 5) (29, 22) (0, 9) (0, 21) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 5) (21, 28) (21, 0) (21, 10) (21, 22) (10, 21) (10, 2) (10, 9) (16, 22) (16, 3) (16, 26) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 23) (12, 2) (12, 1) (26, 20) (26, 17) (26, 16) (3, 16) (3, 18) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 24) (1, 7) (11, 17) (11, 9) (5, 29) (5, 14) (5, 23) (23, 25) (23, 13) (23, 2) (23, 5) (23, 7) (7, 20) (7, 1) (7, 23) (24, 15) (24, 1) (24, 19) (9, 20) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) (4, 19) (19, 6) (19, 24) (19, 4) (18, 25) (18, 14) (18, 3) (22, 29) (22, 21) (22, 16) (27, 8) (27, 6) 

Response:
The central node in a 3-star must have at least three neighbors to form a 3-star. From the given edges, nodes 2, 6, 9, 17, 18, 21, 23, and 25 have three or more neighbors, while the other nodes have fewer than three neighbors and thus do not form any 3-stars.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: 
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <2, (6, 10, 23)>, <2, (6, 12, 23)>, <2, (10, 12, 23)>, <2, (10, 15, 23)>, <2, (12, 15, 23)>, <2, (6, 10, 23)>, <2, (6, 10, 12)>, <2, (6, 10, 23)>, <2, (6, 12, 23)>, <2, (10, 12, 23)>

- Node 6:
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <6, (2, 10, 23)>, <6, (2, 12, 23)>, <6, (10, 12, 23)>, <6, (2, 15, 23)>, <6, (10, 15, 23)>, <6, (2, 10, 23)>, <6, (2, 12, 23)>, <6, (10, 12, 23)>, <6, (15, 23, 28)>, <6, (2, 10, 28)>

- Node 9:
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 10, 11)>, <9, (0, 10, 11)>, <9, (0, 10, 11)>, <9, (0, 10, 11)>

- Node 17:
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <17, (11, 25, 29)>, <17, (11, 25, 29)>, <17, (11, 25, 29)>, <17, (11, 25, 29)>

- Node 18:
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <18, (3, 14, 25)>

- Node 21:
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <21, (0, 22, 28)>, <21, (0, 22, 28)>, <21, (0, 22, 28)>, <21, (0, 22, 28)>

- Node 23:
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <23, (2, 5, 7)>, <23, (2, 5, 7)>, <23, (2, 5, 7)>, <23, (2, 5, 7)>, <23, (2, 5, 7)>, <23, (5, 7, 29)>, <23, (5, 7, 29)>, <23, (5, 7, 29)>, <23, (5, 7, 29)>, <23, (5, 7, 29)>

- Node 25:
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <25, (17, 20, 29)>, <25, (17, 20, 29)>, <25, (17, 20, 29)>, <25, (17, 20, 29)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 43. Thus, the final answer is [43].
