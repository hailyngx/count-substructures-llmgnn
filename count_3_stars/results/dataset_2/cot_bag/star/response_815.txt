Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (27, 4) (27, 22) (27, 3) (18, 4) (18, 5) (22, 27) (22, 4) (22, 12) (10, 7) (10, 28) (10, 16) (10, 14) (11, 3) (4, 27) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 5) (4, 26) (19, 26) (19, 28) (19, 9) (26, 4) (26, 19) (26, 23) (28, 10) (28, 19) (28, 15) (28, 20) (3, 27) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 5) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 23) (21, 17) (21, 24) (23, 26) (23, 6) (23, 29) (23, 12) (9, 19) (9, 24) (9, 20) (9, 13) (29, 23) (29, 25) (29, 15) (1, 6) (1, 20) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 1) (12, 22) (12, 23) (7, 10) (7, 20) (7, 14) (16, 10) (16, 3) (20, 28) (20, 9) (20, 1) (20, 7) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 13) (8, 14) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 25) (25, 29) (25, 13) (25, 15) (5, 0) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 3) (17, 21) (17, 24) (24, 21) (24, 9) (24, 17) (15, 28) (15, 29) (15, 25) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

The total number of 3-stars is: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].
