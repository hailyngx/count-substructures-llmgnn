Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: {9, 4, 7, 3, 2, 5}
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {9, 1, 8, 0}
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {9, 7, 3, 5, 1}
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {6, 4, 1, 8}
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {9, 5, 7}
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {6, 9, 4, 1}
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {7, 5, 2, 0}
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: {6, 4, 2, 1, 7}

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed: 
- Node 1 can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Adding these up: 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 56.

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
