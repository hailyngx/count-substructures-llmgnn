Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (15, 3) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 19) (4, 15) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 19) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (18, 19) (18, 5) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 17) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 13) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 16) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 18) (7, 10) (7, 2) (13, 14) (13, 16) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph are: 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 45 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars are: <2, (4, 5, 14)>, <4, (2, 6, 15)>, <5, (1, 8, 18)>, <6, (9, 12, 4)>, <9, (6, 11, 1)>, <10, (2, 7, 14)>, <11, (9, 10, 19)>, <12, (15, 6, 16)>, <15, (3, 12, 17)>, <16, (12, 13, 17)>, <17, (3, 19, 16)>, <19, (11, 0, 18)>.
