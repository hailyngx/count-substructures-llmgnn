Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 7) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 5) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 16) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (19, 11) (19, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 9) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 16) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 18) (7, 13) (7, 10) (7, 5) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 18) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 11) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 18) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 0) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 3) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 8, 13, 10, 17, 4, 5, 15, and 12.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Adding them up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 14.

So, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<8, (4, 12, 14)>
<8, (4, 5, 12)>
<8, (4, 5, 14)>
<8, (12, 13, 15)>
<13, (7, 15, 17)>
<10, (2, 7, 17)>
<17, (5, 10, 12)>
<4, (5, 8, 16)>
<5, (2, 7, 17)>
<5, (4, 7, 16)>
<15, (1, 13, 16)>
<12, (17, 18, 8)>
<12, (12, 16, 18)>
<12, (12, 17, 18)>
