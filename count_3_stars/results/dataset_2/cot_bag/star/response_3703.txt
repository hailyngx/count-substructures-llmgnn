Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 13) (14, 3) (14, 17) (14, 11) (17, 14) (17, 0) (4, 19) (4, 13) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 11) (2, 5) (2, 10) (18, 15) (18, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 10) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 16) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 13) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 13) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 5) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 1) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 16) (13, 15) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 12) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes with three or more neighbors are:

- Node 0: neighbors {17, 5, 7, 1}
- Node 3: neighbors {15, 14, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 6, 1, 0, 11}
- Node 6: neighbors {18, 5, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 8: neighbors {3, 19, 11}
- Node 10: neighbors {2, 6, 7, 16}
- Node 11: neighbors {14, 8, 5}
- Node 12: neighbors {6, 16, 13}
- Node 13: neighbors {15, 4, 19, 12}
- Node 14: neighbors {3, 17, 11}
- Node 15: neighbors {3, 18, 13}
- Node 16: neighbors {10, 12, 1}
- Node 19: neighbors {4, 8, 13}

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is [29].
