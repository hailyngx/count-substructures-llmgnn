Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this 10-node graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The neighbors of each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 6, 8, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars to the total.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars to the total.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars to the total.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars to the total.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars to the total.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars to the total.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars to the total.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars to the total.

Adding up all the individual contributions, we get a total of 
\[ 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>

<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
