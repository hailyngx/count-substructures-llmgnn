Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
0: 4, 23
1: 6, 18
2: 4, 5, 7, 12, 24
3: 17, 24, 26
4: 0, 2, 16, 18, 25
5: 2, 24, 28
6: 1, 11, 19
7: 2, 7, 8, 16, 23
8: 7, 8, 25, 29
9: 14
10: 20
11: 6, 13
12: 2, 12, 15, 16, 21
13: 11, 16, 29
14: 9
15: 12, 15, 19, 23, 28
16: 4, 7, 12, 13, 27
17: 3, 24
18: 1, 4, 22
19: 6, 15
20: 10, 20, 27, 28, 29
21: 12, 21, 22
22: 18, 21, 26
23: 0, 7, 15, 23, 28
24: 2, 3, 5, 17, 24
25: 4, 8
26: 3, 22
27: 16, 20
28: 5, 15, 20, 23, 28
29: 8, 13, 20

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1] = 105 \).
