Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 10) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 11) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 8, 13, 0, 14, 2, 12, 11, 5, 3, 10, and 1.  

Calculating the 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 3 3-stars: <2, (6, 8, 13)>, <2, (8, 6, 13)>, <2, (13, 6, 8)>.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives: [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [13].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (6, 8, 13)>, 
<2, (8, 6, 13)>, 
<2, (13, 6, 8)>.
