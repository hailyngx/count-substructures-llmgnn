Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 14) (0, 4) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 2) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 72

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [72].

The unique 3-stars are:
