Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 1.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), as it has 4 neighbors.
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \), as it has 5 neighbors.
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \), as it has 5 neighbors.
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \), as it has 6 neighbors.
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \), as it has 6 neighbors.
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), as it has 4 neighbors.

Adding these up, we get a total of 68 3-stars in the graph.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (4, 1, 2)>, <2, (4, 0, 6)>, <3, (7, 5, 9)>, <4, (7, 5, 1)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>.
