Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will analyze each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors: (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 1), (0, 8), (0, 6). So, there are [6 choose 3] = 20 3-stars involving node 0.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 6). So, there are [5 choose 3] = 10 3-stars involving node 4.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 3). So, there are [5 choose 3] = 10 3-stars involving node 5.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 1), (8, 0), (8, 6). So, there are [5 choose 3] = 10 3-stars involving node 8.

Adding these up, we have a total of 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (5, 3, 7)>
<0, (5, 4, 7)>
<0, (5, 4, 9)>
<0, (5, 9, 2)>
<0, (5, 9, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 0, 8)>
<4, (7, 0, 3)>
<5, (3, 2, 7)>
<5, (4, 0, 7)>
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 0, 9)>
