Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 8) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 11) (2, 13) (2, 3) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 3) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 14) (19, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 16) (9, 18) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 6) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (11, 17) (11, 1) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 0) (14, 5) (14, 8) (15, 7) (16, 4) (16, 8) (6, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 10, 17, 13, 18, 1, 8, 12, 5, 0, and 3.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 44 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars are:

<4, (7, 16, 1)>
<7, (4, 15, 10)>
<10, (7, 3, 8)>
<17, (10, 12, 13)>
<13, (17, 0, 6)>
<18, (4, 9, 3)>
<1, (4, 5, 11)>
<8, (7, 14, 16)>
<12, (17, 0, 1)>
<5, (4, 14, 19)>
<0, (13, 3, 12)>
<3, (10, 18, 0)>
