Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows: 
- Node 0: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 61 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [61].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 1)>
