Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 14) (9, 13) (5, 6) (28, 27) (28, 24) (28, 2) (22, 9) (22, 27) (22, 7) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 0) (17, 1) (17, 8) (17, 27) (17, 4) (20, 7) (20, 3) (20, 23) (20, 10) (3, 20) (3, 21) (3, 23) (3, 19) (3, 18) (21, 3) (21, 19) (16, 19) (29, 4) (29, 10) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 25) (8, 26) (19, 3) (19, 21) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 15) (10, 20) (10, 29) (26, 8) (26, 7) (11, 24) (11, 18) (24, 28) (24, 11) (24, 23) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 12) (23, 20) (23, 3) (23, 24) (7, 22) (7, 20) (7, 26) (7, 13) (2, 6) (2, 28) (2, 1) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 25) (27, 28) (27, 22) (27, 17) (27, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 27) (13, 25) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 13) (25, 14) (12, 15) (18, 3) (18, 11) (4, 17) (4, 29) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 25) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 2 with neighbors 6, 28, 1, 14
- Node 3 with neighbors 20, 21, 19, 18, 23
- Node 4 with neighbors 17, 29, 14
- Node 7 with neighbors 22, 20, 26, 13
- Node 8 with neighbors 17, 19, 25, 26
- Node 9 with neighbors 6, 22, 14, 13
- Node 13 with neighbors 9, 7, 27, 25
- Node 14 with neighbors 9, 15, 2, 25
- Node 15 with neighbors 19, 14, 12
- Node 17 with neighbors 1, 8, 27, 4
- Node 19 with neighbors 3, 21, 16, 8, 15
- Node 20 with neighbors 7, 3, 23, 10
- Node 22 with neighbors 9, 27, 7
- Node 24 with neighbors 28, 11, 23
- Node 25 with neighbors 8, 0, 13, 14
- Node 26 with neighbors 8, 7
- Node 27 with neighbors 28, 22, 17, 13
- Node 28 with neighbors 27, 24, 2

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding them up, we have a total of 60 3-stars. So, the final answer is [60].
