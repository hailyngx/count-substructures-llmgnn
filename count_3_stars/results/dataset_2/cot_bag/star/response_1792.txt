Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 17) (16, 18) (26, 18) (2, 24) (2, 14) (2, 7) (29, 20) (29, 3) (20, 29) (20, 21) (20, 6) (25, 17) (25, 15) (25, 18) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 21) (8, 27) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 7) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 20) (6, 28) (6, 27) (28, 8) (28, 6) (21, 20) (21, 8) (21, 24) (21, 4) (24, 2) (24, 21) (24, 3) (24, 27) (24, 19) (4, 21) (4, 27) (4, 1) (4, 17) (27, 8) (27, 6) (27, 24) (27, 4) (18, 16) (18, 26) (18, 25) (5, 10) (17, 16) (17, 25) (17, 4) (17, 23) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 23) (14, 19) (22, 10) (22, 15) (15, 25) (15, 13) (15, 22) (15, 19) (19, 24) (19, 14) (19, 15) (19, 23) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 23) (0, 1) (3, 29) (3, 24) (3, 0) (23, 17) (23, 14) (23, 19) (23, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 10) (10, 5) (10, 22) (10, 1) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 11, 13, 8, 2, 24, 20, 25, 7, 6, 28, 21, 4, 27, 18, 17, 14, 15, 19, 0, 23, and 1.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For each of the nodes mentioned above with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \).

For node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 70 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [70]. 

Some unique 3-stars found are: 
<11, (14, 0, 13)>, <13, (11, 8, 15)>, <2, (14, 7, 24)>, <24, (2, 3, 27)>, <20, (29, 6, 21)>, <25, (17, 15, 18)>, <7, (2, 1, 13)>, <6, (20, 28, 27)>, <28, (8, 6, 27)>, <21, (24, 8, 4)>, <4, (21, 1, 27)>, <27, (24, 8, 4)>, <18, (16, 25, 26)>, <17, (16, 25, 4)>, <14, (11, 2, 19)>, <15, (25, 13, 22)>, <19, (14, 15, 23)>, <0, (11, 3, 23)>, <23, (17, 0, 19)>, <1, (7, 10, 4)>
