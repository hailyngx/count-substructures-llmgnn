Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 14) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 10) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: In this case, there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: In this case, there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: In this case, there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 65

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [65].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 1, 14)>, 
<2, (5, 2, 14)>, 
<3, (1, 5, 13)>, 
<4, (3, 7, 12)>, 
<6, (9, 6, 13)>, 
<7, (9, 7, 14)>, 
<8, (9, 8, 13)>, 
<9, (6, 9, 11)>, 
<10, (8, 10, 12)>, 
<11, (5, 9, 11)>, 
<12, (0, 8, 12)>, 
<13, (3, 6, 13)>, 
<14, (1, 13, 14)>.
