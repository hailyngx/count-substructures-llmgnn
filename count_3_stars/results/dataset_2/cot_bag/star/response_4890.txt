Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
Let's first find the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, and 0 (degree = 6)
- Node 2 has neighbors 9, 4, 1, 3, and 0 (degree = 5)
- Node 3 has neighbors 9, 7, 8, 2 (degree = 4)
- Node 4 has neighbors 7, 8, 2 (degree = 3)
- Node 5 has neighbors 9, 6, 1, 0 (degree = 4)
- Node 7 has neighbors 4, 3, 1 (degree = 3)
- Node 8 has neighbors 9, 4, 3, 1 (degree = 4)
- Node 9 has neighbors 5, 8, 2, 3 (degree = 4)

Now we'll count the number of 3-stars at each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42 3-stars in the graph.

Thus, the final answer is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 2)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <2, (9, 4, 1)>
