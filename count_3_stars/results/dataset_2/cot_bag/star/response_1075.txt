Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 1) (20, 22) (15, 7) (15, 18) (3, 11) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 6) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (21, 3) (21, 22) (21, 29) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 1) (17, 12) (17, 2) (18, 15) (18, 23) (18, 29) (19, 25) (19, 7) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 8) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (14, 27) (14, 28) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 22) (2, 17) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 25) (5, 0) (5, 10) (23, 18) (23, 12) (23, 9) (16, 13) (16, 9) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 24) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 23) (9, 16) (9, 27) (26, 27) (26, 12) (29, 21) (29, 18) (29, 10) (24, 7) (24, 12) (12, 17) (12, 23) (12, 26) (12, 24) (27, 14) (27, 9) (27, 26) (27, 8) (27, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 25) (8, 1) (8, 27) (8, 22) (25, 19) (25, 2) (25, 4) (25, 22) (22, 20) (22, 21) (22, 28) (22, 8) (22, 25) (10, 5) (10, 29) (10, 27) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: {(0, 5), (0, 1), (1, 13), (1, 6), (1, 8), (2, 17), (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 25), (3, 11), (3, 21), (3, 28), (3, 6), (4, 11), (4, 13), (4, 25), (5, 0), (5, 10), (6, 3), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 15), (7, 19), (7, 24), (8, 1), (8, 27), (8, 22), (9, 11), (9, 2), (9, 23), (9, 16), (9, 27), (10, 5), (10, 29), (10, 27), (11, 3), (11, 9), (11, 4), (12, 17), (12, 23), (12, 26), (12, 24), (13, 16), (13, 4), (13, 1), (14, 27), (14, 28), (15, 7), (15, 18), (16, 13), (16, 9), (17, 12), (17, 2), (18, 15), (18, 23), (18, 29), (19, 25), (19, 7), (20, 22), (21, 3), (21, 22), (21, 29), (22, 20), (22, 21), (22, 28), (22, 8), (22, 25), (23, 18), (23, 12), (23, 9), (24, 7), (24, 12), (25, 19), (25, 2), (25, 4), (25, 22), (26, 27), (26, 12), (27, 14), (27, 9), (27, 26), (27, 8), (27, 10), (28, 3), (28, 14), (28, 22), (29, 21), (29, 18), (29, 10)}

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 13: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 17: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 22: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 25: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 27: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 28: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 29: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 45

Therefore, there are 45 3-stars in the given graph.
