Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 7) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 10) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (11, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 9) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 4) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we construct the following graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 10), (1, 7), (3, 14), (3, 6), (3, 5), (8, 13), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 12), (13, 8), (13, 4), (13, 9), (13, 7), (7, 1), (7, 13), (7, 5), (12, 8), (12, 2), (12, 5), (12, 0), (0, 12), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 4), (0, 9), (14, 3), (14, 9), (14, 10), (2, 1), (2, 12), (2, 6), (2, 10), (11, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 2), (6, 4), (10, 1), (10, 0), (10, 14), (10, 2), (10, 4), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 12), (4, 13), (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 10), (4, 9), (9, 13), (9, 0), (9, 14), (9, 4)

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1 forms one 3-star: <1, (6, 5, 10)>
2. Node 3 forms one 3-star: <3, (14, 6, 5)>
3. Node 6 forms multiple 3-stars: <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (4, 10, 2)>, <6, (8, 1, 3)>
4. Node 8 forms one 3-star: <8, (13, 5, 12)>
5. Node 13 forms one 3-star: <13, (4, 9, 7)>
6. Node 12 forms one 3-star: <12, (0, 2, 5)>
7. Node 7 forms one 3-star: <7, (1, 13, 5)>
8. Node 0 forms one 3-star: <0, (12, 9, 11)>
9. Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, (1, 10, 12)>
10. Node 10 forms one 3-star: <10, (1, 0, 14)>
11. Node 5 forms one 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 7)>
12. Node 4 forms one 3-star: <4, (13, 9, 10)>
13. Node 9 forms one 3-star: <9, (13, 0, 14)>
14. Node 14 forms one 3-star: <14, (3, 9, 10)>

Total number of 3-stars = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
