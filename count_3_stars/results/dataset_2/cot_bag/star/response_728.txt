Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 22) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 25) (9, 6) (22, 4) (22, 23) (22, 29) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 21) (23, 16) (23, 0) (21, 23) (21, 20) (21, 18) (21, 24) (28, 26) (28, 20) (26, 28) (26, 2) (26, 3) (0, 23) (3, 7) (3, 26) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 17) (5, 23) (5, 24) (17, 6) (17, 11) (17, 2) (15, 25) (2, 4) (2, 26) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 25) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 29) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 20) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 16) (20, 21) (20, 28) (20, 14) (12, 29) (12, 1) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 27) (10, 1) (10, 24) (18, 21) (18, 1) (27, 10) (16, 23) (16, 19) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 12) (29, 24) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 18) (25, 6) (25, 22) (25, 15) (25, 2) (13, 11) (13, 19) (24, 21) (24, 5) (24, 10) (24, 29) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 2, 3, 10, 11, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<2, (4, 17, 26)>
<2, (4, 17, 25)>
<2, (4, 26, 25)>
<2, (17, 26, 25)>

For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<3, (7, 11, 26)>
<3, (7, 11, 10)>
<3, (7, 11, 8)>
<3, (7, 26, 10)>
<3, (7, 26, 8)>
<3, (11, 10, 8)>
<3, (11, 17, 13)>
<3, (11, 13, 19)>
<3, (10, 27, 24)>
<3, (26, 10, 24)>

For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<10, (3, 2, 27)>
<10, (3, 2, 24)>
<10, (3, 27, 24)>
<10, (2, 27, 24)>
<10, (2, 17, 10)>
<10, (17, 2, 25)>
<10, (17, 2, 10)>
<10, (27, 24, 29)>
<10, (24, 29, 1)>
<10, (2, 25, 24)>

For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<11, (7, 3, 13)>
<11, (7, 13, 19)>
<11, (3, 26, 13)>
<11, (26, 3, 13)>

For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<14, (8, 1, 19)>
<14, (8, 1, 20)>
<14, (8, 1, 12)>
<14, (1, 19, 20)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \([4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4] = 32\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 32.
