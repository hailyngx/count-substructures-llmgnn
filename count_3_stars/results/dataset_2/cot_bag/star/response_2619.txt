Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes in the graph. Let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph using the formula explained earlier:

1. Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 5, 4, 1, 6, 2
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <0, (5, 4, 1)>, <0, (5, 4, 6)>, <0, (5, 4, 2)>, <0, (5, 1, 6)>, <0, (5, 1, 2)>, <0, (5, 6, 2)>, <0, (4, 1, 6)>, <0, (4, 1, 2)>, <0, (4, 6, 2)>, <0, (1, 6, 2)>

2. Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 5, 9, 6, 0, 8
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <1, (5, 9, 6)>, <1, (5, 9, 0)>, <1, (5, 9, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 0)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 0, 8)>, <1, (9, 6, 0)>, <1, (9, 6, 8)>, <1, (9, 0, 8)>, <1, (6, 0, 8)>

3. Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 6, 8, 0
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <2, (4, 7, 6)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 0)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 0)>, <2, (4, 8, 0)>, <2, (7, 6, 8)>, <2, (7, 6, 0)>, <2, (7, 8, 0)>, <2, (6, 8, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 + 10 = 30. 
So, the final answer is [30].
