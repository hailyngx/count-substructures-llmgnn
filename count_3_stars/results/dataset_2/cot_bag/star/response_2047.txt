Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, let's construct the graph first:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 8), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 8), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 7), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 7)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and find the 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: Total neighbors = 4. Number of 3-stars = 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 1: Total neighbors = 4. Number of 3-stars = 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 2: Total neighbors = 4. Number of 3-stars = 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 3: Total neighbors = 3. (Node 3 only forms 1 3-star with its neighbors)
- Node 4: Total neighbors = 4. Number of 3-stars = 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 5: Total neighbors = 4. Number of 3-stars = 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 7: Total neighbors = 5. Number of 3-stars = 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 8: Total neighbors = 6. Number of 3-stars = 6 choose 3 = 20
- Node 9: Total neighbors = 4. Number of 3-stars = 4 choose 3 = 4

Adding all the 3-stars formed by the nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 45

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 7, 0)>
