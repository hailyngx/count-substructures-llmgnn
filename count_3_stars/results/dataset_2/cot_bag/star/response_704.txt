Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 18) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 16) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 17) (0, 5) (0, 16) (14, 4) (14, 16) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 11) (4, 14) (4, 16) (4, 17) (18, 13) (18, 6) (18, 15) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 10) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 4) (17, 1) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 1) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 14) (16, 4) (11, 5) (11, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 19) (19, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 13, 16, and 17.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of \( 9 \times 4 = 36 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the final answer is [36].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, 2, 17, 4>
- <2, 13, 18, 15>
- <3, 9, 5, 11>
- <4, 14, 16, 6>
- <5, 6, 1, 17>
- <6, 1, 10, 3>
- <13, 8, 2, 17>
- <16, 0, 5, 11>
- <17, 12, 7, 10>
