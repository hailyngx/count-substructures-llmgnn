Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 13) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 10) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 17) (2, 15) (18, 3) (18, 10) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 16) (4, 19) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 16) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (7, 3) (7, 16) (7, 14) (16, 19) (16, 4) (16, 7) (1, 12) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 0) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 0) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 17) (14, 12) (14, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 19. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:
\[ \left[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} \right] = [1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [18] \]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 16, 17)>, <3, (6, 12, 16)>, <4, (0, 12, 16)>, <6, (3, 12, 17)>, <8, (5, 13, 12)>, <10, (9, 13, 18)>, <12, (4, 6, 14)>, <13, (8, 9, 10)>, <15, (0, 2, 15)>, <16, (4, 6, 7)>, <17, (0, 6, 11)>, <19, (11, 16, 4)>
