Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 3) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 0) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 12) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 7) (0, 11) (0, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: Neighbors {11, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 10, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 9, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 6, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 5, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 4, 11, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 5, 11, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 7, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 3, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 6, 10}
- Node 14: Neighbors {3, 8, 11, 12}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 5.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 6.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 9.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 10.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 11.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 13.

Adding these up: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 48 \)

Therefore, there are 48 3-stars in the graph, listed below:

[48]

<5, (6, 9, 13)>
<6, (4, 5, 13)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<10, (1, 5, 13)>
<11, (7, 8, 10)>
<13, (1, 5, 6)>
