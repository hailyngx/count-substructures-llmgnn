Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the 3-stars for each node gives us a total of 50 3-stars in this graph. So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

Listing the unique 3-stars:

<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
