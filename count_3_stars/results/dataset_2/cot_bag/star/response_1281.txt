Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 11) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 13, 8, 3, 11, 12, 7, 1.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each node: 

\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 68 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 68. 

In <> format, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, 3, 7>
<5, 3, 8>
<5, 3, 11>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 11>
<5, 7, 12>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 12>
<5, 8, 13>
<5, 8, 7>
<5, 9, 11>
<5, 9, 12>
<5, 9, 13>
<8, 9, 11>
<8, 9, 12>
