Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 17) (11, 15) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 19) (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 12) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 18) (13, 2) (13, 7) (4, 16) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 15) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 12) (1, 10) (1, 7) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 18) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 2) (15, 10) (3, 17) (3, 14) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 17) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 7) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 14) (18, 16) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 17) (18, 10) (12, 6) (12, 0) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, we will first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges. Then, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors in order to count the total number of 3-stars formed.

The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
- 0: (2, 18, 12)
- 1: (10, 7)
- 2: (5, 8, 13, 0, 15)
- 3: (17, 14)
- 4: (16)
- 5: (9, 2)
- 6: (9, 14, 7, 12)
- 7: (6, 13, 1, 14)
- 8: (2, 15, 18)
- 9: (5, 6)
- 10: (1, 15, 18)
- 11: (19, 17, 15)
- 12: (6, 0)
- 13: (2, 7)
- 14: (6, 3, 7)
- 15: (11, 8, 2, 10)
- 16: (18, 4, 19)
- 17: (11, 3, 19, 18)
- 18: (16, 8, 0, 17, 10)
- 19: (11, 16, 17)

Now, we will identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 18, 19

Total number of 3-stars:
Number of 3-stars at node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of \(10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 33\) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<2, (0, 8, 15)>
<6, (9, 7, 14)>
<7, (6, 13, 1)>
<8, (2, 15, 18)>
<10, (1, 15, 18)>
<11, (19, 17, 15)>
<18, (16, 8, 10)>
<19, (16, 17, 11)>
