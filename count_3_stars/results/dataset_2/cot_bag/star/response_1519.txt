The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 3) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 0) (22, 1) (22, 3) (9, 27) (26, 14) (26, 25) (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 29) (27, 9) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 8) (1, 22) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 18) (3, 13) (3, 22) (3, 1) (3, 28) (6, 24) (6, 11) (0, 22) (14, 26) (14, 24) (14, 21) (17, 29) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 2) (29, 15) (29, 17) (16, 17) (16, 10) (28, 3) (28, 25) (8, 27) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 21) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 20) (10, 16) (10, 19) (10, 4) (24, 6) (24, 14) (24, 12) (24, 2) (2, 17) (2, 24) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 2) (7, 20) (7, 23) (7, 25) (11, 1) (11, 6) (20, 19) (20, 7) (20, 21) (21, 27) (21, 14) (21, 5) (21, 20) (21, 4) (25, 26) (25, 28) (25, 7) (25, 18) (18, 15) (18, 1) (18, 25) (23, 13) (23, 7) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 21) 

Response:
The list of nodes that have three or more neighbors is as follows: 1, 3, 5, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27.
    
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars with node 1 as the center are: <1, (3, 18, 19)>, <1, (3, 11, 18)>, <1, (3, 11, 19)>, <1, (3, 18, 21)>, <1, (3, 19, 21)>, <1, (11, 18, 19)>, <1, (11, 18, 21)>, <1, (11, 19, 21)>, <1, (18, 19, 21)>, <1, (3, 18, 21)>.

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars with node 3 as the center are: <3, (1, 18, 19)>, <3, (1, 11, 18)>, <3, (1, 11, 19)>, <3, (1, 18, 21)>.

Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars with node 5 as the center are: <5, (12, 17, 21)>, <5, (12, 17, 19)>, <5, (12, 21, 19)>, <5, (17, 21, 19)>.

Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars with node 19 as the center are: <19, (1, 10, 20)>, <19, (10, 20, 21)>, <19, (10, 20, 7)>, <19, (10, 7, 21)>.

Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars with node 21 as the center are: <21, (4, 5, 20)>, <21, (4, 7, 20)>, <21, (4, 5, 27)>, <21, (4, 20, 27)>, <21, (5, 7, 20)>, <21, (5, 7, 27)>, <21, (5, 20, 27)>, <21, (7, 20, 27)>, <21, (5, 20, 14)>, <21, (4, 5, 14)>.

Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars with node 22 as the center are: <22, (0, 1, 3)>, <22, (1, 13, 3)>, <22, (1, 11, 3)>, <22, (13, 23, 3)>, <22, (13, 3, 10)>, <22, (1, 3, 28)>, <22, (0, 1, 13)>, <22, (13, 22, 23)>, <22, (0, 13, 23)>, <22, (0, 13, 1)>.

Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars with node 24 as the center are: <24, (2, 12, 14)>, <24, (2, 12, 5)>, <24, (2, 5, 14)>, <24, (12, 5, 14)>.

Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars with node 25 as the center are: <25, (7, 18, 28)>, <25, (7, 18, 21)>, <25, (7, 21, 28)>, <25, (18, 21, 28)>.

Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars with node 27 as the center are: <27, (8, 15, 21)>, <27, (8, 15, 27)>, <27, (8, 15, 9)>, <27, (8, 9, 15)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \). Therefore, the final answer is [50].
