Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 5 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 7 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 35.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 1, 8)>
<2, (5, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 0, 9)>
<5, (2, 1, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 2)>
