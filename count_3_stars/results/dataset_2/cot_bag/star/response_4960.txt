Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 19) (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 15) (9, 5) (1, 13) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 19) (18, 17) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 14) (19, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 15) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 13) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 19) (13, 1) (13, 15) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<12, (7, 10, 0)>
<8, (2, 4, 12)>
<7, (12, 14, 15)>
<11, (14, 16, 19)>
<17, (5, 4, 18)>
<19, (10, 11, 14)>
