Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 12) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 12) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 14) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. By looking at the given list of edges, we can identify that the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14.

Now, we'll apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes to find the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up these counts, we get a total of \( 4+4+10+4+20+1+10+1+4+10+4+4+10 = 82 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [82].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 4, 13)>
<1, (0, 4, 13)>
<2, (0, 4, 14)>
<3, (0, 6, 14)>
<4, (0, 1, 13)>
<5, (7, 11, 14)>
<6, (0, 3, 14)>
<9, (1, 10, 13)>
<10, (2, 4, 14)>
<11, (4, 7, 12)>
<13, (0, 1, 4)>
<14, (2, 6, 10)>
