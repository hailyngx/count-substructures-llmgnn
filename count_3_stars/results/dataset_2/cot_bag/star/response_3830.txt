Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4

The nodes that can form 3-stars are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9.
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, there are \( [20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 40 \) 3-stars in total.

Unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>.
