Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 7) (2, 8) (2, 10) (3, 0) (3, 10) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 13) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 1) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4] = [77]

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 6, 13)>
<0, (6, 9, 12)>
<0, (6, 11, 0)>
...
(There are 77 unique 3-stars in total)
