Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
From the given information, we construct the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges as described by the edge list. 

The node degrees are as follows: 
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 5
- Node 2 has degree 7
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 4

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and find the total number of 3-stars. 

- Node 1, 2, and 5 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can also form 10 3-stars.
- Node 0, 3, 6, and 9 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4(10) + 4(4) = 56 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 2)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 2, 7)>
<1, (6, 2, 7)>
<1, (7, 5, 9)>
<1, (7, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 9, 2)>
