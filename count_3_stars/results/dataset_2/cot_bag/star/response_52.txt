Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 12) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 4) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 7) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 7) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
1: (10, 8, 7)
2: None
3: (6, 11, 8, 14, 12)
4: (5, 10, 12, 13)
5: (9, 6, 4, 7, 14)
6: (5, 9, 3, 0)
7: (5, 0, 14, 13, 1)
8: (10, 14, 12, 3, 1)
9: (5, 6, 11, 13)
10: (11, 8, 1, 4, 13)
11: (9, 10, 3, 14)
12: (8, 3, 4)
13: (9, 10, 0, 7, 4)
14: (5, 11, 8, 3, 7)

Using the formula mentioned earlier, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: 2 3-stars
Node 3: 3 3-stars
Node 4: 1 3-star
Node 5: 1 3-star
Node 6: 1 3-star
Node 7: 1 3-star
Node 8: 3 3-stars
Node 9: 1 3-star
Node 10: 1 3-star
Node 11: 1 3-star
Node 12: 1 3-star
Node 13: 1 3-star
Node 14: 2 3-stars

Summing these up: 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of 18 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting this number inside brackets: [18]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (10, 8, 7)>, <3, (6, 11, 8)>, <4, (5, 10, 12)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <6, (5, 9, 3)>, <7, (5, 0, 14)>, <8, (10, 14, 3)>, <14, (5, 11, 8)>
