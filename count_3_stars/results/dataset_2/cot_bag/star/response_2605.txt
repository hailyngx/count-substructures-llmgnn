Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes have the following degrees:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 6
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 5
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 7 has degree 6
- Node 8 has degree 6
- Node 9 has degree 7

So, we can consider nodes 2, 7, 8, and 9 for creating 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 20 + 20 + 35 = 95 \).

So, the final answer is [95] and the unique 3-stars are:
