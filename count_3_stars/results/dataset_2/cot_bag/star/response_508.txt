Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (0, 9) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 5) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-stars: <1, (3, 8, 12)>, <1, (3, 8, 4)>, <1, (3, 12, 4)>, <1, (8, 12, 4)>, <1, (8, 3, 4)>, <1, (8, 3, 11)>, <1, (8, 4, 11)>, <1, (8, 7, 11)>, <1, (3, 1, 11)>, <1, (4, 1, 12)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-stars: <3, (1, 8, 4)>, <3, (1, 10, 13)>, <3, (8, 4, 1)>, <3, (8, 4, 12)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-stars: <4, (1, 12, 7)>, <4, (1, 12, 9)>, <4, (8, 1, 3)>, <4, (8, 1, 12)>, <4, (8, 7, 12)>, <4, (8, 7, 11)>, <4, (8, 3, 1)>, <4, (8, 3, 10)>, <4, (8, 3, 13)>, <4, (8, 3, 11)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-stars: <5, (6, 14, 2)>, <5, (6, 14, 9)>, <5, (6, 14, 13)>, <5, (6, 2, 14)>, <5, (6, 2, 11)>, <5, (14, 6, 2)>, <5, (14, 6, 9)>, <5, (14, 2, 11)>, <5, (14, 2, 5)>, <5, (14, 9, 11)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-stars: <6, (9, 14, 7)>, <6, (9, 14, 5)>, <6, (9, 14, 13)>, <6, (9, 7, 12)>, <6, (9, 7, 11)>, <6, (14, 9, 7)>, <6, (14, 9, 5)>, <6, (14, 5, 11)>, <6, (14, 5, 2)>, <6, (14, 13, 11)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-stars: <7, (12, 1, 4)>, <7, (12, 1, 9)>, <7, (12, 4, 1)>, <7, (12, 4, 8)>, <7, (12, 4, 11)>, <7, (11, 8, 3)>, <7, (11, 8, 4)>, <7, (11, 8, 1)>, <7, (11, 5, 6)>, <7, (11, 5, 14)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-stars: <8, (1, 4, 12)>, <8, (3, 1, 4)>, <8, (3, 1, 11)>, <8, (4, 1, 12)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-stars: <9, (6, 14, 2)>, <9, (6, 14, 13)>, <9, (6, 2, 5)>, <9, (6, 2, 11)>, <9, (6, 2, 14)>, <9, (14, 6, 2)>, <9, (14, 6, 5)>, <9, (14, 5, 11)>, <9, (14, 5, 2)>, <9, (14, 13, 11)>

- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 3-stars: <10, (9, 13, 3)>

- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-stars: <11, (9, 1, 13)>, <11, (9, 1, 12)>, <11, (9, 1, 3)>, <11, (9, 13, 3)>, <11, (9, 13, 10)>, <11, (9, 13, 11)>, <11, (9, 3, 1)>, <11, (5, 6, 14)>, <11, (5, 14, 2)>, <11, (5, 14, 13)>

- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-stars: <12, (1, 7, 4)>, <12, (1, 7, 11)>, <12, (4, 1, 8)>, <12, (4, 8, 7)>

Now sum up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 83.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [83].
