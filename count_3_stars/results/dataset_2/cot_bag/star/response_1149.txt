Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look at each node that has three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of.

Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 5, 6, 3, 2, 4. It can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with these neighbors.
Node 3 has 7 neighbors: 5, 9, 1, 7, 2, 8, 4. It can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars with these neighbors.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 5, 1, 8, 0. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with these neighbors.
Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 5, 6, 3, 4, 2, 7. It can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with these neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( 10 + 35 + 4 + 20 = 69 \).

Putting this final number inside brackets, we get: [69].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<1, (6, 2, 4)>
<1, (3, 2, 4)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 3)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<1, (5, 4, 3)>
<3, (5, 8, 2)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 1, 8)>
<3, (5, 1, 2)>
<3, (4, 8, 5)>
<3, (4, 1, 8)>
<3, (4, 1, 2)>
<3, (8, 7, 5)>
<3, (8, 2, 7)>
<3, (8, 2, 5)>
<8, (5, 1, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 2)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
