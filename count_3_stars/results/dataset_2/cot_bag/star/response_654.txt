Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 6, 14
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 8, 10, 12, 14
- Node 4: 0, 2, 9, 10, 13
- Node 5: 0, 11, 12
- Node 6: 1, 10, 12
- Node 7: 0, 8, 12
- Node 8: 3, 7, 9, 13
- Node 9: 4, 8, 11, 12, 14
- Node 10: 3, 4, 6, 11, 14
- Node 11: 5, 9, 10, 14
- Node 12: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13
- Node 13: 4, 8, 12, 14
- Node 14: 1, 3, 9, 10, 11, 13

Let's now calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 12: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 14: [inom{6}{3}] = 20

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 78

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [78].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (8, 10, 14)>
- <4, (0, 9, 10)>
- <9, (4, 11, 14)>
- <10, (4, 6, 14)>
- <12, (3, 6, 9)>
- <14, (1, 11, 13)>
