- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (21, 28, 19)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (11, 23, 7)>
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star: <19, (2, 1, 19)>
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star: <27, (22, 24, 27)>
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star: <25, (10, 12, 13)>

To find the total number of 3-stars, count the unique 3-stars listed above and add the 3-stars formed by nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.   
In this case, all the 3-stars have been found, and there are no additional 3-stars formed by nodes with 3 neighbors.  
So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 22, which we can represent as [22].
