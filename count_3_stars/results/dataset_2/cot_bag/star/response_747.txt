Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 11) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 14) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 6) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
There are three nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 5, 4, and 2. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

For node 5, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 4, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 2, \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 = 34.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 13, 12)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
