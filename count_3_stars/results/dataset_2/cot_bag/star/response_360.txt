Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 20) (3, 25) (3, 12) (3, 22) (3, 18) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 13) (25, 24) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 16) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 1) (28, 12) (28, 23) (29, 9) (29, 28) (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 1) (7, 10) (7, 0) (13, 25) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 24) (14, 8) (14, 1) (26, 10) (26, 21) (19, 22) (19, 2) (19, 23) (22, 3) (22, 19) (22, 27) (18, 3) (18, 8) (24, 25) (24, 13) (1, 25) (1, 28) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 4) (2, 15) (4, 2) (4, 23) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 13) (20, 9) (20, 27) (8, 14) (8, 18) (8, 27) (21, 0) (21, 26) (21, 27) (21, 23) (27, 22) (27, 20) (27, 8) (27, 21) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 23) (23, 28) (23, 19) (23, 4) (23, 21) (23, 15) (12, 3) (12, 28) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 1, 3, 7, 10, 13, 16, 22, 25, 27, and 28. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (since it has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the number of 3-stars from each node that has three or more neighbors:
\( 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 39 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 39. 

Therefore, the final answer is: [39]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<{1, (0, 14, 28)}>
<{3, (18, 22, 27)}>
<{10, (7, 17, 26)}>
<{13, (16, 24, 25)}>
<{16, (5, 13, 17)}>
<{22, (3, 19, 27)}>
<{25, (1, 13, 24)}>
<{27, (8, 21, 22)}>
<{28, (1, 11, 23)}>
