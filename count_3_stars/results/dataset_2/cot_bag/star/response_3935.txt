Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 4) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 12) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 1) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 7) (1, 10) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 6, 8, 13, and 14.

For node 6: Since it has 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.  
For node 8: There are also 4 possible 3-stars formed around node 8.  
For node 13: There are 5 possible 3-stars formed around node 13.  
For node 14: There are 5 possible 3-stars around node 14.  

Adding these up will give the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 18 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 18, delineated as [18].

The unique 3-star configurations are:  
<6, (5, 10, 14)>  
<6, (4, 9, 14)>  
<8, (5, 12, 13)>  
<8, (1, 7, 9)>  
<13, (4, 10, 14)>  
<14, (2, 12, 13)>
