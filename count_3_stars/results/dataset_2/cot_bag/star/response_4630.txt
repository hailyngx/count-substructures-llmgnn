Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 1) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 10) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 12) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 12) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 6, 2, 0, 14, and 3. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

1. Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3. Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
4. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
7. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 38 \)

So, there are [38] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (9, 11, 14)>
<9, (4, 11, 13)>
<4, (2, 8, 11)>
<6, (5, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 11)>
<2, (4, 11, 13)>
<14, (0, 10, 14)>
<3, (6, 7, 12)>
<3, (7, 12, 13)>
