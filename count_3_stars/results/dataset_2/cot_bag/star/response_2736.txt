Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 18) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 16) (17, 9) (17, 5) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 12) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 2) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 16) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 0) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (1, 10) (1, 16) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 9) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (19, 11) (19, 7) (13, 11) (13, 6) (16, 14) (16, 6) (16, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 18. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars formed with these nodes: 
\( 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 31 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [31].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (5, 15, 10)>
<5, (2, 3, 17)>
<6, (11, 13, 16)>
<7, (0, 12, 19)>
<9, (8, 15, 17)>
<10, (1, 3, 8)>
<11, (0, 6, 13)>
<14, (0, 6, 16)>
<15, (9, 18, 3)>
<16, (1, 6, 14)>
<18, (7, 12, 0)>
