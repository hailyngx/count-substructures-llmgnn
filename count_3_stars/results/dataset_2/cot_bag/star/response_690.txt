Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 10) (26, 14) (5, 9) (5, 28) (5, 20) (14, 26) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 15) (17, 29) (17, 25) (17, 6) (17, 21) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 8) (21, 17) (21, 7) (21, 23) (7, 21) (7, 19) (7, 28) (7, 23) (7, 13) (29, 17) (29, 8) (29, 3) (19, 7) (19, 25) (10, 26) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 28) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 18) (25, 17) (25, 1) (25, 19) (27, 9) (3, 29) (3, 28) (28, 5) (28, 7) (28, 10) (28, 3) (28, 13) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 4) (2, 20) (12, 10) (12, 0) (6, 17) (6, 0) (16, 24) (16, 13) (16, 23) (24, 16) (24, 4) (13, 7) (13, 28) (13, 16) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 6) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 8) (8, 1) (8, 29) (8, 18) (4, 11) (4, 24) (4, 20) (23, 1) (23, 21) (23, 7) (23, 16) (20, 5) (20, 2) (20, 4) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 9 and node 28. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 26, 5, and 11.
- There is 1 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (26, 5, 11)>.

For node 28:
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 3, and 13.
- There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 28 as the center:
  - <28, (5, 7, 3)>
  - <28, (5, 7, 13)>
  - <28, (5, 3, 13)>
  - <28, (7, 3, 13)>.

In total, there are [1 + 4] = 5 3-stars in the graph.
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
