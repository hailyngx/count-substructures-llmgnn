Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.

For node 0:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 0)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>

For node 1:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 1)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>

For node 4:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 8, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>

For node 6:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>

<6, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 7:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 1)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 1)>
<7, (0, 8, 1)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 1)>
<7, (3, 8, 1)>
<7, (5, 8, 1)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>

<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 5)>
<7, (1, 9, 5)>
<7, (1, 9, 8)>

<7, (8, 5, 9)>

For node 8:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>

For node 9:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (0, 7, 3)>
<9, (0, 8, 3)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (6, 8, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>


Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [66].
