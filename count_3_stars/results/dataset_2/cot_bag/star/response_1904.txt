Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 10) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 11) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 14) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) 

Response:
From the given information, we can construct the following graph with nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 14), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 13), (9, 12), (1, 3), (1, 11), (1, 10), (1, 12), (1, 8), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (8, 13), (8, 10), (8, 7), (13, 10), (10, 11), (6, 12), (6, 4), (6, 0), (0, 14), (14, 7)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph.

For each node with three or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars it forms:

Node 0: 3 neighbors - No 3-stars
Node 1: 5 neighbors - 1 3-star
Node 2: 3 neighbors - No 3-stars
Node 3: 5 neighbors - 1 3-star
Node 4: 4 neighbors - 1 3-star
Node 5: 5 neighbors - 1 3-star
Node 6: 3 neighbors - No 3-stars
Node 7: 3 neighbors - No 3-stars
Node 8: 4 neighbors - 1 3-star
Node 9: 5 neighbors - 1 3-star
Node 10: 4 neighbors - 1 3-star
Node 11: 3 neighbors - No 3-stars
Node 12: 3 neighbors - No 3-stars
Node 13: 3 neighbors - No 3-stars
Node 14: 4 neighbors - 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 8, 12)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (3, 6, 14)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <14, (0, 4, 5)>
