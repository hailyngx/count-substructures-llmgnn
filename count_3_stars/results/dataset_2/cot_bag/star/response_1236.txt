Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

For node 0: 
- It has neighbors 1, 3, 7. 
- Hence, there are [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (1, 3, 7)>.

For node 1:
- It has neighbors 0, 2, 3, 8, 9. 
- There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 1 as the center: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>.

Similarly, we can calculate for the rest of the nodes.

For node 2: 
- It has neighbors 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 
- There are [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars with node 2 as the center.

For node 3: 
- It has neighbors 0, 1, 4, 7, 8. 
- There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 3 as the center.

For node 4: 
- It has neighbors 3, 5. 
- Hence, there is [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-star with node 4 as the center.

For node 5: 
- It has neighbors 2, 4, 7, 9. 
- There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>.

For node 7: 
- It has neighbors 0, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
- There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 7 as the center.

For node 8: 
- It has neighbors 1, 2, 3, 7. 
- There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 8 as the center: <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>.

For node 9: 
- It has neighbors 1, 2, 5, 6. 
- There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>.

Summing up the 3-stars for each node, we have a total of [1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [53]. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [53], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>.
