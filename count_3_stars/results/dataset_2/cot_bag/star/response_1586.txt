Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are two nodes with exactly three neighbors: node 9 and node 6.

For node 9, we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars.
<9, (6, 2, 3)>  
<9, (6, 2, 0)>  
<9, (6, 3, 0)>  
<9, (2, 3, 0)>  

For node 6, we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) unique 3-stars.
<6, (9, 1, 3)>
<6, (9, 1, 4)>
<6, (9, 3, 4)>
<6, (9, 1, 8)>
<6, (9, 3, 8)>
<6, (9, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 10 = 14\)

So, the final answer is [14].
