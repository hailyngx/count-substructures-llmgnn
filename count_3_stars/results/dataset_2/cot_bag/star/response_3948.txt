Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 10) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, and 14. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars  
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars  
For node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars  
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  

Adding these up: 
\( 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 86 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 86, which we represent as [86].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 6, 12)>, <1, (2, 6, 14)>, <1, (3, 6, 12)>, <1, (3, 6, 14)>, <1, (3, 10, 12)>, <1, (3, 10, 6)>, <1, (6, 10, 12)>, <1, (10, 12, 4)>, <3, (5, 8, 13)>, <3, (6, 10, 12)>, <3, (6, 10, 14)>, <3, (10, 12, 4)>, <5, (0, 11, 9)>, <6, (2, 9, 10)>, <10, (4, 6, 12)>
