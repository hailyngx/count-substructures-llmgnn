Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (7, 5), (7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 8), (6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 2), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 2), (8, 3), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 0), (0, 9), (0, 7), (0, 2), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 2), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 2)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph: 

For Node 5: 1 3-star
For Node 9: 1 3-star
For Node 4: 0 3-stars
For Node 7: 1 3-star
For Node 6: 1 3-star
For Node 8: 1 3-star
For Node 2: 1 3-star
For Node 0: 0 3-stars
For Node 1: 1 3-star
For Node 3: 1 3-star

Summing these up, we get a total of [8] 3-stars.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>
<7, (5, 0, 8)>
<6, (9, 4, 2)>
<8, (5, 7, 3)>
<2, (8, 1, 3)>
<1, (9, 4, 6)>
<3, (5, 9, 8)>
