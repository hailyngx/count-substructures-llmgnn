Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 9) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 12) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 5) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (3, 0) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 0) (10, 13) (10, 7) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
Considering the given graph, we can list the nodes that have three or more neighbors along with their neighbors to identify the 3-stars. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 -> Neighbors: 8, 6, 5, 13
- Node 4 -> Neighbors: 13, 9, 0
- Node 5 -> Neighbors: 1, 11, 14, 7, 2
- Node 7 -> Neighbors: 6, 11, 14, 10, 5, 2
- Node 8 -> Neighbors: 9, 13, 0, 12, 1
- Node 9 -> Neighbors: 8, 13, 4, 12
- Node 11 -> Neighbors: 13, 14, 7, 5, 12
- Node 12 -> Neighbors: 8, 9, 6, 11, 14
- Node 13 -> Neighbors: 4, 11, 1, 10, 9, 8
- Node 14 -> Neighbors: 11, 7, 12, 2, 5

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <1, (8, 6, 5)>, <1, (8, 6, 13)>, <1, (8, 5, 13)>, <1, (6, 5, 13)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <4, (13, 9, 0)>

  <5, (1, 11, 14)>, <5, (1, 11, 7)>, <5, (1, 11, 2)>, <5, (1, 11, 5)>, <5, (1, 14, 7)>, <5, (1, 14, 2)>, <5, (1, 14, 5)>, <5, (1, 7, 2)>, <5, (1, 7, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 5)>

- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <12, (8, 9, 6)>, <12, (8, 9, 11)>, <12, (8, 6, 11)>, <12, (9, 6, 11)>, <12, (8, 9, 14)>, <12, (9, 11, 14)>, <12, (8, 6, 14)>, <12, (6, 11, 14)>, <12, (9, 14, 6)>, <12, (11, 14, 6)>

- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  <13, (4, 11, 14)>, <13, (4, 11, 7)>, <13, (4, 11, 10)>, <13, (4, 14, 7)>, <13, (4, 14, 10)>, <13, (4, 7, 10)>, <13, (11, 14, 7)>, <13, (11, 14, 10)>, <13, (11, 7, 10)>, <13, (14, 7, 10)>, <13, (4, 9, 12)>, <13, (4, 9, 8)>, <13, (9, 12, 8)>, <13, (11, 14, 12)>, <13, (11, 14, 8)>, <13, (14, 12, 8)>, <13, (9, 8, 12)>, <13, (14, 12, 9)>, <13, (11, 8, 12)>, <13, (14, 9, 8)>

- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [85].
