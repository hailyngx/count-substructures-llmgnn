Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 14) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) 

Response:
There are 18 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node:
\[ 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 = 74 \]

Therefore, there are a total of 74 three-star subgraphs in this graph, denoted by  [74]. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (6, 9, 10)>
<1, (14, 13, 8)>
<2, (12, 3, 8)>
<3, (12, 2, 8)>
<4, (9, 6, 0)>
<5, (6, 8, 14)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (11, 13, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 14)>
<9, (10, 4, 6)>
<10, (0, 9, 6)>
<11, (9, 14, 7)>
<12, (2, 8, 3)>
<13, (1, 14, 7)>
<14, (5, 9, 10)>
