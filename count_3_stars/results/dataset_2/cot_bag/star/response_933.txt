Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up these values: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 50 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 0)>

<0, (4, 1, 7)>
