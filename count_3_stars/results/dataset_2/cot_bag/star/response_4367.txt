Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 7) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 7) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 17) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 19) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (15, 7) (15, 14) (19, 12) (0, 11) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 14) (14, 10) (14, 15) (14, 3) (16, 18) (16, 1) (17, 4) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 13, 10, 11, 2, 18, 4, 12, 6, 1, 0, 14, 16, 7.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
2. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
3. Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
4. Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
5. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
6. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
7. Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
8. Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
9. Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
10. Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
11. Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
12. Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
13. Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
14. Node 16 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
15. Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 10 = 42

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [42].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 13)>, <13, (7, 9, 12)>, <10, (7, 13, 14)>, <11, (0, 4, 10)>, <2, (6, 9, 18)>, <18, (4, 7, 16)>, <4, (6, 11, 12)>, <12, (4, 8, 13)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 6, 16)>, <7, (5, 10, 13)>.
