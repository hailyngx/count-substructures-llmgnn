Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 3) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 10) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 8, 5, 3
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 4, 8, 10
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 13, 14, 10
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 8, 1, 11
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 5, 3, 11
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get: 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 64

Therefore, there are a total of [64] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 8, 10)>, <2, (10, 13, 14)>, <3, (0, 5, 12)>, <3, (5, 11, 12)>, <3, (6, 11, 13)>, <3, (7, 10, 11)>, <3, (7, 11, 12)>, <3, (7, 11, 14)>, <4, (1, 8, 11)>, <4, (1, 10, 14)>, <6, (9, 11, 13)>, <7, (8, 9, 10)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 10, 11)>, <8, (4, 7, 11)>, <8, (4, 7, 14)>, <9, (10, 13, 14)>
