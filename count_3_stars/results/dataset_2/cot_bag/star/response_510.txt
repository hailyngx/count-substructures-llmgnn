Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 14) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 10) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 12) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 11) (18, 9) (18, 17) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 12) (11, 17) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 19) (10, 16) (15, 16) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 15) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 19) 

Response:
From the given information, we construct the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges as described by the edge list.

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 7, 16
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 10, 13, 19
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 13, 17
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 8
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 3, 13
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 1, 7, 8, 14
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 9, 10, 17
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 16, 19
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 12, 13
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 11, 18
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 6, 12, 18
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 9, 14, 19
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 7, 10, 12, 14

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 7 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 3 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 13 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 10 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 9 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 12 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 19 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding all the contributions together, we get a total of 37 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [37].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (1, 7, 16)>
<7, (0, 10, 19)>
<1, (3, 13, 17)>
<3, (5, 8, 1)>
<13, (7, 8, 14)>
<6, (9, 10, 17)>
<10, (2, 16, 19)>
<14, (0, 12, 5)>
<17, (1, 6, 18)>
<9, (6, 12, 18)>
<12, (9, 14, 19)>
<19, (7, 10, 14)>
