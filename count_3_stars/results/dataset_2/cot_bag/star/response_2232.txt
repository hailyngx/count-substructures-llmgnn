Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 15) (16, 3) (16, 9) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 4) (10, 12) (10, 9) (10, 5) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 15) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 15) (18, 17) (18, 13) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 5) (19, 14) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 1) (2, 14) (2, 9) (12, 14) (12, 10) (3, 16) (3, 0) (6, 17) (6, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 1) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 7) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 19) (1, 5) (1, 9) (13, 18) (13, 6) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 19
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 14
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 16
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 15, 17, 19
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8, 10, 11, 15
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 13, 17
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 15
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 15, 19
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 16
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 10, 12
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 11, 15
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 10, 14
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 6, 18
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 2, 12, 14, 17, 19
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 15
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 3, 9
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 14, 17
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 13, 17
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 8, 14

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:

- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (1, 10, 11)>
<9, (1, 10, 11)>
<14, (2, 12, 17)>
<17, (6, 14, 18)>
<19, (1, 4, 8)>
