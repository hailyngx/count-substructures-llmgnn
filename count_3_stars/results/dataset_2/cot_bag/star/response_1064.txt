Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 15) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 14) (19, 4) (19, 10) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 7) (4, 19) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 6) (1, 2) (6, 12) (6, 14) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 16) (7, 2) (7, 17) (7, 9) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 16) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 11) (15, 8) (18, 14) (18, 10) (10, 19) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 18) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18.
We will calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes participate in.

For node 0:
  - Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
  - Number of 3-stars formed: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
For node 4:
  - Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
  - Number of 3-stars formed: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
For node 5:
  - Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
  - Number of 3-stars formed: 1
  
For node 9:
  - Node 9 has 5 neighbors.
  - Number of 3-stars formed: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
For node 10:
  - Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
  - Number of 3-stars formed: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
For node 12:
  - Node 12 has 4 neighbors.
  - Number of 3-stars formed: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
For node 13:
  - Node 13 has 5 neighbors.
  - Number of 3-stars formed: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
For node 14:
  - Node 14 has 5 neighbors.
  - Number of 3-stars formed: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
For node 17:
  - Node 17 has 3 neighbors.
  - Number of 3-stars formed: 1
  
For node 18:
  - Node 18 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
  
Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 44 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [44].
