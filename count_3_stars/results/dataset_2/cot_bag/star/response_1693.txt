Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 29) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 20) (9, 5) (18, 22) (18, 7) (23, 13) (23, 0) (24, 6) (24, 8) (24, 20) (4, 13) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 24) (8, 4) (8, 29) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 19) (21, 17) (28, 21) (28, 3) (28, 1) (28, 20) (1, 28) (1, 17) (1, 25) (17, 21) (17, 1) (17, 2) (17, 7) (26, 11) (26, 16) (19, 5) (19, 21) (19, 2) (10, 13) (10, 21) (10, 14) (3, 13) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 24) (6, 4) (12, 16) (12, 15) (16, 26) (16, 12) (16, 27) (16, 20) (11, 26) (11, 14) (11, 27) (11, 29) (14, 10) (14, 11) (0, 23) (0, 3) (0, 25) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 3) (7, 18) (7, 17) (7, 15) (15, 12) (15, 7) (25, 1) (25, 0) (27, 21) (27, 16) (27, 11) (20, 5) (20, 24) (20, 28) (20, 16) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 11) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 19: degree 3
- Node 20: degree 4
- Node 21: degree 5
- Node 22: degree 3
- Node 23: degree 2
- Node 24: degree 3
- Node 25: degree 2
- Node 26: degree 2
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 28: degree 4
- Node 29: degree 3

Now we can determine the number of 3-stars formed with each node:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 36

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars present in the graph are:
<3, (0, 23, 25)>
<13, (4, 10, 23)>
<16, (12, 20, 27)>
<17, (1, 2, 7)>
<20, (4, 16, 24)>
<21, (1, 19, 28)>
