Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 14) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (12, 3) (12, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 0) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 14) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 8, 10, 12, 11}
- Node 1: {9, 4, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 5}
- Node 3: {6, 11, 14, 12}
- Node 4: {7, 13, 0, 10, 1, 2}
- Node 5: {7, 13, 2, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {10, 3, 11}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 0, 14}
- Node 9: {11, 10, 1}
- Node 10: {6, 9, 4, 13, 5, 0}
- Node 11: {9, 6, 3, 0}
- Node 12: {3, 0}
- Node 13: {4, 5, 1, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {8, 13, 1, 3, 5}

Now, let's look at the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form.
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 47.
Therefore, the final result is [47].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 10, 13)>
<1, (9, 13, 14)>
<3, (6, 11, 14)>
<4, (7, 10, 13)>
<5, (7, 10, 13)>
<10, (4, 5, 13)>
<10, (4, 13, 5)>
<14, (8, 13, 1)>
