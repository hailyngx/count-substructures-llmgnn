Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding all these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 27 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27].
