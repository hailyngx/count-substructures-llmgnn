Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 0) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 12) 

Response:
We start by identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \(10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 80\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [80].

Now, we list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 8, 12)>
<0, (5, 12, 1)>
<0, (5, 13, 1)>
<0, (8, 12, 10)>
<0, (8, 14, 5)>
<1, (5, 12, 0)>
<1, (5, 12, 1)>
<1, (5, 13, 0)>
<1, (5, 13, 12)>
<2, (0, 8, 12)>
<2, (7, 11, 13)>
<2, (13, 7, 11)>
<3, (4, 11, 6)>
<3, (5, 11, 13)>
<4, (3, 6, 11)>
<5, (0, 8, 14)>
<6, (1, 9, 13)>
<11, (3, 4, 6)>
<12, (0, 8, 10)>
