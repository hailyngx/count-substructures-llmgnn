Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, and the edges are as provided. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 9 neighbors

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{9}{3} = 84 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \(4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 84 = 122\) 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <8, (9, 0, 7)>
- <9, (8, 7, 2)>
- <9, (8, 7, 3)>
- <9, (8, 7, 4)>
- <9, (8, 7, 5)>
- <9, (8, 7, 6)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [122].
