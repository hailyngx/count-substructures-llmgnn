Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 6 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 6 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 52 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
