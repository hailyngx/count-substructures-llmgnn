Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:  
- Node 0: 5, 3, 6, 2, 7  
- Node 1: 5, 3, 6, 8  
- Node 2: 9, 8, 0  
- Node 3: 9, 1, 7, 0, 4  
- Node 4: 3, 8  
- Node 5: 6, 1, 0, 7  
- Node 6: 5, 1, 7, 0  
- Node 7: 5, 3, 8, 6, 0  
- Node 8: 9, 1, 4, 8, 2, 7  
- Node 9: 8, 2, 3  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with more than 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 44

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <0, (5, 6, 1)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <3, (4, 0, 7)>
- <3, (4, 8, 7)>
- <8, (9, 2, 7)>
- <8, (9, 1, 7)>
- <8, (9, 4, 7)>
- <8, (2, 9, 7)>
