Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (12, 6) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 3) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are 0, 4, 7, 8, 11, and 13.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - <0, (3, 11, 12)>
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
  - <4, (2, 7, 10)>, <4, (7, 8, 10)>, <4, (0, 2, 10)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 10)>
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - <7, (1, 11, 13)>, <7, (1, 2, 13)>
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - <8, (3, 10, 13)>, <8, (3, 13, 14)>
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - <11, (0, 3, 14)>, <11, (3, 7, 14)>
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
  - <13, (3, 7, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1] = 55.
