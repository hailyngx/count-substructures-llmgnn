Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors: Node 0, node 1, node 2, node 4, node 5, node 6, and node 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 6 neighbors: nodes 6, 1, 3, 4, 8, and 7, therefore [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars.

2. Node 1 has 5 neighbors: nodes 5, 3, 2, 4, and 0, therefore [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.

3. Node 2 has 5 neighbors: nodes 5, 9, 1, 8, and 0, therefore [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.

4. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: nodes 5, 9, 1, 0, and 8, therefore [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.

5. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: nodes 9, 2, 8, 1, and 4, therefore [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.

6. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: nodes 9, 3, 8, and 0, therefore [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.

7. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: nodes 5, 6, 2, and 0, therefore [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.

Adding the total number of 3-stars for each node, we get a total of 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 68 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68] and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>.
