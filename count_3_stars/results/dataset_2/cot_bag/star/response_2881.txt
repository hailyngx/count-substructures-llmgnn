Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 6, 8}

Now we determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
