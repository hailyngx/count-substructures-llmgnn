Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 19) (16, 17) (16, 6) (14, 9) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (18, 19) (5, 14) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (15, 1) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 15) (1, 13) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 3) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 12) (7, 17) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (6, 16) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
There are three nodes that have three or more neighbors, namely nodes 1, 4, and 5. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1, it has 4 neighbors: 11, 10, 15, and 13. So the number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 4, it has 5 neighbors: 9, 0, 10, 6, and 9. So the number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 5, it has 5 neighbors: 14, 17, 19, 12, and 19. So the number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 10 + 10] = [24] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (11, 10, 15)>
<4, (9, 0, 10)>
<4, (9, 0, 6)>
<4, (9, 10, 6)>
<4, (0, 10, 6)>
<5, (14, 17, 19)>
<5, (14, 17, 12)>
<5, (14, 19, 12)>
<5, (17, 19, 12)>
<5, (17, 19, 8)>
