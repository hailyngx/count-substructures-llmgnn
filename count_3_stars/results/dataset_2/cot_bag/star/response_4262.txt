Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 12) (18, 17) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 9) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 15) (0, 12) (0, 9) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 1) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 6) (15, 11) (15, 5) (16, 18) (16, 3) (8, 6) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 8) (6, 10) (17, 18) (17, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 9) (14, 12) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 17) (9, 1) (2, 7) (2, 19) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (10, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 18, 3, 11, 1, 9, 7, 19, 15, 16, 6, 12.

- Node 4: forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 = \textbf{44} \)

Thus, 44 unique 3-stars are found in the graph:
<4, (18, 1, 3)>, <18, (4, 12, 6)>, <3, (4, 11, 9)>, <11, (3, 1, 15)>, <1, (4, 11, 7)>, <9, (4, 3, 17)>, <7, (11, 1, 19)>, <19, (7, 5, 2)>, <16, (18, 3, 16)>, <6, (18, 19, 8)>, <12, (18, 0, 14)>
