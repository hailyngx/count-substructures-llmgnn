Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 4) (7, 28) (18, 4) (18, 22) (18, 28) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 10) (22, 8) (20, 0) (20, 21) (20, 14) (25, 8) (25, 15) (25, 21) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 24) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 27) (0, 20) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 24) (28, 7) (28, 18) (28, 3) (28, 13) (29, 1) (29, 26) (29, 15) (14, 20) (14, 0) (14, 13) (1, 29) (1, 26) (26, 29) (26, 1) (26, 16) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 19) (17, 12) (17, 21) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 10) (5, 27) (11, 19) (23, 16) (23, 10) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 13) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 23) (16, 24) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 16) (19, 2) (19, 11) (13, 28) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 21) (21, 20) (21, 25) (21, 17) (21, 5) (21, 13) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 9) (27, 5) (8, 18) (8, 22) (8, 25) (10, 22) (10, 5) (10, 23) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are: 0, 2, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 62.

Putting this inside brackets, we have: [62].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 3, 14)>, <0, (2, 5, 12)>, <0, (2, 13, 21)>, <0, (2, 14, 20)>, <0, (3, 20, 24)>, <2, (0, 9, 27)>, <5, (6, 12, 17)>, <5, (6, 21, 25)>, <5, (10, 12, 13)>, <5, (10, 21, 27)>, <8, (18, 22, 25)>, <9, (5, 6, 21)>, <13, (12, 14, 21)>, <14, (0, 1, 29)>, <16, (10, 22, 23)>, <16, (10, 22, 24)>.

These are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph.
