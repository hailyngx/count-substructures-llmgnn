Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 10) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (12, 1) (12, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 2) 

Response:
Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

\( inom{15}{3} = 455 \)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. The node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 13, which forms one 3-star: <4, (6, 7, 13)>
2. The node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 13, which forms one 3-star: <1, (9, 8, 13)>
3. The node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 1, which forms one 3-star: <3, (6, 7, 1)>
4. The node 0 is connected to nodes 8, 3, 14, which forms one 3-star: <0, (8, 3, 14)>
5. The node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 13, which forms one 3-star: <14, (9, 7, 13)>
6. The node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8, which forms one 3-star: <5, (4, 7, 8)>
7. The node 11 is connected to nodes 6, 5, 12, which forms one 3-star: <11, (6, 5, 12)>
8. The node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 14, 11, which forms one 3-star: <2, (4, 14, 11)>

Adding them up, there are 8 unique 3-stars found in this graph. Putting this final count inside brackets gives us the answer:

[8]
