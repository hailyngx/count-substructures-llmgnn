Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 13) (21, 16) (21, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 29) (7, 19) (7, 5) (20, 18) (20, 23) (20, 24) (25, 27) (25, 17) (25, 6) (12, 27) (12, 26) (12, 23) (27, 25) (27, 12) (27, 11) (0, 11) (0, 23) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 9) (17, 15) (29, 7) (29, 5) (29, 15) (16, 21) (16, 28) (16, 9) (28, 16) (28, 22) (28, 24) (28, 10) (18, 20) (26, 12) (26, 14) (23, 20) (23, 12) (23, 0) (23, 2) (14, 26) (14, 6) (6, 4) (6, 25) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 13) (8, 24) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 3) (24, 20) (24, 28) (24, 8) (2, 23) (2, 3) (19, 7) (19, 13) (9, 21) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 16) (10, 28) (10, 6) (10, 8) (11, 27) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 22) (22, 28) (22, 11) (22, 15) (5, 7) (5, 29) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 19) (13, 3) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 13) (15, 17) (15, 29) (15, 22) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 neighbors each: 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4 can form 3-stars with nodes 7, 6, and 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6 can form 3-stars with nodes 4, 25, and 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7 can form 3-stars with nodes 4, 29, and 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9 can form 3-stars with nodes 21, 4, and 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11 can form 3-stars with nodes 27, 0, and 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13 can form 3-stars with nodes 1, 6, and 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15 can form 3-stars with nodes 17, 29, and 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 7. 
These 3-stars are: 
<4, 7, 9>, 
<6, 4, 25>, 
<7, 4, 29>, 
<9, 21, 16>, 
<11, 27, 0>, 
<13, 1, 19>, 
<15, 17, 29>.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
