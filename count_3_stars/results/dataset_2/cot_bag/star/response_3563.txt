Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
Node 0: 1, 5, 7
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
Node 3: 1, 2
Node 4: 1, 6, 8, 9, 5
Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 4
Node 6: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 0, 2, 6
Node 8: 4, 6, 9
Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 55

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [55].

Unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>
