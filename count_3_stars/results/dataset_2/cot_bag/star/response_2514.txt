Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 9) (7, 13) (14, 6) (14, 16) (17, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 16) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 6) (19, 12) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 9) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 5) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 9) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 5) (5, 16) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 19) (15, 7) (15, 18) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 0) (9, 12) (18, 0) (18, 10) (18, 15) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 16, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (<6, (4, 7, 14)>, <6, (4, 7, 19)>, <6, (14, 7, 19)>, <6, (7, 14, 19)>)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (<7, (4, 6, 14)>, <7, (4, 6, 19)>, <7, (6, 14, 19)>, <7, (4, 14, 19)>)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (<10, (4, 6, 19)>, <10, (4, 18, 0)>, <10, (4, 5, 6)>, <10, (4, 5, 16)>)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (<11, (1, 3, 2)>)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (<12, (19, 2, 9)>)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (<16, (8, 13, 5)>, <16, (8, 14, 5)>, <16, (8, 13, 14)>, <16, (13, 5, 14)>)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (<18, (0, 10, 15)>)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (<19, (2, 12, 9)>, <19, (2, 10, 6)>, <19, (12, 9, 6)>, <19, (2, 12, 6)>)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 19 \)

Therefore, there are 19 unique 3-stars in this graph: 
<6, (4, 7, 14)>, <6, (4, 7, 19)>, <6, (14, 7, 19)>, <6, (7, 14, 19)>, <7, (4, 6, 14)>, <7, (4, 6, 19)>, <7, (6, 14, 19)>, <7, (4, 14, 19)>, <10, (4, 6, 19)>, <10, (4, 18, 0)>, <10, (4, 5, 6)>, <10, (4, 5, 16)>, <11, (1, 3, 2)>, <12, (19, 2, 9)>, <16, (8, 13, 5)>, <16, (8, 14, 5)>, <16, (8, 13, 14)>, <16, (13, 5, 14)>, <18, (0, 10, 15)>, <19, (2, 12, 9)>, <19, (2, 10, 6)>, <19, (12, 9, 6)>, <19, (2, 12, 6)> 

Putting the final number inside brackets: [19]
