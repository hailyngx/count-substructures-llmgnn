Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars present.

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 9, 3, 8, 5, and 2.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 4, and 8.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 9, 3, 0, and 5.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 7, 0, 2, and 4.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 6, 9, 1, 3, and 8.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 1, 7, 8, 0, and 2.
Node 6 has 1 neighbor: 4.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 3, 8, and 5.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 5, and 0.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 4, 2, 0, and 1.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 8.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 3, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 4)>
<2, (9, 3, 0)>
<3, (1, 7, 0)>
<4, (6, 9, 1)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 2, 0)>
