Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 6, 2, 7, 9)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 6, 4, 5, 7, 9)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 6, 3, 8, 0)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 6, 5, 2)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 9, 5, 1)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 6, 4, 3, 1)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 9, 5, 1, 3, 2, 0)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 9, 8, 0, 1)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 6, 4, 1, 7, 0)
 
Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} ] = [ 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 ] = [ 48 ] \]

So, there are a total of 48 3-stars in the graph. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (6, 2, 7)>
<0, (6, 2, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<1, (6, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (6, 0, 3)>
<3, (6, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
