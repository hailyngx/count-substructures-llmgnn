Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 17) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 8) (10, 17) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 3) (11, 19) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 12) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 5) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 18) (18, 16) (18, 9) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 12) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 2) (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 14) (2, 14) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 9) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will look for nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

Looking at the list of edges provided, we can identify the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (3, 5, 9, 6)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (17, 14, 13, 12)
- Node 3: 5 neighbors (15, 11, 0, 4, 12)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (3, 7, 5, 16)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (17, 0, 13)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (7, 16, 14)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (18, 0, 12)
- Node 13: 3 neighbors (15, 1, 6)
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (1, 8, 2)
- Node 15: 3 neighbors (3, 13, 17)
- Node 16: 3 neighbors (4, 8, 18)
- Node 17: 5 neighbors (15, 10, 1, 6, 19)
- Node 19: 3 neighbors (17, 11, 5)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 26

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (17, 14, 13)>
<3, (15, 4, 12)>
<4, (3, 7, 5)>
<17, (15, 10, 19)>
