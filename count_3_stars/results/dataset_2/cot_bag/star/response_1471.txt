Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 14) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 11) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 1) (5, 11) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 12) (8, 4) (8, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (3, 4) (3, 11) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 15) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 12) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 13) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 9) (19, 2) (19, 13) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 19) (9, 17) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 14) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

So, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0, we have \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.
For node 1, we have \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star.
For node 2, we have \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star.
For node 4, we have \(C(2, 3) = 0\) 3-stars.
For node 6, we have \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star.
For node 7, we have \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.
For node 9, we have \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.
For node 10, we have \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star.
For node 11, we have \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.
For node 12, we have \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star.
For node 13, we have \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.
For node 14, we have \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star.
For node 15, we have \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star.
For node 16, we have \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star.
For node 17, we have \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.
For node 18, we have \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star.
For node 19, we have \(C(2, 3) = 0\) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 29 3-stars for the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is [29].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (8, 13, 17)>, 
<0, (10, 14, 17)>, 
<0, (13, 17, 19)>, 
<0, (8, 13, 0)>, 
<1, (10, 15, 18)>, 
<2, (11, 18, 19)>, 
<4, (3, 8, 11)>, 
<6, (12, 15, 17)>, 
<7, (9, 13, 14)>, 
<9, (7, 12, 17)>, 
<10, (0, 1, 14)>, 
<11, (2, 3, 17)>, 
<13, (0, 7, 16)>, 
<13, (7, 16, 19)>, 
<13, (9, 16, 19)>, 
<14, (7, 9, 10)>, 
<15, (1, 6, 12)>, 
<16, (7, 13, 18)>
