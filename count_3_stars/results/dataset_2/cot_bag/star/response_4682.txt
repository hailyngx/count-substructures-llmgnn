Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 9) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 12) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 10) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 60 3-stars. So, the final answer is [60].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 1, 2, 13>
- <0, 1, 10, 12>
- <0, 2, 5, 7>
- <0, 2, 8, 14>
- <0, 5, 7, 13>
- <1, 0, 4, 14>
- <1, 3, 6, 11>
- <2, 0, 4, 14>
- <2, 5, 7, 10>
- <2, 8, 6, 11>
- <3, 1, 11, 13>
- <5, 0, 4, 13>
- <5, 2, 7, 10>
- <6, 3, 9, 11>
- <7, 4, 0, 14>
