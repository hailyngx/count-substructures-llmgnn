Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 19) (7, 17) (14, 9) (14, 8) (17, 7) (17, 15) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 0) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 2) (0, 18) (0, 15) (1, 5) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 8) (16, 6) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 6) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 15) (2, 3) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 2) (15, 6) (15, 12) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 13) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 3) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 15) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 13) 

Response:
There are several nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph, namely nodes 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
So, there are 4 unique 3-stars with node 3 as the center: <3, (2, 4, 13)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 13)>, <3, (2, 5, 13)>.

For node 4:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
There are 4 unique 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (2, 18, 19)>, <4, (18, 19, 0)>, <4, (18, 0, 3)>, <4, (19, 0, 3)>.

For node 6:
Since node 6 has 5 neighbors, there are \[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
However, we must check if the same 3-star is being counted multiple times because each edge connection is bidirectional in an undirected graph. After inspection, there are no duplicates.
So, there are 10 unique 3-stars with node 6 as the center.

For the remaining nodes with 3 or more neighbors, the calculations are as follows:
For node 8: 10 unique 3-stars
For node 9: 1 unique 3-star
For node 12: 4 unique 3-stars
For node 15: 10 unique 3-stars
For node 18: 4 unique 3-stars
For node 19: 4 unique 3-stars

Summing up the 3-stars from each node, we get a total of 47 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [47].
