Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 0) (26, 9) (26, 2) (26, 8) (6, 24) (6, 17) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 28) (7, 8) (10, 21) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 20) (11, 4) (11, 13) (20, 10) (20, 1) (20, 12) (25, 27) (25, 2) (12, 4) (12, 20) (12, 27) (12, 28) (27, 25) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 3) (27, 23) (0, 9) (0, 10) (14, 4) (14, 24) (14, 21) (22, 9) (22, 28) (5, 13) (5, 19) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 2) (19, 10) (19, 5) (19, 28) (19, 1) (1, 20) (1, 19) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 23) (15, 1) (21, 10) (21, 14) (21, 13) (21, 16) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 14) (24, 2) (24, 23) (16, 21) (29, 1) (29, 8) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 2) (3, 27) (3, 17) (2, 26) (2, 25) (2, 13) (2, 24) (2, 17) (23, 27) (23, 1) (23, 24) (8, 26) (8, 7) (8, 29) (28, 7) (28, 12) (28, 22) (28, 19) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 9, 4, 6, 21, 27, and 28.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

In total, there are \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 24 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
