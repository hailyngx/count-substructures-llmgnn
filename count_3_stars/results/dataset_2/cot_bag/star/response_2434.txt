Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 11) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 14) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 6, 9, 1, 3, 8, 13, 11, 4, 5, 2, 12, 0, 14, and 7. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 57 \)
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [57]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<6, (0, 12, 9)>
<9, (3, 13, 14)>
<9, (6, 8, 11)>
<9, (6, 11, 12)>
<9, (6, 12, 0)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (7, 11, 13)>
<13, (8, 9, 14)>
<11, (4, 12, 13)>
<11, (4, 13, 14)>
<4, (2, 14, 13)>
<4, (11, 13, 14)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<2, (4, 12, 14)>
<2, (5, 12, 14)>
<12, (0, 6, 11)>
<12, (1, 2, 11)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
