Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 24) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 20) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 16) (8, 4) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 11) (21, 14) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 19) (28, 13) (19, 15) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 1) (26, 19) (26, 17) (10, 21) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 20) (2, 22) (2, 14) (22, 2) (22, 0) (22, 29) (22, 7) (0, 28) (0, 22) (0, 29) (0, 23) (16, 4) (16, 14) (6, 18) (24, 5) (24, 13) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 20) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 10) (7, 22) (7, 29) (29, 22) (29, 0) (29, 7) (29, 11) (25, 9) (13, 28) (13, 24) (23, 0) (23, 1) (23, 20) (1, 19) (1, 23) (17, 26) (17, 11) (11, 5) (11, 21) (11, 29) (11, 17) (27, 3) (20, 9) (20, 10) (20, 18) (20, 23) (20, 14) (14, 5) (14, 21) (14, 2) (14, 16) (14, 20) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 3, 15, 4, 28, 19, 21, 22, 0, 18, 7, 29, 24, 20, 14, 10, 11, 23, 1, 26, 16.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 26: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 59 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [59]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<5, (9, 11, 14)>, 
<9, (5, 18, 25)>, 
<3, (7, 15, 27)>, 
<15, (3, 19, 7)>, 
<28, (0, 19, 21)>, 
<19, (15, 1, 28)>, 
<21, (11, 14, 28)>, 
<22, (2, 7, 29)>, 
<0, (28, 22, 29)>, 
<18, (6, 9, 10)>, 
<7, (3, 15, 10)>, 
<29, (0, 7, 22)>, 
<20, (9, 10, 18)>, 
<14, (2, 5, 16)>.
