Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 13) (29, 10) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 26) (25, 3) (25, 15) (25, 12) (1, 14) (1, 28) (1, 23) (1, 7) (15, 25) (15, 19) (20, 19) (20, 11) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 11) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 9) (0, 19) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 12) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 16) (26, 3) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 17) (9, 0) (9, 22) (9, 28) (9, 24) (9, 27) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (13, 29) (13, 4) (24, 2) (24, 9) (10, 29) (10, 0) (23, 1) (23, 26) (23, 21) (11, 20) (11, 18) (11, 5) (19, 15) (19, 20) (19, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (16, 22) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 6) (17, 26) (17, 16) (17, 28) (8, 16) (28, 1) (28, 9) (28, 17) (28, 12) (28, 27) (21, 23) (21, 12) (27, 9) (27, 28) (12, 25) (12, 14) (12, 28) (12, 21) (6, 4) (6, 16) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors, and we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each.

For node 1: 1 3-star
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 12: 1 3-star
For node 14: 1 3-star
For node 16: 1 3-star
For node 17: 1 3-star
For node 18: 1 3-star
For node 19: 1 3-star
For node 25: 1 3-star
For node 26: 1 3-star
For node 28: 1 3-star
For node 29: 1 3-star

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us $\left[ 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 \right] = 24$.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 24.

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (2, 7, 25)>
<9, (0, 22, 28)>
<9, (22, 24, 28)>
<9, (22, 26, 27)>
<12, (14, 21, 28)>
<14, (0, 12, 18)>
<16, (6, 17, 22)>
<17, (16, 26, 28)>
<18, (4, 11, 14)>
<19, (0, 15, 20)>
<25, (3, 12, 26)>
<26, (3, 17, 23)>
<28, (1, 12, 27)>
<29, (2, 10, 13)>
