Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's start by identifying the nodes that are central nodes in 3-stars. 

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {13, 25, 29}
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {23, 9, 8, 18}
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors: {4, 23, 10}
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: {3, 0, 17}
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: {4, 22, 28, 27}
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {3, 2, 21, 27}
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors: {18, 1, 0, 15, 21}
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors: {2, 1, 26, 0, 20}
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: {26, 12, 19, 15}
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors: {29, 8, 26, 6}
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: {17, 20, 16, 24, 9}
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: {14, 16, 27}
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {18, 17, 16}
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors: {8, 5, 17, 23}
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: {25, 6, 19}
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors: {22, 5, 1, 16}
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: {10, 14, 23}
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: {21, 20}
- Node 13 has 1 neighbor: {4}
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: {28, 28}
- Node 22 has 2 neighbors: {20, 29}
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {8, 16, 24}
- Node 12 has 1 neighbor: {14}
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: {3, 1}
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: {10, 27}
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: {3, 25, 21, 19}
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors: {17, 14}

Now, for the calculation of the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
