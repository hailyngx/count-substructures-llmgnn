Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 0) (2, 29) (2, 5) (29, 2) (29, 16) (29, 24) (7, 8) (21, 6) (21, 26) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 24) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 27) (17, 4) (3, 25) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 8) (8, 7) (8, 25) (8, 23) (8, 18) (23, 13) (23, 8) (23, 1) (23, 0) (23, 12) (10, 12) (10, 20) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 12) (20, 14) (20, 10) (20, 19) (20, 28) (12, 23) (12, 10) (12, 15) (12, 18) (11, 19) (11, 9) (28, 20) (28, 16) (28, 9) (6, 21) (6, 1) (6, 4) (16, 29) (16, 15) (16, 28) (5, 2) (5, 19) (19, 17) (19, 20) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 18) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 26) (26, 21) (26, 18) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 6) (0, 22) (0, 23) (0, 15) (0, 9) (9, 11) (9, 28) (9, 0) (9, 27) (24, 29) (24, 14) (24, 27) (27, 17) (27, 9) (27, 24) (4, 17) (4, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't contribute any 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 23 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up gives a total of 58 3-stars in the graph. So, the final number inside brackets is [58].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
