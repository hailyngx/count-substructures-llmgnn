Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 12) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 5) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 11) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we first need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors to check for possible 3-stars.   

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <6, (9, 10, 12)>
- For Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
  <9, (6, 11, 12)>
- For Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
  <8, (6, 4, 12)>, <8, (6, 7, 2)>, <8, (6, 7, 12)>, <8, (4, 7, 2)>, <8, (4, 7, 12)>, <8, (7, 0, 14)>, <8, (0, 7, 14)>, <8, (0, 7, 5)>, <8, (0, 14, 5)>, <8, (7, 14, 5)>
- For Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
  <3, (1, 0, 14)>, <3, (1, 10, 5)>, <3, (1, 10, 14)>, <3, (0, 10, 14)>, <3, (4, 7, 0)>, <3, (4, 7, 14)>, <3, (7, 0, 14)>, <3, (7, 14, 5)>, <3, (0, 14, 5)>, <3, (7, 14, 0)>
- For Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <7, (4, 0, 14)>, <7, (4, 8, 14)>, <7, (4, 14, 5)>, <7, (0, 14, 5)>
- For Node 5: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
  <5, (3, 0, 14)>, <5, (3, 0, 13)>, <5, (3, 0, 11)>, <5, (3, 14, 13)>, <5, (3, 14, 11)>, <5, (3, 13, 11)>, <5, (0, 14, 13)>, <5, (0, 14, 11)>, <5, (0, 13, 11)>, <5, (14, 13, 11)>, <5, (0, 13, 12)>, <5, (3, 13, 12)>, <5, (14, 13, 12)>, <5, (0, 11, 12)>, <5, (3, 11, 12)>, <5, (14, 11, 12)>, <5, (3, 0 , 12)>, <5, (0, 11, 13)>, <5, (3, 11, 13)>, <5, (14, 11, 13)>
- For Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
  <0, (3, 7, 14)>, <0, (3, 7, 5)>, <0, (3, 14, 5)>, <0, (7, 14, 5)>, <0, (4, 7, 14)>, <0, (4, 7, 5)>, <0, (4, 14, 5)>, <0, (7, 14, 5)>, <0, (7, 14, 11)>, <0, (7, 5, 11)>
- For Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <14, (3, 0, 7)>, <14, (3, 0, 5)>, <14, (0, 7, 5)>, <14, (3, 7, 5)>
- For Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
  <2, (8, 13, 10)>
- For Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <13, (4, 2, 5)>, <13, (4, 5, 11)>, <13, (4, 5, 13)>, <13, (2, 5, 11)>
- For Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <11, (5, 9, 13)>, <11, (5, 0, 13)>, <11, (5, 13, 11)>, <11, (0, 13, 11)>
- For Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <12, (6, 8, 5)>, <12, (6, 9, 5)>, <12, (6, 5, 12)>, <12, (8, 5, 12)>
- For Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <10, (6, 1, 3)>, <10, (6, 2, 3)>, <10, (1, 2, 3)>, <10, (1, 3, 10)>

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 66 unique 3-stars:
