Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
Let's first draw the graph:

- Center node: 5
- Nodes connected to 5: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Nodes connected to 4: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Nodes connected to 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5
- Nodes connected to 8: 0, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Nodes connected to 9: 3, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 38

So, the final answer is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
