Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 0) (6, 13) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 9) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 9) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 14) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 0 with 4 neighbors
- Node 1 with 4 neighbors
- Node 3 with 6 neighbors
- Node 4 with 4 neighbors
- Node 5 with 4 neighbors
- Node 6 with 4 neighbors
- Node 7 with 4 neighbors
- Node 8 with 4 neighbors
- Node 9 with 4 neighbors
- Node 10 with 3 neighbors
- Node 12 with 4 neighbors
- Node 13 with 6 neighbors
- Node 14 with 5 neighbors

Now, calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
- Node 0 can form 3-stars with inom{4}{3} = 4 other nodes = 4
- Node 1 can form 3-stars with inom{4}{3} = 4 other nodes = 4
- Node 3 can form 3-stars with inom{6}{3} = 20 other nodes = 20
- Node 4 can form 3-stars with inom{4}{3} = 4 other nodes = 4
- Node 5 can form 3-stars with inom{4}{3} = 4 other nodes = 4
- Node 6 can form 3-stars with inom{4}{3} = 4 other nodes = 4
- Node 7 can form 3-stars with inom{4}{3} = 4 other nodes = 4
- Node 8 can form 3-stars with inom{4}{3} = 4 other nodes = 4
- Node 9 can form 3-stars with inom{4}{3} = 4 other nodes = 4
- Node 13 can form 3-stars with inom{6}{3} = 20 other nodes = 20
- Node 14 can form 3-stars with inom{5}{3} = 10 other nodes = 10

Adding them up: 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 82

So, the total number of 3-stars is: [82]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 5>
<3, 7, 10>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 7, 13>
<3, 8, 10>
<3, 8, 14>
<3, 9, 14>
<4, 12, 7>
<4, 12, 13>
<5, 13, 2>
<6, 5, 13>
<7, 0, 4>
<13, 5, 1>
