Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 26) (15, 4) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 6) (6, 27) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 22) (9, 17) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 17) (3, 24) (3, 26) (8, 23) (8, 16) (8, 22) (23, 8) (23, 5) (4, 15) (4, 1) (4, 24) (2, 26) (18, 6) (18, 19) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 28) (0, 5) (20, 27) (20, 0) (20, 13) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 5) (21, 22) (21, 29) (28, 0) (28, 21) (11, 15) (11, 1) (11, 12) (22, 9) (22, 8) (22, 21) (22, 12) (22, 25) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (25, 22) (29, 21) (29, 12) (10, 21) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 16) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 26) (14, 12) (14, 24) (26, 15) (26, 3) (26, 2) (26, 14) (19, 18) (16, 8) (16, 10) (17, 9) (17, 3) (5, 23) (5, 0) (5, 21) (24, 3) (24, 4) (24, 14) (13, 9) (13, 20) (13, 10) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 22) (12, 29) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 28 has 2 neighbors: no 3-star
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors: no 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 71

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [71].
The unique 3-stars found are: <<0, 7, 28>, <0, 7, 21>, <0, 7, 10>, <0, 20, 13>, <1, 11, 12>, <4, 15, 27>, <4, 24, 13>, <5, 21, 22>, <6, 12, 29>, <8, 22, 25>, <10, 13, 20>, <14, 12, 29>, <15, 26, 2>, <21, 5, 23>, <21, 10, 16>, <22, 8, 16>, <22, 21, 29>, <24, 3, 17>, <26, 14, 1>, <27, 20, 6>>.
