Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (10, 4) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 13) (8, 10) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 0) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 6, 7, 11, 8, 12, 13  
Node 1: 5, 9, 3, 13, 12, 8  
Node 2: 5, 4, 8  
Node 3: 5, 1, 13  
Node 4: 2, 7, 10, 13  
Node 5: 9, 2, 12, 1, 3  
Node 6: 9, 11, 0  
Node 7: 4, 9, 0, 11  
Node 8: 10, 1, 2, 0  
Node 9: 5, 6, 14, 1, 7  
Node 10: 4, 8  
Node 11: 6, 7, 14, 0  
Node 12: 5, 1, 0  
Node 13: 4, 1, 3, 0, 14  
Node 14: 9, 11, 13  

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
Node 2: 1  
Node 3: 1  
Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
Node 6: 1  
Node 7: 1  
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 11: 1  
Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  

Summing up:  
10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 43  
Therefore, there are a total of 43 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars:  
<0, (6, 8, 12)>  
<1, (5, 8, 12)>  
<2, (4, 8, 10)>  
<3, (1, 5, 13)>  
<4, (2, 7, 10)>  
<5, (1, 3, 13)>  
<6, (9, 11, 0)>  
<7, (4, 9, 0)>  
<9, (7, 11, 14)>  
<11, (6, 7, 14)>  
<13, (0, 1, 14)>
