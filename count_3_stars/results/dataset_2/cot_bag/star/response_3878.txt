The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 25) (7, 2) (21, 7) (21, 15) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 19) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 14) (23, 8) (23, 2) (28, 17) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 5) (29, 28) (29, 24) (29, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 23) (2, 13) (13, 2) (13, 26) (13, 11) (26, 10) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 20) (24, 29) (24, 26) (24, 12) (4, 16) (4, 15) (27, 22) (16, 28) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 9) (25, 7) (25, 19) (25, 6) (12, 24) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 15) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 25) (19, 18) (0, 16) (0, 9) (3, 14) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 20) (20, 26) (20, 14) (20, 22) (20, 9) (22, 27) (22, 20) (22, 6) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 20) (1, 10) (1, 14) (5, 28) (5, 18) (5, 15) (6, 25) (6, 22) (6, 11) (15, 21) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 5) (11, 29) (11, 13) (11, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we need to identify the number of 3-stars formed and list them uniquely.

Let's first identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (21, 25, 2).
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors (17, 26, 18, 1, 19).
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors (10, 28, 19).
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors (17, 29, 16, 5).
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (7, 8, 23, 13).
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors (2, 26, 11).
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors (10, 13, 24, 20).
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors (29, 26, 12).
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors (28, 4, 0, 9).
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors (7, 19, 6).
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors (10, 19, 5, 15).
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors (10, 17, 25, 18).
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors (8, 3, 1, 20).
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors (26, 14, 22, 9).
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors (27, 20, 6).
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (16, 0, 20).
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors (10, 14).
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (28, 18, 15).
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (25, 22, 11).
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors (21, 4, 18, 5).
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors (29, 13, 6).
- Node 12 has 1 neighbor (24).
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor (14).
- Node 27 has 1 neighbor (22).
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors (16, 9).

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 7: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 10: \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 17: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 28: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 13: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 26: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 24: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 16: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 25: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 18: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 19: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 14: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 20: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 22: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 9: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1: No 3-stars
- Node 5: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 6: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 15: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 11: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<7, (21, 25, 2)>, <10, (17, 26, 18)>, <17, (10, 28, 19)>, <28, (17, 29, 16)>, <2, (7, 8, 23)>, <13, (2, 26, 11)>, <26, (10, 13, 24)>, <24, (29, 26, 12)>, <16, (28, 4, 0)>, <25, (7, 19, 6)>, <18, (10, 19, 5)>, <19, (10, 17, 25)>, <14, (8, 3, 1)>, <20, (26, 14, 22)>, <22, (27, 20, 6)>, <9, (16, 0, 20)>, <5, (28, 18, 15)>, <6, (25, 22, 11)>, <15, (21, 4, 18)>, <11, (29, 13, 6)>.
