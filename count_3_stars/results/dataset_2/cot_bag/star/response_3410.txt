Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
Applying the methodology described earlier, we will identify the central nodes of potential 3-stars based on the number of neighbors each node has. Here is the process:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.  
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.  

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 66 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Thus, inside brackets [], we have the total number of 3-stars as [66]. 

The unique 3-stars found are listed inside <> as follows:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
