Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's examine each node to identify the 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: (4, 7, 1, 3, 2)
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (5, 3, 0)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (7, 6, 8, 0)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (9, 1, 0, 6)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (7, 8, 6, 0)
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: (6, 8)
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors: (5, 9, 4, 3, 8, 2)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (9, 4, 0, 2)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (5, 4, 6, 2)
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (6, 3, 7)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 2: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found inside <> are:

<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
