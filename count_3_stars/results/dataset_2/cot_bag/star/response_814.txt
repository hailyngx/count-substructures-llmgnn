Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 14) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph provided, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars for each such node:

Node 1: 3 neighbors (4, 7, 12)
Node 2: 3 neighbors (1, 6, 13)
Node 3: 4 neighbors (4, 7, 9, 12)
Node 4: 3 neighbors (1, 3, 14)
Node 6: 5 neighbors (2, 5, 9, 13, 14)
Node 8: 5 neighbors (0, 5, 9, 10, 12)
Node 9: 4 neighbors (3, 6, 8, 11)
Node 11: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 7, 9, 13)
Node 12: 4 neighbors (0, 3, 8, 1)
Node 13: 4 neighbors (1, 2, 6, 11)
Node 14: 4 neighbors (4, 5, 6, 10)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by summing up \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of the nodes above that have 3 or more neighbors:

\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \]

Calculating these values gives:

\[ 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 53 \]

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 53. 

Therefore, the final answer, in brackets, is: \[ [53] \]

The unique 3-stars formed in this graph are:
\[ <1, (4, 7, 12)> \]
\[ <2, (1, 6, 13)> \]
\[ <3, (4, 7, 12)> \]
\[ <4, (1, 3, 14)> \]
\[ <6, (2, 5, 13)> \]
\[ <8, (0, 5, 12)> \]
\[ <9, (3, 6, 11)> \]
\[ <11, (0, 7, 13)> \]
\[ <12, (0, 1, 3)> \]
\[ <13, (1, 2, 11)> \]
\[ <14, (4, 6, 10)> \]
