Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 9) (16, 21) (16, 29) (16, 18) (28, 4) (28, 18) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 4) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 25) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 7) (13, 6) (20, 29) (20, 24) (29, 16) (29, 1) (29, 20) (29, 0) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 14) (23, 3) (23, 21) (2, 6) (2, 24) (22, 6) (22, 25) (21, 16) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 24) (25, 1) (25, 17) (25, 22) (25, 4) (25, 18) (26, 10) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 27) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 14) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 9) (8, 15) (8, 3) (7, 13) (14, 23) (14, 15) (12, 1) (12, 6) (0, 29) (0, 19) (0, 9) (0, 18) (9, 11) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 3) (27, 10) (18, 16) (18, 28) (18, 25) (18, 10) (18, 0) (4, 28) (4, 1) (4, 23) (4, 25) (24, 20) (24, 2) (24, 21) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 3) (3, 23) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 6, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star <1, (17, 4, 29)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star <4, (28, 1, 25)>
- Node 6 forms 2 3-stars <6, (13, 2, 3)> and <6, (3, 22, 12)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star <9, (19, 3, 11)>
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star <10, (26, 27, 18)>
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star <13, (7, 21, 6)>
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star <15, (14, 8, 19)>
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star <16, (18, 21, 29)>
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star <17, (13, 25, 1)>
- Node 18 forms 3 3-stars <18, (16, 28, 10)>, <18, (25, 18, 0)>, and <18, (4, 25, 18)>
- Node 21 forms 2 3-stars <21, (13, 23, 24)> and <21, (24, 21, 16)>
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star <23, (3, 21, 14)>
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star <24, (20, 2, 21)>
- Node 25 forms 2 3-stars <25, (1, 17, 25)> and <25, (18, 25, 4)>
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star <26, (10, 27, 18)>
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star <28, (4, 18, 16)>
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star <29, (20, 1, 0)>

There are a total of 1+1+2+1+1+1+1+1+1+3+2+1+1+2+1+1 = 19 unique 3-stars in this graph.
Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [19].
