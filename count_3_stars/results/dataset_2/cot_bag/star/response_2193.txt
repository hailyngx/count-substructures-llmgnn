Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 14) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 8) (10, 9) (10, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 10) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: connected to 2, 3, 4, 6 (has 4 neighbors)
Node 1: connected to 7, 8, 10, 12, 13 (has 5 neighbors)
Node 3: connected to 0, 7, 9, 11, 13 (has 5 neighbors)
Node 4: connected to 0, 2, 5, 12, 14 (has 5 neighbors)
Node 6: connected to 0, 9, 12, 14 (has 4 neighbors)
Node 7: connected to 1, 3, 8, 12 (has 4 neighbors)
Node 8: connected to 1, 7, 11, 14 (has 4 neighbors)
Node 9: connected to 0, 3, 6, 10 (has 4 neighbors)
Node 12: connected to 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 (has 5 neighbors)
Node 13: connected to 1, 3, 11, 13, 14 (has 5 neighbors)
Node 14: connected to 4, 6, 8, 13 (has 4 neighbors)

We will find the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 13 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 14 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 70 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [70].

Unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (7, 8, 10)>, <3, (0, 9, 13)>, <4, (0, 12, 14)>, <6, (0, 9, 12)>, <7, (1, 8, 12)>, <8, (1, 7, 11)>, <9, (0, 3, 10)>, <12, (1, 4, 5)>, <13, (1, 3, 14)>.
