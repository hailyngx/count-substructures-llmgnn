Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 17) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (2, 18) (2, 0) (2, 15) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 8) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 12) (17, 4) (17, 19) (17, 8) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 19) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 13) (10, 15) (10, 8) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 10) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 17) (8, 10) (19, 17) (19, 3) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 6) (14, 5) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 14) (6, 18) (6, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors greater than or equal to 3 are: 0, 2, 5, 8, 11, 12, 15, 18.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars based on these nodes:
Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 18 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
10 (from node 0) + 10 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 11) + 1 (from node 12) + 4 (from node 15) + 20 (from node 18) = 57

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [57].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 15, 16)>
<0, (2, 6, 18)>
<0, (2, 15, 18)>
<0, (8, 10, 15)>
<0, (11, 13, 16)>
<1, (0, 12, 13)>
<2, (0, 5, 18)>
<2, (15, 18, 8)>
<3, (4, 11, 19)>
<4, (3, 12, 17)>
<5, (7, 12, 14)>
<8, (10, 15, 18)>
<11, (0, 9, 13)>
<12, (0, 1, 5)>
<13, (11, 14, 16)>
<15, (0, 2, 18)>
<18, (2, 6, 8)>
