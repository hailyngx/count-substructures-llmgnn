Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors 1, 3, 6, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 4: neighbors 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 2 (degree 6)
- Node 5: neighbors 1, 4, 7, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 6: neighbors 0, 3, 4, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 9: neighbors 0, 2, 3, 5, 8 (degree 5)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 42

So the final count of the 3-stars is [42].

Unique 3-stars:

<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>

<4, (6, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 1, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (4, 1, 7)>
<6, (4, 3, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>

<9, (2, 3, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
