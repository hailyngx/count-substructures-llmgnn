Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 3, 7
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars. Starting with each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 9)>
Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 5, 8)>
Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 9)>
Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (2, 7, 8)>
Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (1, 7, 8)>
Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (4, 5, 9)>
Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (2, 5, 9)>
Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>
