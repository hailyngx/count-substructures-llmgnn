Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, as those are the potential central nodes for 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {4, 7, 1, 8}
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: {6, 7, 3, 2, 0, 8}
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {5, 9, 0, 3}
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: {9, 2, 8, 4, 7}
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {9, 1, 7, 3}
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {5, 6, 0, 1}
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {5, 1, 2, 0}
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {5, 6, 4}

Now we will count the number of 3-stars for each central node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (4, 7, 1, 8)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (6, 7, 3, 2, 0, 8)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (5, 9, 0, 3)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (9, 2, 8, 4, 7)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (9, 1, 7, 3)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (5, 6, 0, 1)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (5, 1, 2, 0)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
