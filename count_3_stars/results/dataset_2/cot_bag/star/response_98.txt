Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (4, 9) (4, 14) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
Given the information about the graph, we can first draw the graph to visualize it better. Once we have the visualization, we can easily identify the nodes that can form 3-star configurations.

After creating the graph and identifying the nodes with three or more neighbors, we find the following 3-stars:

- Node 5: <5, (2, 9, 10)>
- Node 9: <9, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 6: <6, (3, 9, 10)>
- Node 10: <10, (5, 6, 12)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 12: <12, (1, 10, 11)>
- Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 13)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 1: <1, (7, 11, 12)>
- Node 14: <14, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 13: <13, (0, 1, 12)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \left[ 10 \times \binom{3}{3} + 8 \times \binom{4}{3} + 0 \times \binom{1}{3} + 4 \times \binom{2}{3} + 0 \times \binom{1}{3} + 3 \times \binom{3}{3} + 0 \times \binom{1}{3} + 4 \times \binom{2}{3} + 5 \times \binom{3}{3} + 4 \times \binom{2}{3} \right] = \left[ 10 + 32 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 4 + 5 + 4 \right] = \left[ 62 \right] \] 

Therefore, there are 62 3-stars in the given graph.
