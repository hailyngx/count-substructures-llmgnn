Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 29) (27, 22) (14, 17) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 23) (17, 22) (17, 11) (7, 21) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 1) (21, 15) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 10) (21, 29) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 24) (8, 16) (8, 26) (1, 7) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 24) (26, 8) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 18) (0, 4) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 18) (20, 7) (20, 0) (20, 11) (5, 19) (6, 7) (6, 1) (24, 8) (24, 1) (24, 26) (19, 5) (19, 29) (19, 12) (3, 21) (3, 23) (3, 12) (18, 14) (18, 26) (18, 0) (10, 21) (10, 13) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 25) (16, 2) (22, 27) (22, 17) (28, 8) (28, 13) (28, 25) (28, 2) (11, 17) (11, 20) (23, 17) (23, 3) (29, 27) (29, 21) (29, 19) (29, 12) (2, 16) (2, 28) (13, 10) (13, 28) (13, 25) (25, 0) (25, 16) (25, 28) (25, 13) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 29) 

Response:
There are a total of 20 3-stars in this graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<15, (27, 21, 29)>
<27, (15, 21, 29)>
<21, (15, 27, 29)>
<17, (14, 22, 11)>
<7, (21, 1, 6)>
<4, (8, 16, 0)>
<8, (4, 26, 24)>
<1, (7, 6, 26)>
<26, (8, 1, 18)>
<0, (4, 20, 18)>
<20, (7, 11, 0)>
<6, (7, 1, 26)>
<3, (21, 23, 12)>
<18, (14, 0, 26)>
<10, (21, 13, 29)>
<16, (4, 8, 25)>
<23, (17, 3, 0)>
<29, (27, 21, 19)>
<2, (16, 28, 13)>
<12, (19, 3, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
