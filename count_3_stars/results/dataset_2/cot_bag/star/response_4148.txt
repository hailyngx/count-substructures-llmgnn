Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors first:
- Node 0 is connected to: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 1 is connected to: 0, 6, 8
- Node 2 is connected to: 0, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3 is connected to: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4 is connected to: 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5 is connected to: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6 is connected to: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 7 is connected to: 2, 5, 9
- Node 8 is connected to: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 9 is connected to: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 4 3-stars.
  <0, (1, 2, 8)>
  <0, (1, 3, 8)>
  <0, (2, 3, 8)>
  <0, (3, 4, 5)>

- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
  <3, (4, 5, 9)>

- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
  <4, (5, 6, 9)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
