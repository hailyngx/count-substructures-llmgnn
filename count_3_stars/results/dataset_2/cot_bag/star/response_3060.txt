Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and 40 edges in the given graph. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: Has 4 neighbors
- Node 2: Has 6 neighbors
- Node 4: Has 5 neighbors
- Node 6: Has 3 neighbors
- Node 8: Has 4 neighbors
- Node 9: Has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 42 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42]. The unique 3-star configurations are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (4, 9, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <8, (6, 4, 3)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
