Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and 40 edges in the graph. 

Let's first represent the graph as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 7), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 1), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 2), (4, 1), (4, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 0), (3, 6), (3, 2), (3, 8), (6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 0), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 0), (0, 1), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 2), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 0)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (6, 8, 2)>
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars: <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 6, 0)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 0)>, <2, (4, 5, 0)>, <2, (6, 8, 0)>
- Node 4 has 7 neighbors, so it can form 35 3-stars, but we need to list them individually: 
  <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 2)>, <4, (1, 0, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, 
  <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 8, 7)>, <4, (5, 8, 2)>, <4, (5, 2, 6)>, <4, (5, 0, 8)>,
  <4, (6, 7, 0)>, <4, (6, 3, 7)>, <4, (6, 3, 0)>, <4, (6, 3, 2)>, <4, (6, 0, 2)>,
  <4, (7, 0, 8)>, <4, (7, 5, 8)>, <4, (7, 5, 2)>, <4, (7, 2, 6)>, <4, (7, 0, 5)>,
  <4, (1, 2, 0)>, <4, (1, 0, 3)>, <4, (1, 0, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>,
  <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 6, 0)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 0, 8)>,
  <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 2, 8)>, <4, (5, 2, 0)>, <4, (6, 8, 0)>, <4, (6, 2, 8)>,
  <4, (0, 8, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 2)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (8, 3, 6)>, <4, (8, 6, 0)>
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 15 3-stars: <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 8, 4)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 0)>,
  <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 0)>, <5, (4, 0, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, 
  <5, (7, 0, 8)>, <5, (6, 8, 0)>, <5, (7, 8, 0)>, <5, (8, 0, 6)>, <5, (8, 2, 6)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star: <9, (1, 5, 6)>

Adding them up: [4 + 10 + 35 + 15 + 1] = 65

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is 65.
