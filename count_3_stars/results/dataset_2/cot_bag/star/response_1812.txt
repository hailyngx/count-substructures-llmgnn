Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 5) (15, 7) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 26) (4, 20) (7, 15) (7, 28) (7, 9) (7, 2) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 29) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 25) (1, 3) (1, 16) (10, 0) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 0) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 21) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 22) (5, 11) (6, 21) (6, 24) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 24) (21, 16) (21, 29) (24, 6) (24, 21) (24, 16) (24, 13) (26, 27) (26, 28) (26, 29) (28, 7) (28, 26) (28, 14) (20, 4) (20, 9) (29, 22) (29, 21) (29, 26) (18, 14) (18, 11) (19, 2) (19, 16) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 19) (2, 7) (2, 23) (2, 19) (2, 25) (14, 22) (14, 8) (14, 28) (14, 18) (12, 0) (12, 13) (13, 24) (13, 12) (25, 23) (25, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 20) (11, 5) (11, 18) 

Response:
The nodes that have at least three neighbors are: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 14, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, and 29. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center. 
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center. 
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 5 as the center.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 10 as the center.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 14 as the center. 
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 16 as the center.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 17 as the center.
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 21 as the center.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 22 as the center.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 23 as the center.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 24 as the center.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 26 as the center.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 28 as the center.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 29 as the center.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 83

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [83].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (10, 12, 17)>, <0, (9, 12, 17)>, <0, (9, 17, 27)>, <0, (9, 17, 21)>, <0, (9, 17, 10)>, <0, (9, 27, 26)>, <0, (17, 10, 16)>, <0, (17, 10, 8)>, <0, (17, 16, 21)>, <0, (17, 16, 16)>, <0, (17, 16, 24)>, <0, (17, 16, 19)>, <0, (17, 21, 16)>, <0, (17, 21, 29)>, <0, (10, 8, 14)>, <0, (10, 17, 16)>, <0, (10, 17, 21)>, <0, (10, 17, 16)>, <0, (10, 17, 16)>, <0, (12, 0, 13)>, <2, (7, 14, 19)>, <2, (7, 23, 25)>, <2, (23, 8, 10)>, <2, (23, 8, 14)>, <5, (3, 11, 22)>, <7, (2, 9, 28)>, <7, (9, 2, 23)>, <16, (1, 19, 16)>, <16, (1, 21, 24)>, <16, (1, 24, 16)>
