Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 13) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 9) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 9) 

Response:
There are a total of 12 nodes that have three or more neighbors, which are nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

1. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
2. Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
3. Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
4. Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
5. Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
6. Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
7. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
8. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
9. Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
10. Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
12. Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get:
\[ 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 66 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [66].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (7, 9, 12)>
<2, (10, 6, 14)>
<2, (9, 13, 1)>
<2, (4, 8, 14)>

<4, (2, 10, 6)>
<5, (0, 14, 1)>

<5, (7, 6, 14)>
<5, (10, 9, 1)>
<6, (8, 7, 14)>
<6, (5, 10, 14)>
<6, (4, 10, 5)>
