Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 9) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 2) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 9) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 4) (14, 8) (14, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 10) 

Response:
There are three nodes that have three or more neighbors: node 1, node 3, and node 7. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so the total number of 3-stars formed with node 1 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so the total number of 3-stars formed with node 3 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so the total number of 3-stars formed with node 7 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 10 + 10] = 24 \).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

- <1, (2, 11, 3)>
- <1, (0, 3, 1)>
- <1, (11, 3, 1)>
- <1, (11, 5, 1)>
