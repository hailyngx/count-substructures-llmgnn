Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 24) (11, 5) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 28) (16, 1) (2, 29) (2, 1) (29, 11) (29, 2) (29, 9) (29, 15) (12, 22) (12, 26) (27, 18) (27, 10) (10, 27) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 13) (17, 10) (17, 6) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 8) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 24) (20, 0) (20, 23) (22, 12) (22, 26) (22, 21) (26, 12) (26, 22) (26, 21) (24, 11) (24, 0) (24, 23) (24, 25) (28, 16) (28, 0) (9, 29) (9, 15) (9, 3) (21, 10) (21, 22) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 14) (23, 11) (23, 20) (23, 24) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 7) (14, 21) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 15) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 13) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 18) (19, 4) (15, 29) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 25) (18, 27) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 11) (5, 18) (25, 24) (25, 21) (25, 15) (13, 10) (13, 1) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 11, 16, 29, 10, 8, 0, 20, 22, 26, 24, 28, 21, 14, 6, 15, 18, 25, and 13.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:
1. Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
2. Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
3. Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
6. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7. Node 20: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
8. Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
9. Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
10. Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
11. Node 28: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
12. Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
13. Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
14. Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
15. Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
16. Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
17. Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
18. Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us:
\( 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 60 \)

Therefore, there are 60 3-stars in the given graph. 
Inside brackets [], we write the total number of 3-stars, which is [60], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<11, (16, 24, 5)>, <16, (11, 28, 1)>, <29, (11, 2, 9)>, <10, (27, 17, 21)>, <8, (4, 0, 3)>, <0, (8, 20, 24)>, <22, (12, 26, 21)>, <26, (12, 22, 21)>, <24, (11, 0, 25)>, <21, (10, 22, 26)>, <21, (14, 6, 18)>, <6, (17, 14, 7)>, <15, (29, 9, 14)>, <18, (27, 14, 7)>, <25, (24, 21, 15)>.
