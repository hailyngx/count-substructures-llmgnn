Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph have the following degrees:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4

Let's identify the 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 4 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [25] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 8, 4)>
- <1, (9, 7, 4)>
- <2, (0, 8, 4)>
- <3, (1, 8, 2)>
- <4, (7, 1, 9)>
- <6, (7, 1, 9)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <8, (3, 2, 0)>
- <9, (1, 7, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 25, and the unique 3-stars are as listed above.
