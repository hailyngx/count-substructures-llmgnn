Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 4) (4, 0) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 7) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are 24 nodes with three or more neighbors: 

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: {9, 4, 12, 13, 6} 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {14, 12, 6, 2}
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {4, 1, 3} 
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: {5, 12, 7, 2, 8}
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {0, 13, 12, 2}
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: {11, 0, 14, 1, 7}
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {9, 6, 3, 8}
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {10, 3, 7}
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: {5, 7, 13, 0, 12}
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: {8, 13, 14}
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors: {9, 0, 14, 4, 3, 1}
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: {5, 9, 10, 0, 4}
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: {10, 6, 1, 12}

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 12: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 82

Therefore, there are total [82] 3-stars in this graph.
