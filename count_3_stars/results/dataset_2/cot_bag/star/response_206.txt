Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 15) (9, 2) (9, 19) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 16) (17, 1) (17, 3) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 4) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 18) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (1, 14) (1, 17) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 16) (12, 6) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 13) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 13) (18, 5) (18, 11) (18, 19) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 3) (19, 13) (7, 8) (7, 3) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 7) (2, 9) (2, 19) (2, 13) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 19) (13, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 14, 17, 6, 10, 11, 4, 8, 1, 15, 0, 16, 18, 19, 3, 13.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 5 has 2 neighbors. No 3-star is formed.
2. Node 9 has 2 neighbors. No 3-star is formed.
3. Node 14 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Unique 3-stars: <14, (11, 1, 16)>, <14, (3, 1, 16)>, <14, (11, 3, 1)>, <14, (11, 3, 16)>.
4. Node 17 has 2 neighbors. No 3-star is formed.
5. Node 6 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Unique 3-stars: <6, (10, 12, 15)>, <6, (4, 12, 15)>, <6, (10, 4, 15)>, <6, (10, 4, 12)>.
6. Node 10 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Unique 3-stars: <10, (6, 11, 4)>, <10, (6, 11, 15)>, <10, (6, 4, 15)>, <10, (11, 4, 15)>.
7. Node 11 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = 1. Unique 3-star: <11, (14, 18, 10)>.
8. Node 4 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Unique 3-stars: <4, (10, 8, 6)>, <4, (10, 8, 0)>, <4, (10, 6, 0)>, <4, (8, 6, 0)>.
9. Node 8 has 2 neighbors. No 3-star is formed.
10. Node 1 has 2 neighbors. No 3-star is formed.
11. Node 15 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = 1. Unique 3-star: <15, (5, 16, 6)>.
12. Node 0 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = 1. Unique 3-star: <0, (4, 13, 16)>.
13. Node 16 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Unique 3-stars: <16, (14, 15, 0)>, <16, (14, 15, 13)>, <16, (14, 0, 13)>, <16, (15, 0, 13)>.
14. Node 18 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = 1. Unique 3-star: <18, (5, 11, 19)>.
15. Node 19 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Unique 3-stars: <19, (9, 18, 2)>, <19, (9, 18, 13)>, <19, (9, 2, 13)>, <19, (18, 2, 13)>.
16. Node 3 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Unique 3-stars: <3, (14, 19, 17)>, <3, (14, 19, 7)>, <3, (14, 17, 7)>, <3, (19, 17, 7)>.
17. Node 13 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Unique 3-stars: <13, (0, 16, 2)>, <13, (0, 16, 19)>, <13, (0, 2, 19)>, <13, (16, 2, 19)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].
