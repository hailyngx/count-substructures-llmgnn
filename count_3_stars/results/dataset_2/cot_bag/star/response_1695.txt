Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: [ \(\binom{3}{3}\) ] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: [ \(\binom{3}{3}\) ] = 1 3-star   
- Node 2: [ \(\binom{4}{3}\) ] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: [ \(\binom{4}{3}\) ] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: [ \(\binom{4}{3}\) ] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: [ \(\binom{4}{3}\) ] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: [ \(\binom{4}{3}\) ] = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: [ \(\binom{4}{3}\) ] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: [ \(\binom{5}{3}\) ] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: [ \(\binom{6}{3}\) ] = 20 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [ 56 ], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 9, 4)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 8)>, <5, (0, 9, 4)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 9, 4)>, <5, (6, 9, 4)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 1)>, <7, (8, 9, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 1)>, <8, (7, 9, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>
