Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 4) (15, 18) (8, 23) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 25) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 0) (23, 9) (13, 26) (13, 20) (13, 19) (26, 13) (26, 14) (26, 6) (0, 23) (7, 11) (7, 27) (16, 28) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 9) (28, 16) (28, 17) (28, 24) (17, 28) (17, 20) (17, 25) (17, 27) (20, 13) (20, 17) (20, 22) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 29) (9, 23) (9, 16) (9, 29) (9, 21) (29, 11) (29, 9) (4, 3) (4, 23) (4, 16) (4, 10) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 19) (2, 16) (2, 22) (22, 20) (22, 2) (22, 14) (25, 8) (25, 17) (25, 14) (25, 10) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 12) (19, 1) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 22) (14, 25) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 10) (1, 27) (24, 28) (24, 21) (21, 9) (21, 24) (5, 12) (5, 27) (18, 15) (18, 6) (6, 26) (6, 18) (10, 4) (10, 25) (10, 1) (27, 7) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 4 neighbors: 8, 16, 23, 26, 28
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 17, 20, 22, 25

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For nodes with 4 neighbors:
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 23: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 26: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 28: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

For nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 17: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 20: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 22: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 25: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 20

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<8, (14, 19, 25)>
<16, (2, 4, 28)>
<23, (4, 11, 9)>
<26, (6, 13, 14)>
<28, (16, 17, 24)>
<17, (20, 25, 27)>
<20, (13, 17, 22)>
<22, (2, 14, 20)>
<25, (10, 14, 17)>
<6, (18, 26, 27)> 

Therefore, there are 20 total 3-stars.
