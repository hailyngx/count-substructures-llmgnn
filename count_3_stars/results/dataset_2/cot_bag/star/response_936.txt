Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:  
1: 5, 3, 0, 8  
2: 3, 4, 0, 7  
3: 5, 9, 1, 7, 2  
4: 5, 9, 6, 0, 2  
5: 9, 6, 1, 3, 7, 4  
6: 5, 9, 4  
7: 5, 3, 8, 0, 2  
8: 1, 7  
9: 5, 4, 3  

Considering only nodes with at least three neighbors, we have 5, 4, 3, and 7.  
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 4 + 10 + 10] = [34] \).

The unique 3-stars are:  
<5, (1, 3, 7)>  
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
