Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 12) (6, 17) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 0) (8, 15) (8, 10) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 16) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (13, 14) (1, 18) (1, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 19) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 2) (7, 18) (16, 5) (16, 18) (19, 2) 

Response:
First, let's organize the given information into a clearer format:

Nodes: 20
Edges: 60
Edges:
- (3, 15), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4)
- (15, 3), (15, 8), (15, 12)
- (14, 17), (14, 0), (14, 11), (14, 13)
- (17, 14), (17, 6), (17, 12)
- (6, 17), (6, 9), (6, 5)
- (9, 6), (9, 10)
- (10, 9), (10, 11), (10, 8)
- (11, 14), (11, 10), (11, 0), (11, 12)
- (4, 3), (4, 8), (4, 18), (4, 0)
- (8, 15), (8, 10), (8, 4)
- (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 16)
- (18, 4), (18, 16), (18, 7), (18, 1)
- (0, 3), (0, 14), (0, 11), (0, 4)
- (13, 14)
- (1, 18), (1, 12)
- (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 12), (2, 19)
- (12, 15), (12, 17), (12, 11), (12, 1), (12, 2)
- (7, 18)
- (16, 5), (16, 18)
- (19, 2)

Now let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 2: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 3: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 4: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 5: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 6: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 8: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 10: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 11: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 12: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 14: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 15: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 16: C(2, 3) = 0
- Node 17: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 18: C(4, 3) = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [45]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (11, 14, 4)>, <0, (11, 14, 13)>, <0, (11, 14, 3)>, <0, (11, 14, 12)>, <2, (3, 5, 19)>, <2, (3, 5, 12)>, <2, (3, 12, 19)>, <2, (5, 12, 19)>, <3, (0, 15, 4)>, <3, (0, 15, 2)>, <3, (2, 15, 4)>, <3, (2, 15, 0)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 18)>, <4, (0, 8,...
