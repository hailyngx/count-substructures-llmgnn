Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 9) (3, 11) (3, 10) (15, 1) (15, 17) (14, 0) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 5) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (9, 16) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 19) (9, 12) (18, 19) (19, 2) (19, 9) (19, 18) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 5) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 13) (7, 17) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (6, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (4, 16) (4, 2) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 3, 15, 17, 2, 8, 1, 9, 19, 10, 12, 7, 5, and 13. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 37\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 37, and the unique 3-stars found are:
