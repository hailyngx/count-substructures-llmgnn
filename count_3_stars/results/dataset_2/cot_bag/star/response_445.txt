Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 22) (17, 4) (3, 25) (3, 24) (25, 14) (25, 3) (25, 15) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 18) (5, 2) (5, 29) (5, 20) (6, 21) (6, 11) (6, 27) (11, 6) (11, 23) (11, 9) (28, 13) (28, 20) (13, 17) (13, 28) (13, 7) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 15) (21, 6) (21, 16) (21, 23) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 18) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 23) (23, 11) (23, 26) (23, 21) (23, 9) (23, 20) (7, 13) (7, 18) (7, 2) (16, 21) (16, 8) (4, 17) (4, 22) (4, 24) (22, 17) (22, 4) (22, 29) (19, 2) (19, 10) (10, 26) (10, 8) (10, 19) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 19) (2, 15) (15, 25) (15, 26) (15, 2) (15, 24) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 18) (24, 3) (24, 4) (24, 15) (24, 29) (20, 5) (20, 28) (20, 23) (27, 6) (29, 5) (29, 22) (29, 24) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars each of these nodes is a part of:
- Node 0: 2 stars
- Node 2: 1 star
- Node 4: 1 star
- Node 6: 1 star
- Node 9: 2 stars
- Node 11: 2 stars
- Node 13: 2 stars
- Node 15: 3 stars
- Node 17: 4 stars
- Node 18: 3 stars
- Node 20: 2 stars
- Node 21: 2 stars
- Node 22: 1 star
- Node 23: 4 stars
- Node 24: 3 stars
- Node 25: 2 stars
- Node 26: 2 stars
- Node 28: 1 star
- Node 29: 1 star

Total number of 3-stars: \(2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 35\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 17, 18)>
<2, (5, 9, 15)>
<4, (17, 22, 24)>
<6, (11, 21, 27)>
<9, (1, 11, 23)>
<11, (6, 9, 23)>
<13, (7, 17, 28)>
<15, (2, 15, 25)>
<17, (0, 4, 13)>
<18, (0, 7, 18)>
<20, (5, 20, 23)>
<21, (6, 16, 23)>
<22, (4, 17, 29)>
<23, (9, 20, 26)>
<24, (3, 15, 24)>
<25, (3, 14, 25)>
<26, (10, 15, 26)>
<28, (13, 20, 28)>
<29, (4, 24, 29)>
