Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 7
Node 1: 0, 2, 3
Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 8
Node 3: 1, 7, 8
Node 4: 2, 6, 8
Node 5: 0, 2, 7, 9
Node 6: 0, 4, 8
Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 8, 9
Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
Node 9: 5, 7, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
Node 0: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
Node 2: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
Node 3: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
Node 4: \({2 \choose 3} = 0\)
Node 5: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
Node 7: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
Node 8: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\)
Node 9: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 44 \)

So, there are 44 3-stars in this graph. Putting this inside brackets: [44].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
