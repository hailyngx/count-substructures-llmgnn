Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 19) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 16) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 15) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 2) (3, 0) (3, 16) (15, 17) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 19) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 4) (4, 8) (4, 13) (1, 17) (1, 12) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 16) (18, 6) (18, 19) (0, 5) (0, 17) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 12) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 0) (16, 6) (16, 3) (16, 19) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 19) (7, 6) (7, 10) 

Response:
With 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can now determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 5, 3, 17, 10, 12.
   There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars centered at node 0. 
   These 3-stars are: <0, (3, 5, 12)>, <0, (3, 5, 10)>, <0, (3, 5, 17)>, <0, (3, 10, 12)>, <0, (3, 10, 17)>, <0, (3, 12, 17)>, <0, (5, 10, 12)>, <0, (5, 10, 17)>, <0, (5, 12, 17)>, <0, (10, 12, 17)>.

2. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 9, 7, 18, 16.
   There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars centered at node 6.
   These 3-stars are: <6, (7, 9, 18)>, <6, (7, 9, 16)>, <6, (7, 16, 18)>, <6, (9, 16, 18)>.

3. Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 14, 10, 8, 2.
   There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars centered at node 11.
   These 3-stars are: <11, (2, 8, 10)>, <11, (2, 8, 14)>, <11, (2, 10, 14)>, <11, (8, 10, 14)>.

4. Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 17, 13, 1, 0.
   There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars centered at node 12.
   These 3-stars are: <12, (0, 1, 13)>, <12, (0, 1, 17)>, <12, (0, 13, 17)>, <12, (1, 13, 17)>.

5. Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 6, 3, 19.
   There is 1 3-star centered at node 16.
   The 3-star is: <16, (3, 6, 19)>.

6. Node 17 has 5 neighbors: 14, 0, 1, 15, 12.
   There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars centered at node 17.
   These 3-stars are: <17, (0, 1, 14)>, <17, (0, 1, 15)>, <17, (0, 1, 12)>, <17, (0, 14, 15)>, <17, (0, 14, 12)>, <17, (0, 15, 12)>, <17, (1, 14, 15)>, <17, (1, 14, 12)>, <17, (1, 15, 12)>, <17, (14, 15, 12)>.

7. Node 19 has 5 neighbors: 9, 8, 18, 2, 16.
   There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars centered at node 19.
   These 3-stars are: <19, (2, 8, 16)>, <19, (2, 8, 18)>, <19, (2, 8, 9)>, <19, (2, 16, 18)>, <19, (2, 16, 9)>, <19, (2, 18, 9)>, <19, (8, 16, 18)>, <19, (8, 16, 9)>, <19, (8, 18, 9)>, <19, (16, 18, 9)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10] = 43 3-stars in the graph. Hence, the final answer is [43].
