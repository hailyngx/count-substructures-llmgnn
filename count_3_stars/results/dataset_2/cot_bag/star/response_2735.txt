Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 13) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 21) (26, 16) (26, 4) (4, 26) (4, 25) (7, 29) (7, 6) (7, 22) (0, 27) (0, 20) (0, 11) (27, 0) (27, 18) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 16) (18, 21) (22, 7) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 12) (22, 21) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 5) (5, 26) (5, 20) (5, 6) (5, 11) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 24) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 25) (1, 15) (1, 25) (17, 28) (3, 20) (3, 13) (11, 0) (11, 22) (11, 5) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 2) (19, 8) (19, 24) (25, 4) (25, 8) (25, 1) (24, 6) (24, 19) (24, 29) (10, 2) (10, 23) (12, 22) (12, 16) (12, 29) (16, 26) (16, 18) (16, 12) (16, 29) (29, 7) (29, 24) (29, 12) (29, 16) (13, 9) (13, 3) (21, 26) (21, 18) (21, 22) (14, 8) (14, 23) (14, 28) (28, 9) (28, 17) (28, 14) (28, 2) (23, 15) (23, 10) (23, 14) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 28) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, and 29. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars gives \[ 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 49 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 49. 
The final answer is: \[ [49] \]
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
\[ <2, (15, 23, 14)>, <5, (20, 6, 11)>, <6, (7, 5, 24)>, <7, (22, 6, 29)>, <8, (19, 25, 14)>, <9, (26, 28, 13)>, <11, (0, 22, 5)>, <12, (22, 16, 29)>, <14, (8, 23, 28)>, <16, (26, 18, 29)>, <18, (27, 22, 21)>, <20, (0, 3, 5)>, <21, (26, 18, 22)>, <22, (7, 18, 11)>, <23, (15, 10, 14)>, <24, (6, 19, 29)>, <25, (4, 8, 1)>, <26, (9, 5, 21)>, <28, (17, 14, 2)>, <29, (24, 16, 12)> \]
