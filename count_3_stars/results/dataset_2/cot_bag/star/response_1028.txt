Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) 

Response:
The nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 9 are all nodes that can potentially form 3-stars since they each have at least 3 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: Only 1 3-star can be formed as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 4) + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 41

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [41].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>
