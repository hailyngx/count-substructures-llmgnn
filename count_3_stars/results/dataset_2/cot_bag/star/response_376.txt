This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 4) 

Response:
For this graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors to construct the 3-stars.

The nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 5, 2, 10, 11, 6, 0, 8, 13.

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 9, 2, 4, 7. Hence, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 5, 3, 10, 13. Hence, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 9, 2, 14. Hence, there is 1 3-star with node 10.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 14, 0, 6. Hence, there is 1 3-star with node 11.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 11, 14, 4, 13. Hence, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6.
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors: 1, 3, 11, 7, 4, 8. Hence, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 0.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 9, 0, 14. Hence, there is 1 3-star with node 8.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 6, 2, 4. Hence, there is 1 3-star with node 13.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 36 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [36]. The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<2, (5, 3, 10)>
<10, (9, 2, 14)>
<11, (14, 0, 6)>
<6, (11, 14, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<8, (9, 0, 14)>
<13, (6, 2, 4)>
