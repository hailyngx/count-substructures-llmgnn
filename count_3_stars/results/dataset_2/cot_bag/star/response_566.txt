Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 29) (20, 6) (20, 5) (25, 27) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 24) (13, 27) (5, 20) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 20) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (3, 5) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 19) (28, 0) (28, 9) (28, 10) (28, 2) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 10) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 10) (26, 21) (9, 28) (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 7) (18, 26) (18, 27) (21, 3) (21, 26) (21, 23) (21, 14) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 23) (29, 11) (4, 22) (4, 12) (4, 24) (4, 17) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 19) (7, 9) (7, 16) (7, 15) (16, 7) (11, 29) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 21) (14, 11) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 28) (23, 21) (23, 29) (23, 10) (19, 3) (19, 12) (19, 17) (10, 6) (10, 28) (10, 22) (10, 26) (10, 23) (15, 12) (15, 7) (27, 25) (27, 13) (27, 18) (24, 13) (24, 4) (24, 2) (2, 28) (2, 11) (2, 24) (17, 4) (17, 19) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 47 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [47]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 28)>, <2, (11, 24, 28)>, <3, (0, 5, 28)>, <4, (12, 19, 24)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (5, 8, 10)>, <9, (7, 22, 29)>, <10, (6, 22, 23)>, <12, (4, 13, 15)>, <13, (12, 24, 27)>, <14, (11, 21, 29)>, <21, (3, 14, 23)>, <22, (9, 10, 26)>, <23, (10, 21, 29)>, <24, (4, 12, 2)>, <26, (10, 21, 22)>, <28, (2, 11, 29)>, <29, (9, 11, 23)>.
