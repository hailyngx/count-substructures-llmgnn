Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 3) (27, 26) (27, 13) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 18) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 5) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 20) (0, 20) (0, 22) (20, 1) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 19) (11, 15) (11, 18) (28, 16) (28, 12) (28, 23) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 14) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 22) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 29) (9, 4) (9, 25) (9, 8) (9, 24) (16, 21) (16, 28) (16, 10) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 24) (19, 12) (2, 17) (22, 0) (22, 25) (22, 10) (17, 6) (17, 25) (17, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 5) (10, 16) (10, 22) (26, 27) (26, 20) (24, 9) (24, 19) (29, 1) (29, 8) (29, 13) (29, 18) (5, 21) (5, 14) (5, 23) (23, 28) (23, 5) (23, 3) (23, 12) (3, 27) (3, 23) (3, 18) (12, 28) (12, 19) (12, 23) (13, 15) (13, 27) (13, 29) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 29) (18, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 15, 27, 4, 7, 21, 1, 20, 9, 16, 19, 22, 17, 14, 10, 26, 24, 29, 5, 23, 3, 12, 13, 18.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 can also form 4 3-stars.
- Nodes 4, 7, 21, 1, 20, 9, 16, 19, 22, 17, 14, 10, 26, 24, and 29 each have 3 neighbors, so they can form 1 3-star each.
- Nodes 5, 23, 3, 12, 13, and 18 have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 3-stars each.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44 \)

So, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
