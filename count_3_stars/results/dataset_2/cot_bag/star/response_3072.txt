Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 22) (29, 2) (29, 26) (29, 25) (29, 11) (1, 6) (3, 16) (3, 19) (4, 8) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 27) (24, 26) (24, 9) (24, 15) (26, 29) (26, 24) (26, 23) (26, 21) (15, 24) (15, 5) (11, 29) (11, 4) (11, 23) (11, 20) (23, 26) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 25) (22, 2) (22, 27) (22, 12) (28, 0) (28, 17) (28, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (14, 18) (14, 20) (19, 3) (19, 16) (19, 12) (0, 28) (0, 6) (5, 15) (5, 23) (5, 7) (5, 20) (9, 24) (9, 25) (9, 10) (25, 29) (25, 23) (25, 9) (25, 13) (25, 16) (7, 28) (7, 6) (7, 5) (17, 8) (17, 28) (17, 12) (17, 18) (21, 26) (21, 27) (27, 8) (27, 22) (27, 21) (13, 25) (18, 14) (18, 17) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 16) (12, 22) (12, 6) (12, 19) (12, 17) (12, 10) (16, 3) (16, 19) (16, 25) (16, 10) (20, 11) (20, 14) (20, 5) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes: 
1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60]. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<4, (11, 23, 20)>, <6, (0, 7, 12)>, <12, (6, 17, 10)>, <15, (5, 24, 9)>, <17, (8, 28, 18)>, <20, (11, 14, 5)>, <22, (2, 27, 12)>, <23, (26, 11, 5)>, 
<24, (26, 15, 9)>, <25, (29, 23, 9)>, <26, (29, 24, 21)>, <27, (22, 8, 21)>, <28, (0, 7, 17)>, <29, (2, 26, 25)>
