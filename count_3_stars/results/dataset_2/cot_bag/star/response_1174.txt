Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: No 3-stars (has <1, 2, 8> but it is already counted)
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: No 3-stars (has <1, 6, 2> but it is already counted)
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 28

So, there are 28 3-stars in the given graph.

Putting the unique 3-stars inside <>:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [28].
