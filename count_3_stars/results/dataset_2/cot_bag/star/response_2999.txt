Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 28) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 7) (8, 29) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 27) (13, 16) (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 18) (10, 11) (10, 29) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 27) (11, 5) (11, 4) (7, 26) (7, 12) (7, 20) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 18) (17, 29) (17, 6) (17, 0) (29, 8) (29, 10) (29, 17) (29, 23) (29, 14) (21, 13) (21, 28) (28, 9) (28, 21) (28, 25) (16, 13) (16, 22) (16, 27) (22, 26) (22, 16) (14, 29) (14, 20) (6, 17) (6, 24) (6, 19) (24, 6) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 25) (15, 23) (19, 6) (19, 3) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 3) (3, 19) (3, 0) (20, 26) (20, 7) (20, 14) (23, 10) (23, 29) (23, 15) (23, 2) (27, 8) (27, 11) (27, 16) (27, 2) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 1) (18, 13) (18, 12) (18, 5) (18, 1) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 18) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 23) (2, 27) (25, 28) (25, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29.   
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 55

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [55].   

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:

<1, (7, 18, 5)>  
<2, (13, 27, 23)>  
<4, (11, 25, 1)>  
<6, (17, 24, 19)>  
<7, (1, 4, 11)>  
<8, (29, 10, 12)>  
<10, (29, 23, 15)>  
<11, (10, 27, 5)>  
<12, (8, 7, 18)>

<16, (22, 26, 27)>  
<17, (29, 6, 0)>  
<18, (13, 12, 5)>  
<20, (26, 7, 14)>  
<22, (16, 26, 3)>
