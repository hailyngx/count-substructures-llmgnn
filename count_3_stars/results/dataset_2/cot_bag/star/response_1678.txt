Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 5) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 9) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (2, 5) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 1) (8, 5) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 9) (13, 10) (13, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 13) 

Response:
Following the instructions provided, let's start by identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 
\[ 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 92 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [92].

Let's now list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (8, 9, 11)>
- <1, (6, 10, 14)>
- <3, (5, 9, 12)>
- <5, (2, 8, 14)>
- <6, (1, 7, 14)>
- <9, (3, 10, 13)>
