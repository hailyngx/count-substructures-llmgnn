Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars each of those nodes contributes.

1. Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 7, and 3.
2. Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 7, 1, 6, 8, and 2.
3. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 5, 8, 1, and 2.
4. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 9, 6, 2, and 4.
5. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, and 3.
6. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 2, and 8.
7. Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 9, 4, 7, 3, and 0.
8. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 8, 2, and 1.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up these contributions:
\( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 46 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars are:
