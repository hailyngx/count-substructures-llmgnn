Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 14) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 6) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 1) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 3) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 13) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with 3 or more neighbors, namely nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node:

Total number of 3-stars: \( [20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 10] = [123] \)
