Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, and 6.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 63 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [63].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
