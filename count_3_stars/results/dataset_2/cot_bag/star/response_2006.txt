Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:

```
          1
         / \
        6 - 5 - 7
         \   / \
          3 - 9 - 0
           \ /   |
            2 - 8
           (4)
```

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars by considering the nodes identified above:
- For Node 0: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- For Node 3: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- For Node 4: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- For Node 5: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars.
- For Node 6: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars.
- For Node 7: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- For Node 9: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.

Adding these up: $4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 40$.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 40, which we represent as [40].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <7, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
