Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 9, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 6}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with (0, 4, 7) <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with (1, 6, 7) <3, (1, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
