Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 28) (22, 13) (22, 0) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 16) (20, 9) (20, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 21) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 3) (11, 17) (24, 9) (26, 23) (26, 21) (26, 17) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 25) (5, 1) (5, 21) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 23) (16, 15) (16, 27) (28, 13) (28, 1) (9, 20) (9, 24) (9, 7) (29, 0) (29, 23) (17, 13) (17, 11) (17, 26) (1, 5) (1, 28) (1, 6) (1, 25) (1, 23) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 25) (23, 26) (23, 19) (23, 29) (23, 1) (23, 14) (7, 3) (7, 9) (21, 13) (21, 2) (21, 26) (21, 5) (14, 19) (14, 23) (14, 4) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 0) (25, 5) (25, 1) (25, 6) (0, 22) (0, 15) (0, 29) (0, 12) (4, 20) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 14) (10, 8) (10, 18) (18, 10) (18, 27) (27, 16) (27, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 13, 22, 15, 20, 2, 8, 11, 9, 5, 19, 16, 28, 17, 1, 6, 23, 21, 14, 12, 25, 0, and 4.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 22: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 20: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 28: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 61 \)

Therefore, there are 61 unique 3-stars in this graph, which we'll represent as <...> inside square brackets [].
