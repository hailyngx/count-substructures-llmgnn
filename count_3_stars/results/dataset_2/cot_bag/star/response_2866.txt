Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 8}

Now let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 = 24

Therefore, in the given graph, there are a total of 24 3-stars. 

Putting the final count inside brackets []: [24]

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 5)>
