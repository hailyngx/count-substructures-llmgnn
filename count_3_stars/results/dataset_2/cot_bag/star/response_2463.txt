- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 17.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 29 and 18.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 25, 2, and 29.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 18.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 23, and 27.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 1, 26, and 22.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 25, 28, 16, and 24.
- Node 13 is connected to node 18.
- Node 14 is connected to node 7.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 17 and 19.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 26, 17, 12.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 29, 16, 15, and 4.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 9, 23, 5, and 13.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 25, 15, and 27.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 25, 0, 29, 23, and 24.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 26, 3, and 27.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 11 and 27.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 20, 10, 18.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 3, 20, 25, and 12.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 20, 19, 8, 12, and 24.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 21, 11, and 16.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 10, 21, 22, and 19.
- Node 28 is connected to node 12.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 20, 8, 17, and 5.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 12 and its 5 neighbors form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 25 and its 4 neighbors form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 20 and its 5 neighbors form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 and its 4 neighbors form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 and its 3 neighbors form 1 3-star.
  
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<12, (1, 25, 24)>
<25, (20, 24, 12)>
<20, (25, 24, 23)>
<3, (1, 21, 7)>
<16, (26, 17, 12)>
