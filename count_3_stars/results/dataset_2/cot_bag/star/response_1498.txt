Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are 12 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's find the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   - <0, (3, 5, 6)>
   - <0, (2, 5, 6)>
   - <0, (2, 3, 6)>
   - <0, (2, 3, 5)>

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
   - <1, (3, 5, 8)>
   - <1, (3, 8, 9)>
   - <1, (3, 5, 9)>
   - <1, (5, 6, 8)>
   - <1, (5, 6, 9)>
   - <1, (6, 8, 9)>

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   - <2, (0, 3, 6)>
   - <2, (0, 3, 5)>
   - <2, (0, 5, 6)>
   - <2, (3, 5, 6)>

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   - <3, (0, 2, 6)>
   - <3, (0, 2, 5)>
   - <3, (0, 5, 6)>
   - <3, (2, 5, 6)>

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   - <4, (7, 8, 9)>
   - <4, (7, 1, 8)>
   - <4, (7, 1, 9)>
   - <4, (1, 8, 9)>

- Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 each have 3 neighbors, so each can only form 1 3-star.
   - <5, (1, 8, 0)>
   - <6, (5, 2, 0)>
   - <7, (4, 1, 8)>
   - <8, (9, 1, 4)>
   - <9, (4, 1, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [31]
