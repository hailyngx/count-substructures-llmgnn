Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 11) (1, 18) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 19) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 29) (0, 25) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 11) (27, 13) (8, 23) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 18) (23, 8) (23, 10) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 15) (6, 28) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 13) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 4) (19, 21) (19, 11) (19, 29) (22, 4) (22, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 25) (7, 10) (25, 0) (25, 7) (25, 2) (20, 2) (29, 0) (29, 19) (29, 24) (3, 16) (3, 5) (2, 25) (2, 20) (2, 9) (16, 21) (16, 3) (5, 26) (5, 3) (5, 4) (4, 28) (4, 22) (4, 5) (17, 8) (17, 6) (17, 11) (11, 1) (11, 27) (11, 19) (11, 17) (11, 18) (24, 27) (24, 29) (24, 13) (24, 14) (13, 27) (13, 6) (13, 24) (15, 26) (15, 14) (9, 28) (9, 2) (10, 23) (10, 7) (10, 14) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 11) (14, 24) (14, 15) (14, 10) (12, 8) (12, 22) 

Response:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's identify the nodes with their degree:

- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 3
- Node 10 has degree 3
- Node 11 has degree 5
- Node 12 has degree 2
- Node 13 has degree 3
- Node 14 has degree 3
- Node 15 has degree 2
- Node 16 has degree 3
- Node 17 has degree 3
- Node 18 has degree 3
- Node 19 has degree 3
- Node 20 has degree 2
- Node 21 has degree 4
- Node 22 has degree 2
- Node 23 has degree 3
- Node 24 has degree 4
- Node 25 has degree 3
- Node 26 has degree 3
- Node 27 has degree 4
- Node 28 has degree 3
- Node 29 has degree 3

Now, we'll count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with degree 3 or more:

- Node 0 can form 1 3-star
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star
- Node 7 can form 1 3-star
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star
- Node 10 can form 1 3-star
- Node 11 can form 3 3-stars
- Node 16 can form 1 3-star
- Node 17 can form 1 3-star
- Node 18 can form 1 3-star
- Node 19 can form 1 3-star
- Node 21 can form 1 3-star
- Node 24 can form 1 3-star
- Node 25 can form 1 3-star
- Node 26 can form 1 3-star
- Node 27 can form 1 3-star
- Node 28 can form 1 3-star
- Node 29 can form 1 3-star

Counting these up, there are 21 total 3-stars formed by the nodes. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 7, 25>
- <1, 11, 27>
- <4, 22, 12>
- <6, 7, 0>
- <8, 23, 10>
- <9, 2, 25>
- <10, 14, 24>
- <11, 17, 18>
- <16, 21, 19>
- <24, 27, 13>
