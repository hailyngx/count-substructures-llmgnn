Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 1) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 9) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 13.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 62

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 12)>
<1, (0, 11, 12)>
<1, (4, 5, 11)>
<1, (4, 9, 12)>
<1, (5, 11, 12)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 12)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 13)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 11)>
<1, (6, 7, 13)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (7, 9, 13)>
<1, (4, 11, 13)>
<1, (0, 1, 11)>
<1, (0, 1, 12)>
<1, (11, 12, 13)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 8, 13)>
<4, (1, 5, 11)>
<5, (1, 4, 11)>
<7, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<10, (1, 11, 13)>
<10, (1, 4, 11)>
<12, (0, 6, 7)>
<12, (4, 6, 11)>
<13, (0, 8, 13)>
<14, (1, 4, 11)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62].
