Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: {9, 3, 8, 2}
Node 1: {5, 4, 3, 2}
Node 2: {5, 9, 1, 6, 0}
Node 4: {5, 1, 6, 3}
Node 5: {9, 2, 8, 1, 4, 7}
Node 6: {9, 4, 2, 8}
Node 8: {5, 7, 6, 0}
Node 9: {5, 6, 2, 0}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars each node forms:

Node 0: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
Node 1: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
Node 2: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $
Node 4: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
Node 5: $ \binom{6}{3} = 20 $
Node 6: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
Node 8: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
Node 9: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $

Adding them up, the total number of 3-stars is $4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50$

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [50].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars formed:
<0, (9, 3, 8)>, <0, (9, 8, 2)>, <0, (3, 8, 2)>, <0, (9, 3, 2)>, <1, (5, 4, 3)>, <1, (5, 3, 2)>, <1, (5, 4, 2)>, <1, (4, 3, 2)>, <2, (5, 9, 1)>, <2, (5, 9, 6)>, <2, (5, 1, 6)>, <2, (9, 1, 6)>, <2, (5, 1, 0)>, <2, (9, 1, 0)>, <2, (5, 6, 0)>, <2, (9, 6, 0)>, <4, (5, 1, 6)>, <4, (5, 1, 3)>, <4, (5, 1, 2)>, <4, (1, 6, 3)>, <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <5, (2, 8, 0)>, <5, (9, 8, 0)>, <5, (2, 8, 6)>, <5, (9, 8, 6)>, <6, (9, 4, 2)>, <8, (5, 7, 6)>, <8, (5, 7, 0)>, <8, (7, 6, 0)>, <9, (5, 6, 2)>
