Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0, there are 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 8, 2. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.

For node 1, there are 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 0, 8. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.

For node 2, there are 3 neighbors: 8, 5, 0. So, there is only 1 3-star formed.

For node 3, there are 4 neighbors: 6, 9, 1, 0. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.

For node 4, there are 4 neighbors: 6, 9, 0, 5. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.

For node 5, there are 5 neighbors: 6, 1, 4, 2, 7. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.

For node 6, there are 5 neighbors: 9, 5, 7, 3, 4. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.

For node 8, there are 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 0, 7. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.

For node 9, there are 3 neighbors: 6, 4, 3. So, there is only 1 3-star formed.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get: \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 44 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 44, which can be represented as [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
