Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 18) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 19) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 18) (8, 2) (8, 7) (13, 11) (13, 4) (10, 7) (17, 12) (17, 15) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 16) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 12) (4, 13) (4, 18) (0, 9) (0, 6) (14, 9) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 1) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 17) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 18) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are 11, 5, 16, 3, and 18. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each and then sum them up:
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding them up: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 32 \)

So, there are 32 3-stars in total.

Inside brackets, this number is [32].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <11, 6, 13>
- <11, 13, 19>
- <11, 13, 4>
- <11, 19, 5>
