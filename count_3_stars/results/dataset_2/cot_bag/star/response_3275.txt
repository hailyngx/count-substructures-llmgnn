Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 6, 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>.
  
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 6)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>.

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>.

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>.

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <3, (0, 5, 6)>.

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <4, (1, 7, 8)>.

- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <7, (1, 4, 8)>.

- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <8, (5, 6, 9)>.

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we get a total of 66 3-stars in this graph. Hence, the answer is [66].
