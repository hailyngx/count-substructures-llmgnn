Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (12, 6) (12, 3) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 14) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 13) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will identify nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 80

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [80]. 

List of unique 3-stars:

- <1, (5, 8, 10)>
- <2, (6, 12, 13)>
- <2, (6, 7, 14)>
- <2, (13, 0, 9)>
- <3, (9, 10, 12)>
- <3, (10, 11, 13)>
- <3, (10, 11, 8)>

- <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- <8, (5, 14, 2)>
- <8, (8, 1, 5)>
