Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's determine the total number of 3-stars formed with each node and then sum them up to find the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 5, 7, 1, 3, and 2.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 0.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 9, 4, 0, 6, and 8.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 3.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 3, and 6.
- There is 1 3-star formed with node 4.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 9, 6, 2, 4, and 0.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 5.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, and 3.
- There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed with node 6.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 4, and 3.
- There is 1 3-star formed with node 9.

Summing up these results:
\[ 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 52 \]

Therefore, there are a total of 52 3-stars in this graph. 

So the answer is [52].
