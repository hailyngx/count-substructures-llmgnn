- Node 2: {13, 16, 19, 25}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 14, 17, 27}
- Node 4: {0, 11, 29}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 8, 11, 21}
- Node 6: {0, 5}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 10, 25}
- Node 9: {21, 27}
- Node 10: {8, 14, 18}
- Node 11: {4, 5, 18, 20}
- Node 12: {1, 19, 28}
- Node 13: {2, 28}
- Node 14: {3, 10, 22}
- Node 15: {25}
- Node 16: {2, 17, 19}
- Node 17: {3, 16, 25}
- Node 18: {1, 10, 11}
- Node 19: {2, 12, 16, 20}
- Node 20: {11, 19}
- Node 21: {5, 9, 23}

- Node 23: {21, 28}
- Node 24: {22, 29}
- Node 25: {2, 8, 15, 17, 27}
- Node 27: {1, 3, 9, 25}
- Node 28: {12, 13, 22, 23}
- Node 29: {0, 4, 24}

Based on the given information, we can find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms 4 3-stars: <1, (0, 7, 12)>, <1, (0, 18, 27)>, <1, (7, 12, 27)>, <1, (0, 12, 27)>
- Node 2 forms 4 3-stars: <2, (13, 16, 19)>, <2, (13, 16, 25)>, <2, (13, 19, 25)>, <2, (16, 19, 25)>
- Node 3 forms 5 3-stars: <3, (5, 8, 14)>, <3, (5, 8, 17)>, <3, (5, 14, 17)>, <3, (8, 14, 17)>, <3, (8, 14, 22)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (6, 11, 21)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (10, 25, 27)>
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star: <10, (14, 18, 22)>
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star: <11, (4, 18, 20)>
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star: <18, (10, 11, 20)>
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star: <19, (12, 16, 20)>
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star: <21, (9, 21, 23)>
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star: <22, (14, 24, 28)>
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star: <25, (15, 17, 27)>
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star: <27, (9, 21, 25)>
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star: <28, (13, 22, 23)>
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star: <29, (0, 4, 24)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].
