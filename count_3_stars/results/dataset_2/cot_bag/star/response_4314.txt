Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 26) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 17) (3, 23) (15, 27) (15, 8) (15, 28) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 7) (18, 22) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 25) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 2) (10, 24) (8, 15) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 19) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 0) (5, 20) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 19) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 0) (14, 23) (26, 11) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 25) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 20) (17, 19) (20, 11) (20, 27) (20, 5) (20, 17) (9, 11) (9, 29) (9, 12) (29, 9) (29, 7) (29, 12) (2, 22) (2, 13) (2, 28) (2, 21) (23, 3) (23, 5) (23, 14) (23, 26) (1, 25) (1, 28) (1, 7) (7, 27) (7, 18) (7, 29) (7, 1) (21, 13) (21, 2) (25, 18) (25, 26) (25, 1) (24, 10) (12, 9) (12, 29) (28, 15) (28, 2) (28, 1) (28, 19) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 28) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Now, for each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors of the node.

For Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 38, which gives us the final answer as [38].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<11, (16, 9, 26)>
<13, (8, 17, 21)>
<15, (27, 8, 28)>
<17, (16, 13, 20)>
<18, (22, 6, 7)>
<20, (27, 5, 17)>
<26, (22, 23, 25)>
<28, (2, 1, 19)>
<29, (9, 12, 7)>
