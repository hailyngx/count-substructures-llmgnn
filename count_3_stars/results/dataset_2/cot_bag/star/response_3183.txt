Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 20) (26, 21) (26, 3) (26, 6) (15, 27) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 28) (27, 19) (27, 23) (6, 9) (6, 26) (6, 4) (6, 13) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 24) (12, 7) (11, 15) (11, 28) (11, 1) (28, 27) (28, 11) (28, 14) (17, 15) (20, 9) (20, 8) (20, 13) (20, 5) (5, 20) (5, 19) (5, 22) (5, 0) (19, 27) (19, 5) (19, 0) (25, 15) (25, 21) (1, 11) (1, 29) (29, 1) (29, 21) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 3) (0, 8) (3, 26) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 24) (3, 10) (13, 6) (13, 20) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 29) (14, 18) (14, 28) (14, 22) (14, 23) (22, 5) (22, 14) (22, 10) (22, 8) (24, 7) (24, 3) (24, 8) (8, 20) (8, 0) (8, 22) (8, 24) (10, 18) (10, 3) (10, 22) (16, 18) (16, 23) (16, 4) (4, 6) (4, 16) (23, 27) (23, 14) (23, 16) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 3, 5, 6, 11, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, and 28.
        
For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 3 forms 4 3-stars: <3, (0, 8, 24)>, <3, (7, 21, 26)>, <3, (11, 15, 28)>, <3, (0, 24, 8)>.
- Node 5 forms 4 3-stars: <5, (0, 19, 22)>, <5, (8, 14, 22)>, <5, (19, 27, 29)>, <5, (0, 3, 22)>.
- Node 6 forms 4 3-stars: <6, (4, 13, 20)>, <6, (9, 13, 20)>, <6, (9, 20, 26)>, <6, (4, 9, 26)>.
- Node 11 forms 2 3-stars: <11, (1, 15, 28)>, <11, (1, 15, 27)>.
- Node 14 forms 4 3-stars: <14, (8, 18, 22)>, <14, (10, 22, 23)>, <14, (22, 23, 27)>, <14, (18, 22, 28)>.
- Node 15 forms 4 3-stars: <15, (11, 17, 28)>, <15, (17, 19, 25)>, <15, (11, 17, 28)>, <15, (11, 17, 25)>.
- Node 18 forms 3 3-stars: <18, (2, 16, 4)>, <18, (16, 22, 23)>, <18, (2, 16, 4)>.
- Node 20 forms 2 3-stars: <20, (5, 13, 6)>, <20, (5, 13, 6)>.
- Node 21 forms 4 3-stars: <21, (25, 26, 29)>, <21, (25, 27, 29)>, <21, (26, 27, 29)>, <21, (25, 26, 27)>.
- Node 22 forms 3 3-stars: <22, (8, 10, 23)>, <22, (8, 10, 23)>, <22, (14, 16, 23)>.
- Node 23 forms 2 3-stars: <23, (16, 22, 27)>, <23, (16, 22, 27)>.
- Node 26 forms 3 3-stars: <26, (6, 21, 3)>, <26, (6, 21, 3)>, <26, (21, 27, 29)>.
- Node 27 forms 4 3-stars: <27, (19, 23, 14)>, <27, (19, 23, 14)>, <27, (19, 23, 14)>, <27, (19, 25, 29)>.
- Node 28 forms 4 3-stars: <28, (11, 14, 	21)>, <28, (11, 14, 21)>, <28, (11, 14, 21)>, <28, (14, 21, 27)>.

Combining all the formed 3-stars, we have a total of [59] unique 3-stars.
