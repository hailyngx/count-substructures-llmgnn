Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 19) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 24) (22, 12) (22, 25) (15, 27) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 6) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 16) (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 8) (9, 18) (26, 11) (20, 25) (20, 12) (25, 22) (25, 20) (25, 7) (0, 15) (0, 4) (8, 3) (8, 23) (8, 1) (23, 8) (23, 24) (28, 18) (29, 17) (29, 16) (29, 24) (29, 21) (17, 29) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 21) (4, 22) (4, 27) (4, 0) (4, 17) (6, 15) (6, 1) (21, 3) (21, 29) (21, 17) (21, 11) (7, 25) (7, 2) (7, 1) (5, 3) (5, 17) (19, 13) (19, 18) (14, 27) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 16) (18, 13) (18, 9) (18, 28) (18, 19) (10, 3) (10, 2) (16, 27) (16, 29) (16, 1) (16, 24) (24, 22) (24, 23) (24, 29) (24, 16) (11, 26) (11, 21) (11, 1) (11, 12) (2, 7) (2, 10) (12, 22) (12, 20) (12, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22, 24, 25, 27, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 90 \).

Therefore, there are 90 total 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 11>
<1, 6, 16>
<1, 6, 1>
<1, 6, 15>
<3, 0, 4>
<3, 0, 6>
<3, 0, 8>
<3, 0, 15>
<3, 5, 17>
<4, 0, 6>
<4, 0, 17>
<4, 0, 22>
<4, 0, 27>
<4, 17, 21>
<15, 3, 5>
<15, 3, 8>
<15, 3, 21>
<16, 1, 6>
<16, 1, 11>
<16, 1, 24>
<16, 1, 29>
<16, 11, 26>
<16, 24, 29>
<17, 4, 0>
<17, 4, 21>
<18, 9, 13>
<18, 9, 19>
<22, 12, 20>
<22, 12, 25>
<22, 24, 23>
<22, 4, 27>
<24, 16, 1>
<24, 16, 29>
<24, 23, 8>
<25, 7, 1>
<27, 14, 16>
<27, 14, 29>
<27, 4, 0>
<27, 4, 17>
<29, 16, 1>
<29, 17, 5> 

So, the number of 3-stars is 90, and the unique 3-stars found are the ones listed above.
