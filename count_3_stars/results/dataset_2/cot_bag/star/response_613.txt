Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 3) (0, 6) (0, 11) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges:
- Node 0: {6, 11}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 2: {1, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 9, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {3, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {9, 11}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {9, 11, 13}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 4, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 13: {4, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 6, 7, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3
- Node 4
- Node 6
- Node 7
- Node 9
- Node 10
- Node 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 62

Therefore, there are 62 3-stars in this graph. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<[3, 9, 5], [3, 9, 6], [3, 9, 7], [3, 9, 10], [3, 9, 11], [4, 10, 2], [4, 10, 13], [4, 10, 14], [4, 13, 8], [4, 13, 14], [6, 1, 7], [6, 1, 12], [6, 7, 1], [6, 7, 14], [6, 14, 2], [7, 1, 6], [7, 1, 12], [7, 6, 1], [7, 6, 14], [7, 14, 2], [9, 3, 10], [9, 3, 11], [9, 5, 11], [10, 2, 14], [10, 3, 11], [10, 3, 9], [10, 4, 14], [10, 4, 13], [10, 4, 3], [13, 8, 11], [13, 8, 9], [13, 8, 4], [13, 4, 3], [13, 4, 10], [13, 14, 4], [14, 2, 10], [14, 2, 4], [14, 2, 6], [14, 4, 13], [14, 4, 10], [14, 6, 7], [14, 6, 2], [14, 7, 1], [14, 7, 6]>
