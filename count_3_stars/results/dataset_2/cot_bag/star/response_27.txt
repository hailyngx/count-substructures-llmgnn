Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 22) (15, 25) (15, 24) (6, 9) (6, 26) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 20) (7, 21) (7, 25) (21, 7) (21, 26) (21, 11) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 29) (11, 21) (11, 10) (11, 5) (12, 10) (12, 27) (12, 18) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 17) (19, 8) (19, 20) (26, 6) (26, 21) (26, 5) (26, 2) (1, 17) (1, 28) (1, 24) (1, 4) (17, 27) (17, 1) (17, 0) (4, 27) (4, 1) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 0) (25, 15) (25, 7) (16, 29) (16, 23) (28, 1) (28, 8) (28, 14) (8, 19) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 24) (22, 3) (22, 4) (5, 11) (5, 26) (5, 2) (2, 26) (2, 5) (2, 20) (2, 14) (2, 0) (24, 15) (24, 1) (24, 8) (14, 28) (14, 8) (14, 2) (29, 10) (29, 16) (13, 4) (13, 23) (13, 0) (13, 18) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) (18, 12) (18, 13) (20, 9) (20, 19) (20, 2) (20, 23) (23, 16) (23, 13) (23, 20) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: <0, (2, 4, 13)>.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: <1, (4, 24, 28)>.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: <2, (0, 5, 14)>, <2, (5, 20, 26)>.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: <4, (0, 1, 13)>, <4, (13, 17, 27)>.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: <5, (2, 11, 26)>.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: <8, (14, 24, 28)>.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: <9, (3, 6, 20)>.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: <11, (5, 10, 21)>.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: <13, (0, 4, 18)>.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: <14, (2, 8, 28)>.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: <17, (1, 4, 27)>.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors: <20, (2, 9, 23)>.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: <26, (2, 5, 21)>.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
