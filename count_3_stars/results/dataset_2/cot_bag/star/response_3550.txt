Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 11) (12, 14) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 4) (10, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up we get: 
\( 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 65 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [65].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (3, 7, 13)>
<1, (5, 6, 11)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
