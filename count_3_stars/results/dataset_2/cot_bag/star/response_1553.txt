Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 16) (8, 18) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) (0, 17) (0, 6) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 12) (10, 4) (10, 16) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 17) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 11) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 18) (5, 4) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 19) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 6) (17, 19) (3, 14) (3, 9) (16, 8) (16, 10) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 17) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 3) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: neighbors 13, 14, 15, 9, 7
- Node 4: neighbors 10, 5, 2
- Node 6: neighbors 0, 14, 12, 17, 19
- Node 7: neighbors 13, 1, 11
- Node 9: neighbors 1, 11, 3 
- Node 11: neighbors 12, 7, 9, 18
- Node 12: neighbors 15, 6, 11
- Node 13: neighbors 1, 19, 7
- Node 14: neighbors 3, 1, 6, 18
- Node 16: neighbors 8, 10
- Node 17: neighbors 0, 2, 6, 19
- Node 18: neighbors 8, 14, 11

From this, we see that nodes 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 18 have three or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars they can each form:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 = 38 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (13, 14, 15)>, <1, (13, 14, 9)>, <1, (13, 15, 9)>, <1, (14, 15, 9)>, <1, (13, 14, 7)>, <1, (13, 15, 7)>, <1, (14, 15, 7)>, <1, (13, 9, 7)>, <1, (14, 9, 7)>, <1, (15, 9, 7)>, <4, (10, 5, 2)>, <6, (0, 14, 12)>, <6, (0, 14, 17)>, <6, (0, 12, 17)>, <6, (14, 12, 17)>, <6, (14, 12, 19)>, <6, (12, 17, 19)>, <7, (13, 11, 18)>, <9, (1, 11, 3)>, <11, (12, 7, 9)>, <11, (7, 9, 18)>, <11, (9, 3, 18)>, <17, (0, 6, 19)>.
