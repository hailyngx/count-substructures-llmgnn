Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 24) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 3) (3, 22) (3, 21) (3, 0) (6, 25) (6, 19) (9, 26) (9, 25) (9, 16) (18, 22) (18, 27) (18, 17) (26, 9) (26, 28) (26, 11) (26, 8) (2, 29) (2, 1) (2, 20) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 23) (29, 24) (29, 11) (23, 22) (23, 29) (23, 28) (7, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 28) (12, 14) (28, 26) (28, 23) (28, 12) (28, 17) (21, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (24, 13) (24, 2) (24, 29) (24, 4) (11, 26) (11, 29) (11, 14) (11, 19) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 8) (5, 25) (5, 16) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 20) (25, 6) (25, 9) (25, 5) (25, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 4) (17, 18) (17, 28) (17, 0) (17, 4) (8, 26) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 25) (16, 9) (16, 5) (27, 18) (4, 24) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 17) (20, 2) (20, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 \) = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].
