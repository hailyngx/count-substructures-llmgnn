Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 12) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (12, 11) (12, 1) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 13) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 4) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 4) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed from each of these nodes.

- Node 1: It has neighbors 5, 12, 14, and 13. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2: It has neighbors 5, 9, 7, and 0. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3: It has neighbors 5, 7, 6, and 13. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4: It has neighbors 5, 10, 13, and 0. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5: It has neighbors 9, 2, 1, 4, and 3. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: It has neighbors 10, 11, 3, and 8. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8: It has neighbors 10, 3, 14, 7, 6, and 1. So, it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: It has neighbors 5, 2, 10, and 0. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10: It has neighbors 9, 6, 8, 7, and 4. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 = 45.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [45].
