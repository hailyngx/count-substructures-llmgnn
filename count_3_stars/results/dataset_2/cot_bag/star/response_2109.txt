Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed from each node:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 33 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33], and the unique 3-stars are:
<5, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>
