Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 18) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 18) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 15) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 17) (8, 7) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 2) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 12) (6, 13) (17, 9) (17, 8) (17, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 18) (13, 6) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 14) (18, 12) (4, 17) (4, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 19) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5
- Node 1: 0, 5, 19
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7, 8, 15
- Node 3: 2, 4
- Node 4: 3, 17
- Node 5: 0, 1, 9, 15
- Node 6: 13
- Node 7: 2, 8, 19
- Node 8: 2, 7, 10, 17
- Node 9: 5, 12, 15, 17
- Node 10: 8, 11, 18
- Node 11: 10, 14, 16, 18
- Node 12: 9, 18, 19
- Node 13: 6
- Node 14: 11, 16, 18
- Node 15: 2, 5, 9
- Node 16: 11, 14
- Node 17: 4, 8, 9
- Node 18: 10, 11, 12, 14
- Node 19: 1, 7, 12

Based on the given information, the total number of 3-stars can be calculated by analyzing nodes with three or more neighbors. Let's find the unique 3-stars:
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with leaves 10, 14, 18: <11, (10, 14, 18)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 9, 15: <5, (1, 9, 15)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 7, 8: <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 10, 17: <8, (2, 10, 17)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 12, 17: <9, (5, 12, 17)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with leaves 10, 11, 14: <18, (10, 11, 14)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with leaves 9, 18, 19: <12, (9, 18, 19)>

The total number of 3-stars is [6].
