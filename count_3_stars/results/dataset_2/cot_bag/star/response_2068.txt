Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 13) (8, 7) (8, 11) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 13) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {5, 7, 0, 13}. There are \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars. 
2. Node 2 has 6 neighbors: {5, 9, 6, 10, 12, 3}. There are \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars.
3. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {9, 0, 2}. There is 1 3-star.
4. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {7, 10, 14, 7, 10}. There are \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
5. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {9, 6, 2, 1}. There are 4 3-stars.
6. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: {5, 7, 14, 2, 13}. There are 10 3-stars.
7. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {4, 6, 10, 8, 1}. There are 10 3-stars.
8. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {5, 2, 11, 3}. There are 4 3-stars.
9. Node 10 has 4 neighbors: {4, 7, 11, 2}. There are 4 3-stars.
10. Node 11 has 4 neighbors: {9, 10, 14, 8}. There are 4 3-stars.
11. Node 12 has 3 neighbors: {0, 2, 13}. There is 1 3-star.
12. Node 13 has 4 neighbors: {6, 14, 12, 1}. There are 4 3-stars.
13. Node 14 has 5 neighbors: {4, 6, 11, 0, 13}. There are 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \(4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 82\).

Therefore, there are a total of [82] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (5, 0, 13)>, <1, (5, 0, 7)>, <1, (5, 0, 13)>, <1, (7, 5, 0)>, <2, (5, 12, 10)>, <2, (5, 3, 9)>, <2, (12, 3, 9)>, <2, (6, 5, 9)>, <2, (6, 5, 12)>, <2, (6, 9, 10)>, <2, (6, 3, 10)>, <2, (10, 5, 9)>, <2, (10, 12, 3)>, <2, (10, 3, 9)>, <2, (10, 6, 5)>, <3, (9, 0, 2)>, <4, (7, 10, 14)>, <4, (7, 14, 10)>, <4, (10, 14, 7)>, <4, (10, 7, 14)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 9, 6)>, <6, (2, 13, 14)>, <6, (6, 13, 14)>, <6, (6, 2, 13)>, <7, (1, 4, 10)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 10)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 10, 6)>, <7, (4, 8, 6)>, <7, (6, 8, 4)>, <7, (6, 10, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <10, (2, 7, 11)>, <10, (2, 7, 14)>, <10, (7, 11, 2)>, <10, (7, 14, 2)>, <11, (8, 10, 14)>, <11, (8, 14, 10)>, <12, (0, 2, 13)>, <13, (1, 6, 14)>, <13, (6, 14, 1)>, <14, (0, 13, 12)>.
