Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 15) (21, 7) (21, 27) (21, 25) (21, 2) (21, 15) (18, 10) (18, 24) (22, 3) (28, 29) (28, 17) (28, 13) (28, 25) (29, 28) (29, 8) (29, 25) (17, 28) (17, 2) (1, 25) (1, 4) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 14) (19, 5) (19, 27) (8, 29) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 27) (9, 8) (9, 12) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 23) (6, 0) (24, 18) (24, 3) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 15) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 25) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 18) (10, 3) (3, 22) (3, 8) (3, 24) (3, 10) (23, 16) (23, 2) (23, 4) (20, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 20) (12, 15) (15, 7) (15, 21) (15, 11) (15, 12) (25, 21) (25, 28) (25, 29) (25, 1) (25, 14) (27, 21) (27, 19) (27, 8) (13, 28) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 23) (4, 13) (2, 21) (2, 17) (2, 16) (2, 23) 

Response:
There are 14 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 7, 21, 25, 28, 29, 8, 14, 0, 3, 16, 12, 15, 27, 4.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
1. Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
2. Node 21 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 25 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
6. Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
11. Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
12. Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
13. Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
14. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 77.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [77].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<21, (7, 25, 15)>

<29, (28, 8, 27)>
<8, (29, 14, 3)>
<14, (8, 25, 11)>
<0, (12, 5, 13)>
<3, (8, 24, 10)>
