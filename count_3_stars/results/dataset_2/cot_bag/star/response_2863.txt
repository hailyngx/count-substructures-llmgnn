Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 11) (9, 18) (9, 10) (9, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 11) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 18) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 8) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 16) (15, 10) (15, 11) (13, 17) (13, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 7) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 4) (4, 19) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 2) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 8) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 8) (2, 1) (2, 12) (18, 5) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 0) (6, 4) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 15) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, and 18.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has degree 5, thus it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has degree 4, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has degree 5, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has degree 5, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has degree 3, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has degree 2, can't form any 3-star.
- Node 16 has degree 4, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has degree 3, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has degree 5, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 40.

So, there are 40 total 3-stars in this graph.

Inside brackets: [40]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 8, 18)>, <8, (3, 10, 19)>, <10, (7, 15, 19)>, <16, (8, 10, 17)>
