Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors in this graph are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0, 7, 9, 2, and 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 1:
Node 1 has 4 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 9). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 1 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For Node 3:
Node 3 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 9). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 3 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For Node 4:
Node 4 has 4 neighbors (3, 8, 9, 0). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 4 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For Node 5:
Node 5 has 4 neighbors (1, 6, 0, 7). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 5 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For Node 6:
Node 6 has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 7, 8). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 6 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For Node 0:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors (4, 5, 7, 2). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 0 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For Node 7:
Node 7 has 5 neighbors (5, 6, 0, 2, 9). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 7 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For Node 9:
Node 9 has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 7, 8). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 9 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For Node 2:
Node 2 has 3 neighbors (3, 0, 7). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 2 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For Node 8:
Node 8 has 3 neighbors (4, 6, 9). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 8 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

Summing up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 42 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
