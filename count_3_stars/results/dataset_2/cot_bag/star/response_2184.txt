Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 17) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 16) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 3) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (19, 2) (19, 1) (13, 11) (13, 17) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (16, 4) (3, 18) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 8) (7, 9) (7, 18) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 14) (1, 19) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (15, 12) (12, 17) (12, 3) (12, 15) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify which nodes can be the centers of a 3-star based on their degree. 

First, let's determine the degree of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 1
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 2

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Nodes 3, 4, 11, and 17 have a degree of at least 3, so they can potentially be the centers of 3-stars. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 34 3-stars in this graph which can be represented as:

\[ [34] \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (12, 15, 17)>, <4, (14, 16, 18)>, <4, (18, 7, 14)>, <4, (11, 13, 17)>, <4, (14, 2, 5)>, <11, (4, 17, 13)>
