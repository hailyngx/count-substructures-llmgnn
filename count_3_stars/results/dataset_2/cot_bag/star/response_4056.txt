Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 14) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 9) (12, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
Here are the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 
\( 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 90 \)

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 90.
