Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

We'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Nodes 6, 8, and 9 do not have enough neighbors to form 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 \). 
The 3-stars are: 
<0, (5, 1, 3)>, 
<0, (5, 1, 9)>, 
<0, (5, 3, 8)>, 
<0, (5, 3, 1)>, 
<0, (5, 3, 6)>, 
<0, (5, 1, 2)>, 
<1, (5, 0, 3)>, 
<1, (5, 0, 9)>, 
<1, (5, 0, 2)>, 
<1, (5, 0, 9)>, 
<3, (1, 0, 5)>, 
<3, (1, 0, 5)>, 
<3, (1, 0, 5)>, 
<5, (0, 1, 3)>, 
<5, (0, 1, 9)>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [50].
