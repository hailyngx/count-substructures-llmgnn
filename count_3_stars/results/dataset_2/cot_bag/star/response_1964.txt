Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 1), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 2), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 6), (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 2), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 3), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 0), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2)}

Let's analyze the nodes to determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 5: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: [5 choose 3] = 10
- For node 3: [4 choose 3] = 4
- For node 4: [5 choose 3] = 10
- For node 5: [5 choose 3] = 10
- For node 7: [4 choose 3] = 4
- For node 8: [4 choose 3] = 4
- For node 9: [4 choose 3] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 46

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 46 and the unique 3-stars are as listed above.
