Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 13) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (11, 12) (11, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 9) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up these values, we get a total of 73 3-stars. So, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [73].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (8, 12, 14)>, <0, (8, 12, 5)>, <0, (8, 12, 11)>, <0, (8, 12, 10)>, <1, (13, 4, 5)>, <5, (8, 12, 14)>, <5, (8, 12, 11)>, <5, (8, 12, 14)>, <7, (12, 5, 14)>, <7, (12, 10, 11)>, <7, (12, 10, 0)>, <7, (12, 10, 6)>, <8, (7, 9, 14)>, <8, (7, 9, 2)>, <8, (7, 9, 13)>, <8, (9, 7, 14)>, <8, (9, 7, 13)>, <8, (9, 14, 5)>, <9, (8, 7, 14)>, <9, (8, 7, 2)>, <9, (8, 7, 13)>, <9, (8, 14, 5)>, <9, (14, 8, 5)>, <10, (12, 0, 6)>, <10, (12, 0, 11)>, <10, (12, 0, 14)>, <10, (3, 13, 9)>, <12, (7, 5, 14)>, <12, (7, 10, 11)>, <12, (7, 10, 14)>, <12, (0, 8, 13)>, <13, (0, 9, 4)>, <13, (0, 9, 1)>, <13, (0, 9, 3)>, <13, (9, 0, 1)>, <13, (9, 0, 3)>, <14, (1, 12, 11)>, <14, (1, 12, 5)>, <14, (1, 12, 10)>, <14, (12, 1, 5)>, <14, (12, 1, 11)>
