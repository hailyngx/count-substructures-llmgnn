Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 23) (3, 26) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (27, 21) (27, 11) (27, 16) (7, 15) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 14) (21, 27) (21, 7) (21, 4) (21, 18) (22, 19) (22, 4) (22, 6) (23, 3) (23, 11) (23, 6) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 20) (10, 29) (11, 0) (11, 27) (11, 23) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 18) (2, 10) (2, 29) (2, 9) (29, 10) (29, 2) (1, 15) (1, 26) (1, 5) (1, 28) (26, 3) (26, 1) (5, 1) (5, 25) (5, 24) (6, 22) (6, 23) (4, 21) (4, 22) (4, 20) (18, 21) (18, 13) (16, 27) (16, 7) (16, 28) (16, 20) (28, 1) (28, 16) (28, 9) (28, 12) (28, 25) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 28) (17, 3) (17, 8) (25, 5) (25, 28) (19, 22) (19, 12) (14, 7) (14, 8) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 28) (12, 19) (20, 10) (20, 4) (20, 16) (24, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 
- Node 3 with 6 neighbors: 15, 17, 23, 26, 12, 1
- Node 15 with 5 neighbors: 3, 1, 7, 9, 26
- Node 7 with 5 neighbors: 15, 21, 16, 14, 27
- Node 21 with 5 neighbors: 27, 7, 4, 18, 16
- Node 10 with 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 20, 29
- Node 11 with 4 neighbors: 0, 27, 23, 1
- Node 8 with 4 neighbors: 13, 14, 17, 12
- Node 2 with 4 neighbors: 10, 29, 9, 1
- Node 26 with 3 neighbors: 3, 1, 5
- Node 5 with 3 neighbors: 1, 25, 24
- Node 23 with 3 neighbors: 3, 11, 6
- Node 0 with 3 neighbors: 10, 11, 1
- Node 27 with 3 neighbors: 21, 11, 16
- Node 29 with 3 neighbors: 10, 2, 28
- Node 1 with 3 neighbors: 15, 26, 5
- Node 4 with 3 neighbors: 21, 22, 20
- Node 18 with 3 neighbors: 21, 13, 12
- Node 16 with 4 neighbors: 27, 7, 28, 20
- Node 28 with 5 neighbors: 1, 16, 9, 12, 25
- Node 9 with 4 neighbors: 15, 2, 28, 22
- Node 17 with 2 neighbors: 3, 8
- Node 25 with 2 neighbors: 5, 28
- Node 19 with 2 neighbors: 22, 12
- Node 14 with 2 neighbors: 7, 8

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 6 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \times 2 = 20 \)
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \)
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 (as only 1 unique 3-star is formed)

Adding up the totals: 20 + 20 + 24 + 1 = 65

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [65].
