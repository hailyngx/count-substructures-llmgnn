Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 15) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 0) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 5) (15, 4) (15, 10) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 1) (18, 16) (18, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 17) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 19) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 3) (17, 19) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 5) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 6) (19, 0) (19, 17) (19, 16) (5, 10) (5, 1) (5, 11) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 19) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to see if they can form any 3-stars.

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 5 neighbors
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 34 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 34 3-stars in the given graph. Represented inside brackets: [34]. 

And the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 17, 19)>, <2, (0, 17, 3)>, <3, (0, 7, 17)>, <4, (9, 10, 15)>, <5, (1, 10, 11)>, <6, (10, 11, 18)>, <7, (10, 3, 13)>, <8, (2, 12, 17)>, <9, (1, 4, 16)>, <10, (4, 5, 6)>, and <13, (7, 8, 12)>.
