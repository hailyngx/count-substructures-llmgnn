Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (12, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first check which nodes have three or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars. 

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {1, 3, 14}
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {0, 6, 7, 9}
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {3, 6, 10, 11}
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {5, 6, 7, 13}
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {3, 4, 11, 14}
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: {1, 4, 14, 1, 8}
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {1, 4, 7, 10, 11}
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {3, 6, 8, 10}
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: {1, 3, 10, 11, 13}
Node 10 has 4 neighbors: {2, 7, 8, 9}
Node 11 has 5 neighbors: {2, 5, 7, 9, 13}
Node 13 has 4 neighbors: {4, 8, 9, 11}
Node 14 has 3 neighbors: {0, 5, 6}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars each node can form:

[node 3] inom{5}{3} = 10
[node 6] inom{5}{3} = 10
[node 7] inom{5}{3} = 10
[node 9] inom{5}{3} = 10
[node 11] inom{5}{3} = 10

Summing up these numbers gives: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, 
<6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 14)>, <6, (1, 14, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 13)>, <6, (8, 13, 14)>, 
<7, (1, 9, 11)>, <7, (1, 9, 13)>, <7, (1, 11, 13)>, <7, (9, 11, 13)>, <7, (7, 10, 11)>, 
<9, (1, 3, 13)>, <9, (1, 13, 4)>, <9, (1, 13, 11)>, <9, (3, 4, 13)>, <9, (3, 8, 13)>, 
<11, (2, 5, 11)>, <11, (2, 11, 13)>, <11, (5, 11, 13)>, <11, (7, 9, 11)>, <11, (9, 11, 13)>. 

These 3-stars are listed only once to avoid repetition.
