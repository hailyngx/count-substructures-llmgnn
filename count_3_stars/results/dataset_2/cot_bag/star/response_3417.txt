Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 0) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 2) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of \(10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 73 \) 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [73].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 8, 10)>, 
<1, (3, 4, 10)>, 
<2, (1, 5, 12)>, 
<3, (1, 10, 13)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 10)>, 
<5, (0, 8, 12)>, 
<6, (1, 7, 13)>, 
<8, (0, 5, 12)>, 
<9, (1, 6, 14)>, 
<10, (0, 4, 8)>, 
<12, (2, 5, 8)>.
