Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 20) (26, 17) (26, 3) (3, 26) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 19) (25, 23) (25, 29) (25, 14) (10, 17) (10, 22) (17, 26) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 23) (8, 27) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 24) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 16) (29, 25) (29, 17) (29, 18) (21, 6) (21, 28) (21, 13) (28, 21) (28, 20) (22, 9) (22, 10) (22, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (0, 1) (0, 13) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 24) (16, 6) (16, 23) (18, 29) (18, 19) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 15) (19, 25) (19, 18) (19, 24) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 22) (12, 2) (12, 20) (12, 15) (14, 25) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 15) (13, 21) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 2) (27, 8) (23, 25) (23, 17) (23, 16) (23, 18) (23, 20) (20, 9) (20, 28) (20, 12) (20, 23) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 14) (24, 5) (24, 7) (24, 19) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first draw the graph using the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: 
(9, 22), (9, 15), (9, 20), 
(26, 17), (26, 3), 
(3, 26), (3, 25), (3, 11), (3, 2), 
(25, 3), (25, 19), (25, 23), (25, 29), (25, 14), 
(10, 17), (10, 22), 
(17, 26), (17, 10), (17, 29), (17, 23), 
(8, 27), (8, 7), 
(5, 6), (5, 24), (5, 7), 
(6, 5), (6, 21), (6, 16), 
(29, 25), (29, 17), (29, 18), 
(21, 6), (21, 28), (21, 13), 
(28, 21), (28, 20), 
(22, 9), (22, 10), (22, 12), 
(11, 3), (11, 14), 
(1, 13), (1, 0), 
(0, 1), (0, 13), 
(7, 8), (7, 5), (7, 24), 
(16, 6), (16, 23), 
(18, 29), (18, 19), (18, 23), (18, 14), (18, 15), 
(19, 25), (19, 18), (19, 24), 
(2, 3), (2, 12), (2, 13), 
(12, 22), (12, 2), (12, 20), (12, 15), 
(14, 25), (14, 11), (14, 18), (14, 15), 
(13, 21), (13, 1), (13, 0), (13, 2), 
(27, 8), 
(23, 25), (23, 17), (23, 16), (23, 18), (23, 20), 
(20, 9), (20, 28), (20, 12), (20, 23), 
(15, 9), (15, 18), (15, 12), (15, 14), 
(24, 5), (24, 7), (24, 19)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 10 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 63\]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 63. 

Therefore, the answer is [63].
