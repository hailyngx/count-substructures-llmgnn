Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6, 4, 2, 1
- Node 1: 5, 6, 4, 8, 0, 7
- Node 2: 9, 6, 0, 3
- Node 3: 5, 4, 8, 2, 7
- Node 4: 9, 0, 1, 3
- Node 5: 6, 1, 3
- Node 6: 5, 9, 1, 2, 8, 0
- Node 7: 3, 1
- Node 8: 6, 3, 1
- Node 9: 6, 4, 2

Now, we can count the total number of 3-stars using the given formula and determine the unique 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 5 3-stars: <1, (5, 6, 4)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 0)>, <1, (6, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 9, 2)>
- Node 3 forms 3 3-stars: <3, (5, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 6)>, <3, (8, 6, 2)>
- Node 4 forms 2 3-stars: <4, (9, 0, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 2)>
- Node 6 forms 5 3-stars: <6, (5, 1, 8)>, <6, (1, 8, 3)>, <6, (8, 3, 2)>, <6, (3, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 9, 4)>

There is a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
