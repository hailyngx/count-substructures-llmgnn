Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 10) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 1, node 4, and node 12. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and then sum them up.  

For node 1, we have \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.  
For node 4, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
For node 12, we have \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.  

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [20 + 10 + 35] = 65 \).  
  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<1, (2, 9, 13)>  
<1, (6, 9, 13)>  
<1, (0, 9, 13)>  
<1, (2, 6, 13)>  
<1, (0, 2, 13)>  
<4, (12, 7, 9)>  
<4, (12, 7, 3)>  
<4, (12, 9, 14)>  
<4, (12, 3, 7)>  
<4, (9, 7, 12)>  
<12, (0, 1, 3)>  
<12, (0, 2, 3)>  
<12, (1, 2, 3)>  
<12, (0, 2, 1)>  
<12, (4, 7, 9)>
