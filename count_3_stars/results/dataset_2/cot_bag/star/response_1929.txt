Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 1) 

Response:
Since this graph has 10 nodes, we will analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star with any other nodes. An edge between two nodes represents a connection between them.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 9, 3, and 8.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 3, and 6.
Node 2 has 1 neighbor: 1.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 9, 4, 1, 6, and 0.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 9, 8, and 3.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 9, 6, 8, 1, and 7.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 5, 1, 3, and 8.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 5, 8, and 1.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 7, and 6.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 5, 8, 4, 3, and 0.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0 and Node 2 have less than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.
Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 4, Node 7, and Node 8 form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star each.
Node 3, Node 5, and Node 9 form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Adding all the 3-stars: 4 (from Node 1) + 1 (from Node 4) + 1 (from Node 7) + 10 (from Node 3) + 10 (from Node 5) + 10 (from Node 9) = 36.
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (5, 7, 6)>, <4, (9, 3, 8)>, <7, (5, 8, 1)>, <3, (9, 5, 4)>, <5, (9, 8, 1)>, <9, (8, 5, 3)>.
