Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will analyze each node to determine how many 3-stars can be formed with that node as the center. 

Let's start our analysis:

- Node 0: 0 is connected to nodes 21, 27, 10, and 17 (degree 4), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
- Node 1: 1 is connected to nodes 20, 23, and 8 (degree 3), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2: 2 is connected to nodes 5, 3, and 20 (degree 3), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3: 3 is connected to nodes 15, 2, and 29 (degree 3), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5: 5 is connected to nodes 2, 28, and 16 (degree 3), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6: 6 is connected to nodes 15, 22, 11, 20, and 13 (degree 5), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: 9 is connected to nodes 26 and 23 (degree 2), which is less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 11: 11 is connected to nodes 28, 24, 6, and 25 (degree 4), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13: 13 is connected to nodes 7, 10, 29, 14, and 6 (degree 5), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14: 14 is connected to nodes 16, 24, and 13 (degree 3), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 15: 15 is connected to nodes 27, 3, and 6 (degree 3), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 16: 16 is connected to nodes 5, 12, 19, and 14 (degree 4), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18: 18 is connected to nodes 19, 10, and 25 (degree 3), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 19: 19 is connected to nodes 18, 4, and 16 (degree 3), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 20: 20 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6 (degree 3), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 21: 21 is connected to nodes 0, 23 (degree 2), which is less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 22: 22 is connected to nodes 6 and 28 (degree 2), which is less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 23: 23 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 21, and 17 (degree 4), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24: 24 is connected to nodes 11, 28, 14, and 29 (degree 4), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25: 25 is connected to nodes 26, 11, 18 (degree 3), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 26: 26 is connected to nodes 9, 25 (degree 2), which is less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 27: 27 is connected to nodes 15, 0 (degree 2), which is less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 28: 28 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 22, 11, and 24 (degree 5), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29: 29 is connected to nodes 3, 24, and 13 (degree 3), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 51 \) 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (21, 27, 17)>, <1, (20, 8, 23)>, <2, (5, 3, 20)>, <3, (15, 2, 29)>, <5, (2, 28, 16)>, <6, (15, 22, 11)>, <6, (15, 20, 13)>, <6, (22, 11, 13)>, <6, (11, 20, 13)>, <6, (11, 24, 13)>, <11, (28, 24, 25)>, <13, (7, 29, 14)>, <13, (10, 29, 14)>, <13, (29, 24, 14)>, <13, (6, 11, 13)>, <13, (6, 20, 13)>, <14, (16, 24, 13)>, <16, (5, 12, 19)>, <16, (5, 19, 14)>, <16, (12, 19, 14)>, <16, (12, 16, 14)>, <18, (19, 10, 25)>, <19, (18, 4, 16)>, <20, (1, 2, 6)>, <23, (9, 1, 17)>, <23, (9, 1, 21)>, <23, (9, 1, 27)>, <23, (1, 8, 23)>, <24, (11, 28, 14)>, <25, (26, 11, 18)>.
