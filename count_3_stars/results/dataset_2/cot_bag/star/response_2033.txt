Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's write down the number of neighbors for each node:  
Node 0 has 3 neighbors.  
Node 1 has 5 neighbors.  
Node 2 has 6 neighbors.  
Node 3 has 4 neighbors.   
Node 4 has 4 neighbors.   
Node 5 has 3 neighbors.   
Node 6 has 3 neighbors.   
Node 7 has 6 neighbors.  
Node 8 has 2 neighbors.  
Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

Now, let's go through each node that has 3 or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed.
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.
For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed.
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.
For node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed.
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.

Adding these up: \( 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 69 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [69].

Some unique 3-stars in this graph are:  
<0, (4, 7, 2)>  
<1, (5, 6, 3)>  
<2, (9, 7, 1)>  
<3, (7, 1, 4)>  
<4, (1, 3, 7)>  
<7, (1, 3, 9)>  
<9, (6, 2, 7)>
