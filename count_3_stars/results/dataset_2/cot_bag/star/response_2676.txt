Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 7) (16, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 16) (7, 2) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 13) (15, 4) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 13) (10, 14) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 14) (19, 13) (19, 12) (18, 10) (18, 17) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 8) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 15) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 17) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 10) (13, 19) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 17) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 2
Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 14, 15
Node 2: 0, 7, 11, 17
Node 3: 1, 14
Node 4: 1, 5, 9, 15
Node 5: 0, 4
Node 6: 1, 8
Node 7: 2, 16
Node 8: 6, 14, 16
Node 9: 4, 13
Node 10: 13, 14, 15, 18
Node 11: 2, 12, 13
Node 12: 11, 17, 19
Node 13: 9, 10, 11, 15, 19
Node 14: 1, 3, 8, 10
Node 15: 1, 4, 10, 13
Node 16: 7, 8
Node 17: 2, 12, 17, 18
Node 18: 10, 17
Node 19: 12, 13

Nodes 1, 4, and 10 have 5 neighbors each, hence they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
Nodes 13 and 15 have 5 neighbors each, hence they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
Nodes 2, 8, and 14 have 4 neighbors each, hence they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
Nodes 0, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 17, and 19 have 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, and 2 neighbors respectively, hence they cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:

\[ 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42 \]

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 10, 14)>
<4, (1, 10, 15)>
<10, (13, 14, 15)>
<13, (9, 10, 15)>
<2, (7, 11, 17)>
<2, (7, 8, 16)>
<8, (6, 14, 16)>
<14, (1, 8, 10)>
<15, (1, 10, 13)>
