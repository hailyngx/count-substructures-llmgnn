Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 14) (14, 1) (14, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and determine the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form.

Node 1 has 7 neighbors: 3, 14, 10, 13, 4, 7, 3
There are 7 choose 3 = 35 ways to form 3-stars involving node 1.

Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 8
There is only 1 3-star that can be formed with node 3.

Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 3, 11, 0, 8, 7
There are 5 choose 3 = 10 ways to form 3-stars involving node 5.

Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 6, 9, 1, 0, 5
There are 5 choose 3 = 10 ways to form 3-stars involving node 7.

Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 3, 0, 2, 12, 5
There are 5 choose 3 = 10 ways to form 3-stars involving node 8.

Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 6, 4, 10, 7, 13
There are 5 choose 3 = 10 ways to form 3-stars involving node 9.

Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 9, 1, 11, 0, 2
There are 5 choose 3 = 10 ways to form 3-stars involving node 10.

Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 6, 11, 2, 8, 14
There are 5 choose 3 = 10 ways to form 3-stars involving node 12.

The total number of 3-stars is 35 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 96

So, putting the final number inside brackets gives us [96].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
