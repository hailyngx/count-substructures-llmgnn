Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 11) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 7) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 7) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 12) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 13) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 7) (14, 9) (14, 3) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 1) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 10) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we will calculate the number of 3-stars associated with each such node.

From the given edges, we can construct the following node degrees:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 2

Therefore, only nodes 4, 5, 8, 9 have three or more neighbors, making them potential centers of 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these potential centers:
1. Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
2. Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3. Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
4. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is denoted by [50].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (0, 8, 11)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 11)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (5, 9, 11)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 4, 11)>, <4, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<5, (1, 8, 13)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 13)>, <5, (4, 6, 11)>, <5, (4, 9, 11)>, <5, (8, 13, 14)>, <5, (8, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 14)>, <5, (4, 8, 13)>, 
<8, (1, 2, 10)>, <8, (2, 7, 13)>, <8, (2, 10, 13)>, <8, (4, 10, 11)>, <8, (2, 10, 7)>, <8, (4, 10, 13)>, <8, (4, 7, 11)>, <8, (4, 2, 10)>, <8, (4, 8, 10)>, <8, (2, 8, 13)>, 
<9, (1, 12, 14)>, <9, (4, 8, 14)>, <9, (4, 14, 12)>, <9, (6, 12, 14)>, <9, (4, 12, 14)>, <9, (4, 6, 14)>, <9, (4, 6, 12)>, <9, (5, 8, 13)>, <9, (5, 8, 14)>, <9, (5, 13, 14)>, 

So the final list of unique 3-stars is <4, (0, 8, 11)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 11)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (5, 9, 11)>, <5, (1, 8, 13)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 13)>, 
<8, (1, 2, 10)>, <8, (2, 7, 13)>, <8, (2, 10, 13)>, <9, (1, 12, 14)>, <9, (4, 8, 14)>, <9, (6, 12, 14)>, <9, (5, 8, 13)>.
