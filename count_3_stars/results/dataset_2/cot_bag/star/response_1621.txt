Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 14) (20, 24) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 0) (25, 18) (10, 9) (10, 16) (17, 27) (17, 15) (28, 27) (28, 22) (28, 19) (29, 1) (29, 7) (29, 19) (29, 21) (0, 25) (0, 14) (0, 23) (14, 20) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (1, 29) (1, 26) (1, 13) (26, 1) (26, 15) (26, 21) (26, 6) (9, 10) (9, 22) (9, 3) (22, 28) (22, 9) (22, 6) (5, 25) (5, 8) (19, 28) (19, 29) (19, 3) (19, 13) (2, 6) (2, 11) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 24) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 21) (12, 14) (12, 16) (16, 10) (16, 12) (7, 29) (7, 24) (7, 27) (8, 14) (8, 5) (8, 21) (15, 17) (15, 26) (24, 20) (24, 3) (24, 7) (18, 25) (18, 27) (27, 17) (27, 28) (27, 7) (27, 18) (27, 13) (4, 23) (4, 6) (23, 0) (23, 4) (6, 26) (6, 22) (6, 2) (6, 4) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 27) (21, 29) (21, 26) (21, 11) (21, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 20, node 25, and node 29.

For node 20:
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 25, 14, and 24.
- With node 20 as the center, there are 1 possible 3-star: <20, (25, 14, 24)>.

For node 25:
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 20, 5, and 0.
- With node 25 as the center, there are 1 possible 3-star: <25, (20, 5, 0)>.

For node 29:
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 19, and 21.
- With node 29 as the center, there are 4 possible 3-stars: <29, (1, 7, 19)>, <29, (1, 19, 21)>, <29, (7, 19, 21)>, <29, (1, 7, 21)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4] = 6.
