Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (16, 17) (13, 22) (13, 20) (13, 24) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 27) (22, 10) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 14) (9, 29) (9, 2) (9, 15) (0, 20) (0, 21) (0, 26) (20, 13) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 14) (28, 11) (28, 7) (28, 24) (28, 2) (24, 13) (24, 28) (24, 4) (26, 0) (26, 20) (26, 2) (26, 27) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 19) (1, 8) (15, 9) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 7) (29, 9) (29, 1) (29, 7) (29, 27) (10, 22) (10, 21) (10, 12) (10, 18) (21, 5) (21, 0) (21, 10) (21, 23) (19, 1) (19, 15) (7, 28) (7, 15) (7, 29) (2, 9) (2, 28) (2, 26) (2, 4) (4, 24) (4, 2) (17, 16) (27, 22) (27, 26) (27, 29) (23, 15) (23, 21) (23, 14) (23, 25) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 6) (6, 12) (25, 1) (25, 23) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 8) (8, 1) (8, 18) (14, 5) (14, 20) (14, 23) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with more than 3 neighbors. These nodes will potentially form 3-stars:
- Node 13 has neighbors {22, 20, 24, 18}.
- Node 20 has neighbors {13, 0, 26, 14}.
- Node 28 has neighbors {11, 7, 24, 2}.
- Node 24 has neighbors {13, 28, 4}.
- Node 26 has neighbors {0, 20, 2, 27}.
- Node 1 has neighbors {15, 29, 25, 19, 8}.
- Node 15 has neighbors {9, 1, 19, 23, 7}.
- Node 29 has neighbors {9, 1, 7, 27}.
- Node 21 has neighbors {5, 0, 10, 23}.
- Node 5 has neighbors {12, 21, 14}.
- Node 12 has neighbors {5, 10, 14, 6}.
- Node 10 has neighbors {22, 21, 12, 18}.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the 3-stars for each of these nodes: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 44 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<13, (22, 20, 18)>, 
<20, (13, 0, 14)>, 
<28, (11, 7, 2)>, 
<24, (13, 28, 4)>, 
<26, (0, 20, 27)>, 
<1, (15, 29, 25)>, 
<1, (15, 19, 8)>, 
<15, (9, 1, 19)>, 
<15, (23, 7, 1)>, 
<29, (9, 1, 7)>, 
<21, (5, 0, 23)>, 
<7, (28, 15, 29)>, 
<12, (5, 10, 14)>, 
<10, (22, 21, 18)>.
