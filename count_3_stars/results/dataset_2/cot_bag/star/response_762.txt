Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's first list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 4, 3, 5
- Node 1: 4, 7, 3, 8
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 9, 5, 0
- Node 4: 7, 8, 0, 1
- Node 5: 7, 3, 6, 0
- Node 6: 7, 9, 5, 2, 8
- Node 7: 4, 6, 9, 5, 1
- Node 8: 4, 1, 6, 9, 2
- Node 9: 7, 3, 6, 8

Nodes 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <4, (0, 1, 8)>
    - <4, (0, 1, 7)>
    - <4, (0, 1, 8)>
    - <4, (1, 7, 8)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - <6, (2, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (8, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (2, 7, 5)>
    - <6, (8, 7, 5)>
    - <6, (2, 5, 9)>
    - <6, (8, 5, 9)>
    - <6, (2, 8, 9)>
    - <6, (2, 7, 8)>
    - <6, (7, 5, 9)>
    - <6, (2, 5, 8)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - <7, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <7, (8, 6, 9)>
    - <7, (1, 6, 5)>
    - <7, (8, 6, 5)>
    - <7, (1, 5, 9)>
    - <7, (8, 5, 9)>
    - <7, (1, 8, 9)>
    - <7, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <7, (6, 5, 9)>
    - <7, (1, 5, 8)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - <8, (2, 4, 9)>
    - <8, (6, 4, 9)>
    - <8, (2, 4, 5)>
    - <8, (6, 4, 5)>
    - <8, (2, 5, 9)>
    - <8, (6, 5, 9)>
    - <8, (2, 6, 9)>
    - <8, (2, 4, 6)>
    - <8, (4, 5, 9)>
    - <8, (2, 5, 6)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <9, (3, 6, 8)>
    - <9, (7, 6, 8)>
    - <9, (3, 6, 5)>
    - <9, (7, 6, 5)>

Adding all these up, we get a total of [38] 3-stars in this graph.
