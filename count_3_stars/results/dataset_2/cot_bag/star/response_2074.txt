Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: Neighbor - 6
- Node 1: Neighbors - 9, 7, 5, 2
- Node 2: Neighbors - 5, 1
- Node 3: Neighbors - 6, 9, 7, 5
- Node 4: Neighbors - 9, 7, 8
- Node 5: Neighbors - 6, 7, 8, 2, 1, 3
- Node 6: Neighbors - 9, 5, 3, 8, 0
- Node 7: Neighbors - 4, 3, 5, 1, 8
- Node 8: Neighbors - 6, 9, 4, 7, 5
- Node 9: Neighbors - 6, 8, 4, 3, 1

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 15 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 15 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 21.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (9, 7, 5)>
<3, (9, 5, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (7, 4, 1)>
<5, (8, 6, 0)>
<5, (1, 9, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 2)>
<5, (1, 5, 3)>
<5, (2, 5, 1)>
<6, (9, 5, 3)>
<7, (4, 3, 5)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
<9, (8, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 5)>
<9, (8, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 3)>
<9, (6, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 9, 1)>
<9, (9, 1, 7)>
