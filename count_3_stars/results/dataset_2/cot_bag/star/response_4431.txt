Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 9) 

Response:
Applying the conditions we discussed earlier, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars.

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 10, 11, 8, 13, 12, 2, 5, 9, 1, 6, 14. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors -> 4 3-stars
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors -> 4 3-stars
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors -> 4 3-stars
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors -> 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors -> 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors -> 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors -> \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors -> 4 3-stars
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors -> 10 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 64

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [64].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars:
