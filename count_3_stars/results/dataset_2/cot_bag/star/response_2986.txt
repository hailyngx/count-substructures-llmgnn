Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's build the graph based on the given information:

The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
The edges are: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (7, 9), (7, 0), (7, 2), (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 3), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 0), (8, 6), (8, 2), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 2), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 0)

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars and list the unique ones:

For node 0: 3-stars formed with node 0 are <0, (5, 4, 3)>, <0, (9, 7, 2)>, <0, (9, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 1, 3)>. Total = 4
For node 1: 3-stars formed with node 1 are <1, (5, 6, 3)>, <1, (5, 4, 0)>, <1, (6, 4, 3)>, <1, (6, 5, 3)>. Total = 4
For node 2: No 3-stars can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
For node 3: 3-stars formed with node 3 are <3, (5, 6, 1)>, <3, (5, 4, 0)>, <3, (6, 1, 0)>, <3, (6, 5, 0)>. Total = 4
For node 4: 3-stars formed with node 4 are <4, (5, 1, 0)>, <4, (5, 3, 0)>, <4, (1, 6, 3)>, <4, (1, 6, 5)>. Total = 4
For node 5: 3-stars formed with node 5 are <5, (9, 6, 3)>, <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (9, 6, 0)>, <5, (1, 4, 3)>. Total = 4
For node 6: 3-stars formed with node 6 are <6, (5, 9, 1)>, <6, (5, 9, 3)>, <6, (5, 9, 0)>, <6, (1, 4, 3)>. Total = 4
For node 7: 3-stars formed with node 7 are <7, (9, 0, 2)>, <7, (9, 0, 3)>, <7, (9, 0, 5)>. Total = 3
For node 8: No 3-stars can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
For node 9: 3-stars formed with node 9 are <9, (5, 6, 0)>, <9, (5, 6, 1)>, <9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (7, 0, 2)>. Total = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4] = [27]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 4, 3)>, <0, (9, 7, 2)>, <0, (9, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 1, 3)>, <1, (5, 6, 3)>, <1, (5, 4, 0)>, <1, (6, 4, 3)>, <1, (6, 5, 3)>, <3, (5, 6, 1)>, <3, (5, 4, 0)>, <3, (6, 1, 0)>, <3, (6, 5, 0)>, <4, (5, 1, 0)>, <4, (5, 3, 0)>, <4, (1, 6, 3)>, <4, (1, 6, 5)>, <5, (9, 6, 3)>, <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (9, 6, 0)>, <5, (1, 4, 3)>, <6, (5, 9, 1)>, <6, (5, 9, 3)>, <6, (5, 9, 0)>, <6, (1, 4, 3)>, <7, (9, 0, 2)>, <7, (9, 0, 3)>, <7, (9, 0, 5)>, <9, (5, 6, 0)>, <9, (5, 6, 1)>, <9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (7, 0, 2)>
