Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 23) (22, 17) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 12) (23, 13) (20, 25) (20, 7) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 1) (25, 8) (25, 28) (12, 23) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 9) (12, 28) (27, 12) (27, 10) (27, 6) (0, 1) (0, 19) (5, 23) (5, 6) (5, 18) (6, 27) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (28, 25) (28, 12) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 10) (19, 0) (19, 29) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 15) (13, 23) (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 9) (18, 5) (18, 26) (8, 25) (8, 11) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 21) (10, 27) (10, 29) (21, 9) (21, 4) (21, 24) (4, 12) (4, 21) (11, 8) (11, 24) (24, 21) (24, 11) (24, 14) (15, 26) (15, 7) (15, 16) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (14, 20) (14, 24) (14, 3) (14, 7) (7, 20) (7, 15) (7, 14) (1, 25) (1, 0) (1, 13) (17, 22) (17, 23) (17, 2) (16, 15) (16, 2) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 5: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 7: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 8: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 10: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 13: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 14: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 15: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 17: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 19: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 20: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 21: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 23: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 24: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 25: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 26: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 27: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 28: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 29: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 43

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [43].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 25, 13>
<2, 17, 27>
<4, 9, 21>
<5, 23, 12>
<6, 3, 14>
<7, 20, 15>
<8, 11, 24>
<10, 29, 27>
<14, 3, 7>
<15, 16, 26>
<26, 13, 18>
<20, 7, 14>
<21, 9, 4>
<24, 11, 14>
<25, 1, 8>
<23, 5, 22>
