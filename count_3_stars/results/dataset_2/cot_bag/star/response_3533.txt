Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a visual representation of the graph to better understand its structure:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (5, 9), (5, 4), (5, 0), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 0), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 7), (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 3), (4, 2), (7, 9), (7, 6), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 1), (8, 4), (8, 0), (8, 1), (2, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 2), (3, 0)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 4: inom{6}{3} = 20
For node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 50

So, the total number of 3-stars is [50].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <0, (5, 2, 3)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (8, 0, 3)>
- <7, (9, 1, 6)>
