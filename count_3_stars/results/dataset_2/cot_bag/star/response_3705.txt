Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 10) (14, 17) (14, 16) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 1) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 18) (10, 15) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 9) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 11) (4, 12) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 1) (18, 13) (18, 12) (18, 4) (18, 9) (1, 17) (1, 4) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 16) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 9) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 16) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

1: 4, 17
2: 4, 5, 10
3: 5, 15
4: 1, 2, 12, 18
5: 2, 3, 7, 11
6: 7, 11, 16
7: 5, 6, 12
8: 0, 13, 16
9: 10, 16, 18
10: 2, 9, 14, 15, 17
11: 5, 6, 12
12: 4, 7, 11, 18, 0
13: 8, 18
14: 10, 16, 17
15: 3, 10
16: 6, 8, 9, 14
17: 1, 10, 14
18: 4, 9, 12, 13

Now let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms the 3-star <4, (1, 2, 12)>.
- Node 5 forms the 3-star <5, (2, 3, 7)>.
- Node 7 forms the 3-star <7, (5, 6, 12)>.
- Node 10 forms the 3-star <10, (2, 14, 15)>.
- Node 12 forms the 3-star <12, (4, 7, 18)>.
- Node 16 forms the 3-star <16, (6, 8, 14)>.

Adding up the 6 unique 3-stars found, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
