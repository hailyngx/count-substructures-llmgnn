Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's examine each node to determine the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 9, 2, 3, 7. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars with node 0 as the center: <0, (9, 2, 3)>, <0, (9, 2, 7)>, <0, (9, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>.

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 4, 8, 7. There's only 1 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (4, 8, 7)>.

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 4, 8, 3, 0. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars with node 2 as the center: <2, (4, 8, 3)>, <2, (4, 3, 0)>, <2, (4, 8, 0)>, <2, (8, 3, 0)>.

- Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 5, 9, 8, 2, 0, 7. So, there are \( \binom{6}{3} \) = 20 3-stars with node 3 as the center: <3, (5, 9, 8)>, <3, (5, 9, 2)>, <3, (5, 9, 0)>, <3, (5, 9, 7)>, <3, (5, 8, 2)>, <3, (5, 8, 0)>, <3, (5, 8, 7)>, <3, (5, 2, 0)>, <3, (5, 2, 7)>, <3, (5, 0, 7)>, <3, (9, 8, 2)>, <3, (9, 8, 0)>, <3, (9, 8, 7)>, <3, (9, 2, 0)>, <3, (9, 2, 7)>, <3, (9, 0, 7)>, <3, (8, 2, 0)>, <3, (8, 2, 7)>, <3, (8, 0, 7)>, <3, (2, 0, 7)>.

- Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 only have 3 neighbors each, so there are no 3-stars formed with these nodes as the center.

The total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 29.
Thus, the final answer is [29].
