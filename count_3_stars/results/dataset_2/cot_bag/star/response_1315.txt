Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 18) (10, 15) (10, 16) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 19) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 11) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 13) (8, 18) (8, 6) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 19) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 15) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 5) (11, 2) (11, 1) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 16) (3, 13) (16, 10) (16, 3) (9, 0) (9, 13) (5, 4) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 13) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can represent the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 17, 18, 14, 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 14, 11, 5
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 11
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 17, 2, 16, 13
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 5, 1, 2
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 1
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 8, 13
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 12, 15, 19, 18
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 18, 6
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 13
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 15, 16
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 2, 1
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 14
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 14, 3, 9, 6
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 12, 0, 1, 13
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 7, 10, 19
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 10, 3
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 3, 0, 19
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 7, 0, 8
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 7, 17, 15

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, 7: <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 15, 19: <7, (4, 15, 19)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, 14: <13, (6, 9, 14)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 13, 12: <14, (1, 13, 12)>

Since each of these nodes has exactly 3 neighbors, each 3-star is counted only once. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 4.

Putting this final count inside brackets, we have [4].
