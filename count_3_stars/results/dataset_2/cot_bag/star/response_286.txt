Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 9, 6, 8, 5, 3, 1, and 0.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>
