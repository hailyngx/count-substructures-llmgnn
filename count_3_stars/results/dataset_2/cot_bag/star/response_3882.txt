Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node with three or more neighbors.
We will go through each node to see if it forms a 3-star and then count the total number of 3-stars.

Starting with the first node:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 8, 14, 3, 19, 13
- So, Node 0 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Continuing with the remaining nodes:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 17, 13
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 4, 14, 3
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 10, 0, 7, 2
- So, Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 8, 2, 16, 15
- So, Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor: 17
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor: 17
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 19, 9, 3, 15
- So, Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 4, 15, 0
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 18, 7, 12
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 11, 3, 16
- So, Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors: 10, 12
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 11, 17, 13, 9
- So, Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 12, 18
- So, Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors: 0, 2
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 4, 8, 7
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 10, 4, 17
- So, Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors: 1, 6, 16, 12, 5
- So, Node 17 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors: 13, 9
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors: 0, 7

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
10 (from Node 0) + 1 (from Node 3) + 1 (from Node 4) + 1 (from Node 7) + 1 (from Node 10) + 1 (from Node 12) + 1 (from Node 13) + 1 (from Node 16) + 10 (from Node 17) = 27

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 8, 14>
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 14, 2>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 13, 18>
<3, 10, 16>
<4, 8, 15>
<7, 9, 18>
<10, 11, 12>
<12, 13, 9>
<12, 17, 5>
<12, 17, 6>
<13, 0, 1>
<13, 1, 17>
<14, 0, 8>
<16, 4, 17>
<17, 12, 9>
<17, 16, 4>
<17, 16, 10>
<17, 5, 12>
