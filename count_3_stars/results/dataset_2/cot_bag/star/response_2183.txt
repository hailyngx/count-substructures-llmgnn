Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 10) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 7) (1, 11) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 1) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 5) 

Response:
To begin, let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(6, 9), (6, 3), (6, 12), (6, 4), (6, 8), 
(9, 6), (9, 10), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 13), 
(4, 6), (4, 0), (4, 10), (4, 5), 
(8, 6), (8, 2), (8, 11), (8, 12), (8, 7), 
(0, 4), (0, 14), 
(14, 0), (14, 7), (14, 13), 
(2, 8), (2, 1), (2, 10), 
(5, 4), (5, 13), (5, 10), 
(13, 9), (13, 14), (13, 5), (13, 3), (13, 7), 
(12, 6), (12, 8), (12, 11), (12, 1), 
(3, 6), (3, 13), (3, 7), 
(7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 14), (7, 13), (7, 3), (7, 1), 
(1, 9), (1, 2), (1, 12), (1, 7), (1, 11), 
(11, 8), (11, 12), (11, 1), 
(10, 9), (10, 4), (10, 2), (10, 5)

Next, let's determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with neighbors:
 Node 6 has 5 neighbors
 Node 9 has 5 neighbors
 Node 4 has 4 neighbors
 Node 8 has 5 neighbors
 Node 0 has 2 neighbors
 Node 14 has 3 neighbors
 Node 2 has 3 neighbors
 Node 5 has 3 neighbors
 Node 13 has 5 neighbors
 Node 12 has 4 neighbors
 Node 3 has 3 neighbors
 Node 7 has 6 neighbors
 Node 1 has 5 neighbors
 Node 11 has 3 neighbors
 Node 10 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 77\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 77. 

Putting this number inside brackets, we get: [77]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<6, (9, 4, 8)>
<9, (6, 4, 13)>
<4, (6, 0, 5)>
<8, (6, 2, 12)>
<0, (4, 14, 7)>
<14, (0, 7, 13)>
<2, (8, 1, 10)>
<5, (4, 13, 10)>
<13, (9, 14, 5)>
<12, (6, 8, 11)>
<3, (6, 13, 7)>
<7, (9, 8, 14)>
<1, (9, 2, 12)>
<11, (8, 12, 1)>
<10, (9, 4, 5)>
