Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 2) (15, 8) (14, 17) (14, 0) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 11) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 6) (13, 8) (10, 17) (10, 19) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 19) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 11) (12, 9) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 19) (4, 1) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 16) (19, 10) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 9) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 18) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 18) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 19) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's list those nodes:

- Node 0: neighbors 14, 7, 11, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 1: neighbors 16, 4, 19 (degree 3)
- Node 2: neighbors 15, 17, 5 (degree 3)
- Node 8: neighbors 3, 15, 13, 5, 6 (degree 5)
- Node 11: neighbors 17, 0, 12, 18 (degree 4)
- Node 12: neighbors 7, 16, 11, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 15: neighbors 3, 2, 8 (degree 3)
- Node 16: neighbors 7, 12, 1, 18 (degree 4)
- Node 17: neighbors 14, 10, 2, 11 (degree 4)
- Node 19: neighbors 10, 6, 1, 18, 9 (degree 5)

Now we'll count the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 34 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].
