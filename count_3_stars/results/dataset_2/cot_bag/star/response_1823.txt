Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 0) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 18) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 18) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 4) (3, 14) (3, 8) (11, 9) (11, 4) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 14) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 19) (18, 6) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 4) (2, 12) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 13) (5, 17) (5, 15) (8, 3) (14, 3) (14, 15) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 0) (13, 9) (13, 0) 

Response:
The nodes that have at least 3 neighbors are: 6, 9, 10, 17, 1, 15, 19, and 4. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<6, (9, 15, 18)>, <6, (9, 15, 19)>, <6, (9, 18, 19)>, <6, (15, 18, 19)>

- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<9, (6, 17, 10)>, <9, (6, 17, 1)>, <9, (6, 17, 5)>, <9, (6, 17, 18)>, <9, (6, 1, 17)>, <9, (6, 1, 15)>, <9, (17, 10, 18)>, <9, (17, 10, 0)>, <9, (17, 1, 15)>, <9, (17, 5, 15)>

- For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<10, (17, 0, 18)>

- For node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<17, (9, 10, 1)>, <17, (9, 10, 5)>, <17, (9, 1, 5)>, <17, (9, 1, 15)>, <17, (10, 1, 5)>, <17, (10, 1, 18)>, <17, (1, 5, 15)>, <17, (1, 15, 18)>, <17, (5, 15, 18)>, <17, (15, 1, 18)>

- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<1, (17, 15, 4)>

- For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<15, (6, 17, 5)>, <15, (6, 17, 14)>, <15, (17, 5, 14)>, <15, (17, 16, 14)>

- For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<19, (6, 16, 18)>

- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<4, (1, 11, 19)>, <4, (1, 19, 0)>, <4, (11, 19, 0)>, <4, (19, 0, 13)>

Adding all the 3-stars up, we get a total of [32].
