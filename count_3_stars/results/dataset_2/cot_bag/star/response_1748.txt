Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can create the following graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 7), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 1), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 1), (7, 8), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 0), (3, 9), (3, 6), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 0), (8, 6), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 0), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 1), (0, 8), (0, 2)

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 1), (0, 8), (0, 2) -> inom{5}{3} = 10

Node 1: (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 0) -> inom{4}{3} = 4

Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 1) -> inom{5}{3} = 10

Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 7) -> inom{4}{3} = 4

Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 2) -> inom{5}{3} = 10

Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 1), (7, 8) -> inom{5}{3} = 10

Node 8: (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 0), (8, 6) -> inom{4}{3} = 4

Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 0) -> inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 43

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [43].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 4, 1)>
<0, (9, 4, 8)>
<0, (9, 1, 8)>
<0, (4, 1, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 1)>
<4, (5, 1, 0)>
<5, (6, 7, 4)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
