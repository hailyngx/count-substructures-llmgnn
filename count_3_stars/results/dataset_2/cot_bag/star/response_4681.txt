Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are as follows: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 2 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 69

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [69].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (2, 9, 4)>, <2, (6, 9, 4)>, <2, (9, 6, 7)>, <2, (9, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 1)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 8, 1)>, <4, (9, 5, 4)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (9, 6, 5)>, <5, (9, 8, 7)>, <6, (9, 8, 0)>, <8, (9, 6, 0)>.
