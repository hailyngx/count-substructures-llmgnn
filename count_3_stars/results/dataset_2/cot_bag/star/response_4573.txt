Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 9) (10, 0) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 1) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 1) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 15) (13, 2) (13, 15) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 7) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 15) (7, 5) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (15, 14) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19}

Edges: 
- 0: (10), 1: (11, 18, 4, 0, 12), 2: (16, 6, 18, 13), 3: (5), 4: (16, 8, 19, 1), 5: (3, 7, 12), 6: (7, 2, 18, 12), 7: (6, 19, 15, 5), 8: (11, 4, 14), 9: (11, 10), 10: (9, 0), 11: (16, 1, 19, 9, 8), 12: (6, 1, 5), 13: (2, 15), 14: (8, 15), 15: (14, 13, 19, 7), 16: (11, 2, 4), 18: (6, 2, 1), 19: (11, 4, 15, 7)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in the graph. First, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 15, and 19 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes 1, 8, 11, and 19 (as they have exactly 3 neighbors), each forms 1 3-star.
- For nodes 2, 4, 6, and 15 (as they have more than 3 neighbors), we calculate: \( \binom{d}{3} \), where d is the degree of the node.

Calculating:
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 (node 1) + 1 (node 8) + 1 (node 11) + 1 (node 19) + 4 (node 2) + 1 (node 4) + 4 (node 6) + 4 (node 15) = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 12, 1)>
<8, (11, 8, 14)>
<11, (9, 8, 11)>
<19, (4, 15, 7)>
<2, (16, 6, 18)>
<4, (16, 4, 19)>
<6, (12, 1, 6)>
<15, (14, 15, 13)>
