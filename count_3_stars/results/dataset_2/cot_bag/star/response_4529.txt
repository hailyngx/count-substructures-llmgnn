Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: [5 choose 3] = 10 3-stars
- Node 12: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 13: [3 choose 3] = 1 3-star
- Node 14: [3 choose 3] = 1 3-star
- Node 19: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 21: [3 choose 3] = 1 3-star
- Node 25: [5 choose 3] = 10 3-stars
- Node 26: [3 choose 3] = 1 3-star
- Node 28: [3 choose 3] = 1 3-star
- Node 29: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 41

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [41].
