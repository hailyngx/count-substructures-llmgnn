Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 29) (9, 8) (9, 12) (4, 24) (4, 10) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 10) (0, 27) (0, 17) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 26) (27, 8) (22, 14) (22, 20) (22, 29) (23, 25) (23, 1) (28, 6) (28, 16) (28, 2) (29, 9) (29, 22) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 13) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 21) (19, 3) (26, 27) (26, 19) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 10) (20, 22) (20, 12) (20, 21) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 16) (21, 19) (21, 20) (21, 13) (21, 2) (1, 23) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 8) (8, 9) (8, 27) (8, 1) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 14) (17, 4) (17, 0) (17, 24) (15, 5) (15, 12) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 1) (3, 19) (14, 22) (14, 8) (14, 13) (12, 9) (12, 20) (12, 15) (24, 4) (24, 27) (24, 17) (24, 25) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 25) (25, 23) (25, 24) (25, 18) (2, 28) (2, 21) (2, 13) 

Response:
Calculating the degree of each node:  
Node 0: degree 2  
Node 1: degree 4  
Node 2: degree 3  
Node 3: degree 1  
Node 4: degree 3  
Node 5: degree 2  
Node 6: degree 4  
Node 7: degree 3  
Node 8: degree 4  
Node 9: degree 3  
Node 10: degree 4  
Node 11: degree 3  
Node 12: degree 3  
Node 13: degree 4  
Node 14: degree 3  
Node 15: degree 2  
Node 16: degree 3  
Node 17: degree 3  
Node 18: degree 3  
Node 19: degree 4  
Node 20: degree 3  
Node 21: degree 4  
Node 22: degree 3  
Node 23: degree 2  
Node 24: degree 4  
Node 25: degree 3  
Node 26: degree 3  
Node 27: degree 4  
Node 28: degree 3  
Node 29: degree 3  

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars and list them:  

For nodes with degree 3 or more:  
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star  
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star  
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star  
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star  
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star  
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star  
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star  
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star  
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star  
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star  
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star  
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star  
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star  
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star  
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star  
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star  
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star  

There are a total of [17] 3-stars in the graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<1, 8, 27>  
<2, 13, 21>  
<4, 10, 16>  
<6, 13, 21>  
<9, 12, 20>  
<11, 1, 7>  
<14, 8, 13>  
<15, 5, 12>  
<19, 11, 1>  
<24, 4, 25>  
<28, 2, 6>  
<29, 9, 22>
