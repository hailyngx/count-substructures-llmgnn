Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes have the following connections:

Node 0: connected to nodes 7, 3, 1
Node 1: connected to nodes 4, 9, 5, 2, 8, 0
Node 2: connected to nodes 4, 6, 5, 1
Node 3: connected to nodes 7, 6, 9, 0
Node 4: connected to nodes 7, 2, 9, 1
Node 5: connected to nodes 7, 2, 1
Node 6: connected to nodes 7, 3, 2, 8
Node 7: connected to nodes 4, 6, 5, 0, 3
Node 8: connected to nodes 6, 9, 1
Node 9: connected to nodes 4, 8, 3, 1

Now, let's identify the centers of 3-stars and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

The centers of 3-stars in this graph are nodes:
- Node 1 (degree 6)
- Node 2 (degree 4)
- Node 4 (degree 4)
- Node 7 (degree 5)
- Node 9 (degree 4)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 1
- For node 2: 1 3-star with node 2
- For node 4: 1 3-star with node 4
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7
- For node 9: 1 3-star with node 9

\[ [20 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1] = 33 \]

Therefore, there are 33 3-stars in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (8, 9, 0)>
<1, (8, 9, 5)>
<1, (0, 7, 3)>
<1, (3, 7, 5)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 5)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (7, 9, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 8, 3)>
