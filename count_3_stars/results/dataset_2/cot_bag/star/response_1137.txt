Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 4) (4, 0) (4, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 11) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that have three or more neighbors.
Let's identify such nodes:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {8, 1, 11, 0}
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {6, 10, 0, 12}
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {9, 1, 7, 8}
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: {5, 6, 2, 10, 3}
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors: {5, 9, 7, 10, 11, 4}
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: {6, 0, 3, 10, 14, 13}
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: {5, 6, 14, 10, 12}
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors: {9, 8, 0, 7, 1, 13}
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {8, 7, 12}
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: {7, 1, 4}
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: {0, 14}
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: {7, 10, 11}
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: {5, 0, 13, 12}
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: {9, 1, 3, 11}

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars per node
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars per node
- For nodes with 6 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars per node

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 5 contributes 4 3-stars
- Node 9 contributes 4 3-stars
- Node 6 contributes 4 3-stars
- Node 8 contributes 10 3-stars
- Node 0 contributes 20 3-stars
- Node 7 contributes 20 3-stars
- Node 1 contributes 10 3-stars
- Node 10 contributes 20 3-stars
- Node 3 contributes 1 3-star
- Node 14 contributes 1 3-star
- Node 13 contributes 1 3-star
- Node 11 contributes 4 3-stars
- Node 12 contributes 4 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [103] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, 8, 0>
- <9, 6, 0>
- <6, 9, 1>
- <8, 5, 6>
- <0, 9, 7>
- <7, 6, 0>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <10, 9, 8>
- <0, 7, 3>
- <7, 10, 14>
- <1, 14, 4>
- <13, 10, 11>
- <11, 5, 0>
- <12, 9, 1>
