- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors
- Node 10: 6 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: No 3-star (Less than 3 neighbors)
For node 1: No 3-star (Exactly 3 neighbors)
For node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <2, (9, 13, 8)>, <2, (9, 13, 10)>, <2, (9, 13, 14)>, <2, (13, 10, 14)>
For node 3: No 3-star (Exactly 3 neighbors)
For node 4: No 3-star (Less than 3 neighbors)
For node 5: No 3-star (Less than 3 neighbors)
For node 6: No 3-star (Less than 3 neighbors)
For node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <7, (9, 12, 10)>, <7, (9, 12, 14)>, <7, (12, 13, 14)>, <7, (12, 13, 10)>
For node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars <8, (9, 13, 10)>, <8, (9, 13, 14)>, <8, (9, 10, 14)>, <8, (13, 10, 14)>, <8, (13, 10, 9)>, <8, (13, 14, 9)>, <8, (14, 10, 9)>, <8, (14, 13, 9)>, <8, (10, 14, 9)>, <8, (10, 13, 9)>
For node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars <9, (2, 13, 14)>, <9, (2, 13, 10)>, <9, (2, 14, 10)>, <9, (13, 10, 14)>, <9, (13, 2, 14)>, <9, (13, 2, 10)>, <9, (10, 14, 2)>, <9, (10, 13, 2)>, <9, (14, 13, 2)>, <9, (14, 10, 2)>
For node 10: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars <10, (13, 8, 14)>, <10, (13, 8, 9)>, <10, (13, 8, 10)>, <10, (13, 14, 9)>, <10, (13, 14, 8)>, <10, (13, 14, 12)>, <10, (8, 14, 9)>, <10, (8, 14, 13)>, <10, (8, 9, 13)>, <10, (8, 9, 14)>, <10, (8, 9, 10)>, <10, (14, 9, 13)>, <10, (14, 9, 8)>, <10, (14, 13, 8)>, <10, (14, 13, 12)>, <10, (9, 8, 13)>, <10, (9, 8, 14)>, <10, (9, 13, 14)>, <10, (9, 13, 8)>, <10, (9, 14, 8)>
For node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <11, (1, 14, 10)>, <11, (1, 14, 9)>, <11, (1, 14, 12)>, <11, (14, 10, 12)>
For node 12: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars <12, (7, 9, 13)>, <12, (7, 9, 14)>, <12, (7, 13, 14)>, <12, (9, 13, 14)>, <12, (9, 13, 7)>, <12, (9, 14, 7)>, <12, (13, 14, 7)>, <12, (13, 14, 9)>, <12, (14, 9, 13)>, <12, (14, 9, 7)>
For node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <13, (8, 10, 14)>, <13, (8, 10, 9)>, <13, (8, 10, 13)>, <13, (10, 14, 9)>
For node 14: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars <14, (1, 8, 10)>, <14, (1, 8, 13)>, <14, (1, 8, 9)>, <14, (1, 10, 8)>, <14, (1, 10, 13)>, <14, (1, 10, 9)>, <14, (8, 13, 9)>, <14, (8, 13, 10)>, <14, (8, 9, 10)>, <14, (8, 9, 13)>, <14, (10, 9, 13)>, <14, (10, 9, 8)>, <14, (10, 13, 8)>, <14, (10, 13, 9)>, <14, (13, 9, 8)>, <14, (13, 9, 10)>, <14, (13, 8, 10)>, <14, (13, 8, 9)>, <14, (9, 8, 10)>, <14, (9, 8, 13)>

So the total number of 3-stars is:
0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 72

Thus, the final answer is [72].
