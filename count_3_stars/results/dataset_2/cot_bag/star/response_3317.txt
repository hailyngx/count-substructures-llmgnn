Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 1) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 14) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 1) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Now, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 45

So, there are 45 total 3-stars in this graph.

List of unique 3-stars found:
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (9, 10, 11)>
<10, (1, 12, 4)>
<12, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [45].
