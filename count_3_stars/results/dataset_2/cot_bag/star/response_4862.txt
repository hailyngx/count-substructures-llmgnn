Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Nodes with their corresponding neighbors:
- Node 0: {6, 9, 8, 2, 5}
- Node 1: {6, 2, 9}
- Node 2: {7, 1, 3, 5, 0}
- Node 3: {7, 9, 2}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 9, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 2, 0}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 3, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 6, 0}
- Node 9: {4, 1, 3, 0}

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 
\[ [ 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 ] = [ 49 ] \]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 2, 5)>, <0, (9, 2, 5)>, <0, (8, 2, 5)>, <1, (6, 9, 2)>, <2, (7, 3, 5)>, <4, (7, 8, 5)>, <4, (7, 9, 5)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 9, 8)>
