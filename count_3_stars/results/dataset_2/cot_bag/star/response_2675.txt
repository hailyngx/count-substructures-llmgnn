Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (2, 9) (2, 11) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 11) (1, 9) (1, 17) (17, 1) (17, 5) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 5) (15, 8) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 5) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 16) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 5) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 16) (12, 13) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 18) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 19) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 18) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 13) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 6, 8, 9, 2, 1, 15, 11, 4, 13, and 18. We will now calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

1. Node 6:
   - Total neighbors: 3
   - Number of 3-stars: 0

2. Node 8:
   - Total neighbors: 4
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <8, (6, 15, 11)>, <8, (19, 15, 11)>, <8, (15, 19, 4)>, <8, (11, 15, 14)>

3. Node 9:
   - Total neighbors: 3
   - Number of 3-stars: 0

4. Node 2:
   - Total neighbors: 3
   - Number of 3-stars: 0

5. Node 1:
   - Total neighbors: 2
   - Number of 3-stars: 0

6. Node 15:
   - Total neighbors: 4
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <15, (8, 10, 18)>, <15, (10, 5, 18)>, <15, (5, 14, 18)>, <15, (18, 16, 13)>

7. Node 11:
   - Total neighbors: 5
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <11, (9, 2, 12)>, <11, (2, 8, 14)>, <11, (8, 10, 14)>, <11, (10, 15, 14)>, <11, (15, 18, 14)>, <11, (18, 16, 14)>, <11, (16, 12, 14)>, <11, (12, 13, 14)>, <11, (13, 4, 12)>, <11, (4, 19, 12)>

8. Node 4:
   - Total neighbors: 3
   - Number of 3-stars: 0

9. Node 13:
   - Total neighbors: 4
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <13, (6, 12, 4)>, <13, (12, 4, 18)>, <13, (4, 19, 18)>, <13, (18, 15, 6)>

10. Node 18:
   - Total neighbors: 3
   - Number of 3-stars: 0

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node: 
\[ 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 0 = 22 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the given graph is [22].
