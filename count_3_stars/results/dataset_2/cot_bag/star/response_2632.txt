Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we'll first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, we apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up all these 3-stars gives us a final count of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 52 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
