Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
Since the graph has 10 nodes, we will check each node to see if it forms a 3-star. We will exclude nodes with less than 3 neighbors.

Node 0: Forms a 3-star with 3, 6, and 9. <0, (3, 6, 9)>
Node 1: Forms a 3-star with 3, 4, and 8. <1, (3, 4, 8)>
Node 3: Forms a 3-star with 1, 4, and 7. <3, (1, 4, 7)>
Node 4: Forms a 3-star with 1, 0, and 5. <4, (1, 0, 5)>
Node 5: Forms a 3-star with 3, 4, and 7. <5, (3, 4, 7)>
Node 7: Forms a 3-star with 0, 3, and 8. <7, (0, 3, 8)>
Node 9: Forms a 3-star with 6, 8, and 5. <9, (6, 8, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [7].
