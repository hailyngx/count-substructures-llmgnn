Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 11) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 6, 9, 3, 13, 10, 11, 12.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

The total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10] = 52 \).

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are: <6, (9, 11, 14)>, <6, (3, 1, 4)>, <6, (3, 7, 2)>, <6, (3, 13, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 10)>, <9, (6, 11, 14)>, <3, (6, 1, 4)>, <3, (6, 7, 2)>, <3, (6, 13, 8)>, <3, (6, 5, 10)>, <13, (8, 11, 14)>, <10, (11, 6, 14)>, <10, (11, 13, 8)>, <10, (11, 5, 3)>, <10, (11, 12, 6)>.
