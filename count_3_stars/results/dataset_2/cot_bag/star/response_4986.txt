Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 17) (16, 4) (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 19) (10, 11) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 17) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 18) (13, 14) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 6) (2, 15) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (15, 11) (15, 14) (15, 2) (6, 19) (6, 12) 

Response:
There are several nodes with exactly three neighbors or more:

- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up:
4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34

So, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<11, (0, 8, 15)>
<5, (4, 8, 10)>
<9, (1, 7, 12)>
<4, (5, 7, 16)>
<7, (4, 14, 9)>
<1, (0, 9, 17)>
<10, (3, 5, 17)>
<14, (3, 13, 15)>
<8, (11, 9, 18)>
<18, (6, 12, 19)>
