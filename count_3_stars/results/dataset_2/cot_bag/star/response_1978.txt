Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 3) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 13) (5, 14) (5, 1) (5, 10) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 10) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, and 14.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<0, (6, 2, 4)>, <0, (6, 2, 3)>, <0, (6, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 4)>

For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<1, (9, 7, 5)>, <1, (9, 5, 13)>, <1, (7, 5, 13)>, <1, (9, 7, 13)>

For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<2, (4, 8, 0)>, <2, (4, 11, 3)>, <2, (4, 0, 3)>, <2, (4, 3, 11)>, <2, (8, 11, 3)>, <2, (8, 0, 3)>, <2, (8, 3, 11)>, <2, (11, 0, 3)>, <2, (11, 3, 0)>, <2, (0, 3, 11)>

For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
<3, (12, 0, 13)>

For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<4, (7, 2, 0)>, <4, (7, 14, 0)>, <4, (2, 14, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 14)>

For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<6, (9, 12, 0)>, <6, (9, 7, 0)>, <6, (9, 8, 0)>, <6, (9, 0, 13)>, <6, (9, 0, 14)>, <6, (12, 7, 3)>, <6, (12, 13, 3)>, <6, (7, 8, 4)>, <6, (7, 1, 4)>, <6, (8, 1, 5)>

For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
<7, (4, 1, 2)>

For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<8, (11, 2, 3)>, <8, (11, 2, 10)>, <8, (11, 3, 10)>, <8, (2, 3, 10)>

For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
<9, (6, 1, 14)>

For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
<12, (6, 3, 13)>

For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
<13, (3, 1, 12)>

For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
<14, (5, 8, 9)>

Adding all these up, we have a total of [34] 3-stars.
