Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 16) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 11) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 16) (4, 9) (18, 13) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (5, 13) (5, 19) (13, 18) (13, 5) (13, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 8) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 6) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 8) (12, 15) (12, 2) (1, 2) (1, 8) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 6) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 13) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 0, 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, and 19. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: There are 4 neighbors (2, 7, 14, 16), so it can form 4 3-stars. 
<0, (2, 7, 16)>
<0, (2, 7, 14)>
<0, (7, 14, 16)>
<0, (2, 14, 16)>

- For node 2: There are 3 neighbors (0, 1, 12), so it can form 1 3-star. 
<2, (0, 1, 12)>

- For node 6: There are 4 neighbors (3, 11, 15, 19), so it can form 4 3-stars. 
<6, (3, 11, 15)>
<6, (3, 11, 19)>
<6, (3, 15, 19)>
<6, (11, 15, 19)>

- For node 8: There are 4 neighbors (1, 7, 14, 16), so it can form 4 3-stars. 
<8, (1, 7, 14)>
<8, (1, 7, 16)>
<8, (1, 14, 16)>
<8, (7, 14, 16)>

- For node 9: There are 4 neighbors (3, 4, 13, 14), so it can form 4 3-stars. 
<9, (3, 4, 13)>
<9, (3, 4, 14)>
<9, (3, 13, 14)>
<9, (4, 13, 14)>

- For node 10: There are 3 neighbors (7, 15, 17), so it can form 1 3-star. 
<10, (7, 15, 17)>

- For node 13: There are 3 neighbors (5, 9, 18), so it can form 1 3-star. 
<13, (5, 9, 18)>

- For node 14: There are 4 neighbors (0, 9, 17, 8), so it can form 4 3-stars. 
<14, (0, 9, 17)>
<14, (0, 9, 8)>
<14, (0, 17, 8)>
<14, (9, 17, 8)>

- For node 15: There are 4 neighbors (3, 6, 12, 16), so it can form 4 3-stars. 
<15, (3, 6, 12)>
<15, (3, 6, 16)>
<15, (3, 12, 16)>
<15, (6, 12, 16)>

- For node 19: There are 3 neighbors (5, 6, 11), so it can form 1 3-star. 
<19, (5, 6, 11)>

Summing up, there are 25 3-stars in total: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 25.  
So, the final answer is [25].
