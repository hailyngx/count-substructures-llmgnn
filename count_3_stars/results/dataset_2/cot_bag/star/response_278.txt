Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 19) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 0) (18, 13) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (15, 17) (15, 7) (13, 17) (13, 18) (13, 19) (16, 7) (16, 3) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 9) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 9) (6, 17) (6, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 9) (4, 17) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 3) (8, 7) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 3) (3, 16) (3, 4) (3, 9) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
There are three nodes in this graph that have more than three neighbors: node 7, node 13, and node 19.

For node 7:
- 3-stars: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - <7, (15, 17, 11)>
  
For node 13:
- 3-stars: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
  - <13, (17, 18, 19)>
  
For node 19:
- 3-stars: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
  - <19, (10, 11, 13)>
  - <19, (10, 9, 4)>
  - <19, (11, 13, 9)>
  - <19, (11, 9, 4)>
  - <19, (13, 17, 18)>
  - <19, (13, 18, 4)>
  - <19, (9, 11, 4)>
  - <19, (9, 14, 11)>
  - <19, (9, 14, 12)>
  - <19, (4, 9, 3)>
  
Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 10 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
