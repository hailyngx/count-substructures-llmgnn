Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars
- Node 2 forms $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars
- Node 3 forms $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars
- Node 4 forms $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars
- Node 5 forms $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars
- Node 6 forms $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars
- Node 7 forms $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars
- Node 8 forms $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $ 3-star
- Node 9 forms $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get $ 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 45 $.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, 
<1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (1, 5, 6)>, 
<6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, 
<6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, 
<9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>.
