Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 13) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 11) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (12, 5) (11, 7) (11, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 10) 

Response:
In this graph, nodes 4, 7, 1, 8, 6, 0, 14, 9, 2, 5, 3, 12, 11, 10, and 13 all have at least 3 neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars with each of these nodes:

- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by each node, we get a total of \( [] = 100 \) 3-stars in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
