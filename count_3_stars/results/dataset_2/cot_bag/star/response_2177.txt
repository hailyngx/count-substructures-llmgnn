Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 17) (7, 10) (7, 17) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 10) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 18) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 2) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 0) (15, 13) (15, 12) (15, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (9, 3) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 16) (6, 1) (6, 2) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 14) (16, 5) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 12) (17, 4) (17, 7) (2, 19) (2, 15) (2, 6) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 12) 

Response:
Since the graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can start by checking each node and counting how many neighbors it has.

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 forms inom{5}{3} = 10  3-stars
- Node 2 forms inom{3}{3} = 1  3-star
- Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4  3-stars
- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4  3-stars
- Node 10 forms inom{4}{3} = 4  3-stars
- Node 11 forms inom{3}{3} = 1  3-star
- Node 13 forms inom{4}{3} = 4  3-stars
- Node 14 forms inom{4}{3} = 4  3-stars
- Node 16 forms inom{4}{3} = 4  3-stars
- Node 19 forms inom{5}{3} = 10  3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].

And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 11, 19)>
<1, (5, 13, 16)>
<1, (5, 19, 2)>
<1, (10, 5, 16)>
<1, (10, 5, 3)>
<1, (11, 3, 19)>
<1, (11, 19, 2)>
<1, (13, 5, 18)>
<1, (13, 18, 14)>
<1, (14, 13, 12)>
<1, (14, 13, 18)>
<1, (14, 18, 12)>
<1, (19, 5, 11)>
<1, (19, 5, 8)>
<1, (19, 11, 8)>
<1, (19, 18, 14)>
<2, (6, 1, 14)>
<2, (6, 2, 15)>
<2, (12, 15, 14)>
<5, (13, 5, 19)>
