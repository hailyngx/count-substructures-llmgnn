Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 12) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 5 with neighbors 9, 6, 4, and 7.
- Node 9 with neighbors 5, 14, 3, 1, and 12.
- Node 4 with neighbors 5, 7, 12, 3, and 11.
- Node 7 with neighbors 5, 4, 10, 1, and 8.
- Node 6 with neighbors 5, 2, 12, and 0.
- Node 2 with neighbors 6, 13, 10, and 0.
- Node 13 with neighbors 2, 3, 14, and 0.
- Node 12 with neighbors 9, 4, 6, and 0.
- Node 0 with neighbors 6, 2, 13, and 12.
- Node 10 with neighbors 7, 2, 8, 3, and 14.
- Node 14 with neighbors 9, 13, 10, and 11.
- Node 3 with neighbors 9, 4, 13, and 10.
- Node 1 with neighbors 9, 7, and 8.
- Node 8 with neighbors 7, 10, and 1.
- Node 11 with neighbors 4 and 14.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes with more than three neighbors:
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 64 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [64].
The unique 3-stars found are: <5, (9, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 14, 3)>, <4, (5, 7, 12)>, <7, (5, 4, 10)>, <6, (5, 2, 12)>, <2, (6, 13, 10)>, <13, (2, 3, 14)>, <12, (9, 4, 6)>, <0, (6, 2, 13)>, <10, (7, 2, 8)>, <14, (9, 13, 10)>, <3, (9, 4, 13)>.
