Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 8) (29, 3) (6, 8) (6, 16) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 12) (20, 26) (20, 11) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 16) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 3) (11, 1) (28, 11) (28, 23) (3, 29) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 19) (4, 27) (4, 12) (4, 15) (27, 25) (27, 4) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 17) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 12) (15, 4) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 5) (22, 2) (22, 8) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 23) (14, 27) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 7) (10, 24) (26, 20) (26, 10) (26, 7) (18, 9) (18, 27) (16, 6) (16, 25) (16, 17) (16, 23) (24, 10) (7, 29) (7, 10) (7, 26) (17, 27) (17, 16) (17, 21) (23, 28) (23, 12) (23, 16) (0, 9) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (19, 3) (19, 0) (13, 25) (13, 3) (13, 15) (5, 15) (5, 21) (8, 29) (8, 6) (8, 22) (8, 0) (21, 17) (21, 5) 

Response:
There are several nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, which will form 3-stars. Let's identify those:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are:
- Node 0
- Node 5
- Node 6
- Node 14
- Node 21
- Node 22
- Node 24
- Node 28

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: 1 3-star
- For Node 5: 1 3-star
- For Node 6: 1 3-star
- For Node 14: 1 3-star
- For Node 21: 1 3-star
- For Node 22: 1 3-star
- For Node 24: 1 3-star
- For Node 28: 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 8, 15, 19>
<5, 15, 21>
<6, 8, 16, 25>
<14, 27, 17>
<21, 5, 15>
<22, 2, 8>
<24, 10, 7>
<28, 11, 23>
