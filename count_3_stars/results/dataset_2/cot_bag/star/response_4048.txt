Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 2) (18, 23) (22, 26) (22, 14) (3, 25) (3, 9) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 15) (25, 0) (25, 4) (0, 25) (0, 24) (0, 29) (20, 17) (20, 15) (20, 14) (7, 25) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 5) (12, 10) (12, 9) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 17) (8, 6) (26, 22) (26, 5) (26, 29) (26, 11) (26, 16) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 21) (28, 17) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 19) (17, 20) (17, 2) (17, 28) (17, 1) (17, 21) (4, 25) (4, 27) (27, 4) (27, 24) (27, 9) (21, 6) (21, 17) (5, 7) (5, 26) (5, 10) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 26) (16, 19) (11, 26) (11, 1) (14, 22) (14, 20) (14, 10) (23, 18) (23, 13) (23, 19) (15, 25) (15, 20) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 23) (19, 29) (19, 10) (29, 0) (29, 26) (29, 19) (29, 24) (24, 0) (24, 27) (24, 29) (24, 9) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 19) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 27) (9, 24) (13, 23) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. 

Let's analyze the neighbors of each node to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Neighbors - 25, 24, 29
2. Node 1: Neighbors - 17, 11, 19
3. Node 2: Neighbors - 18, 16, 17
4. Node 3: Neighbors - 25, 9
5. Node 4: Neighbors - 25, 27
6. Node 5: Neighbors - 26, 7, 10
7. Node 6: Neighbors - 7, 8, 21
8. Node 7: Neighbors - 25, 16, 6
9. Node 8: Neighbor - 6
10. Node 9: Neighbors - 3, 12, 27, 24
11. Node 10: Neighbors - 12, 5, 14, 19
12. Node 11: Neighbors - 26, 1
13. Node 12: Neighbors - 10, 9
14. Node 13: Neighbor - 23
15. Node 14: Neighbors - 22, 20, 10
16. Node 15: Neighbors - 25, 20
17. Node 16: Neighbors - 2, 7, 26, 19
18. Node 17: Neighbors - 20, 2, 28, 1, 21
19. Node 19: Neighbors - 1, 16, 23, 29, 10
20. Node 20: Neighbors - 17, 15, 14
21. Node 21: Neighbors - 6, 17
22. Node 22: Neighbors - 26, 14
23. Node 23: Neighbors - 18, 13, 19
24. Node 24: Neighbors - 0, 27, 29, 9
25. Node 25: Neighbors - 3, 7, 15, 0, 4
26. Node 26: Neighbors - 22, 5, 29, 11, 16
27. Node 27: Neighbors - 4, 24, 9
28. Node 28: Neighbor - 17
29. Node 29: Neighbors - 0, 26, 19, 24

By counting the number of 3-stars at each node that has three or more neighbors, we have:
- Node 25 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 10] = 20 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<25, (0, 4, 15)>
<25, (0, 7, 15)>
<25, (0, 15, 4)>
<25, (0, 15, 7)>
<25, (4, 15, 7)>
<25, (7, 0, 15)>
<25, (7, 15, 0)>
<25, (15, 0, 4)>
<25, (15, 0, 7)>
<25, (15, 4, 7)>
<19, (1, 10, 23)>
<19, (1, 10, 29)>
<19, (1, 23, 29)>
<19, (10, 23, 29)>
<19, (16, 23, 29)>
<19, (1, 23, 10)>
<19, (1, 29, 10)>
<19, (10, 29, 23)>
<19, (16, 29, 23)>
<19, (16, 23, 1)>
