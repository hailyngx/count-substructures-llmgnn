Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: 
- 0: {12, 3}
- 1: {2, 10, 4, 11}
- 2: {1, 11, 4}
- 3: {13, 0, 11}
- 4: {2, 11, 1, 6}
- 5: {9, 8, 7, 14}
- 6: {12, 10, 4}
- 7: {5, 9, 13, 12, 11, 14}
- 8: {5, 13}
- 9: {5, 14, 7, 13, 12}
- 10: {13, 1, 6}
- 11: {7, 12, 2, 3, 1, 4}
- 12: {9, 7, 14, 0, 6, 11}
- 13: {9, 8, 7, 3, 10}
- 14: {5, 9, 7, 12}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

For each node that has three or more neighbors, we'll calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors of that node.

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <5, (9, 7, 14)>
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  - <7, (5, 9, 13)>, <7, (5, 9, 12)>, <7, (5, 9, 14)>, <7, (5, 13, 12)>, <7, (5, 13, 14)>, <7, (9, 13, 12)>, <7, (9, 13, 14)>, <7, (9, 12, 14)>
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  - <12, (9, 7, 14)>, <12, (9, 7, 6)>, <12, (7, 14, 6)>, <12, (0, 3, 11)>, <12, (0, 3, 6)>, <12, (0, 11, 6)>, <12, (3, 11, 6)>, <12, (3, 0, 11)>
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <13, (7, 10, 1)>, <13, (7, 10, 6)>, <13, (7, 1, 6)>, <13, (10, 1, 6)>, <13, (10, 1, 4)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <1, (2, 10, 4)>
  
Adding them up, we have a total of 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 58 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [58]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <5, (9, 7, 14)>, <7, (5, 9, 13)>, <7, (5, 9, 12)>, <7, (5, 9, 14)>, <7, (5, 13, 12)>, <7, (5, 13, 14)>, <7, (9, 13, 12)>, <7, (9, 13, 14)>, <12, (9, 7, 14)>, <12, (9, 7, 6)>, <12, (7, 14, 6)>, <12, (0, 3, 11)>, <12, (0, 3, 6)>, <12, (0, 11, 6)>, <12, (3, 11, 6)>, <12, (3, 0, 11)>, <13, (7, 10, 1)>, <13, (7, 10, 6)>, <13, (7, 1, 6)>, <13, (10, 1, 6)> and <13, (10, 1, 4)>.
