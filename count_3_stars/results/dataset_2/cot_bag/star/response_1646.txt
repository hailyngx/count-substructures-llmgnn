Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 19) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 15) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 12) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 8) (15, 9) (15, 1) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 10) (19, 16) (19, 7) (19, 0) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (12, 3) (12, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 11) (5, 4) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 2) (18, 12) (18, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars from each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 55.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [55].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 10, 19)>, <1, (3, 13, 18)>, <4, (5, 11, 7)>, <6, (2, 14, 7)>, <7, (11, 19, 14)>, <8, (6, 17, 10)>, <9, (6, 15, 1)>, <11, (5, 7, 16)>, <13, (1, 7, 18)>, <14, (2, 6, 7)>, <15, (1, 9, 1)>, <16, (0, 17, 19)>, <17, (1, 8, 16)>.
