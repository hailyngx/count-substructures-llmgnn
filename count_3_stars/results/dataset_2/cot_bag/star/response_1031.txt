Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 5) (15, 18) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 17) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 16) (18, 15) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 8) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 16) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 10) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 12) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 1) (5, 3) (5, 19) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 11) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (12, 18) (12, 1) (13, 7) (13, 11) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 1) (16, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 19) (6, 3) (6, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 4, 7, 2, 18, 8, 17, 16, 1, 9, 11, 12, 13, 10, and 6.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 15 in total.
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 2 (node 3 and node 6 have exactly 3 neighbors).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [15 + 2 = 17].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<3, (5, 6, 19)>, <6, (3, 5, 16)>, <9, (0, 7, 11)>, <16, (2, 4, 6)>, <16, (1, 4, 14)>, <16, (6, 4, 16)>, <6, (3, 16, 6)>, <16, (2, 16, 4)>, <16, (1, 16, 14)>, <16, (6, 16, 4)>, <9, (0, 11, 7)>, <16, (2, 6, 4)>, <1, (10, 12, 16)>, <17, (4, 1, 7)>, <17, (7, 1, 17)>, <2, (8, 15, 18)>, <2, (8, 16, 18)>
