Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: 1 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 47

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [47].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)> 
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)> 
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
