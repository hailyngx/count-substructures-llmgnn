Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form.

1. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {7, 8, 9, 11}. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

2. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {4, 1, 18}. It can form 1 3-star.

3. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {4, 10, 20}. It can form 1 3-star.

4. Node 20 has 3 neighbors: {15, 8, 14}. It can form 1 3-star.

5. Node 17 has 4 neighbors: {29, 6, 24, 27}. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

6. Node 29 has 3 neighbors: {17, 5, 18}. It can form 1 3-star.

7. Node 13 has 3 neighbors: {26, 28, 19}. It can form 1 3-star.

8. Node 26 has 5 neighbors: {3, 13, 28, 18, 2}. It can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

9. Node 18 has 5 neighbors: {7, 29, 26, 10, 16}. It can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

10. Node 11 has 3 neighbors: {4, 0, 12}. It can form 1 3-star.

11. Node 0 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.

12. Node 16 has 3 neighbors: {18, 0, 5}. It can form 1 3-star.

13. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {15, 26, 1, 21}. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

14. Node 21 has 4 neighbors: {2, 24, 27, 23}. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

15. Node 12 has 3 neighbors: {11, 19, 23}. It can form 1 3-star.

16. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {3, 17, 22, 27}. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

17. Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.

18. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {7, 2, 9}. It can form 1 3-star.

19. Node 24 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.

20. Node 22 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.

22. Node 23 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.

23. Node 19 has 3 neighbors: {13, 12, 10}. It can form 1 3-star.

24. Node 14 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.

25. Node 10 has 3 neighbors: {8, 18, 19}. It can form 1 3-star.

From the calculations above, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 45. 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [45]. 

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
