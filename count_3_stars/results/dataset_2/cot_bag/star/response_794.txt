Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9 and the edges are given. Let's list out the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 7}

Now let's find the number of 3-stars around each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (0, 1, 5)> <2, (0, 1, 7)> <2, (0, 5, 8)> <2, (0, 7, 9)> <2, (1, 3, 8)> <2, (1, 5, 8)> <2, (1, 3, 5)> <2, (1, 3, 7)> <2, (5, 3, 8)> <2, (7, 3, 9)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <3, (1, 5, 8)> <3, (1, 7, 2)> <3, (1, 8, 5)> <3, (1, 2, 7)> <3, (5, 2, 8)> <3, (7, 2, 9)> <3, (5, 8, 2)> <3, (7, 9, 2)> <3, (8, 5, 2)> <3, (8, 7, 9)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <7, (2, 3, 9)> <7, (2, 5, 8)> <7, (2, 9, 3)> <7, (2, 8, 5)> <7, (3, 9, 6)> <7, (5, 8, 2)> <7, (9, 6, 3)> <7, (9, 2, 8)> <7, (8, 5, 2)> <7, (8, 9, 6)>

Adding up these 3-stars gives us a total of [30] unique 3-stars.
