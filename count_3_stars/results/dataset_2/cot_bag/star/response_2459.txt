Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:

- Node 0: 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 6, 8

We can see that nodes 1, 4, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 = 18

So, the total number of 3-stars is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>.
