Node 28: neighbors 11, 8, 1, 13  
Node 29: neighbors 12, 16  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:  
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 0 = 70 \)  
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].
