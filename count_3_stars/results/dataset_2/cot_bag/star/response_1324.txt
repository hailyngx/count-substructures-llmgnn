Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 8) (9, 1) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
There are several nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors, so we need to find the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 6, 13, 8, 3, 7
Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 5, 14, 3, 12, 4, 0
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 5, 12, 3, 2, 8
Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 6, 7, 1, 8
Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 5, 4, 2
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 5, 7, 12, 9, 1
Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 12, 8, 9, 0, 4
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 6, 13, 2, 1

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
Node 5 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 12 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 68

Therefore, there are a total of [68] 3-stars in this graph.
The unique 3-stars found are inside <>:
<5, (6, 8, 12)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (13, 4, 2)>, <6, (5, 3, 0)>, <7, (5, 3, 12)>, <8, (5, 7, 12)>, <12, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (12, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 13, 2)>
