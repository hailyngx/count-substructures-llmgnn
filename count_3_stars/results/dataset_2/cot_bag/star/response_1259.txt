Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges of the graph are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 9: <5, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 8: <9, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 8: <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 8: <1, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
