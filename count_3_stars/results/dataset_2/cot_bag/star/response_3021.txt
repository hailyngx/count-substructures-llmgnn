Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 9) (16, 5) (16, 10) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 5) (8, 19) (8, 6) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 19) (6, 8) (6, 5) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 3) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 0) (3, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 18) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 19) (1, 9) (15, 7) (15, 2) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 14) (13, 11) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 2) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 17) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 10) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 17) (10, 16) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 14) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, and 19. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52 \).
So, the total number of 3-stars is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <
(0, 3, 18), (0, 3, 14), (0, 3, 4), (0, 3, 12), (0, 1, 9), (0, 1, 19), (3, 0, 12), (3, 0, 14), (3, 0, 18), (3, 0, 4), (3, 4, 14), (3, 4, 10), (3, 4, 18), (3, 14, 10), (3, 12, 14), (4, 10, 16), (4, 10, 18), (5, 6, 8), (5, 6, 19), (5, 6, 7), (5, 7, 15), (5, 7, 0), (5, 7, 16), (6, 8, 19), (6, 8, 5), (9, 1, 19), (9, 1, 2), (9, 2, 15), (9, 2, 17), (9, 2, 14), (9, 14, 12), (10, 14, 3), (10, 14, 4), (10, 14, 12), (10, 14, 16), (10, 16, 4), (10, 16, 18), (12, 14, 3), (12, 14, 9), (14, 9, 2), (14, 9, 3), (14, 9, 10), (16, 5, 6), (16, 5, 7), (16, 5, 10), (16, 9, 1), (16, 9, 14), (19, 1, 9), (19, 1, 17), (19, 1, 8), (19, 8, 6) >
