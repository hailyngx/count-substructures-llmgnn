Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 17) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 6) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 8) (17, 11) (5, 3) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 8) (9, 10) (0, 11) (16, 10) (4, 12) (4, 14) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 2) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (14, 19) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 14) (18, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's analyze the graph to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 17, 2, 9, and 8.
   - Total 3-stars for node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - <1, (17, 2, 9)>, <1, (17, 2, 8)>, <1, (17, 9, 8)>, <1, (2, 9, 8)>

2. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 15, 5, and 8.
   - Total 3-stars for node 3: 1
   - <3, (15, 5, 8)>

3. Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 12 and 14.
   - Total 3-stars for node 4: 0

4. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 12, 10, and 2.
   - Total 3-stars for node 6: 1
   - <6, (12, 10, 2)>

5. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 19, 8, and 10.
   - Total 3-stars for node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - <9, (1, 19, 8)>, <9, (1, 19, 10)>, <9, (1, 8, 10)>, <9, (19, 8, 10)>

6. Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 9, 16, 6, and 14.
   - Total 3-stars for node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - <10, (9, 16, 6)>, <10, (9, 16, 14)>, <10, (9, 6, 14)>, <10, (16, 6, 14)>

7. Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 7, 17, 0, 13, and 2.
   - Total 3-stars for node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - <11, (7, 17, 0)>, <11, (7, 17, 13)>, <11, (7, 17, 2)>, <11, (7, 0, 13)>, <11, (7, 0, 2)>, <11, (7, 13, 2)>, <11, (17, 0, 13)>, <11, (17, 0, 2)>, <11, (17, 13, 2)>, <11, (0, 13, 2)>

8. Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 4, 13, 18, and 6.
   - Total 3-stars for node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - <12, (4, 13, 18)>, <12, (4, 13, 6)>, <12, (4, 18, 6)>, <12, (13, 18, 6)>

9. Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 19, 4, 13, and 10.
   - Total 3-stars for node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - <14, (19, 4, 13)>, <14, (19, 4, 10)>, <14, (19, 13, 10)>, <14, (4, 13, 10)>

10. Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 15, 1, 8, and 11.
    - Total 3-stars for node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <17, (15, 1, 8)>, <17, (15, 1, 11)>, <17, (15, 8, 11)>, <17, (1, 8, 11)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives:
\[ \text{Total} = [4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 36 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 36.
