Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 46

So, the total number of 3-stars is [46].
