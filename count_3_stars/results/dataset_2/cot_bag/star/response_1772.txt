Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 18) (7, 1) (7, 17) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 18) (8, 16) (13, 15) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 19) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 15) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 12) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 15) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 11) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 9) (19, 1) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 9) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 19) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 5) (16, 8) (16, 5) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 19.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
3. Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
4. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
5. Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
6. Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
7. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
8. Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
9. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
10. Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
11. Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
12. Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
13. Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us 30.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (7, 19, 10)>, <1, (3, 10, 15)>, <1, (7, 17, 11)>, <1, (3, 12, 0)>, <2, (4, 6, 0)>, <4, (7, 17, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 0)>, <4, (7, 1, 17)>, <5, (6, 16, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 18)>, <7, (4, 17, 6)>, <7, (1, 19, 11)>, <11, (4, 17, 7)>, <17, (7, 6, 11)>, <19, (1, 11, 9)>.
