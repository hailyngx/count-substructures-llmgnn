Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 8}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 can form 5 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form 4 3-stars.

Adding these up, we find that there are a total of [26] unique 3-stars: 
<4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>.
