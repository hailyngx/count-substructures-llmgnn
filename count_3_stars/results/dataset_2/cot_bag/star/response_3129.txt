Next, we need to find the total number of 3-stars in this graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 10 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 13 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 15 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 18 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 21 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 24 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 25 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 27 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 29 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 46

Therefore, the final answer is [46]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
