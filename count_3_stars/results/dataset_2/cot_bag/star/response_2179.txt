Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 19) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 16) (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 8) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 15) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 15) (17, 0) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 11) (8, 14) (8, 6) (16, 14) (16, 18) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 17) (9, 7) (9, 10) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 1) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 17) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 7) (1, 18) (1, 10) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 7, 12, 0, 14, 17, 14, 19, 5, 6, 18, 13, 11, and 15. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get a total of 29 3-stars in this graph: \([29]\).

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<7, (1, 9, 10)>, <7, (2, 9, 10)>, <7, (2, 1, 9)>, <7, (2, 1, 10)>, <7, (1, 9, 2)>, <7, (1, 10, 2)>, <7, (10, 9, 2)>, <7, (1, 10, 9)>, <7, (7, 1, 9)>, <7, (7, 10, 9)>, <7, (7, 2, 9)>, <7, (10, 1, 2)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (10, 9, 2)>, <12, (7, 19, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 17)>, <0, (2, 14, 16)>, <0, (17, 3, 14)>, <14, (8, 11, 16)>, <14, (8, 16, 18)>, <14, (6, 8, 16)>, <14, (8, 11, 18)>, <17, (11, 13, 15)>, <17, (11, 15, 19)>, <17, (13, 15, 19)>, <14, (8, 11, 16)>, <14, (6, 8, 16)>, <14, (8, 11, 18)>, <11, (13, 15, 17)>.
