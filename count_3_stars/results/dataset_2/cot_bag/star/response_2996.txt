Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 0) 

Response:
There are a few nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph: node 2, node 3, node 4, node 6, node 7, node 9, node 11, node 12, node 13, and node 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 35] = [107] \).

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (1, 3, 10)> 
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 11, 14)>
<6, (2, 12, 13)>
<7, (5, 8, 12)>
<9, (6, 11, 13)>
<11, (4, 9, 14)>
<12, (1, 2, 7)>
<13, (0, 7, 9)>
<14, (5, 6, 10)>
