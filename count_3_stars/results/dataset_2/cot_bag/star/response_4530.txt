Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph.
Calculating the 3-stars based on the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 36 \).
