Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 6) (1, 6) (1, 18) (3, 4) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 19) (2, 18) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 15) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 17) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 16) (16, 7) (16, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (17, 2) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 15) (19, 11) (19, 17) (8, 14) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 17) (0, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 18.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {7, 10, 3, 15}. There are 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {9, 13, 11}. There is 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {7, 1, 17, 16}. There are 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {4, 12, 16, 6}. There are 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {5, 14, 12}. There is 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: {9, 7, 13, 17}. There are 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: {5, 10, 12, 15, 0}. There are 10 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: {9, 11, 2, 8}. There are 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: {4, 18, 13, 17}. There are 4 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors: {2, 12, 6, 19, 15}. There are 10 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: {1, 2, 15}. There is 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 43

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43].

Unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, (7, 10, 3)>
<5, (9, 13, 11)>
<6, (7, 1, 17)>
<7, (4, 12, 16)>
<9, (5, 14, 12)>
<12, (9, 7, 13)>
<13, (5, 10, 15)>
<14, (9, 11, 2)>
<15, (4, 18, 17)>
<17, (2, 6, 19)>
<18, (1, 2, 15)>
