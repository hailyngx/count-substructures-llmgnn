Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

1: (4, 6, 2)
2: (9, 4, 6, 8, 1)
3: (5, 9, 4, 8, 0)
4: (7, 8, 9, 0, 1, 3, 2)
5: (9, 3)
6: (7, 1, 2, 0)
7: (4, 6)
8: (9, 4, 3, 2)
9: (5, 9, 8, 2, 0, 3)

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

1: [1]
2: [3]
3: [3]
4: [6]
6: [1]
8: [3]
9: [3]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: $1 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 20$

Hence, there are a total of 20 3-stars in this graph. Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<1, (4, 6, 2)>
<2, (9, 4, 6)>
<2, (9, 4, 8)>
<2, (4, 8, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<3, (9, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 0)>
<4, (7, 6, 2)>
<4, (7, 8, 2)>
<4, (7, 8, 3)>
<4, (4, 0, 1)>
<4, (4, 1, 3)> 

Therefore, there are 20 [20] 3-stars in this graph, listed above.
