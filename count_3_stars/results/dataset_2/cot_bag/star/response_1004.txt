Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (4, 0) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 11) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 2) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 14) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 10) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 2) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3} = 10] 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3} = 10] 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3} = 10] 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10] = 64
