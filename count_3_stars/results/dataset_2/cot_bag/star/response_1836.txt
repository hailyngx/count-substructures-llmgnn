Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 14) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 12
- Node 1: 9, 8, 10
- Node 2: 12, 6, 14, 11
- Node 3: 4, 7, 6, 14
- Node 4: 9, 13, 14, 3
- Node 5: 9, 13, 0, 7
- Node 6: 2, 14, 10, 3, 0
- Node 7: 5, 11, 3, 10, 8
- Node 8: 9, 13, 12, 1, 7
- Node 9: 5, 4, 1, 8
- Node 10: 7, 1, 6
- Node 11: 7, 2, 12, 14
- Node 12: 8, 2, 0, 11
- Node 13: 5, 4, 8, 14
- Node 14: 4, 13, 2, 6, 11, 3

Based on the list of neighbors, the number of 3-stars in this graph is 4. 
Hence, the final answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<5, (0, 7, 13)>
<8, (7, 9, 13)>
<4, (9, 13, 14)>
<14, (2, 11, 3)>
