Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 14) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 6) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 6) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 14) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges based on each node. 

Node 0: {7, 3, 11, 6, 2}
Node 1: {8, 13, 2}
Node 2: {7, 11, 0, 5, 12, 1}
Node 3: {11, 0, 5}
Node 4: {7, 8, 10}
Node 5: {3, 2, 12, 14}
Node 6: {11, 0, 12, 14}
Node 7: {4, 0, 10, 2, 9}
Node 8: {4, 9, 14, 1}
Node 9: {7, 8, 11}
Node 10: {4, 7}
Node 11: {3, 14, 0, 9, 6, 2}
Node 12: {5, 13, 2, 6}
Node 13: {12, 1, 14}
Node 14: {8, 11, 5, 13, 6}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-star graphs for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star graphs.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-star graphs.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star graphs.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star graphs.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star graphs.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star graphs.
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-star graphs.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star graphs.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star graph.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star graphs.

Summing up the total number of 3-star graphs: \( 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 83 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is 83. 
Representing the unique 3-star graphs found:
