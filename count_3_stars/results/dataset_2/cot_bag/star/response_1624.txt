Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph have the following connections:

Node 0: 5, 2, 1, 6

Node 1: 5, 9, 4, 8, 0

Node 2: 8, 6, 3, 0

Node 3: 5, 4, 2

Node 4: 5, 9, 3, 1, 6

Node 5: 8, 1, 4, 0, 3

Node 6: 4, 2, 8, 0

Node 7: 9, 8

Node 8: 5, 7, 2, 6, 1

Node 9: 4, 1, 7

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star, <0, (5, 2, 1)>

Node 1 forms 10 3-stars, <1, (5, 4, 0)>, <1, (5, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 4, 6)>, <1, (5, 8, 0)>, <1, (5, 8, 6)>, <1, (5, 0, 6)>, <1, (4, 9, 7)>, <1, (4, 9, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (9, 7, 8)>

Node 2 forms 1 3-star, <2, (8, 6, 0)>

Node 3 forms 1 3-star, <3, (5, 4, 2)>

Node 4 forms 5 3-stars, <4, (5, 9, 1)>, <4, (5, 9, 6)>, <4, (5, 1, 6)>, <4, (9, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 6)>

Node 5 forms 10 3-stars, <5, (8, 1, 0)>, <5, (8, 1, 3)>, <5, (8, 0, 3)>, <5, (1, 9, 4)>, <5, (1, 9, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (9, 4, 6)>, <5, (9, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (7, 8, 6)>

Node 6 forms 5 3-stars, <6, (4, 2, 8)>, <6, (4, 8, 0)>, <6, (2, 8, 0)>, <6, (2, 8, 1)>, <6, (8, 1, 0)>

Node 8 forms 5 3-stars, <8, (5, 7, 2)>, <8, (5, 2, 6)>, <8, (5, 6, 0)>, <8, (7, 9, 4)>, <8, (7, 4, 6)>

Node 9 forms 1 3-star, <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Adding up all the identified 3-stars, we find a total of [33].
