Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(5, 9), (5, 0), (5, 7), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 1), (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 1), (1, 9), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 8), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 6), (6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 8), (8, 7), (8, 1), (8, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 0)]

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors, which are nodes: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 58

Therefore, the final result is [58].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>
