Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 20) (1, 24) (1, 18) (1, 7) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 26) (21, 17) (5, 22) (5, 28) (5, 16) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 24) (8, 13) (8, 25) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 14) (22, 5) (22, 23) (22, 2) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 19) (4, 9) (28, 5) (28, 7) (28, 15) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 26) (7, 1) (7, 28) (7, 12) (12, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 18) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 27) (14, 19) (17, 21) (17, 29) (17, 6) (11, 23) (11, 25) (2, 9) (2, 22) (2, 16) (2, 25) (16, 21) (16, 5) (16, 0) (16, 2) (6, 17) (6, 26) (6, 27) (6, 20) (24, 1) (24, 9) (10, 26) (26, 21) (26, 29) (26, 6) (26, 10) (26, 20) (19, 23) (19, 29) (19, 14) (20, 1) (20, 6) (20, 26) (15, 28) (15, 18) (27, 14) (27, 6) (3, 13) (3, 18) (18, 1) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 3) (25, 8) (25, 11) (25, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 21, 5, 9, 13, 22, 23, 28, 29, 7, 0, 14, 17, 2, 16, 6, 24, 26, 19, 20, 18, 25.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the number of 3-stars: 
\(10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 49\)

Hence, there are a total of 49 3-stars present in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final result is [49]. 

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (7, 20, 21)>, <21, (1, 16, 26)>, <5, (16, 22, 28)>, <22, (2, 5, 23)>, <28, (5, 7, 15)>, <7, (1, 12, 28)>, <0, (8, 14, 18)>, <14, (0, 19, 27)>, <17, (6, 21, 29)>, <2, (9, 16, 25)>, <16, (0, 2, 21)>, <6, (17, 20, 27)>, <26, (6, 10, 29)>, <19, (14, 23, 29)>, <18, (0, 3, 15)>.
