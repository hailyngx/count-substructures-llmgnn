Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 24) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 29) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 26) (21, 7) (21, 17) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 2) (25, 19) (25, 23) (25, 10) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 2) (3, 26) (8, 20) (8, 11) (8, 6) (23, 25) (23, 15) (0, 20) (0, 5) (0, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 29) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (17, 21) (17, 1) (17, 29) (29, 22) (29, 5) (29, 17) (29, 18) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 11) (26, 22) (26, 7) (26, 3) (26, 15) (9, 22) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 27) (16, 28) (16, 15) (28, 16) (28, 18) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 19) (24, 13) (24, 7) (19, 25) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 14) (15, 23) (15, 26) (15, 16) (2, 20) (2, 1) (4, 13) (4, 19) (10, 25) (10, 6) (10, 9) (18, 5) (18, 29) (18, 12) (18, 28) (18, 27) (27, 9) (27, 18) (14, 13) (14, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25, 26, 29.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each node:  
\( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 51 \)

So, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, 20, 2, 8>, <5, 0, 6, 10>, <5, 0, 29, 18>, <5, 6, 10, 25>, <6, 5, 10, 25>, <7, 12, 18, 11>, <7, 21, 17, 1>, <8, 11, 12, 7>, <9, 0, 27, 18>, <9, 10, 25, 6>,  
<11, 1, 17, 21>, <11, 12, 7, 8>, <11, 19, 4, 14>, <12, 7, 24, 13>, <13, 14, 4, 19>, <17, 1, 21, 7>, <17, 29, 18, 5>, <18, 12, 7, 8>, <18, 27, 9, 0>, <18, 27, 9, 10>,  
<19, 4, 13, 14>, <19, 11, 1, 17>, <20, 0, 5, 6>, <22, 13, 14, 19>, <22, 13, 24, 7>, <25, 19, 4, 14>, <26, 7, 12, 18>, <26, 15, 23, 25>, <29, 17, 21, 7>.
