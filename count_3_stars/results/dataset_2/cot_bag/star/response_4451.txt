Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 18) (22, 4) (22, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 10) (9, 16) (9, 7) (3, 22) (3, 15) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 25) (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 17) (1, 19) (21, 1) (21, 6) (21, 11) (21, 25) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 2) (6, 16) (26, 1) (26, 14) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 0) (18, 13) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 20) (17, 1) (17, 8) (17, 11) (20, 18) (14, 26) (14, 24) (14, 25) (12, 4) (12, 28) (2, 6) (2, 11) (16, 5) (16, 9) (16, 6) (16, 24) (16, 8) (24, 14) (24, 16) (24, 27) (24, 29) (7, 9) (7, 29) (7, 10) (29, 24) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 25) (23, 4) (23, 28) (23, 27) (28, 12) (28, 23) (27, 24) (27, 23) (27, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (19, 1) (25, 15) (25, 21) (25, 14) (25, 29) (0, 4) (0, 29) (11, 5) (11, 21) (11, 17) (11, 2) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 16) (8, 27) 

Response:
There are \( \binom{30}{3} = 4060 \) possible 3-stars in this graph.

From the given edges, we see that the nodes 5, 6, 16, 1, 21, 4, 18, 14, 24, 29, 23, and 8 have three or more neighbors, which means they have the potential to form 3-stars.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 5: <5, (6, 11, 16)> 
- Node 6: <6, (5, 16, 21)>
- Node 16: <16, (5, 6, 9)> 
- Node 1: <1, (21, 25, 26)> 
- Node 21: <21, (1, 6, 11)> 
- Node 4: <4, (18, 22, 0)>
- Node 18: <18, (3, 4, 20)>
- Node 14: <14, (25, 26, 24)>
- Node 24: <24, (14, 16, 29)>
- Node 29: <29, (7, 24, 25)>
- Node 23: <23, (4, 27, 28)>
- Node 8: <8, (15, 17, 27)>

So, there are 12 unique 3-stars in this graph. Putting this final count inside brackets, we get [12].
