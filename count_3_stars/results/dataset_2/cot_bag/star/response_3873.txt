Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 11) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 10) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 1) 

Response:
We need to first construct the graph based on the given information. Let's represent the nodes as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Now, let's add the edges to the graph:

Edges: 
- Node 0: (0, 14), (0, 3), (0, 1)
- Node 1: (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 0), (1, 10)
- Node 2: (2, 12), (2, 3), (2, 11)
- Node 3: (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 13), (3, 0), (3, 2)
- Node 4: (4, 9), (4, 12), (4, 1), (4, 11)
- Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 11), (5, 7)
- Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 10), (6, 3)
- Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 12), (7, 14), (7, 8), (7, 14)
- Node 8: (8, 9), (8, 7), (8, 13), (8, 3)
- Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 10)
- Node 10: (10, 9), (10, 6), (10, 13), (10, 1)
- Node 11: (11, 5), (11, 4), (11, 12), (11, 14), (11, 2)
- Node 12: (12, 4), (12, 7), (12, 13), (12, 2), (12, 11)
- Node 13: (13, 8), (13, 12), (13, 3), (13, 10)
- Node 14: (14, 7), (14, 0), (14, 11)

Next, we'll identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors in order to find the total number of 3-stars. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: No 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: [1] <1, (4, 6, 10)>
- Node 3: [1] <3, (0, 2, 13)>
- Node 4: [4] <4, (1, 9, 11)>, <4, (1, 12, 6)>, <4, (1, 12, 11)>, <4, (1, 11, 14)>
- Node 5: [1] <5, (7, 9, 11)>
- Node 6: [1] <6, (1, 9, 10)>
- Node 7: [1] <7, (5, 8, 14)>
- Node 8: [1] <8, (3, 13, 7)>
- Node 9: [4] <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 10, 9)>, <9, (4, 11, 5)>, <9, (4, 12, 6)>
- Node 10: [1] <10, (1, 9, 6)>
- Node 11: [4] <11, (5, 12, 14)>, <11, (5, 12, 4)>, <11, (5, 14, 11)>, <11, (5, 2, 4)>
- Node 12: [4] <12, (4, 11, 1)>, <12, (4, 11, 5)>, <12, (4, 13, 2)>, <12, (4, 7, 12)>
- Node 13: [1] <13, (3, 8, 12)>
- Node 14: [1] <14, (7, 11, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].
