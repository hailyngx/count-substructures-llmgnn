Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we construct the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges. The neighbors of each node are as follows:

Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 6}
Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 5, 8}
Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 6}
Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 8, 9}
Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
Node 5: {1, 2, 8}
Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 9}
Node 7: {4, 9}
Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 9}
Node 9: {3, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars formed by each node based on its neighbors:

Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 4: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
Node 5: 1 3-star
Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 7: 0 3-star
Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 63

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 8, 9)>
