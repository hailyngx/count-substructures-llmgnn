Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 12) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 6) (12, 7) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 13) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are \( \binom{15}{3} = 455 \) possible 3-stars in this graph.
Let's identify the unique 3-stars one by one:

- Node 1: 3 neighbors (3, 2, 14)
  <1, (3, 2, 14)>
  
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (1, 11, 14, 9)
  <3, (1, 11, 9)>
  <3, (1, 14, 9)>
  
- Node 10: 4 neighbors (11, 8, 2, 14)
  <10, (11, 8, 2)>
  
- Node 11: 3 neighbors (3, 10, 5)
  <11, (3, 10, 5)>
  
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (9, 13, 14)
  <4, (9, 13, 14)>
  
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (10, 0, 6, 7)
  <8, (10, 0, 6)>
  <8, (10, 0, 7)>
  
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (1, 11, 13, 2, 0)
  <5, (1, 11, 13)>
  
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (8, 12)
  
- Node 0: 5 neighbors (8, 5, 14, 7, 2)
  <0, (8, 5, 14)>
  
- Node 14: 5 neighbors (1, 3, 10, 4, 0)
  <14, (1, 3, 4)>
  
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (1, 8, 0, 12, 9)
  <7, (1, 8, 9)>

- Node 12: 2 neighbors (6, 7)
  
- Node 13: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 5)
  <13, (1, 4, 5)>
  
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (1, 10, 5, 0, 13)
  <2, (1, 10, 5)>
  
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (3, 4, 7)
  <9, (3, 4, 7)>
  
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].
