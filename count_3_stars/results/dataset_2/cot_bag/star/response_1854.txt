Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 1) (16, 4) (9, 29) (9, 3) (9, 1) (26, 24) (26, 8) (2, 7) (29, 9) (29, 18) (3, 9) (3, 25) (3, 28) (25, 3) (25, 19) (25, 14) (25, 10) (8, 26) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 14) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 14) (23, 27) (12, 22) (12, 27) (12, 1) (27, 23) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 5) (5, 27) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 1) (6, 20) (24, 11) (24, 26) (24, 7) (21, 16) (21, 6) (21, 20) (21, 18) (10, 25) (10, 7) (15, 22) (15, 23) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 19) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 6) (19, 25) (19, 28) (19, 7) (18, 29) (18, 27) (18, 21) (18, 0) (14, 25) (14, 13) (14, 23) (20, 6) (20, 21) (0, 5) (0, 18) (17, 11) (17, 28) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 24) (7, 10) (7, 19) (4, 16) (4, 5) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify them first:

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
    - Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
    - Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated gives us a total of 66 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [66].
