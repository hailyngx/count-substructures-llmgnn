Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: {0, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: {0, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: {4, 7}
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 46 3-stars.

Therefore, the answer is: \[46\]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
