Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 4) (15, 11) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 10) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 16) (12, 5) (4, 15) (4, 18) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) (17, 7) (17, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 16) (19, 0) (0, 19) (0, 16) (0, 2) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 0) (1, 2) (6, 10) (6, 17) (6, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) (14, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (9, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 3, 15, 11, 10, 7, 18, 13, 17, 8, 19, 0, 16, 2, 5, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star formed.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so forms 1 3-star.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 48

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].
