Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 12) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 10) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 10) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 4, 6, 7, 9, 1, 14, 0, 8, 12, 3, 13, 5, and 10.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up all these individual counts, we get \(10 + 20 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 83 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [83].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 10)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 14)>, <6, (6, 9, 13)>, <6, (6, 11, 13)>, <6, (11, 9, 13)>, <6, (6, 9, 3)>, <6, (6, 13, 3)>, <7, (4, 9, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 12)>, <9, (1, 9, 12)>, <9, (3, 13, 6)>, <1, (0, 1, 12)>, <1, (1, 10, 4)>, <1, (1, 9, 4)>, <1, (4, 9, 1)>, <0, (0, 12, 8)>, <3, (12, 13, 3)>, <5, (5, 10, 0)>, <10, (10, 14, 4)>.
