Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
In this graph, the node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: deg(0) = 4
- Node 1: deg(1) = 3
- Node 2: deg(2) = 5
- Node 3: deg(3) = 3
- Node 4: deg(4) = 5
- Node 5: deg(5) = 5
- Node 6: deg(6) = 4
- Node 7: deg(7) = 4
- Node 8: deg(8) = 4
- Node 9: deg(9) = 5

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- For node 2: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]
- For node 4: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]
- For node 5: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]
- For node 9: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40

Therefore, we have a total of 40 unique 3-stars:
<2, (5, 1, 3)>, <2, (5, 4, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 3, 1)>, 
<2, (5, 3, 0)>, <2, (5, 0, 4)>, <2, (5, 2, 6)>, <2, (5, 9, 7)>, 
<2, (1, 5, 3)>, <2, (1, 5, 0)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 2, 5)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 0)>, <2, (1, 2, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 0)>, <2, (3, 5, 1)>, 
<2, (3, 0, 4)>, <2, (3, 1, 5)>, <2, (3, 0, 9)>, <2, (3, 1, 2)>, 
<2, (6, 2, 5)>, <2, (6, 2, 8)>, <2, (6, 9, 8)>, <2, (6, 9, 4)>, 
<2, (6, 4, 0)>, <2, (6, 4, 8)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (8, 4, 7)>, 
<2, (8, 4, 6)>, <2, (8, 4, 0)>, <2, (8, 7, 4)>, <2, (8, 7, 9)>, 
<4, (5, 4, 7)>, <4, (5, 4, 0)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 4)>, 
<5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 0)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 6)>
