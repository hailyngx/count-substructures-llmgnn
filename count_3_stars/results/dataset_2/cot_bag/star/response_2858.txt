Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 10) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 18) (7, 5) (10, 16) (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 9) (1, 13) (1, 18) (15, 19) (15, 0) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 6) (19, 0) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 12) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 14) (18, 7) (18, 1) (18, 5) (18, 19) (12, 17) (12, 8) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 8) (14, 9) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 0) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 15, 19, 3, and 13
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 13, 18
- Node 3 is connected to node 0
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 13
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 11, 7, 19, 18
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 17, 19, 13
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 18, 5
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 11, 16, 9, 14, 12
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 17, 8, 14
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 16, 17
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 14, 5, 8
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 17, 8
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 0, 6
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11, 16, 8, 9
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 19, 0
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 8, 14, 10
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 10, 6, 9, 12
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 5, 19
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 15, 5, 18, 6, 0

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it can form $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is $4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 46$

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [46]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars that can be formed:
- <0, (15, 19, 3)>
- <8, (11, 16, 9)>
- <8, (11, 14, 9)>
- <8, (11, 14, 16)>
- <8, (16, 14, 9)>
- <9, (4, 17, 13)>
- <9, (4, 13, 6)>
- <9, (17, 10, 14)>
- <9, (17, 10, 16)>
- <18, (1, 5, 19)>
- <18, (5, 19, 6)>
- <18, (5, 19, 7)>
- <18, (5, 19, 0)>
- <19, (5, 18, 6)>
- <19, (5, 18, 7)>
- <19, (5, 18, 0)>
- <19, (5, 18, 1)>
