Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (22, 9) (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 23) (16, 20) (18, 16) (18, 23) (18, 20) (18, 1) (10, 11) (10, 26) (10, 4) (1, 18) (1, 25) (26, 10) (26, 28) (26, 8) (17, 29) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 4) (29, 17) (29, 28) (29, 5) (28, 26) (28, 29) (28, 27) (9, 22) (9, 17) (9, 2) (6, 21) (6, 7) (21, 6) (21, 12) (21, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 0) (20, 16) (20, 18) (20, 19) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 25) (15, 14) (15, 19) (19, 20) (19, 15) (19, 3) (19, 12) (23, 16) (23, 18) (3, 19) (3, 24) (3, 5) (3, 8) (24, 3) (24, 8) (24, 12) (8, 26) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 24) (8, 27) (2, 9) (2, 27) (25, 1) (25, 14) (12, 13) (12, 21) (12, 19) (12, 24) (27, 28) (27, 8) (27, 2) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 29) (5, 21) (5, 3) (4, 10) (4, 17) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 18, 10, 1, 26, 17, 29, 28, 9, 21, 5, 12, 8, 3, 24, 2, 25, and 4.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <11, (16, 10, 14)>, <11, (16, 18, 1)>, <11, (16, 18, 5)>, <11, (16, 18, 14)>, <11, (16, 18, 15)>, <11, (18, 1, 25)>, <11, (18, 14, 15)>, <11, (18, 15, 14)>, <11, (18, 15, 19)>, <11, (14, 15, 25)>

- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <16, (11, 18, 20)>, <16, (18, 11, 20)>, <16, (18, 20, 23)>, <16, (11, 20, 23)>

- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <18, (16, 1, 20)>, <18, (16, 20, 23)>, <18, (16, 20, 19)>, <18, (20, 19, 15)>

- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <10, (11, 26, 4)>

- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) because it has exactly 2 neighbors

- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <26, (10, 28, 8)>

- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <17, (29, 5, 4)>, <17, (9, 5, 4)>, <17, (29, 5, 21)>, <17, (9, 22, 2)>

- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <29, (17, 28, 5)>

- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <28, (26, 29, 27)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <9, (17, 22, 2)>

- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <21, (6, 5, 12)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <5, (11, 17, 21)>, <5, (11, 17, 29)>, <5, (11, 3, 24)>, <5, (17, 29, 5)>, <5, (17, 29, 21)>, <5, (3, 19, 12)>, <5, (3, 19, 24)>, <5, (19, 12, 24)>, <5, (19, 3, 8)>, <5, (19, 3, 24)>

- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <12, (13, 21, 24)>, <12, (21, 19, 24)>, <12, (12, 19, 24)>, <12, (12, 19, 21)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <8, (26, 24, 27)>, <8, (26, 8, 27)>, <8, (26, 3, 24)>, <8, (26, 3, 27)>, <8, (26, 8, 3)>, <8, (24, 3, 27)>, <8, (24, 3, 12)>, <8, (24, 12, 27)>, <8, (3, 24, 12)>, <8, (3, 12, 27)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <3, (5, 19, 24)>, <3, (19, 12, 24)>, <3, (19, 8, 24)>, <3, (19, 8, 12)>

- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <24, (3, 8, 12)>, <24, (3, 12, 27)>, <24, (3, 12, 19)>, <24, (8, 12, 27)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) because it has exactly 2 neighbors

- Node 25: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) because it has exactly 2 neighbors

- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) because it has exactly 2 neighbors

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives: 
\[ [10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [90] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 90.
