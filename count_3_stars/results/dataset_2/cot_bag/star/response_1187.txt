Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars in this graph using the formula mentioned earlier.

For each node with 3 or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.

Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can also form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7, 1, 3, and 8 each have 3 neighbors, thus they can each form 1 3-star.
Node 6 and 2 have 4 neighbors, so they can each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 0 does not have 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding up all the possible combinations:
\[ 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 36, which can be represented as [36].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 0)>, <6, (1, 3, 0)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>
