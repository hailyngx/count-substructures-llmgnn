Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 4, 6, 7, 5
- Node 1: 2, 6, 7, 8, 5
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 5

Now, let's check each node for the formation of 3-stars:

- For Node 0: <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- For Node 1: <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- For Node 2: <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- For Node 3: No 3-star can be formed.
- For Node 4: No 3-star can be formed.
- For Node 5: <5, (8, 9, 1)>
- For Node 6: No 3-star can be formed.
- For Node 7: No 3-star can be formed.
- For Node 8: No 3-star can be formed.
- For Node 9: <9, (4, 2, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have 7 in total: [7].
