Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 25) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 27) (17, 7) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 18) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 22) (27, 17) (27, 12) (5, 19) (5, 10) (6, 3) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 29) (22, 12) (22, 26) (26, 22) (26, 29) (26, 3) (26, 4) (0, 17) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 24) (24, 19) (24, 2) (11, 12) (11, 19) (11, 23) (11, 4) (23, 11) (23, 1) (23, 29) (23, 10) (9, 29) (9, 2) (9, 28) (29, 7) (29, 26) (29, 23) (29, 9) (3, 6) (3, 26) (3, 28) (28, 9) (28, 3) (28, 15) (1, 23) (1, 16) (1, 10) (20, 2) (21, 14) (21, 18) (2, 24) (2, 9) (2, 20) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 15) (10, 5) (10, 23) (10, 1) (10, 16) (25, 14) (25, 12) (25, 18) (4, 26) (4, 11) (4, 15) (15, 13) (15, 28) (15, 16) (15, 4) (18, 13) (18, 21) (18, 25) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors:  

- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 17, 8, 15, 18
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 27, 7, 25, 11, 22
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors: 14, 13, 0, 27, 7
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: 22, 29, 3, 4
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 12, 19, 23, 4
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: 7, 26, 23, 9
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 5, 23, 1, 16
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 13, 28, 16, 4
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 13, 21, 25

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing them up: 
\( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44 \)

Hence, there are 44 3-stars in the graph.  

Therefore, the final answer is [44] and the unique 3-stars found are:  
<13, (17, 8, 15)>  
<12, (27, 7, 25)>  
<17, (14, 13, 0)>  
<26, (22, 29, 3)>  
<11, (12, 19, 23)>  
<29, (7, 26, 23)>  
<10, (5, 23, 1)>  
<15, (13, 28, 16)>
