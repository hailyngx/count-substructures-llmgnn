Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 10) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 18) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 18) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 9) (15, 1) (15, 4) (2, 13) (2, 9) (12, 10) (12, 19) (14, 6) (14, 8) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 3) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 9) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (19, 7) (19, 12) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 12) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph described, we'll first find the nodes that have three or more neighbors and then count the 3-stars formed involving these nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 16, 18.

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 38 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [38].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:

- <0, (4, 7, 18)>
- <1, (9, 15, 10)>
- <4, (0, 3, 15)>
- <5, (1, 10, 13)>
- <6, (8, 17, 14)>
- <16, (9, 6, 11)>
- <18, (0, 7, 16)>
