This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 3) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 18) (4, 0) (4, 16) (8, 15) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 7) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 3) (19, 13) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 0) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 1) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 11) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 0) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 7) (11, 18) (11, 15) (11, 0) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 6) (6, 2) (6, 16) (6, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 1) (12, 15) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be described as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 13), (0, 3), (0, 11), (0, 12), (1, 18), (1, 12), (1, 7), (2, 14), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 9), (3, 19), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 16), (6, 2), (6, 16), (6, 12), (7, 14), (7, 2), (7, 18), (7, 1), (8, 15), (9, 5), (9, 18), (9, 3), (11, 18), (11, 15), (11, 0), (12, 15), (12, 0), (12, 1), (12, 6), (13, 14), (13, 19), (13, 0), (14, 7), (14, 2), (14, 13), (15, 8), (15, 19), (15, 12), (15, 11), (16, 5), (16, 4), (16, 6), (17, 18), (18, 9), (18, 17), (18, 11), (18, 7), (18, 1), (19, 5), (19, 15), (19, 3), (19, 13)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph: 

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: (4, 13, 3, 11, 12). So there are 10 possible 3-stars with node 0 at the center. 
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (14, 6, 7). There is 1 3-star with node 2 at the center.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (9, 19, 0, 19). So there are 4 possible 3-stars with node 3 at the center.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (14, 2, 18, 1). So there are 4 possible 3-stars with node 7 at the center.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (5, 18, 3). There is 1 3-star with node 9 at the center.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: (18, 15, 0). There is 1 3-star with node 11 at the center.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (15, 0, 1, 6). So there are 4 possible 3-stars with node 12 at the center.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: (14, 19, 0). There is 1 3-star with node 13 at the center.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: (7, 2, 13). There is 1 3-star with node 14 at the center.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: (8, 19, 12, 11). So there are 4 possible 3-stars with node 15 at the center.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: (5, 4, 6). There is 1 3-star with node 16 at the center.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors: (9, 17, 11, 7, 1). So there are 10 possible 3-stars with node 18 at the center.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: (5, 15, 3, 13). So there are 4 possible 3-stars with node 19 at the center.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 40.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40].
