Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 6) (8, 18) (13, 2) (13, 0) (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 14) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 17) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 1) (15, 10) (15, 14) (7, 16) (7, 1) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 2) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 12) (6, 4) (17, 19) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 9) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 19) (11, 1) (11, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 2) (9, 17) (9, 0) (9, 3) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 3) (14, 5) (14, 15) (14, 1) (18, 8) (18, 6) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32 \)

Therefore, there are 32 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars found inside <> each only once are: 
<1, (7, 11, 14)>, <4, (2, 5, 11)>, <5, (14, 17, 19)>, <6, (8, 17, 18)>, <10, (1, 12, 15)>, <11, (1, 4, 19)>, <12, (3, 6, 10)>, <16, (2, 3, 7)>, <17, (6, 9, 16)>, <19, (5, 11, 17)>. 

Therefore, the final representation of the total number of 3-stars in this graph is: [32].
