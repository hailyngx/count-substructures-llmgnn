Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 85 3-stars.  

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 85. 

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, (8, 3, 4)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (8, 9, 4)>, <2, (8, 9, 5)>, <2, (4, 7, 0)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 0, 8)>, <3, (6, 2, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 0, 2)>, <4, (1, 8, 3)>, <4, (2, 8, 5)>, <4, (9, 8, 5)>, <4, (9, 8, 2)>, <4, (0, 7, 3)>, <5, (3, 7, 0)>, <5, (6, 2, 0)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 0)>, <8, (3, 7, 0)>, <8, (3, 9, 2)>, <8, (4, 9, 0)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 85.
