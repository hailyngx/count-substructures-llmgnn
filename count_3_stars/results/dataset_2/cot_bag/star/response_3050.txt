Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 11) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 6) 

Response:
There are two nodes with only 2 neighbors each (node 6 and node 15), so they cannot form any 3-stars. 
Nodes 1, 3, and 12 have exactly 3 neighbors each, so they each form 1 3-star.
Nodes 0, 4, 8, 10, 13, and 15 have 4 neighbors each and therefore could potentially form multiple 3-stars. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we have 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 27. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (7, 3, 10)>
<3, (1, 10, 12)>
<12, (7, 9, 3)>
<0, (1, 13, 14)>
<4, (7, 6, 10)>
<8, (2, 6, 11)>
<10, (1, 3, 6)>
<13, (0, 2, 5)>
<14, (0, 5, 9)>
