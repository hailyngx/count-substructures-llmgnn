Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 12) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify nodes with three or more neighbors.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13.

Now we apply the formula to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding all these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 
1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 77

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [77].
