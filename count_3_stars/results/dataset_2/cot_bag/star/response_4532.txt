Now let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

We have:
- Node 1 with 3 neighbors, forming \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2 with 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 with 2 neighbors, forming 0 3-stars
- Node 4 with 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars
- Node 5 with 1 neighbor, forming 0 3-stars
- Node 6 with 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star
- Node 7 with 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star
- Node 8 with 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars
- Node 9 with 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star
- Node 11 with 2 neighbors, forming 0 3-stars
- Node 12 with 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star
- Node 13 with 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars
- Node 14 with 1 neighbor, forming 0 3-stars
- Node 15 with 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars
- Node 16 with 1 neighbor, forming 0 3-stars
- Node 17 with 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars
- Node 18 with 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star
- Node 19 with 2 neighbors, forming 0 3-stars
- Node 20 with 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars
- Node 21 with 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 22 with 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars
- Node 23 with 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars
- Node 24 with 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars
- Node 25 with 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star
- Node 26 with 5 neighbors, forming 10 3-stars
- Node 27 with 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star
- Node 28 with 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star
- Node 29 with 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 6 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 69 \)

Therefore, inside brackets [], we have [69].
