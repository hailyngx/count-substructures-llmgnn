Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 3) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 4) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 4) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can now determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 contributes 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 contributes 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 contributes 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 4 contributes 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 5 contributes 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 contributes 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 contributes 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 contributes 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 contributes 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 10 contributes 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 11 contributes 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 12 contributes 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- No 3-stars are formed by Node 13 and Node 14 since they have less than 3 neighbors.

Adding up all the 3-stars gives:
4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 58 3-stars

Therefore, there are [58] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (4, 10, 12)>, <1, (4, 10, 14)>, <1, (4, 12, 10)>, <1, (10, 12, 14)>, <2, (5, 9, 11)>, <2, (5, 11, 14)>, <2, (9, 11, 14)>, <2, (11, 14, 5)>, <3, (7, 10, 14)>, <3, (7, 11, 14)>, <3, (10, 11, 14)>, <3, (10, 14, 7)>, <4, (1, 10, 12)>, <4, (1, 10, 14)>, <4, (1, 12, 10)>, <4, (10, 12, 14)>, <4, (11, 10, 14)>, <4, (11, 12, 10)>, <4, (11, 12, 14)>, <5, (2, 9, 11)>, <5, (2, 9, 14)>, <5, (9, 11, 14)>, <5, (11, 2, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (8, 9, 13)>
