Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 2) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 19) (10, 11) (10, 7) (2, 15) (2, 8) (18, 14) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 17) (5, 16) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 17) (17, 12) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 9) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 14) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 15) (19, 1) (19, 14) (19, 9) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 6) (14, 19) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 19) 

Response:
There are several nodes in this graph with three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 3, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 19. We will calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes.

For node 11:
- Node 11 has three neighbors: nodes 10, 16, and 1.
- There are 3 combinations of choosing 2 nodes from these 3 neighbors: (10, 16), (10, 1), and (16, 1).
- So, there are 3 3-stars around node 11: <11, (10, 16, 1)>, <11, (10, 1, 16)>, and <11, (16, 1, 10)>.

For node 16:
- Node 16 has three neighbors: nodes 11, 0, and 5.
- There are 3 combinations of choosing 2 nodes from these 3 neighbors: (11, 0), (11, 5), and (0, 5).
- So, there are 3 3-stars around node 16: <16, (11, 0, 5)>, <16, (11, 5, 0)>, and <16, (0, 5, 11)>.

For the other nodes with three or more neighbors, the calculations are as follows:
- Node 1: 3 3-stars
- Node 3: 3 3-stars
- Node 12: 3 3-stars
- Node 14: 3 3-stars
- Node 15: 3 3-stars
- Node 17: 3 3-stars
- Node 19: 3 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 24 3-stars. So, the final result is [24].
