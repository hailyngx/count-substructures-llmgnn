Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 17) (1, 10) (3, 11) (3, 20) (18, 22) (18, 10) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 0) (26, 1) (26, 2) (26, 20) (26, 6) (0, 22) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 28) (14, 7) (14, 19) (19, 14) (19, 16) (11, 3) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 12) (6, 26) (21, 27) (21, 9) (21, 12) (21, 4) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 25) (7, 8) (25, 7) (25, 13) (25, 5) (15, 23) (15, 8) (15, 5) (16, 19) (16, 17) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 7) (8, 15) (8, 17) (2, 22) (2, 26) (2, 17) (2, 20) (24, 11) (24, 9) (29, 4) (20, 3) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 12) (12, 11) (12, 21) (12, 20) (12, 5) (12, 9) (4, 21) (4, 29) (4, 9) (9, 21) (9, 24) (9, 12) (9, 4) (23, 15) (27, 21) (27, 5) (5, 0) (5, 25) (5, 15) (5, 12) (5, 27) (13, 0) (13, 25) (13, 28) (10, 1) (10, 18) (28, 14) (28, 13) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 5, 11, 12, 14, and 21. We can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes: 

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 40 \).

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (14, 5, 13)>, <2, (26, 17, 20)>, <5, (0, 12, 27)>, <11, (3, 7, 24)>, <12, (9, 20, 5)>, <14, (0, 19, 28)>, <21, (27, 9, 4)>.

So, the final answer is: [40], <0, (14, 5, 13)>, <2, (26, 17, 20)>, <5, (0, 12, 27)>, <11, (3, 7, 24)>, <12, (9, 20, 5)>, <14, (0, 19, 28)>, <21, (27, 9, 4)>.
