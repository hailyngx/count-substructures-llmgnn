Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 18) (15, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (10, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 2) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 8) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 12) (4, 15) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (9, 17) (9, 4) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 17) (12, 11) (19, 7) (19, 16) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 16) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 8) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 2) (14, 5) (14, 7) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 16, 17, and 18.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
2. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
5. Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
6. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
7. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8. Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
9. Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (No 3-star can be formed with less than 3 neighbors)
10. Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
12. Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 17, 18)>
<0, (2, 17, 8)>
<0, (2, 17, 11)>
<0, (17, 8, 18)>
<2, (0, 7, 16)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 14, 7)>
<4, (5, 15, 16)>
<4, (9, 17, 4)>
<5, (4, 14, 7)>
<5, (4, 15, 16)>
<8, (1, 7, 18)>
<16, (2, 5, 14)>
<16, (5, 10, 19)>
<16, (5, 2, 14)>
<17, (0, 8, 18)>
<18, (0, 3, 7)>
