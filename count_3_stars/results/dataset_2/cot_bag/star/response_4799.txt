Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 15) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 11) (0, 6) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 10) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 11) (19, 0) (19, 5) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 16) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 18) (2, 12) (2, 11) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 17) (3, 7) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 4) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 1) (17, 8) (17, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 6, 9, 8, 7, 12, 0, 5, 19, 10, 15, 1, 2, 18, 11, and 4.   
Let's find the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 38

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].
