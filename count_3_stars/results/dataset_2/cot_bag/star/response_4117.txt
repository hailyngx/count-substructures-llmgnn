Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 27) (13, 22) (13, 3) (13, 9) (22, 11) (22, 13) (22, 7) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 19) (17, 16) (17, 15) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 18) (21, 7) (21, 10) (23, 20) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 25) (3, 20) (3, 4) (25, 3) (25, 27) (1, 6) (1, 5) (26, 11) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 29) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 20) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 15) (24, 26) (24, 19) (24, 10) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 28) (8, 15) (8, 6) (19, 14) (19, 24) (19, 8) (19, 9) (27, 16) (27, 25) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 29) (5, 1) (5, 26) (5, 2) (0, 2) (10, 21) (10, 24) (28, 8) (28, 9) (2, 16) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 28) (9, 2) (20, 23) (20, 3) (20, 4) (20, 12) (12, 20) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 8) (29, 26) (29, 6) 

Response:
The graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so no 3-stars are formed.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36 \]

Therefore, there are a total of 36 3-stars in the given graph.

Putting the final number inside brackets: [36], the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (13, 14, 20)>, <4, (11, 26, 4)>, <7, (18, 4, 22)>, <9, (2, 9, 28)>, <11, (11, 16, 22)>, <13, (3, 22, 13)>, <14, (6, 14, 8)>, <16, (16, 11, 27)>, <19, (8, 19, 24)>, <20, (4, 20, 12)>, <24, (19, 24, 10)>, <26, (5, 26, 29)>.
