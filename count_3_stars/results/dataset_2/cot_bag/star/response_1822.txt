Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The neighbors of each node are:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 6, 8}

Nodes with three or more neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [51]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 2, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 1, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
