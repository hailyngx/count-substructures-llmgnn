Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 3) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 18) (13, 10) (13, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 16) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 2) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 16) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 18) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 16) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 3) (15, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 15) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 5 and 8.  

Node 5 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.  
Node 8 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.  

So, the total number of 3-stars is [10 + 10] = 20.  

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <5, (0, 14, 17)>, <5, (0, 14, 2)>, <5, (0, 2, 17)>, <5, (14, 2, 17)>, <5, (9, 3, 6)>, <5, (9, 3, 17)>, <5, (9, 6, 17)>, <5, (3, 6, 17)>, <5, (9, 6, 10)>, <5, (9, 10, 6)>, <8, (4, 18, 19)>, <8, (16, 1, 19)>, <8, (16, 19, 4)>, <8, (1, 19, 4)>, <8, (18, 3, 8)>, <8, (3, 18, 18)>, <8, (3, 8, 19)>, <8, (18, 18, 19)>, <8, (4, 18, 3)>, <8, (18, 3, 16)>.
