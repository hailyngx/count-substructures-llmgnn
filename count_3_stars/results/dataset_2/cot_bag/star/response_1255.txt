Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 2) (14, 8) (14, 12) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 12) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 5, 13, 6, 12
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 11, 2
Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 5, 9, 7, 11, 6, 12
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 7, 10, 11, 6
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 9, 2, 1, 0, 3
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 4, 8, 10, 3, 0
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 13, 14, 11, 6, 12
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 3, 1, 7
Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 4, 8, 3, 1, 12
Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 8, 11, 3, 14, 0
Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 8, 2, 0
Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 8, 12
 Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 13, 1, 5

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 12, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors, so the total contribution is \( 10 \times 4 = 40 \).
- For nodes 13, 14, and 2, there is only 1 possible 3-star for each, so that adds \( 3 \) more.
- In total, there are \( 40 + 3 = 43 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [43].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 6, 12)>
<1, (5, 9, 11)>
<3, (5, 7, 12)>
<4, (7, 11, 6)>
<5, (9, 1, 3)>
<6, (4, 8, 3)>
<8, (13, 14, 12)>
<9, (5, 3, 7)>
<13, (8, 2, 0)>
<14, (8, 12)>
<2, (13, 1, 5)>
