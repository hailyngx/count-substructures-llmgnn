Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 7) (22, 2) (22, 11) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 21) (1, 14) (21, 1) (21, 6) (21, 14) (26, 5) (26, 28) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 27) (28, 23) (6, 21) (6, 3) (6, 18) (7, 13) (7, 25) (7, 0) (25, 7) (25, 10) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 11) (24, 23) (24, 29) (24, 20) (10, 13) (10, 25) (10, 29) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 20) (29, 24) (29, 10) (29, 11) (27, 28) (27, 17) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 15) (17, 27) (17, 8) (8, 17) (8, 14) (14, 1) (14, 21) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 20) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 23) (23, 28) (23, 24) (23, 18) (23, 4) (23, 12) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 23) (4, 11) (19, 14) (19, 20) (15, 0) (15, 16) (20, 24) (20, 3) (20, 14) (20, 19) (11, 22) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 29) (11, 4) (12, 23) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 13, 5, 21, 26, 28, 6, 7, 0, 24, 29, 2, 3, 4, 14, 18, 23, 16, 20, and 11.

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

1. Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
2. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 26 has 2 neighbors which is not enough to form a 3-star.
5. Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
7. Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
8. Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
10. Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
11. Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
12. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
13. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
14. Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
15. Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
16. Node 23 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
17. Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
18. Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
19. Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by each node, we get: 
\( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 60 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 60. 
Therefore, the answer is [60].
