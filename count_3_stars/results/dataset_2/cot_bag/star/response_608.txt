Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 12) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 1) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 9) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to analyze each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 1: (0, 6, 10, 11, 13)
Node 2: (6, 9, 10, 14)
Node 3: (4, 5, 8, 13)
Node 4: (3, 5, 7)
Node 5: (3, 4, 8, 11)
Node 6: (1, 2, 7, 12, 14)
Node 7: (4, 6, 8, 11)
Node 8: (3, 5, 7, 10)
Node 9: (2, 10, 13)
Node 10: (1, 2, 8, 9)
Node 11: (0, 1, 5, 7, 12, 14)
Node 12: (6, 11, 14)
Node 13: (1, 3, 9)
Node 14: (2, 6, 11, 12)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 1 forms 10 3-stars
- Node 2 forms 3 3-stars
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star 
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 3 3-stars
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star
- Node 10 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 11 forms 9 3-stars
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star
- Node 14 forms 3 3-stars

Adding these up gives us a total of 39 3-stars [39].

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<1, (0, 10, 11)>
<1, (0, 11, 13)>
<1, (6, 10, 13)>
<1, (10, 11, 13)>
<2, (6, 9, 14)>
<6, (1, 7, 12)>
<10, (1, 8, 9)>
<10, (1, 9, 13)>
<10, (2, 8, 9)>
<10, (2, 9, 13)>
<11, (0, 5, 12)>
<11, (0, 7, 12)>
<11, (1, 5, 7)>
<11, (1, 7, 12)>
<11, (5, 7, 12)>
<11, (5, 7, 14)>
<11, (7, 12, 14)>
<12, (6, 11, 14)>
<14, (11, 12, 14)>
