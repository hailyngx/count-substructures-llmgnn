Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the given information:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 6, 8, and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 3, 6, and 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 7, 6, and 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 1, 6, and 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 2, 1, 3, and 0.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8 and 1.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 3, 2, and 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 8 and 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 7, 0.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 3, 0, 1.

Next, we'll identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to count the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 have three or more neighbors, so we will count the number of 3-stars around these nodes.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 64 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 64, and we can represent them as follows: 
\[ [64] \]
Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (1, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>
