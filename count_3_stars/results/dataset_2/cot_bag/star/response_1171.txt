Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will need to identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes.

Let's first identify the nodes with their respective number of neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
  - Node 0: [4 3-stars]
  - Node 1: [4 3-stars]
  - Node 4: [4 3-stars]
  - Node 7: [4 3-stars]
  - Node 8: [4 3-stars]
  - Node 9: [4 3-stars]

- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each
  - Node 2: [10 3-stars]
  - Node 5: [10 3-stars]

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from all applicable nodes:
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 44 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [44]

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 8, 1)>, <2, (9, 3, 6)>, <3, (9, 1, 2)>, <4, (5, 9, 7)>, <5, (8, 2, 0)>
