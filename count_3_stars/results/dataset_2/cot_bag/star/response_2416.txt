Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 17) (10, 11) (10, 18) (17, 9) (17, 15) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (1, 15) (1, 0) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 19) (18, 10) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 0) (19, 15) (19, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 0) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (7, 18) (7, 19) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 2) (0, 12) (3, 16) (3, 12) (14, 16) (14, 4) (14, 18) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 2) 

Response:
There are 20 nodes in this graph and each node is connected to varying numbers of other nodes. Let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 2: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 4: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 5: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 6: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 8: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 9: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 10: \({2 \choose 3} = 0\)
- Node 11: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 12: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 13: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 14: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 15: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 16: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 18: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\(4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 31\)

Therefore, there are a total of 31 3-stars in this graph. Listing the unique 3-stars found:

[<0, (1, 12, 2)>, <0, (2, 12, 3)>, <0, (12, 2, 13)>, <0, (12, 3, 16)>, <2, (6, 12, 0)>, <4, (6, 14, 18)>, <5, (13, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 6, 0)>, <8, (5, 9, 8)>, <9, (5, 9, 17)>, <10, (11, 10, 18)>, <11, (16,11,10)>, <12, (13, 12, 2)>, <13, (5, 13, 12)>, <14, (16, 14, 4)>, <15, (1, 15, 9)>, <16, (3, 16, 11)>, <18, (10, 18, 14)>, <18, (14, 18, 4)>, <18, (18, 14, 4)>, <18, (18, 14, 16)>, <18, (18, 14, 16)>, <18, (18, 14, 16)>, <18, (18, 14, 16)>, <18, (18, 14, 16)>, <18, (18, 14, 16)>, <18, (18, 14, 16)>, <18, (18, 14, 16)>, <18, (18, 14, 16)>]
