Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 19) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 3) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 3) (15, 4) (15, 10) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 0) (0, 11) (0, 19) (0, 3) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 17) (17, 12) (17, 5) (3, 18) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (2, 11) (2, 14) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 17) (5, 1) (14, 18) (14, 3) (14, 2) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 5) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 4, node 7, node 9, node 10, node 11, node 12, and node 18.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes is 25. 

Therefore, the final answer is [25].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (11, 19, 3)>
<4, (7, 10, 15)>
<7, (4, 10, 13)>
<9, (6, 12, 16)>
<12, (11, 13, 17)>
<18, (1, 14, 3)>
