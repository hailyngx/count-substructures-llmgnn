Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 21) (15, 2) (27, 4) (27, 11) (14, 17) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 21) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 10) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 10) (22, 23) (22, 29) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 6) (23, 12) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 6) (7, 6) (12, 14) (12, 23) (12, 16) (12, 1) (4, 27) (4, 19) (18, 5) (18, 8) (13, 26) (13, 21) (26, 13) (26, 2) (26, 11) (26, 8) (1, 15) (1, 12) (1, 29) (3, 21) (3, 16) (21, 15) (21, 17) (21, 13) (21, 3) (21, 24) (6, 23) (6, 0) (6, 7) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 3) (29, 22) (29, 0) (29, 1) (5, 23) (5, 18) (5, 11) (28, 0) (8, 20) (8, 22) (8, 18) (8, 26) (2, 15) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 11) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 9) (24, 21) (9, 17) (9, 25) (9, 19) (9, 11) (11, 27) (11, 26) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 9) (10, 20) (10, 25) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 15, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 0, 12, 26, 1, 8, 2, 19, and 11.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- For nodes 15, 17, 21, 26, and 11, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- For nodes 0, 12, 1, and 2, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.
- For nodes 8 and 19, we have \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars each.
- For nodes 20, 22, and 23, we have \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars each.

Summing up, we have a total of \(4 \times 5 + 1 \times 4 = 24\) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars is given by [24].

The unique 3-stars formed in this graph are:
<15, (1, 2, 21)>, <17, (14, 16, 25)>, <21, (3, 13, 15)>, <26, (2, 11, 13)>, <11, (2, 9, 26)>, <0, (6, 20, 29)>, <12, (14, 16, 23)>
