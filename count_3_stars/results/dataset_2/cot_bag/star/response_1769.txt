Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the contributions, we get a total of \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 40 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 6, 8)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<4, (1, 6, 7)>, 
<5, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<6, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<7, (4, 5, 6)>, 
<8, (0, 5, 9)>, 
<9, (0, 2, 5)>.
