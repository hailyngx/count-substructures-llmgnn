Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 10) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 19) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (7, 6) (7, 17) (12, 5) (12, 14) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 14) (18, 11) (18, 4) (0, 8) (5, 17) (5, 12) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 17) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 17) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 4) (2, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 47

Hence, we have a total of 47 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 17, 19)>
<3, (15, 13, 6)>
<4, (18, 11, 1)>
<6, (1, 16, 11)>
<9, (19, 17, 10)>
<10, (14, 4, 17)>
<11, (1, 16, 13)>
<13, (15, 6, 16)>
<15, (2, 19, 4)>
<16, (13, 6, 11)>
<17, (10, 14, 12)>
<19, (17, 9, 15)> 

Putting the total number of 3-stars in brackets, we have: [47].
