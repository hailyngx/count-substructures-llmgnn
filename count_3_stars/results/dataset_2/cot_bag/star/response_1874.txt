Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 12) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (0, 11) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 13) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 16) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 16) (4, 17) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 1) (13, 14) (13, 15) (8, 5) (8, 16) (9, 4) (9, 15) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 19) (1, 7) (1, 18) (1, 16) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 16) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 9) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with degrees are:

- Node 0: degree 1
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 5
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 3

The nodes with degrees greater than or equal to 3 are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Now, calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \sum_{i \in \text{Nodes with degree} \geq 3} \binom{{\text{degree}(i)}}{3} \]

\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} \]

\[ 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 40 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [40].

The unique 3-stars are:  
<1, (18, 11, 19)>  
<3, (10, 14, 4)>  
<4, (14, 10, 3)>  
<5, (17, 19, 16)>  
<6, (16, 1, 18)>  
<7, (2, 3, 10)>  
<8, (16, 4, 17)>  
<9, (4, 15, 9)>  
<10, (11, 7, 12)>  
<12, (11, 7, 10)>  
<13, (15, 6, 8)>  
<14, (13, 15, 6)>  
<16, (6, 15, 13)>  
<17, (5, 4, 18)>  
<18, (1, 7, 12)>  
<19, (11, 17, 18)>
