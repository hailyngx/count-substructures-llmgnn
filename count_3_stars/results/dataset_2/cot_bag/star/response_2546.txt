Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 8) (15, 6) (15, 2) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 19) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 19) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 9) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 5) (16, 0) (16, 2) (12, 4) (12, 18) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 5) (9, 18) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 7) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 17) (6, 15) (6, 7) (6, 17) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 6) (2, 15) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 13) (13, 3) (13, 18) (13, 2) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 14) (10, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 58

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, 3, 16>, <0, 3, 17>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 16, 2>, <1, 2, 8>, <4, 12, 18>, <4, 18, 12>, <4, 18, 13>, <5, 0, 14>, <7, 3, 10>, <7, 3, 17>, <7, 9, 14>, <7, 9, 18>, <7, 9, 19>, <8, 3, 19>, <9, 14, 5>, <15, 2, 16>, <18, 13, 2>, <18, 5, 0>, <19, 8, 4>
