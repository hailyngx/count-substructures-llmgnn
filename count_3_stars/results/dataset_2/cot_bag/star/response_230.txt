Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 13) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 12) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 12) 

Response:
In this graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we can identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 12, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 8, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbor {2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 10: Neighbors {7, 14, 12}
- Node 11: Neighbors {2, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 1, 10, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 3, 11, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {2, 3, 9, 10, 12}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars each node forms:
- Node 0 forms 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 4 unique 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 3 unique 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 5 unique 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 2 unique 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 2 unique 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms 4 unique 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms 2 unique 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms 2 unique 3-stars.

Summing these numbers, we get a total of 30 3-stars in the graph, which we denote as [30]. The unique 3-stars found inside <> are:
<0, 1, 12>, <1, 2, 14>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 12, 14>, <2, 3, 14>, <5, 0, 6>, <7, 5, 8>, <9, 3, 14>, <10, 7, 14>, <11, 2, 7>, <11, 8, 13>, <12, 0, 1>, <12, 1, 13>, <12, 1, 14>, <12, 3, 13>, <13, 1, 3>, <14, 2, 9>, <14, 3, 9>.
