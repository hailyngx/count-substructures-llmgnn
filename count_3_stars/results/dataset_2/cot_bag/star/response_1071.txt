Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 6, 2
- Node 1: 6, 3, 5, 8
- Node 2: 3, 0
- Node 3: 9, 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 7, 8, 9, 5, 0
- Node 5: 4, 6, 1, 3, 8
- Node 6: 9, 5, 1, 0
- Node 7: 4, 0, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7, 9, 1, 5
- Node 9: 4, 6, 8, 3

By examining the nodes, we see that nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9 have 5 neighbors each, and nodes 0, 1, and 3 have 4 neighbors each.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing them up gives: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.

So, there are 40 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
