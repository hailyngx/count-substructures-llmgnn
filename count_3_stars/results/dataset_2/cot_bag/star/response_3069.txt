Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (13, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 2) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, and 12. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 0: 
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

For Node 2: 
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

For Node 4: 
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For Node 5: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For Node 6: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For Node 8: 
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For Node 10: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For Node 11: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For Node 12: 
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 82 \)

So, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [82].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 12>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 10>
<0, 2, 12>
<0, 3, 10>
<0, 7, 12>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 8, 11>
<6, 8, 12>
<6, 8, 14>
<8, 12, 14>
<10, 11, 12>
<10, 12, 14>
<11, 12, 13>
