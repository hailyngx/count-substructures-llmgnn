Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 24) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 28) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 12) (21, 16) (21, 4) (21, 25) (21, 15) (2, 3) (2, 15) (8, 25) (8, 7) (8, 6) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 27) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 22) (11, 18) (11, 17) (17, 11) (17, 20) (17, 12) (20, 17) (20, 13) (20, 28) (7, 8) (7, 25) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 13) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 7) (0, 7) (0, 29) (0, 23) (22, 11) (22, 27) (16, 21) (16, 15) (6, 8) (6, 24) (6, 14) (6, 4) (24, 5) (24, 6) (24, 10) (24, 15) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 28) (23, 0) (26, 27) (27, 3) (27, 22) (27, 26) (29, 0) (29, 10) (18, 11) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 13) (15, 9) (15, 21) (15, 2) (15, 16) (15, 24) (13, 1) (13, 20) (13, 7) (13, 12) (10, 24) (10, 29) (10, 4) (28, 9) (28, 20) (28, 14) (19, 1) (19, 7) (4, 21) (4, 6) (4, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are:
- Node 1 (with neighbors 13, 19, 12)
- Node 3 (with neighbors 2, 11, 27)
- Node 5 (with neighbors 9, 24, 14)
- Node 7 (with neighbors 8, 25, 0, 19, 13)
- Node 11 (with neighbors 3, 14, 22, 18, 17)
- Node 14 (with neighbors 5, 11, 6, 28)
- Node 15 (with neighbors 9, 21, 2, 16, 24)
- Node 20 (with neighbors 17, 13, 28)
- Node 21 (with neighbors 16, 4, 25, 15)
- Node 24 (with neighbors 5, 6, 10, 15)
- Node 25 (with neighbors 21, 8, 7)
- Node 27 (with neighbors 3, 22, 26)
- Node 28 (with neighbors 9, 20, 14)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 38 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [38].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, 13, 19, 12>, <3, 2, 11, 27>, <5, 9, 24, 14>, <7, 8, 25, 0>, <7, 8, 25, 19>, <7, 8, 0, 19>, <7, 8, 25, 13>, <7, 25, 0, 19>, <7, 0, 29, 10>, <7, 13, 20, 17>, <11, 3, 14, 22>, <11, 3, 18, 17>, <11, 14, 22, 18>, <11, 17, 20, 13>, <14, 5, 11, 28>, <14, 5, 6, 28>, <14, 5, 28, 20>, <14, 6, 24, 10>, <15, 9, 21, 16>, <15, 9, 2, 16>, <15, 9, 16, 24>, <15, 21, 4, 25>, <15, 6, 24, 10>, <21, 16, 15, 24>, <24, 5, 6, 10>, <24, 6, 14, 28>, <24, 10, 29, 0>, <28, 9, 20, 17>
