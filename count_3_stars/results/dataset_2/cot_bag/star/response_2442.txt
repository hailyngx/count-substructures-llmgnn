Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 22) (0, 18) (0, 8) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 17) (27, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) (29, 7) (29, 11) (29, 18) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 2) (3, 28) (10, 17) (10, 24) (10, 16) (17, 27) (17, 10) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 22) (5, 28) (6, 5) (6, 15) (15, 6) (15, 20) (15, 23) (15, 12) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 19) (22, 0) (22, 5) (22, 26) (26, 22) (26, 11) (16, 10) (16, 28) (28, 3) (28, 5) (28, 16) (28, 24) (9, 27) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 14) (7, 29) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 23) (19, 20) (19, 21) (12, 15) (11, 29) (11, 1) (11, 26) (11, 7) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 18) (24, 10) (24, 28) (23, 15) (23, 7) (23, 21) (23, 13) (21, 27) (21, 19) (21, 23) (18, 0) (18, 29) (18, 14) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 20) (13, 23) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 forms 3 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 20

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 20. 

Therefore, the final answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (8, 22, 27)>
<4, (8, 13, 17)>
<5, (8, 22, 28)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<11, (1, 7, 26)>
<13, (1, 20, 23)>
<15, (6, 12, 20)>
<17, (4, 10, 27)>
<18, (0, 14, 29)>
<20, (15, 19, 20)>
<21, (19, 21, 23)>
<23, (7, 13, 21)>
<29, (7, 18, 29)>
