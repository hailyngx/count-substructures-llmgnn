Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 0) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 10) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 11, 12
- Node 1: 5, 6, 8, 10, 13
- Node 2: 3, 7, 9, 14
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 3, 5, 7, 12
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 1, 10, 13
- Node 7: 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12
- Node 8: 1, 14
- Node 9: 2, 13, 14
- Node 10: 1, 6, 7, 13, 14
- Node 11: 0, 7
- Node 12: 0, 4, 7, 14
- Node 13: 1, 6, 9, 10
- Node 14: 2, 8, 9, 10, 12

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars with each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = \binom{n}{3} \]

Calculating for each node:
- Node 0: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 1: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 2: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 3: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 7: 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 
- Node 10: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 12: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 13: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 14: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 

Summing these values: 
\[ 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 90 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 90. 
Therefore, the final answer is [90]. 

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, 5, 12>, <1, 6, 13>, <2, 9, 14>, <3, 4, 5>, <7, 10, 14>
