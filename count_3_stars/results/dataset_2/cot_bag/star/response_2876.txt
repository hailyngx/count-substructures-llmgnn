This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 24) (15, 16) (27, 15) (27, 18) (27, 26) (2, 29) (2, 26) (2, 1) (29, 2) (29, 16) (29, 14) (29, 24) (29, 3) (3, 29) (3, 25) (3, 0) (3, 13) (25, 3) (25, 16) (25, 22) (25, 18) (14, 29) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 26) (8, 13) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 9) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 22) (0, 3) (20, 7) (20, 23) (20, 28) (7, 20) (12, 10) (26, 27) (26, 2) (26, 17) (26, 28) (26, 4) (28, 20) (28, 26) (28, 4) (21, 19) (21, 5) (21, 22) (5, 14) (5, 21) (5, 19) (19, 21) (19, 5) (4, 14) (4, 26) (4, 28) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 23) (6, 1) (6, 18) (11, 14) (11, 18) (23, 15) (23, 20) (23, 1) (16, 15) (16, 29) (16, 25) (16, 17) (16, 22) (24, 15) (24, 29) (22, 25) (22, 10) (22, 21) (22, 16) (18, 27) (18, 25) (18, 6) (18, 11) (9, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 15, 27, 2, 29, 3, 25, 14, 17, 26, 28, 21, 5, 4, 1, 6, 11, 23, 16, 24, 22, 18, 13, 10, and 20.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Summing up the number of 3-stars formed by each node, we get a total of [42].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<{15, 27, 23, 24}, {2, 29, 16, 24}, {3, 29, 16, 25}, {14, 29, 17, 11}, {17, 14, 16, 26}, {5, 21, 22, 19}, {18, 25, 6, 11}>
