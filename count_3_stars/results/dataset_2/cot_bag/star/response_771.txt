Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) 

Response:
Let's start by visualizing the graph based on the provided edges:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 5, 9
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 1, 7, 8, 0

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: <0, (4, 9, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 3)>  (2 3-stars)
- Node 2: <2, (3, 8, 6)>  (1 3-star)
- Node 3: <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>  (2 3-stars)
- Node 4: <4, (0, 3, 5)>  (1 3-star)
- Node 5: <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>  (3 3-stars)
- Node 6: <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (5, 4, 7)>  (2 3-stars)
- Node 7: <7, (4, 5, 6)>  (1 3-star)
- Node 8: <8, (0, 2, 3)>  (1 3-star)
- Node 9: <9, (0, 4, 7)>  (1 3-star)

Adding them up, we have a total of [13] 3-stars in the graph.
