Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 4) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (12, 8) (12, 3) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 4) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 5, 9, 8, 13, 10, 11, 7, 0, 6, 4, 1, and 2.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes based on their degree:

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up all these possible 3-stars, we get a total of \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 95 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [95], and the unique 3-stars found are:
