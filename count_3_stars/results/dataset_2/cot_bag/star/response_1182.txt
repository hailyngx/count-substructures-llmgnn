Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0:  neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 1:  neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} 
- Node 2:  neighbors {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3:  neighbors {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4:  neighbors {0, 1, 3}
- Node 5:  neighbors {0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 6:  neighbors {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 7:  neighbors {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8:  neighbors {2, 5, 7}
- Node 9:  neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7}

There are no nodes with less than 3 neighbors.
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 20 + 4 = 25 \).

Inside brackets []: [25]

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <5, (0, 8, 9)>
- <5, (2, 8, 9)>
- <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- <5, (1, 7, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- <9, (2, 8, 7)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
- <9, (1, 8, 7)>
- <9, (1, 2, 8)>
- <9, (1, 2, 6)>
- <9, (1, 3, 6)>
- <9, (1, 2, 7)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
- <9, (1, 6, 7)>
- <9, (5, 8, 2)>
- <9, (5, 8, 7)>
- <9, (5, 2, 7)>
- <9, (5, 2, 6)>
- <9, (5, 1, 7)>
