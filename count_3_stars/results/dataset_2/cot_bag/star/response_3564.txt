Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 10) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 11) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 4) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 4) 

Response:
The node with the most neighbors is node 2 with degree 5, followed by nodes 7, 12, 14, and 13 with degree 4. We will calculate the number of 3-stars using these nodes.

For node 2:
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 2 as the center.
  
For nodes 7, 12, 14, and 13:
- Each has degree 4, so there's only 1 3-star for each of them: <7, 0, 13>, <12, 0, 6>, <14, 8, 10>, <13, 0, 3>.

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 4 = 14 \). 

Thus, the final answer is [14].
