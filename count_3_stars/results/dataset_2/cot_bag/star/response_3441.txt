Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing these up: 
\( 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 82 \)

List of unique 3-stars: 
<1, (3, 6, 13)>, <3, (1, 4, 10)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 3, 13)>, <6, (7, 12, 14)>, <7, (1, 4, 12)>, <8, (4, 7, 12)>, <10, (1, 3, 13)>, <10, (0, 13, 14)>, <12, (4, 7, 14)>, <13, (1, 6, 10)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [82].
