Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 21) (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 28) (9, 12) (6, 11) (23, 22) (23, 25) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 29) (0, 2) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 18) (20, 2) (14, 0) (14, 25) (28, 9) (28, 29) (1, 17) (26, 3) (26, 7) (26, 4) (29, 0) (29, 28) (29, 15) (29, 4) (29, 10) (3, 26) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 16) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 21) (17, 1) (17, 24) (21, 22) (21, 11) (8, 20) (8, 24) (8, 12) (25, 23) (25, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 18) (16, 3) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 2) (24, 17) (24, 8) (24, 19) (2, 0) (2, 20) (2, 16) (2, 15) (19, 24) (19, 10) (7, 5) (7, 26) (7, 27) (15, 29) (15, 2) (15, 18) (10, 13) (10, 29) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 4) (27, 7) (18, 13) (18, 20) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 15) (4, 0) (4, 26) (4, 29) (4, 10) 

Response:
Since there are 30 nodes in the graph, we can start by checking the degree of each node based on the given edges. Nodes with degree less than 3 cannot form 3-stars, so we will look at nodes with degree 3 or more.

Based on the given edges, the degrees of the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0: 5 edges (degree 5)
- Node 2: 4 edges (degree 4)
- Node 3: 4 edges (degree 4)
- Node 4: 4 edges (degree 4)
- Node 7: 3 edges (degree 3)
- Node 8: 3 edges (degree 3)
- Node 9: 4 edges (degree 4)
- Node 10: 5 edges (degree 5)
- Node 11: 3 edges (degree 3)
- Node 12: 4 edges (degree 4)
- Node 13: 3 edges (degree 3)
- Node 14: 2 edges (degree 2)
- Node 15: 3 edges (degree 3)
- Node 16: 4 edges (degree 4)
- Node 18: 5 edges (degree 5)
- Node 20: 4 edges (degree 4)
- Node 21: 3 edges (degree 3)
- Node 22: 3 edges (degree 3)
- Node 24: 3 edges (degree 3)
- Node 25: 3 edges (degree 3)
- Node 26: 3 edges (degree 3)
- Node 28: 3 edges (degree 3)
- Node 29: 5 edges (degree 5)

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by nodes with degree 3 or more:
- Nodes with degree 3: 7 nodes (\( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars)
- Nodes with degree 4: 6 nodes (\( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars)
- Nodes with degree 5: 6 nodes (\( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars)

Adding these together gives a total of 35 + 20 + 20 = 75 3-stars. Hence, the final answer is [75].

Unique 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, 20, 2>
- <3, 16, 2>
- <4, 29, 0>
- <5, 9, 28>
- <9, 12, 8>
- <10, 19, 24>
- <13, 18, 15>
- <29, 15, 2>
