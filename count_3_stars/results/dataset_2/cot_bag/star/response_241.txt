Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors as potential center nodes for 3-stars. These nodes are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
2. Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
4. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
6. Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
7. Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
8. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
9. Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
10. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Now, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 20 + \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 112 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 112.

Therefore, the final answer is [112].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (5, 13, 14)>
<0, (9, 13, 2)>
<0, (11, 13, 4)>
<0, (4, 1, 7)>
<2, (9, 8, 6)>
<4, (11, 13, 2)>
<5, (13, 11, 0)>
<6, (10, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 10, 11)>
<8, (3, 12, 6)>
<10, (6, 7, 11)>
<11, (10, 7, 13)>
<13, (2, 11, 0)>
<14, (12, 0, 5)>
