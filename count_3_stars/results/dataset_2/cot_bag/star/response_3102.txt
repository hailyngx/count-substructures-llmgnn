Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 1) (12, 4) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 1) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 10) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
From the given edges, we can identify the following nodes with at least three neighbors:
- Node 4: 6 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 6, 9, 8, 13, 0, 14, 5, 12, 10, 3, 1, 11, 2: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

For Node 4:
- Total possible 3-stars from Node 4 = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Unique 3-stars from Node 4: <4, (7, 12, 13)>, <4, (0, 5, 11)>

For Node 7:
- Total possible 3-stars from Node 7 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars from Node 7: <7, (6, 10, 2)>, <7, (1, 6, 10)>

Adding these up:
Total number of 3-stars: [20 + 10] = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 30.
