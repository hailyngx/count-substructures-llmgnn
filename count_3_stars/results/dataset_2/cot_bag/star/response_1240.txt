Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 20) (16, 29) (16, 22) (16, 15) (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 21) (26, 9) (26, 14) (26, 10) (26, 29) (14, 26) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 28) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 22) (8, 20) (8, 1) (8, 18) (13, 25) (13, 1) (10, 26) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 12) (2, 12) (18, 8) (18, 20) (6, 21) (6, 23) (21, 9) (21, 6) (29, 16) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 19) (19, 29) (19, 15) (19, 25) (23, 6) (23, 4) (23, 25) (23, 0) (25, 13) (25, 19) (25, 23) (27, 5) (0, 10) (0, 23) (0, 3) (12, 10) (12, 2) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 5) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 20) (7, 14) (7, 24) (7, 28) (7, 1) (20, 11) (20, 8) (20, 18) (20, 3) (24, 7) (24, 28) (24, 5) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (4, 23) (4, 28) (22, 16) (22, 17) (22, 28) (28, 14) (28, 7) (28, 24) (28, 4) (28, 22) (5, 27) (5, 15) (5, 24) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has neighbors 13, 7, and 8 (3 neighbors), so there is 1 3-star.
2. Node 7 has neighbors 14, 24, and 1 (3 neighbors), so there is 1 3-star.
3. Node 8 has neighbors 20, 18, and 1 (3 neighbors), so there is 1 3-star.
4. Node 9 has neighbors 26, 29, and 21 (3 neighbors), so there is 1 3-star.
5. Node 10 has neighbors 26, 17, and 12 (3 neighbors), so there is 1 3-star.
6. Node 14 has neighbors 1, 7, and 28 (3 neighbors), so there is 1 3-star.
7. Node 15 has neighbors 16, 19, and 5 (3 neighbors), so there is 1 3-star.
8. Node 16 has neighbors 29, 22, and 15 (3 neighbors), so there is 1 3-star.
9. Node 17 has neighbors 3, 10, and 22 (3 neighbors), so there is 1 3-star.
10. Node 20 has neighbors 11, 8, and 18 (3 neighbors), so there is 1 3-star.
11. Node 21 has neighbors 6, 9, and 29 (3 neighbors), so there is 1 3-star.
12. Node 23 has neighbors 0, 4, and 25 (3 neighbors), so there is 1 3-star.
13. Node 24 has neighbors 5, 7, and 28 (3 neighbors), so there is 1 3-star.
14. Node 25 has neighbors 13, 19, and 23 (3 neighbors), so there is 1 3-star.
15. Node 26 has neighbors 29, 14, and 10 (3 neighbors), so there is 1 3-star.
16. Node 28 has neighbors 22, 24, and 7 (3 neighbors), so there is 1 3-star.
17. Node 29 has neighbors 19, 26, and 16 (3 neighbors), so there is 1 3-star.

Summing up all the 3-stars for the 17 nodes gives us: [17].

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, 13, 7, 8>, <7, 1, 14, 24>, <8, 1, 20, 18>, <9, 26, 29, 21>, <10, 26, 17, 12>, <14, 1, 7, 28>, <15, 16, 19, 5>, <16, 29, 22, 15>, <17, 3, 10, 22>, <20, 11, 8, 18>, <21, 6, 9, 29>, <23, 0, 4, 25>, <24, 5, 7, 28>, <25, 13, 19, 23>, <26, 29, 14, 10>, <28, 22, 24, 7>, <29, 19, 26, 16>.
