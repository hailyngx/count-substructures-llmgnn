Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 24) (15, 28) (6, 15) (6, 20) (9, 25) (9, 11) (9, 16) (22, 4) (22, 5) (22, 7) (22, 21) (23, 2) (23, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 26) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 4) (10, 23) (10, 1) (17, 2) (2, 23) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 26) (19, 26) (19, 14) (19, 20) (19, 0) (26, 8) (26, 2) (26, 19) (11, 9) (11, 28) (11, 24) (28, 15) (28, 11) (28, 7) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 18) (0, 1) (7, 22) (7, 28) (20, 6) (20, 19) (4, 3) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 14) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 12) (24, 15) (24, 11) (24, 25) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 29) (1, 5) (29, 1) (29, 27) (21, 22) (21, 18) (5, 22) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 25) (25, 9) (25, 24) (25, 5) (25, 18) (27, 29) (14, 19) (14, 12) (18, 0) (18, 21) (18, 25) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 15, 19, 1, and 18.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 10, 0, 29, and 5.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 23, 8, 17, and 26.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 3, 22, 13, and 12.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 22, 8, 12, 1, and 25.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 13, 2, 26, and 5.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 25, 11, and 16.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 9, 28, and 24.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 4, 16, 5, and 14.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 8, 16, and 4.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, and 24.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 9, 13, and 12.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 0, 21, and 25.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 26, 14, 20, and 0.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 7, and 21.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors: 9, 24, 5, and 18.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: 8, 2, 19, and 14.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors: 15, 11, and 7.
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors: 1 and 27.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 22 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 25 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 26 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by each node, we get a total of [36] 3-stars. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (15, 19, 1)>
- <0, (15, 19, 18)>
- <0, (19, 20, 15)>
- <0, (19, 20, 18)>
- <1, (10, 23, 2)>
- <2, (23, 2, 8)>
- <2, (23, 10, 1)>
- <2, (8, 26, 19)>
- <4, (3, 15, 24)>
- <5, (22, 8, 26)>
- <5, (22, 1, 29)>
- <5, (8, 5, 25)>
- <5, (8, 5, 12)>
- <8, (13, 4, 12)>
- <9, (25, 24, 11)>
- <12, (4, 13, 16)>
- <15, (3, 6, 24)>
- <19, (26, 8, 2)>
- <19, (26, 14, 20)>
- <19, (20, 6, 15)>
- <19, (20, 6, 0)>
- <22, (4, 13, 16)>
- <25, (9, 16, 12)>
- <26, (8, 13, 4)>
- <28, (15, 24, 11)>
