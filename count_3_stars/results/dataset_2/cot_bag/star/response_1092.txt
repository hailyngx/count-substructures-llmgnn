Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: {(5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 0), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0), (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 3), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 8), (7, 1), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 8), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 1), (3, 8), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 1), (8, 3), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 7), (0, 2), (2, 9), (2, 7), (2, 1), (2, 0)}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 3 neighbors.
For node 1: <1, (7, 9, 3)> is a 3-star.
For node 2: <2, (0, 7, 9)> is a 3-star.
For node 3: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 3 neighbors.
For node 4: <4, (7, 8, 9)> is a 3-star.
For node 5: <5, (0, 1, 8)> is a 3-star.
For node 7: <7, (1, 4, 9)> is a 3-star.
For node 8: <8, (1, 4, 5)> is a 3-star.
For node 9: <9, (1, 2, 4)> is a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [8]
