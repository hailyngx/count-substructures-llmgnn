Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 7) (4, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 11) (7, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (10, 17) (10, 0) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 16) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 18) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 13) (3, 13) (11, 4) (11, 13) (1, 6) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 11) (19, 8) (19, 9) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 9) (18, 15) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 15) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 12) (9, 19) (9, 18) (15, 18) (15, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, and 19. 

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0, there are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- For node 2, there are also 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
- For the rest of the nodes with three or more neighbors, they all have exactly 3 neighbors, so each forms only 1 3-star:
  - Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (14, 7, 11)>
  - Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (16, 1, 7)>
  - Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (17, 4, 0)>
  - Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (4, 18, 16)>
  - Node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, (17, 0, 7)>
  - Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (16, 15, 2)>
  - Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (3, 11, 2)>
  - Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (0, 16, 4)>
  - Node 16 forms a 3-star: <16, (12, 6, 8)>
  - Node 18 forms a 3-star: <18, (9, 0, 15)>
  - Node 19 forms a 3-star: <19, (9, 8, 18)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 11 = 19 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].
