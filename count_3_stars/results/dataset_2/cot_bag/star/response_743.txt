Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 13) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 6) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 14) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (12, 10) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 14) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 10: 5 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 13: 5 neighbors

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 
\[ 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 83 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 83. 

Inside brackets []: [83]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found inside <>:

<1, (2, 8, 3)>
<3, (1, 13, 14)>
<3, (6, 10, 14)>
<3, (4, 13, 9)>

<3, (9, 11, 4)>
<7, (0, 9, 13)>
<7, (10, 13, 14)>
<7, (14, 6, 8)>
<7, (9, 11, 4)>
