Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (18, 15) (18, 21) (18, 3) (18, 8) (22, 9) (22, 11) (22, 24) (22, 21) (14, 4) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 25) (21, 18) (21, 22) (21, 19) (15, 18) (15, 13) (20, 13) (20, 28) (6, 11) (28, 20) (28, 26) (28, 0) (13, 15) (13, 20) (13, 16) (26, 28) (26, 24) (26, 29) (24, 22) (24, 26) (24, 9) (9, 22) (9, 24) (9, 29) (9, 3) (29, 26) (29, 9) (29, 27) (29, 12) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 12) (19, 21) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 10) (12, 29) (12, 5) (12, 23) (16, 14) (16, 13) (16, 23) (16, 10) (25, 17) (25, 8) (25, 11) (0, 28) (10, 19) (10, 16) (2, 7) (2, 19) (2, 23) (11, 7) (11, 22) (11, 6) (11, 25) (11, 8) (3, 18) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 23) (27, 29) (27, 23) (8, 18) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 11) (23, 12) (23, 16) (23, 2) (23, 3) (23, 27) 

Response:
There are 15 nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 18, 14, 9, 23.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 19, 8, 12, 25.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 4, 11, 2, 19.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 18, 25, 11, 5.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 22, 24, 29, 3.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 7, 22, 6, 25, 8.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 15, 20, 16, 23.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 4, 17, 3, 16.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 14, 13, 23, 10.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 21, 5, 2, 10.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors: 18, 22, 19, 1.
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors: 12, 16, 2, 3, 27.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors: 17, 8, 11, 25.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: 28, 24, 29.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: 26, 9, 27, 12.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 5 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 7 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 8 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 9 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 11 contributes 2 3-stars.
- Node 13 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 14 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 16 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 19 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 21 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 23 contributes 5 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is [16].

The unique 3-stars formed in this graph are: 
- <3, (18, 14, 9)>
- <5, (19, 8, 12)>
- <7, (4, 11, 2)>
- <8, (18, 25, 11)>
- <9, (22, 24, 29)>
- <11, (7, 22, 6)>
- <13, (15, 20, 16)>
- <14, (4, 17, 3)>
- <16, (14, 13, 23)>
- <19, (21, 5, 2)>
- <21, (18, 22, 19)>
- <23, (12, 16, 2)>, <23, (12, 23, 3)>, <23, (12, 27, 29)>, <23, (16, 3, 23)>, <23, (16, 2, 3)>
