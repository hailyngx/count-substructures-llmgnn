Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}.

Now, we'll identify which nodes have three or more neighbors, as they are potential centers for 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- From nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14}, each can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 can't form any 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 13 \times 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 63 \).

Therefore, [63]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (8, 13, 14)>
- <1, (2, 6, 14)>
- <2, (1, 6, 14)>
- <3, (7, 11, 13)>
- <4, (6, 7, 11)>
- <5, (10, 13, 14)>
- <6, (1, 2, 14)>
- <7, (3, 11, 13)>
- <8, (0, 9, 10)>
- <9, (0, 7, 13)>
- <10, (5, 9, 13)>
- <11, (3, 4, 7)>
- <13, (5, 7, 9)>
- <14, (1, 2, 6)>
