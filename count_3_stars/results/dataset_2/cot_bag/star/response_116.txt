Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5
- Node 4: 1, 5, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 1 are the only nodes with 4 neighbors each, so they will each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 9 have 5 neighbors each, so they will form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it will form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 2 \times 4 + 4 \times 10 + 4 = 46 \).

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [46].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- <6, (0, 7, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
