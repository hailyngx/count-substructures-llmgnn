Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 10) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 12) (13, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 17) (0, 12) (0, 2) (16, 7) (16, 18) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 9) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 15) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 14) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 17) (17, 3) (17, 11) (17, 2) (19, 11) (19, 10) (15, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 6) (10, 12) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 10) (14, 18) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 17, and 18.

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

- Node 1 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 2 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 20.

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars found: 
<1, (3, 8, 5)>
<3, (1, 8, 11)>
<5, (8, 13, 2)>
<7, (8, 11, 16)>
<10, (3, 4, 19)>
<11, (3, 7, 17)>
<12, (5, 0, 10)>
<17, (3, 11, 2)>
<18, (5, 9, 14)>
