Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in the given graph. Let's calculate and count the number of 3-stars based on these nodes:

1. Node 15: It has 3 neighbors (25, 29, 24), so it can form 1 3-star.
2. Node 27: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
3. Node 5: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
4. Node 9: It has 3 neighbors (5, 10), so it can form 1 3-star.
5. Node 21: It has 4 neighbors (7, 16, 0, 19), so it can form 1 3-star.
6. Node 20: It has 5 neighbors (27, 25, 8, 19, 28), so it can form 1 3-star.
7. Node 25: It has 4 neighbors (15, 20, 0, 2), so it can form 1 3-star.
8. Node 2: It has 3 neighbors (25, 1, 13), so it can form 1 3-star.
9. Node 18: It has 4 neighbors (26, 23, 14, 17), so it can form 1 3-star.
10. Node 26: It has 4 neighbors (18, 19, 13, 11), so it can form 1 3-star.
11. Node 13: It has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 26), so it can form 1 3-star.
12. Node 28: It has 3 neighbors (20, 17, 12), so it can form 1 3-star.
13. Node 16: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
14. Node 24: It has 3 neighbors (15, 6, 12), so it can form 1 3-star.
15. Node 22: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
16. Node 1: It has 4 neighbors (2, 22, 29, 10), so it can form 1 3-star.
17. Node 29: It has 4 neighbors (15, 21, 1, 12), so it can form 1 3-star.
18. Node 14: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
19. Node 17: It has 3 neighbors (18, 28, 16), so it can form 1 3-star.
20. Node 23: It has 4 neighbors (18, 4, 6, 3), so it can form 1 3-star.
21. Node 0: It has 3 neighbors (21, 25, 6), so it can form 1 3-star.
22. Node 10: It has 4 neighbors (27, 9, 1, 12), so it can form 1 3-star.
23. Node 12: It has 4 neighbors (28, 24, 29, 10), so it can form 1 3-star.
24. Node 11: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<15, (25, 29, 24)>
<9, (5, 10, 9)>
<21, (7, 16, 19)>
<20, (27, 25, 8)>
<25, (15, 20, 0)>
<2, (25, 1, 13)>
<18, (26, 23, 14)>
<26, (18, 19, 11)>
<13, (2, 4, 26)>
<28, (20, 17, 12)>
<1, (2, 29, 10)>
<29, (15, 21, 12)>
<23, (18, 4, 6)>
<0, (21, 25, 6)>
