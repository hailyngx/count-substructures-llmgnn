Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 15) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 15) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 7) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 18) (3, 5) (3, 18) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 5) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 9) (16, 0) (16, 10) (12, 6) (12, 14) (7, 1) (7, 11) (15, 4) (15, 2) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 0) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 14) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 5) (10, 16) (10, 18) (18, 6) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 8, 13, 4, 2, 1, 17, 11, 16, 0, 12, 7, 15, 19, 5, 14, 10, 18.

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated, we have a total of 26 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [26].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<6, (2, 12, 14)>, 
<6, (2, 12, 18)>, 
<6, (2, 14, 18)>, 
<6, (12, 14, 18)>, 
<4, (2, 8, 15)>, 
<4, (2, 13, 15)>, 
<4, (8, 13, 15)>, 
<4, (8, 13, 2)>, 
<4, (13, 2, 15)>, 
<4, (9, 13, 15)>, 
<11, (0, 7, 13)>, 
<11, (0, 7, 5)>, 
<11, (0, 7, 11)>, 
<11, (5, 7, 13)>, 
<11, (5, 7, 0)>, 
<11, (5, 7, 11)>, 
<5, (3, 8, 14)>, 
<5, (3, 11, 14)>, 
<5, (3, 14, 18)>, 
<5, (8, 11, 14)>, 
<5, (8, 14, 18)>, 
<5, (11, 14, 18)>, 
<14, (6, 12, 5)>, 
<14, (6, 12, 3)>, 
<14, (6, 5, 3)>, 
<18, (6, 17, 3)>.
