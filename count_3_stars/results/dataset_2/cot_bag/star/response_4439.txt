Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 6) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 6) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 12) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 6) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 8) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 10, 13, 14, 6
- Node 1: 5, 11, 8
- Node 2: 5, 9, 14
- Node 3: 9, 11, 13, 14, 7, 12
- Node 4: 8, 12, 6
- Node 5: 9, 2, 1, 7
- Node 6: 11, 4, 0, 12
- Node 7: 5, 10, 13, 3
- Node 8: 11, 13, 4, 1
- Node 9: 5, 2, 14, 3
- Node 10: 0, 7, 13
- Node 11: 3, 1, 6, 8
- Node 12: 4, 14, 3, 6
- Node 13: 10, 8, 3, 7, 0
- Node 14: 9, 0, 3, 12, 2

To find the total number of 3-stars, we check the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 3: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 10: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 13: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 14: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Summing up the 3-stars for each node, we get 4 +1 +1 +20 +1 +4 +4 +4 +4 +4 +1 +4 +4 +10 +10 = 66.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [66]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (10, 13, 14)>
<1, (5, 11, 8)>
<3, (9, 11, 13)>
<4, (8, 12, 6)>
<5, (9, 2, 7)>
<6, (11, 4, 12)>
<7, (10, 13, 3)>
<8, (11, 13, 1)>
<9, (5, 2, 14)>
<13, (10, 8, 7)>
<14, (9, 3, 12)>
