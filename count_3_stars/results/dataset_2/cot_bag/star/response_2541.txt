Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (15, 18) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 19) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 18) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 19) (16, 0) (16, 5) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 2) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 13) (18, 15) (18, 1) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 8) (19, 12) (19, 0) (19, 2) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 8) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 13) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 13) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 18) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors and their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: {16, 5, 19}
- Node 1: {11, 14, 18, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 19, 13}
- Node 4: {12, 9, 2}
- Node 5: {0, 16, 14}
- Node 6: {17, 7, 8}
- Node 8: {10, 12, 18, 6}
- Node 9: {17, 1, 4, 18, 13}
- Node 12: {4, 8, 19}
- Node 14: {7, 1, 5}
- Node 17: {3, 10, 6, 9}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 0: [Inom{3}{3}] = 1
For Node 1: [Inom{4}{3}] = 4
For Node 2: [Inom{3}{3}] = 1
For Node 4: [Inom{3}{3}] = 1
For Node 5: [Inom{3}{3}] = 1
For Node 6: [Inom{3}{3}] = 1
For Node 8: [Inom{4}{3}] = 4
For Node 9: [Inom{5}{3}] = 10
For Node 12: [Inom{3}{3}] = 1
For Node 14: [Inom{3}{3}] = 1
For Node 17: [Inom{5}{3}] = 10

Adding these up, we get the total number of 3-stars: 34

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 14, 16)>
<1, (9, 14, 18)>
<1, (11, 18, 13)>
<1, (9, 14, 18)>
<1, (9, 18, 4)>
<2, (13, 2, 4)>
<4, (9, 2, 12)>
<5, (0, 14, 16)>
<6, (8, 7, 10)>
<8, (6, 12, 18)>
<9, (13, 11, 18)>
<9, (1, 4, 18)>
<12, (4, 8, 19)>
<14, (1, 5, 7)>
<17, (6, 9, 10)>
