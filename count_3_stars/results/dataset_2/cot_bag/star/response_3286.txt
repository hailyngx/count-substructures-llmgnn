Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (3, 9) (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 17) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 17) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 17) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 13) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 16) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 17) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (11, 5) (11, 9) (14, 15) (16, 12) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 10) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 13) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 7) (17, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 3, 15, 4, 8, 2, 0, 19, 12, 18, 1, 6, 11, 14, 16, 13, 10, 17.

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes, we get:

\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 78 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [78].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 10, 17)>, <3, (2, 12, 15)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (9, 10, 11)>, <6, (1, 7, 17)>, <7, (6, 13, 17)>, <8, (0, 4, 19)>, <9, (4, 5, 11)>, <10, (3, 13, 17)>, <11, (5, 9, 19)>, <12, (3, 4, 16)>, <13, (7, 10, 19)>, <14, (15, 17, 18)>, <15, (3, 14, 18)>, <16, (12, 15, 17)>, <17, (2, 7, 18)>, <18, (15, 17, 19)>, <19, (5, 8, 18)>.

These are all the unique 3-stars in the graph.
