Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 13) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 13) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 13) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 6 neighbors: (9, 10, 7, 2, 3, 13)  
   So, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed with node 0.

2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (9, 7, 6, 13)  
   So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 1.

3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (8, 12, 14, 0)  
   So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 2.

4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (8, 0, 14, 13)  
   So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 3.

5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (5, 9, 10, 11)  
   So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 4.

6. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: (8, 12, 0, 1, 6)  
   So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 7.

7. Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (11, 2, 7, 3, 4)  
   So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 8.

8. Node 9 has 5 neighbors: (5, 4, 1, 0, 12)  
   So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 9.

9. Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (11, 0, 4, 13)  
   So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 10.

10. Node 11 has 4 neighbors: (5, 10, 8, 4)  
    So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 11.

11. Node 13 has 5 neighbors: (10, 0, 1, 14, 3)  
    So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 13.

Adding up all these 3-stars, we get: 
\[ [20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10] = [84] \]

So, there are 84 unique 3-stars in this graph.
