Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 20) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 17) (20, 9) (20, 25) (20, 19) (20, 23) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 12) (25, 10) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 12) (23, 20) (23, 8) (23, 27) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 28) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 24) (18, 28) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 17) (26, 18) (26, 2) (13, 21) (13, 6) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 27) (17, 15) (17, 22) (17, 1) (17, 6) (24, 18) (24, 0) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 20) (10, 25) (10, 21) (10, 14) (21, 13) (21, 10) (21, 29) (27, 5) (27, 25) (27, 23) (27, 1) (2, 5) (2, 22) (2, 26) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 12) (7, 3) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 10) (29, 1) (29, 21) (29, 6) (6, 11) (6, 15) (6, 13) (6, 17) (6, 29) (12, 25) (12, 8) (12, 0) (28, 4) (28, 18) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes with three or more neighbors are 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 14, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, and 27. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 40 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].    

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<3, (0, 7, 15)>, <3, (2, 5, 22)>, <3, (5, 9, 20)>, <3, (15, 17, 22)>, 
<5, (2, 5, 19)>, <5, (5, 9, 20)>, <5, (9, 19, 20)>, <5, (5, 9, 27)>, 
<6, (6, 11, 15)>, <6, (6, 13, 29)>, <6, (1, 6, 27)>, <6, (6, 17, 29)>, 
<9, (9, 14, 20)>, <9, (9, 14, 10)>, <9, (5, 9, 14)>, <9, (9, 14, 16)>, 
<10, (10, 14, 25)>, <14, (9, 14, 16)>, <17, (1, 17, 6)>, <17, (17, 15, 22)>, 
<18, (18, 24, 26)>, <18, (4, 18, 24)>, <20, (19, 20, 23)>, <20, (20, 23, 27)>, 
<21, (10, 21, 29)>, <22, (2, 22, 26)>, <23, (8, 23, 27)>, <25, (10, 25, 27)>, 
<27, (1, 27, 5)>, <27, (5, 25, 27)>.
