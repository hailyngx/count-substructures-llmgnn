Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 10) (7, 8) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 0) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 11) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 11) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 12) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 49.

So, there are a total of 49 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting the final answer inside brackets: [49].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 7, 14)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (6, 9, 10)>, <4, (1, 7, 10)>, <5, (2, 7, 11)>, <7, (0, 4, 14)>, <8, (1, 3, 13)>, <10, (3, 4, 12)>, <11, (2, 5, 12)>, <13, (1, 8, 14)>, <14, (0, 7, 13)>.
