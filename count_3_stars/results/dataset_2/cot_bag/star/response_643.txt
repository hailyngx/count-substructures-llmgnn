Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 28) (9, 22) (9, 21) (9, 24) (9, 27) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 25) (7, 6) (7, 24) (7, 10) (2, 27) (2, 6) (29, 6) (29, 19) (29, 12) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (17, 20) (17, 3) (17, 16) (22, 9) (22, 24) (22, 3) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 0) (20, 17) (20, 18) (26, 12) (28, 5) (28, 3) (25, 4) (25, 10) (25, 16) (8, 19) (19, 29) (19, 8) (19, 18) (12, 4) (12, 29) (12, 26) (12, 15) (3, 17) (3, 22) (3, 28) (3, 16) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 21) (0, 6) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 18) (18, 20) (18, 19) (18, 14) (21, 9) (21, 0) (21, 27) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 24) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 25) (16, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 29) (6, 0) (1, 14) (1, 23) (27, 9) (27, 2) (27, 21) (27, 23) (24, 9) (24, 7) (24, 22) (24, 15) (23, 1) (23, 27) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 6, 11, 13, 21
- Node 1: 14, 18, 23
- Node 2: 6, 27
- Node 3: 16, 17, 22, 28
- Node 4: 12, 14, 25
- Node 5: 13, 15, 28
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7, 29
- Node 7: 6, 10, 24
- Node 8: 19
- Node 9: 21, 22, 24, 27
- Node 10: 7, 11, 25
- Node 11: 0, 10, 14
- Node 12: 4, 15, 26, 29
- Node 13: 0, 5, 16
- Node 14: 1, 4, 11, 18
- Node 15: 5, 12, 24
- Node 16: 3, 13, 25
- Node 17: 3, 20
- Node 18: 1, 14, 19, 20
- Node 19: 8, 18, 29
- Node 20: 17, 18
- Node 21: 0, 9, 27
- Node 22: 3, 9, 24
- Node 23: 1, 27
- Node 24: 7, 9, 15, 22
- Node 25: 4, 10, 16
- Node 26: 12
- Node 27: 2, 9, 21, 23
- Node 28: 3, 5
- Node 29: 6, 12, 19

Now, let's identify the 3-star patterns:
- Node 0, 3, 16, (3, 16, 25)
- Node 4, 12, 15, (4, 12, 15)
- Node 6, 7, 24, (6, 7, 24)
- Node 9, 22, 24, (9, 22, 24)
- Node 14, 1, 18, (1, 14, 18)
- Node 18, 19, 29, (18, 19, 29)

Counting them all, we have a total of [6] 3-stars:

<0, 3, 16, 25>, <4, 12, 15>, <6, 7, 24>, <9, 22, 24>, <1, 14, 18>, <18, 19, 29>
