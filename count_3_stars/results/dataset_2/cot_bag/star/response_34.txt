Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 14) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 3) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 23) (25, 10) (4, 22) (8, 9) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 11) (15, 20) (15, 7) (15, 13) (18, 6) (1, 20) (1, 26) (1, 13) (1, 22) (26, 1) (3, 20) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 3) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 17) (5, 25) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 29) (19, 25) (19, 5) (19, 21) (19, 16) (29, 9) (29, 5) (29, 13) (29, 23) (28, 8) (28, 12) (22, 4) (22, 1) (22, 16) (22, 24) (22, 21) (10, 25) (12, 0) (12, 28) (12, 16) (16, 19) (16, 22) (16, 12) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 17) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 29) (13, 21) (21, 0) (21, 19) (21, 22) (21, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 3) (24, 22) (24, 23) (23, 25) (23, 29) (23, 24) (17, 7) (17, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are:
- Node 0: neighbors 7, 21, 12
- Node 1: neighbors 20, 26, 13, 22
- Node 2: neighbors 6, 5, 17
- Node 5: neighbors 25, 19, 2, 29
- Node 6: neighbors 9, 14, 2, 18
- Node 8: neighbors 9, 28, 14, 11
- Node 9: neighbors 6, 8, 29, 14
- Node 12: neighbors 0, 28, 16
- Node 13: neighbors 15, 1, 29, 21
- Node 14: neighbors 6, 9, 8, 3
- Node 15: neighbors 20, 7, 13
- Node 16: neighbors 19, 22, 12

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 7, 21, 12>
<1, 20, 26, 13>
<2, 6, 5, 17>
<5, 25, 19, 2>
<6, 9, 14, 2>
<8, 9, 28, 11>
<9, 6, 8, 14>
<12, 0, 28, 16>
<13, 15, 1, 29>
<14, 6, 9, 3>
<15, 20, 7, 13>
<16, 19, 22, 12>
