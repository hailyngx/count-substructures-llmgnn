Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 9) (1, 15) (1, 11) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 17) (18, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 8) (14, 7) (17, 18) (17, 16) (17, 11) (15, 4) (15, 1) (15, 13) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 16) (12, 4) (12, 5) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 5) (19, 11) (5, 18) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (16, 2) (16, 17) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 6) (10, 4) (10, 16) (13, 18) (13, 15) (6, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 or more neighbors are 4, 7, 2, 18, 8, 15, 9, 11, 5, 16.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 63 \) 3-stars.

So, the final number of 3-stars is [63].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<4, (7, 8, 15)>, <4, (7, 10, 15)>, <4, (7, 12, 15)>, <4, (8, 12, 5)>, <4, (8, 12, 11)>, <7, (4, 8, 3)>, <7, (4, 3, 9)>, <7, (3, 2, 8)>, <7, (3, 2, 18)>, <2, (3, 18, 17)>, <2, (3, 18, 13)>, <2, (18, 17, 16)>, <2, (18, 17, 11)>, <18, (2, 17, 16)>, <18, (2, 17, 11)>, <8, (4, 2, 9)>, <8, (4, 8, 0)>, <8, (2, 0, 8)>, <15, (4, 15, 13)>, <9, (7, 3, 8)>, <9, (3, 8, 16)>, <11, (1, 17, 11)>, <5, (18, 5, 12)>, <16, (9, 16, 6)>.
