Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 15) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 19) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 2) (12, 1) (12, 19) (1, 12) (1, 17) (1, 19) (17, 1) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 7) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 14) (16, 0) (16, 14) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 11) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 13) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 4) (14, 15) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 13) (8, 0) (8, 18) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 11) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 13) (4, 5) (4, 3) (13, 0) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 11) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {7, 16, 8, 13}
- Node 1: {12, 17, 19}
- Node 2: {9, 6, 12, 3, 11}
- Node 3: {2, 14, 4}
- Node 4: {5, 3}
- Node 5: {18, 4, 15}
- Node 6: {9, 2, 19}
- Node 7: {0, 10}
- Node 8: {0, 18}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 11}
- Node 10: {7}
- Node 11: {9, 2, 18, 13}
- Node 12: {2, 1, 19}
- Node 13: {0, 19, 14, 11}
- Node 14: {15, 16, 3, 13}
- Node 15: {5, 19, 14}
- Node 16: {0, 14}
- Node 17: {1}
- Node 18: {5, 8, 11}
- Node 19: {6, 12, 1, 15, 13}

Now, let's determine the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 5 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors. If a node has exactly 3 neighbors, we have exactly 1 3-star with that node. Here are the 3-stars using the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [1]
  - <0, (7, 16, 8)>
- Node 2: [10]
  - <2, (9, 6, 12)>, <2, (9, 6, 3)>, <2, (9, 11, 3)>, <2, (6, 19, 12)>, <2, (6, 19, 1)>, <2, (6, 19, 13)>, <2, (12, 1, 19)>, <2, (12, 19, 1)>, <2, (12, 19, 13)>, <2, (3, 14, 13)>
- Node 3: [1]
  - <3, (2, 14, 13)>
- Node 11: [4]
  - <11, (9, 2, 18)>, <11, (9, 2, 13)>, <11, (9, 13, 14)>, <11, (2, 18, 13)>
- Node 12: [1]
  - <12, (2, 1, 19)>
- Node 13: [4]
  - <13, (0, 19, 14)>, <13, (14, 16, 0)>, <13, (14, 16, 14)>, <13, (14, 16, 13)>
- Node 14: [1]
  - <14, (15, 16, 13)>
- Node 19: [10]
  - <19, (6, 12, 1)>, <19, (6, 12, 15)>, <19, (6, 12, 13)>, <19, (6, 1, 15)>, <19, (12, 1, 15)>, <19, (12, 1, 13)>, <19, (12, 19, 1)>, <19, (12, 19, 15)>, <19, (12, 19, 13)>, <19, (1, 15, 13)>

Finally, summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 21 3-stars in this graph. So, the answer is [21].
