Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 16) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 3) (4, 15) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 17) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 12) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 3) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 18) (5, 19) (5, 8) (19, 6) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 0) (15, 4) (15, 2) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 8) (13, 17) (13, 16) (0, 19) (0, 16) (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (14, 11) (14, 19) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 16) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 19) (2, 15) (2, 1) (18, 6) (18, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors in the graph are: 
Node 2: 6 neighbors
Node 3: 5 neighbors
Node 4: 2 neighbors
Node 6: 3 neighbors
Node 7: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 3 neighbors
Node 9: 2 neighbors
Node 10: 2 neighbors
Node 11: 3 neighbors
Node 12: 3 neighbors
Node 13: 2 neighbors
Node 14: 2 neighbors
Node 15: 2 neighbors
Node 16: 4 neighbors
Node 17: 5 neighbors
Node 18: 2 neighbors
Node 19: 5 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars formed from the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) such 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) such 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) such 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) such 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) such 3-star
Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) such 3-star
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) such 3-star
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) such 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) such 3-stars
Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) such 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars together: 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 61

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [61].

The unique 3-stars found are:
