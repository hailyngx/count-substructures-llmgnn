Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 4 has 4 neighbors, node 6 has 5 neighbors, and node 3 has 5 neighbors. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 = 24

Therefore, there are 24 3-stars in this graph. Listing the unique 3-stars inside <>:
<4, (7, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 1, 5)>, <3, (4, 1, 0)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 2)>, <6, (7, 5, 2)>, <6, (8, 0, 5)>, <3, (8, 0, 5)>, <6, (7, 5, 0)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 2)>, <6, (7, 5, 0)>, <3, (4, 0, 5)>, <6, (7, 2, 0)>, <3, (4, 6, 0)>, <6, (7, 2, 0)>, <3, (1, 0, 5)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 0)>, <6, (7, 8, 5)>, <3, (1, 0, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 0)>, <6, (8, 7, 2)> 

Putting the final count inside brackets: [24]
