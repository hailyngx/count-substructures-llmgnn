Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to check each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 4 has 6 neighbors: 5, 9, 7, 0, 3, 1
Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 9, 4, 3, 6, 8
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 9, 1, 2, 8
Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 4, 8, 2
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 6, 0
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 0
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 7
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 6, 4, 1
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 5, 9, 4
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 4, 1, 8

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

There are no additional 3-stars from nodes 6, 0, 2, or 8 as they all have exactly 4 neighbors.

Adding these up: 20 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
