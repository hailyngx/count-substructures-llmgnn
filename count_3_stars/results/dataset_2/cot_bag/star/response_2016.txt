Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 29) (5, 27) (9, 0) (9, 19) (0, 9) (0, 23) (27, 5) (27, 24) (1, 21) (1, 6) (1, 29) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 3) (21, 18) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 28) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 22) (7, 17) (22, 7) (22, 14) (23, 0) (23, 8) (23, 6) (8, 4) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 26) (15, 13) (15, 17) (20, 18) (20, 2) (12, 5) (12, 28) (28, 21) (28, 4) (28, 12) (28, 26) (28, 2) (24, 27) (24, 6) (26, 8) (26, 28) (26, 10) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 15) (17, 3) (25, 2) (3, 21) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 14) (16, 13) (6, 1) (6, 23) (6, 24) (19, 9) (19, 13) (10, 8) (10, 26) (10, 2) (10, 14) (29, 5) (29, 1) (29, 8) (29, 13) (29, 11) (11, 29) (14, 22) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 2) (18, 21) (18, 20) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 19) (13, 29) (2, 20) (2, 28) (2, 25) (2, 10) (2, 14)

We'll now calculate the number of 3-stars each node is part of:

- For nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
    - Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
    - Node 2 forms inom{5}{3} 3-stars = 10 3-stars.
    - Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} 3-stars = 4 3-stars.
    - Node 4 forms inom{4}{3} 3-stars = 4 3-stars.
    - Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} 3-stars = 4 3-stars.
    - Node 8 forms inom{5}{3} 3-stars = 10 3-stars.
    - Node 10 forms inom{4}{3} 3-stars = 4 3-stars.
    - Node 13 forms inom{4}{3} 3-stars = 4 3-stars.
    - Node 14 forms inom{4}{3} 3-stars = 4 3-stars.
    - Node 21 forms inom{4}{3} 3-stars = 4 3-stars.
    - Node 26 forms inom{3}{3} 3-stars = 1 3-star.
    - Node 28 forms inom{5}{3} 3-stars = 10 3-stars.
    - Node 29 forms inom{5}{3} 3-stars = 10 3-stars.

Summing up, we find the total number of 3-stars to be [55].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
