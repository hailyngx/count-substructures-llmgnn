Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (12, 13) (12, 10) 

Response:
There are a total of 13 nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 2 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 22. 

So, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in the graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (9, 10, 11)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 2, 11)>
- <4, (0, 6, 14)>
- <6, (3, 4, 6)>
- <7, (2, 8, 11)>
- <8, (6, 7, 11)>
- <9, (1, 11, 13)>
- <10, (1, 12, 13)>
- <11, (3, 8, 9)>
- <12, (10, 13, 14)>
- <13, (9, 10, 12)>
