Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 8) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 10) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 11) (12, 1) (16, 12) (16, 9) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 13) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 1) (19, 17) (19, 6) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 2) (1, 12) (1, 18) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 1) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 9) (13, 1) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 12) 

Response:
The nodes can be represented as follows:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 \}
\end{aligned}
\]

The node degrees are: 

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\{ 4, 4, 4, 2, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 3, 2 \}
\end{aligned}
\]

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is the sum of the possible 3-stars around each node with degree 3 or more. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars around each node:
\[
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Node 1: } {4 \choose 3} = 4 \\
&\text{Node 2: } {4 \choose 3} = 4 \\
&\text{Node 4: } {3 \choose 3} = 1 \\
&\text{Node 5: } {4 \choose 3} = 4 \\
&\text{Node 7: } {4 \choose 3} = 4 \\
&\text{Node 8: } {4 \choose 3} = 4 \\
&\text{Node 9: } {3 \choose 3} = 1 \\
&\text{Node 10: } {3 \choose 3} = 1 \\
&\text{Node 11: } {3 \choose 3} = 1 \\
&\text{Node 12: } {4 \choose 3} = 4 \\
&\text{Node 13: } {4 \choose 3} = 4 \\
&\text{Node 14: } {4 \choose 3} = 4 \\
&\text{Node 15: } {4 \choose 3} = 4 \\
&\text{Node 16: } {2 \choose 3} = 0 \\
&\text{Node 17: } {4 \choose 3} = 4 \\
&\text{Node 18: } {3 \choose 3} = 1 \\
&\text{Node 19: } {2 \choose 3} = 0 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node with degree 3 or more:

\[
4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 35
\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 35, which can be represented as \( [35] \).

Unique 3-stars:
\[
\{ <1, (2, 13, 14)>, <4, (8, 10, 11)>, <5, (0, 10, 18)>, <7, (14, 17, 18)>, <12, (1, 6, 11)>, <15, (3, 13, 14)>, <17, (7, 8, 19)> \}
\]
