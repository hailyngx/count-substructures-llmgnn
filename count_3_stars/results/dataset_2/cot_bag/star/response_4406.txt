Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 5) (5, 14) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 13) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph to make it easier to identify the unique 3-stars:

```
          0----2----1
          |    |    |
          14---4----5
          |    |    |
          6----11--13
          |    |    |
          7----12---3
             /
            10--8--9
```

Here, we have identified the following nodes with three or more neighbors:
Node 0 (degree = 4), Node 2 (degree = 4), Node 1 (degree = 4), Node 14 (degree = 6), Node 4 (degree = 5), Node 5 (degree = 5), Node 6 (degree = 4), Node 11 (degree = 4), Node 7 (degree = 4), Node 10 (degree = 5), Node 9 (degree = 4), Node 3 (degree = 3).

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{0}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{14}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{11}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{9}{3} \]
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = 0 + 1 + 0 + 364 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 165 + 35 + 120 + 84 \]
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = 799 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 799.

Listing the unique 3-stars found inside <> each only once:
<0, 2, 14>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 14, 4>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 11>, <2, 4, 14>, <2, 3, 10>, <4, 5, 14>, <5, 8, 10>, <5, 13, 6>, <6, 10, 7>, <7, 9, 1>, <9, 10, 4>, <10, 8, 11>.
