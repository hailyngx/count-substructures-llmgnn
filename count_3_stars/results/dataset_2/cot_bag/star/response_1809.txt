Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \(  \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \(  \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \(  \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \(  \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \(  \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \(  \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \(  \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 37

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [37].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
