Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 12) (9, 16) (26, 9) (26, 25) (26, 8) (3, 17) (3, 12) (15, 7) (15, 6) (2, 23) (2, 28) (2, 21) (29, 7) (29, 6) (29, 18) (14, 17) (14, 0) (17, 3) (17, 14) (17, 11) (20, 18) (20, 5) (20, 28) (25, 26) (25, 22) (5, 20) (5, 12) (5, 1) (8, 26) (8, 0) (23, 2) (23, 1) (23, 24) (13, 22) (13, 19) (13, 18) (13, 6) (22, 25) (22, 13) (22, 7) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 18) (7, 15) (7, 29) (7, 22) (7, 0) (7, 11) (6, 15) (6, 29) (6, 13) (6, 21) (6, 12) (21, 2) (21, 6) (21, 24) (4, 12) (27, 10) (27, 1) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 4) (11, 17) (11, 7) (16, 9) (16, 18) (1, 5) (1, 23) (1, 27) (10, 27) (10, 19) (10, 24) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 28) (28, 2) (28, 20) (28, 19) (18, 29) (18, 20) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 16) (24, 23) (24, 21) (24, 10) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes that have three or more neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 7, 12, and 18. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 

\[ 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 45 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 45, which can be represented as [45].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, 7, 11>, <2, 1, 23>, <2, 28, 19>, <2, 21, 24>, <6, 12, 4>, <6, 15, 29>, <7, 0, 18>, <7, 15, 29>, <12, 3, 17>, <12, 5, 1>, <13, 6, 21>, <13, 18, 0>, <13, 22, 7>, <16, 9, 18>, <18, 0, 7>, <18, 13, 6>, <18, 16, 9>, <19, 10, 24>, <20, 5, 1>, <20, 28, 19>, <21, 2, 24>, <22, 13, 7>, <25, 26, 8>, <26, 9, 12>, <27, 10, 24>
  
These are the unique 3-stars formed in the given graph.
