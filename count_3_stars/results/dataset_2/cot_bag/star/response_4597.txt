Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Node 1 has 6 neighbors: {4, 7, 8, 5, 9, 0}
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {7, 5, 9, 0}
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {7, 9, 5, 1, 6}
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {4, 7, 8, 5}
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {4, 3, 6, 5, 1}
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {2, 9, 6, 1}
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: {4, 8, 3, 1, 0}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 62 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [62].
