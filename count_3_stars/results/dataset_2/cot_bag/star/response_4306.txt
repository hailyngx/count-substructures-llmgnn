Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 16) (17, 18) (17, 4) (3, 7) (11, 15) (0, 18) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (13, 6) (13, 16) (13, 2) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 14) (19, 15) (19, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 18) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 16) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 15) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 16) (16, 10) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 1) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, and 18. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 78 \]

Therefore, there are a total of 78 3-stars in this graph.
Putting this number inside brackets: \[ [78] \]

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, (6, 9, 13)>, <6, (4, 9, 10)>, <7, (1, 8, 15)>, <9, (1, 4, 12)>, <10, (6, 15, 16)>, <12, (9, 18, 19)>, <13, (2, 6, 16)>, <15, (4, 10, 18)>, <16, (1, 10, 14)>, <18, (4, 12, 17)>
