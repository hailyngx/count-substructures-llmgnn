Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's analyze the nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 5, 8, 2, 7, and 6. It forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 5, 4, 2, and 6. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 8, 1, 3, and 0. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 8, and 2. It forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 9, 3, 1, 6, and 0. It forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 0, 3, and 5. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 4, 8, 0, 7, and 1. It forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 9, 0, and 6. It forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 2, 0, 6, and 3. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 4, 3, and 7. It forms 0 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 34 \).

Therefore, there are [34] total 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
