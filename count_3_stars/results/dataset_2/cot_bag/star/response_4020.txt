Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 19) (25, 20) (25, 19) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 6) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 29) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (0, 16) (0, 21) (0, 11) (22, 5) (22, 29) (26, 20) (26, 27) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 13) (28, 11) (28, 24) (28, 15) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 14) (27, 26) (27, 18) (27, 16) (16, 0) (16, 27) (16, 24) (23, 2) (23, 21) (23, 12) (7, 3) (7, 29) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (29, 4) (29, 22) (29, 7) (29, 5) (24, 28) (24, 16) (24, 9) (24, 13) (24, 14) (6, 20) (6, 8) (6, 15) (2, 20) (2, 23) (2, 17) (2, 10) (21, 0) (21, 23) (12, 23) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 9) (13, 11) (13, 24) (13, 12) (9, 24) (9, 12) (5, 22) (5, 29) (18, 8) (18, 27) (18, 15) (15, 28) (15, 17) (15, 6) (15, 18) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 10) (10, 2) (10, 1) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 24) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.
- Node 25 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 63 3-stars.

Thus, there are a total of [63] unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <>:
