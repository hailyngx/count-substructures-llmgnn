Node 6: degree 4  
Node 7: degree 4  
Node 8: degree 3  
Node 9: degree 3  
Node 10: degree 3  
Node 11: degree 4  
Node 12: degree 2  
Node 13: degree 1    
Node 14: degree 4  
Node 15: degree 3  
Node 16: degree 5  
Node 17: degree 3  
Node 18: degree 4  
Node 19: degree 2  
Node 20: degree 4  
Node 21: degree 3  
Node 22: degree 5  
Node 23: degree 1  
Node 24: degree 3  
Node 25: degree 2  
Node 26: degree 3  
Node 27: degree 5  
Node 28: degree 2  
Node 29: degree 3  

There are 7 nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 28 \)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (12, 15, 28)> <1, (9, 15, 25)> <2, (3, 20, 25)> <3, (2, 20, 26)> <6, (7, 14, 28)> <7, (6, 14, 19)> <14, (6, 16, 28)>
