Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 21) (9, 20) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 14) (21, 9) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 12) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 19) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 22) (26, 11) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 27) (11, 3) (11, 26) (11, 6) (11, 23) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 27) (4, 13) (27, 6) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 23) (16, 21) (16, 28) (28, 16) (28, 15) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 20) (15, 28) (15, 22) (15, 24) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 24) (17, 7) (23, 25) (23, 11) (23, 27) (23, 18) (0, 17) (2, 9) (2, 10) (12, 21) (12, 6) (12, 8) (29, 1) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 8) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (14, 1) (14, 27) (14, 20) (22, 25) (22, 15) (20, 9) (20, 1) (20, 10) (20, 14) (18, 13) (18, 23) (19, 3) (19, 13) (24, 15) (24, 17) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are:  
Node 1 (with 4 neighbors)  
Node 3 (with 5 neighbors)  
Node 4 (with 4 neighbors)  
Node 5 (with 3 neighbors)  
Node 6 (with 4 neighbors)  
Node 9 (with 5 neighbors)  
Node 11 (with 5 neighbors)  
Node 12 (with 3 neighbors)  
Node 14 (with 3 neighbors)  
Node 15 (with 3 neighbors)  
Node 16 (with 2 neighbors)  
Node 17 (with 4 neighbors)  
Node 20 (with 4 neighbors)  
Node 21 (with 3 neighbors)  
Node 22 (with 2 neighbors)  
Node 23 (with 4 neighbors)  
Node 27 (with 4 neighbors)  
Node 28 (with 2 neighbors)  

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) and sum them up:

\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 = 54 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 54, which can be represented as [54].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:  
<1, (21, 20, 29)>  
<3, (25, 11, 17)>  
<4, (9, 27, 13)>  
<5, (9, 6, 10)>  
<6, (5, 11, 12)>  
<9, (5, 4, 20)>  
<11, (3, 26, 8)>  
<13, (4, 19, 18)>  
<14, (1, 27, 20)>  
<15, (28, 22, 24)>  
<17, (3, 0, 24)>  
<18, (13, 23, 19)>  
<19, (3, 13, 18)>  
<20, (9, 1, 14)>  
<21, (9, 1, 16)>
