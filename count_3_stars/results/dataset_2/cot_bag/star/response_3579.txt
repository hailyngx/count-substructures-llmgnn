Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
1: 6, 8, 2, 0
2: 4, 0, 1, 3
3: 4, 7, 2, 5, 9
4: 5, 7, 3, 2
5: 9, 4, 3
6: 9, 1, 0
7: 4, 0, 3, 8
8: 7, 0, 1
9: 5, 6, 3, 0

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [C(6, 3) + C(5, 3) + C(4, 3) + C(4, 3)] = [20 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [38]
- Node 3: [C(5, 3)] = [10]
- Node 4: [C(4, 3)] = [4]
- Node 7: [C(4, 3)] = [4]
- Node 9: [C(4, 3)] = [4]

Total number of 3-stars: [38 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [60]

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
