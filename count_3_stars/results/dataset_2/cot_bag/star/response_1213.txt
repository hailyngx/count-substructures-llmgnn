Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 22) (11, 20) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 22) (15, 26) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 14) (27, 13) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 24) (6, 9) (6, 22) (10, 26) (10, 19) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 8) (0, 26) (0, 19) (20, 11) (20, 0) (7, 25) (12, 16) (12, 21) (12, 18) (24, 9) (24, 26) (24, 8) (24, 13) (24, 28) (26, 15) (26, 10) (26, 0) (26, 24) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 17) (25, 15) (25, 7) (25, 17) (25, 1) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 25) (17, 28) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 21) (2, 4) (28, 0) (28, 24) (28, 17) (18, 12) (18, 14) (18, 21) (23, 21) (23, 29) (29, 15) (29, 23) (8, 0) (8, 24) (1, 5) (1, 25) (1, 4) (21, 12) (21, 2) (21, 18) (21, 23) (14, 27) (14, 18) (14, 13) (22, 11) (22, 16) (22, 6) (13, 27) (13, 24) (13, 2) (13, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 5, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 46 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [46].
