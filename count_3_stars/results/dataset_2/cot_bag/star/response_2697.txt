Response:
The nodes with their edges are as follows:
1: (23)
2: (21, 19)
3: (7, 11, 23, 0, 14)
4: (6, 21, 24)
5: (9, 29, 17, 0, 15)
6: (9, 28, 21, 4)
7: (22, 3, 11, 27)
8: (12, 28, 27)
9: (5, 6, 27)
10: (20, 19)
11: (7, 14)
12: (8)
13: (1)
14: (11, 24, 3)
15: (22, 16, 5)
16: (26, 0, 15)
17: (5, 26, 25)
18: (0)
19: (21, 24, 0, 2, 10)
20: (26, 10)
21: (6, 4, 23, 2)
22: (26, 15, 7)
23: (29, 21, 1, 3)
24: (4, 14, 19)
25: (28, 17, 27)
26: (22, 20, 16, 17)
27: (9, 7, 25, 8)
28: (6, 8, 25)
29: (5, 23)

Now we'll determine the number of 3-stars:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 0 + 1 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].
