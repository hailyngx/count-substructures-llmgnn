Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 2) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 9) (21, 24) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 16) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 18) (17, 13) (17, 18) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 11) (23, 4) (23, 5) (23, 28) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 29) (12, 3) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 15) (14, 0) (14, 29) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 20) (28, 23) (26, 1) (26, 2) (26, 20) (9, 21) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 27) (13, 17) (13, 24) (13, 27) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 2) (19, 4) (19, 6) (19, 22) (19, 15) (19, 3) (22, 16) (22, 19) (22, 3) (18, 7) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 9) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 19) (15, 25) (3, 12) (3, 19) (3, 22) (29, 7) (29, 12) (29, 14) (29, 5) (29, 11) (5, 23) (5, 29) (2, 1) (2, 26) (2, 16) (20, 6) (20, 26) (20, 27) (25, 15) (24, 21) (24, 13) (11, 8) (11, 29) (27, 9) (27, 13) (27, 20) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding all these up gives us the total number of 3-stars in this graph: 
\(4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 68 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [68].

Now, listing out the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 8, 26)>
<4, (16, 19, 22)>
<7, (12, 18, 29)>
<8, (1, 9, 16)>
<9, (8, 18, 27)>
<12, (7, 18, 29)>
<13, (17, 24, 27)>
<16, (4, 8, 22)>
<18, (7, 9, 12)>
<19, (4, 6, 15)>
<21, (1, 9, 24)>
<22, (16, 19, 3)>
<23, (4, 5, 28)>
<26, (1, 2, 20)>
<29, (7, 12, 14)>
