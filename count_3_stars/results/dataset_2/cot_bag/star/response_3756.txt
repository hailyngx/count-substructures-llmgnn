Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 0) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 10) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 8) (3, 8) (3, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {12, 14, 13}
- Node 1: {9, 8, 14, 5}
- Node 2: {6, 12, 8, 13, 11}
- Node 3: {8, 14}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 1}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 10, 2, 11}
- Node 7: {4, 12, 10}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 11, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 14, 1, 13}
- Node 10: {7, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {6, 2, 8}
- Node 12: {7, 2, 10, 0}
- Node 13: {4, 9, 2, 0, 14}
- Node 14: {9, 0, 3, 1, 13, 10}

Calculating \( \text{inom}(n, 3) \) for each node with more than three neighbors:
- For Node 1: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- For Node 2: \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)
- For Node 6: \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)
- For Node 9: \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)
- For Node 10: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- For Node 13: \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (9, 8, 5)>
- <2, (6, 12, 11)>
- <6, (9, 10, 5)>
- <9, (4, 13, 14)>
- <10, (7, 12, 14)>
- <13, (4, 9, 14)>
