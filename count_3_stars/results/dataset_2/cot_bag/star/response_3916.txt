Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 13) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 13) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 3) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 4, 7, 12, 14, 1, 6, 11, 2, 3, 10, and 13.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

2. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

3. Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

4. Node 7 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

5. Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

6. Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

7. Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

8. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

9. Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

10. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

11. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

12. Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

13. Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Adding up all these 3-stars, we get \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 75 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [75] \).

And the unique 3-stars are: 
<5, (9, 7, 12)>, 
<9, (5, 7, 2)>, 
<4, (3, 14, 13)>, 
<12, (5, 10, 3)>, 
<14, (9, 6, 13)>, 
<1, (9, 8, 6)>, 
<6, (0, 14, 2)>, 
<11, (12, 0, 8)>, 
<2, (9, 10, 6)>, 
<3, (4, 12, 2)>, 
<10, (5, 12, 2)>, 
<13, (4, 0, 11)>
