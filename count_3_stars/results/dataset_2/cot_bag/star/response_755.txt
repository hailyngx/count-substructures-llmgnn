Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 2) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes and the corresponding neighbors are as follows:  
0: 6, 7, 3, 11, 10, 1  
1: 8, 5, 0, 2  
2: 9, 7, 10, 14, 1  
3: 9, 12, 11, 0  
4: 9, 5, 14, 11  
5: 8, 12, 1, 4  
6: 9, 7, 11, 0  
7: 6, 12, 0, 2, 9  
8: 5, 10, 1  
9: 6, 4, 2, 14, 10, 3  
10: 9, 8, 0, 2  
11: 6, 4, 3, 0  
12: 7, 5, 3  
13: 14  
14: 9, 4, 2, 13  

From the list of nodes and edges, we can observe that the nodes {0, 9, 2, 6, 10, 14} have 6 or more neighbors, so we need to consider these nodes for 3-stars:  
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.  
- Node 9 also has 6 neighbors, contributing another \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.  
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, contributing \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
- Node 6, 10, and 14 have 4 neighbors each, so they do not contribute to any additional 3-stars.  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 50.  

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us [50].  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (6, 11, 3)>  
<0, (6, 7, 9)>  
<0, (6, 7, 1)>  
<0, (6, 7, 10)>  
<0, (6, 7, 1)>  
<0, (6, 9, 4)>  
<0, (6, 9, 11)>  
<0, (6, 9, 3)>  
<0, (7, 2, 10)>  
<0, (3, 9, 11)>  
<9, (6, 4, 11)>  
<9, (6, 4, 14)>  
<9, (6, 2, 14)>  
<9, (7, 2, 10)>  
<9, (2, 14, 13)>  
<2, (9, 7, 14)>
