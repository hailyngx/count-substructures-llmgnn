Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 28) (7, 27) (7, 1) (18, 22) (18, 14) (18, 6) (18, 29) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 29) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 20) (17, 15) (0, 10) (0, 20) (0, 15) (20, 11) (20, 0) (20, 27) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 27) (8, 28) (8, 21) (8, 3) (29, 18) (29, 22) (29, 13) (14, 18) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 5) (13, 11) (13, 29) (26, 2) (26, 28) (26, 3) (5, 14) (5, 21) (28, 7) (28, 8) (28, 26) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 24) (12, 1) (6, 18) (6, 14) (6, 24) (6, 25) (24, 12) (24, 6) (24, 25) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 16) (3, 8) (3, 26) (19, 2) (19, 25) (19, 16) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 17) (15, 0) (16, 22) (16, 1) (16, 19) (23, 4) (25, 6) (25, 24) (25, 19) (9, 10) (9, 11) (27, 7) (27, 20) (27, 2) (21, 8) (21, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:  
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 12, 14, 18, 20, 22, 26, 28, 29  
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 11, 15, 24, 25  

Next, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

For nodes with 5 neighbors:  
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  

For nodes with 4 neighbors:  
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  

Summing up all the 3-stars we found:  
Total number of 3-stars = 10*10 + 6*4 = 100 + 24 = 124

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [124].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<7, (4, 1, 15)>
<12, (4, 11, 14)>
<14, (6, 12, 5)>
<18, (22, 29, 16)>
<20, (11, 0, 27)>
<22, (18, 29, 16)>
<26, (2, 28, 3)>
<28, (26, 7, 8)>
<29, (18, 22, 13)>
<0, (10, 20, 15)>
<6, (18, 24, 25)>
<11, (9, 13, 12)>
<15, (4, 0, 17)>
<24, (12, 6, 25)>
<25, (6, 24, 19)>
