Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 5, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: Since node 0 has 5 neighbors, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center. 
2. Node 2: Node 2 also has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
3. Node 4: Node 4 has 4 neighbors, resulting in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
4. Node 5: Node 5 has 6 neighbors, leading to \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center.
5. Node 9: Node 9 has 5 neighbors, thus \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \[ [10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10] = [54] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 6, 0)>
- <4, (8, 2, 9)>
- <5, (0, 7, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 0)>
