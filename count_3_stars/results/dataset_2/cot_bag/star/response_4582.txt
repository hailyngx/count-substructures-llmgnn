Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 7) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 1) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 4) (7, 19) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 13) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 3) (18, 4) (18, 16) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 8) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 16) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 2) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 1) (16, 15) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the graph can be represented visually as shown below.  

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Node} & \text{Neighbors} \\
\hline
1 & 4, 6, 8, 15, 16 \\
2 & 9, 13 \\
3 & 10, 12 \\
4 & 1, 7, 18 \\
5 & 6, 8, 9 \\
6 & 1, 5, 8 \\
7 & 4, 14, 17, 19 \\
8 & 1, 5, 6 \\
9 & 2, 5, 12, 16 \\
10 & 3, 11, 13 \\
11 & 10, 13 \\
12 & 3, 9, 13 \\
13 & 2, 10, 11, 12, 15 \\
14 & 7, 17, 19 \\
15 & 1, 13, 16 \\
16 & 9, 15, 18 \\
17 & 7, 14, 19 \\
18 & 4, 16 \\
19 & 7, 14, 17 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars. 

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up all these possibilities, we have a total of \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 37 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 37, which I will represent as \([37]\). 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (4, 8, 15)>
- <1, (4, 15, 16)>
- <1, (6, 5, 8)>
- <1, (6, 8, 15)>
- <1, (6, 15, 16)>
- <4, (1, 7, 14)>
- <4, (7, 14, 19)>
- <4, (7, 17, 19)>
- <4, (14, 17, 19)>
- <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- <7, (14, 17, 19)>
- <9, (12, 13, 15)>
- <13, (10, 11, 12)>
- <13, (10, 11, 15)>
- <13, (10, 12, 15)>
- <13, (11, 12, 15)>
- <13, (11, 12, 2)>
- <13, (10, 2, 15)>
- <13, (11, 2, 15)>
