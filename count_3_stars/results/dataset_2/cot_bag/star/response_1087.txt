Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 2) (13, 9) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
Node 1 with neighbors: 5, 9, 6, 3, 11, 8
Node 6 with neighbors: 9, 1, 2, 11, 4
Node 8 with neighbors: 5, 1, 4, 12, 7
Node 11 with neighbors: 6, 1, 10, 14, 0, 4
Node 14 with neighbors: 5, 10, 11, 0, 2

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For node 1: inom{6}{3} = 20
For node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 11: inom{6}{3} = 20
For node 14: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 70

Hence, there are 70 3-stars in this graph.
[70]

The unique 3-stars are:
