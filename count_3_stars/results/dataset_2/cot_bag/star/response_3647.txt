Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {6, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {6, 9, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {9, 3, 8, 5}
- Node 3: {9, 1, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {6, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 5: {1, 8, 2, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 8, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 1}
- Node 8: {6, 4, 2, 5}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 3, 1, 7}

Based on the number of neighbors each node has, we can count the number of 3-stars for each node and sum them up. 

Let's calculate:
- Nodes 0, 7, and 3 do not form any 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Nodes 1 and 2 form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Nodes 4, 8, and 9 form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars since it has 5 neighbors.

Adding these up, we get a total of 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 39 3-stars. So, the total number of 3-stars is [39].

The unique 3-stars found are:
