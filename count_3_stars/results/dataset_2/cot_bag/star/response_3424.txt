Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 0) (15, 14) (6, 7) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 2) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 11) (17, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (0, 15) (0, 7) (14, 15) (14, 1) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 18) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (19, 4) (8, 3) (8, 17) (8, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 19) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 8) (16, 3) (18, 10) (18, 13) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's find the number of 3-stars.

First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Since node 12 has exactly 3 neighbors, it forms only 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 47 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [47].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (13, 17, 18)>
<15, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 15)>
<9, (4, 7, 15)>
<4, (9, 10, 17)>
