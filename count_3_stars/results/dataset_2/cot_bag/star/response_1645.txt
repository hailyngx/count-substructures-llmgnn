Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 10) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 72

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [72].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 7, 14)>, <3, (1, 6, 10)>, <4, (7, 10, 11)>, <6, (1, 3, 12)>, <7, (1, 4, 11)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (5, 7, 14)>, <10, (0, 3, 6)>, <12, (1, 10, 11)>, <14, (1, 9, 13)>
