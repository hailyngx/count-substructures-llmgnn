Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 21) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 29) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 2) (20, 1) (20, 25) (20, 7) (20, 18) (25, 20) (25, 15) (18, 22) (18, 20) (18, 8) (4, 8) (4, 27) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 4) (7, 11) (7, 20) (7, 12) (7, 27) (12, 7) (12, 15) (17, 11) (17, 29) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 6) (29, 26) (26, 29) (26, 28) (26, 24) (26, 14) (26, 0) (28, 26) (28, 27) (28, 24) (24, 26) (24, 28) (24, 21) (27, 4) (27, 7) (27, 28) (27, 21) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 5) (23, 10) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 6) (15, 25) (15, 12) (6, 29) (6, 23) (21, 22) (21, 24) (21, 27) (21, 14) (0, 10) (0, 26) (14, 26) (14, 23) (14, 21) (14, 16) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 9) (9, 2) (16, 3) (16, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to consider nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 8, 20
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 8, 29, 16
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 11, 20, 12, 27
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 11, 0, 2, 23
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 10, 23, 7, 17, 2
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 26, 23, 21, 16
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 22, 20, 8, 18
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors: 1, 25, 7, 18
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors: 22, 24, 27, 14
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: 13, 18, 21
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors: 29, 28, 24, 14, 0
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: 3, 17, 6, 26

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors: 
1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
