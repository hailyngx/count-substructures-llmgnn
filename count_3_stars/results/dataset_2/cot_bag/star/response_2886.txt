Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (16, 17) (16, 2) (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 13) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 10) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 10) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 16) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 17) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (19, 5) (19, 1) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 17) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 13) (12, 18) (14, 9) (14, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4 = 52 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 52. 

Listing the unique 3-stars: 
<1, (11, 8, 19)>, <2, (16, 15, 18)>, <3, (1, 15, 14)>, <4, (7, 2, 10)>, <6, (11, 9, 0)>, <7, (11, 5, 4)>, <9, (6, 14, 13)>, <10, (3, 15, 4)>, <11, (6, 1, 7)>, <13, (9, 1, 17)>, <15, (3, 10, 2)>, <18, (2, 12, 17)>, <19, (5, 1, 7)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].
