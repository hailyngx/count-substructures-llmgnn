Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with less than 3 neighbors: node 0, 2, 8, and 3. So, we will not form any 3-star around these nodes. Nodes 1, 7, 5, and 4 have 4 neighbors each, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes.

For node 1, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<1, (5, 9, 8)>, <1, (5, 9, 6)>, <1, (5, 8, 6)>, <1, (9, 8, 6)>

For node 7, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<7, (5, 4, 6)>, <7, (5, 4, 0)>, <7, (5, 6, 0)>, <7, (4, 6, 0)>

For node 5, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<5, (1, 9, 6)>, <5, (1, 8, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 8, 7)>

For node 4, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<4, (7, 6, 0)>, <4, (7, 8, 0)>, <4, (7, 6, 2)>, <4, (6, 8, 0)>

Thus, we have a total of \(4+4+4+4 = 16\) 3-stars. So, the final answer is [16].
