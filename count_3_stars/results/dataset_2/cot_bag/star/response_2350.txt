Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 9) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 10) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 10) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 63 \). So, the total number of 3-stars is [63].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (8, 9, 11)>
<3, (0, 9, 10)>
<4, (0, 9, 10)>
<6, (7, 12, 13)>
<7, (6, 12, 14)>
<8, (2, 9, 11)>
<9, (0, 4, 13)>
<10, (1, 4, 13)>
<11, (2, 9, 14)>
<12, (6, 7, 14)>
<13, (4, 10, 11)>
<14, (7, 11, 12)>
