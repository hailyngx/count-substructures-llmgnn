Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 45\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>.
