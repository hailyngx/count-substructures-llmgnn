Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 14) (3, 14) (3, 12) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 4) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 6) (7, 11) (12, 3) (12, 17) (2, 8) (2, 17) (8, 15) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (19, 5) (19, 13) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 14) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 4) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 16) (13, 15) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 19) (4, 15) (4, 16) (4, 6) (4, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges:
- Node 0: (5, 0), (6, 0)
- Node 1: (6, 1), (8, 1)
- Node 2: (8, 2), (17, 2)
- Node 3: (14, 3), (12, 3)
- Node 4: (6, 4), (14, 4), (16, 4), (15, 4)
- Node 5: (9, 5), (0, 5), (19, 5)
- Node 6: (0, 6), (1, 6), (4, 6), (11, 6), (16, 6)
- Node 7: (11, 7)
- Node 8: (1, 8), (15, 8), (2, 8), (14, 8)
- Node 9: (5, 9), (18, 9), (14, 9)
- Node 10: (16, 10), (13, 10)
- Node 11: (6, 11), (7, 11), (18, 11), (13, 11)
- Node 12: (3, 12), (17, 12)
- Node 13: (10, 13), (11, 13), (15, 13), (19, 13)
- Node 14: (3, 14), (9, 14), (18, 14), (4, 14)
- Node 15: (8, 15), (13, 15), (4, 15)
- Node 16: (10, 16), (17, 16), (6, 16), (4, 16)
- Node 17: (2, 17), (16, 17), (12, 17)
- Node 18: (9, 18), (11, 18), (14, 18)
- Node 19: (5, 19), (13, 19)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
Denote the number of 3-star centered at a node as \( n_i \):

\[ [n_0 + n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 + n_5 + n_6 + n_7 + n_8 + n_9 + n_{10} + n_{11} + n_{12} + n_{13} + n_{14} + n_{15} + n_{16} + n_{17} + n_{18} + n_{19}] \]

Next, let's calculate \( inom{n}{3} \) for each node and sum them up to find the total number of 3-stars. 

\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 4] \]

\[ [49] \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<5, (0, 6, 19)>, <6, (1, 4, 16)>, <13, (10, 15, 19)>
