Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 8) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 0) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 70

So, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [70].
