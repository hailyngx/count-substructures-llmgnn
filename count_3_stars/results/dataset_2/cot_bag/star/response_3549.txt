Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (9, 13) (9, 18) (9, 7) (9, 27) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 3) (29, 8) (6, 24) (6, 27) (6, 0) (4, 18) (4, 21) (4, 2) (18, 9) (18, 4) (26, 23) (26, 3) (26, 0) (0, 6) (0, 26) (0, 7) (0, 23) (0, 19) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 20) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 27) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 16) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 8) (16, 7) (16, 15) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 23) (21, 4) (21, 16) (21, 22) (24, 6) (24, 16) (24, 12) (24, 23) (23, 26) (23, 0) (23, 16) (23, 24) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 27) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 20) (3, 17) (3, 26) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 20) (20, 7) (20, 19) (20, 11) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 24) (12, 11) (12, 8) (27, 9) (27, 6) (27, 1) (27, 13) (8, 29) (8, 10) (8, 12) (25, 2) (22, 21) (2, 4) (2, 25) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 21, 23, 24, 26, and 27.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 74

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [74].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (7, 23, 26)>, <4, (18, 19, 21)>, <6, (0, 26, 27)>, <7, (0, 9, 16)>, 
<9, (13, 18, 27)>, <10, (1, 8, 14)>, <12, (11, 15, 24)>, <13, (11, 19, 27)>, 
<15, (1, 12, 19)>, <16, (7, 15, 21)>, <19, (13, 15, 20)>, <21, (16, 4, 22)>, 
<23, (0, 16, 24)>, <24, (6, 12, 16)>, <26, (0, 3, 23)>, <27, (1, 9, 13)>
