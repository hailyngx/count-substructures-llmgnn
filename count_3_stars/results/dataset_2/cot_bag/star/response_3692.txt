Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Let's first list the degrees of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 5

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 5:
Since Node 5 is connected to 5 other nodes, including nodes 9, 6, 8, 4, and 3, it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For Node 7:
Similarly, Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For Node 9:
Node 9 also forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 10 + 10] = [30] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>
