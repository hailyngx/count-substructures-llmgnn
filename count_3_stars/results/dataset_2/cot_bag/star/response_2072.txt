Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 28) (17, 18) (6, 9) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 2) (9, 16) (22, 11) (22, 0) (22, 29) (23, 19) (23, 15) (23, 29) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 21) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (1, 26) (1, 15) (1, 29) (26, 1) (26, 18) (26, 7) (2, 9) (2, 12) (21, 4) (21, 28) (21, 19) (28, 17) (28, 21) (28, 5) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 5) (20, 17) (20, 3) (15, 23) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 11) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 7) (19, 23) (19, 21) (18, 17) (18, 26) (7, 6) (7, 26) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 16) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 7) (12, 2) (12, 29) (11, 22) (11, 15) (11, 24) (24, 11) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 25) (29, 22) (29, 23) (29, 1) (29, 12) (25, 14) (25, 9) (25, 24) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 24) (0, 22) (0, 8) (0, 24) (27, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 14, 17, 6, 9, 22, 23, 4, 8, 1, 26, 15, 21, 28, 5, 13, 20, 10, 19, 18, 7, 16, 11, 24, 29, 25, 3, and 0.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 20 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].
