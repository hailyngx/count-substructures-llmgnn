Response:
Based on the given edges, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28}

Edges: 
- Node 0: {16, 24, 10, 13, 9}
- Node 1: {26, 20, 13}
- Node 2: {26, 6}
- Node 3: {16, 22, 27}
- Node 4: {8, 28}
- Node 5: {26, 20, 23}
- Node 6: {25, 11, 2, 22}
- Node 7: {21, 11, 17}
- Node 8: {4, 28, 14, 11}
- Node 9: {0}
- Node 10: {0, 14, 24, 22}
- Node 11: {7, 8, 18, 6, 22}
- Node 13: {1, 19, 0, 18}
- Node 14: {8, 26, 10}
- Node 15: {28, 18, 24}
- Node 16: {0, 3, 25}
- Node 17: {7, 20, 23}
- Node 18: {15, 11, 13}
- Node 19: {26, 13}
- Node 20: {1, 17, 27, 5}
- Node 21: {7}
- Node 22: {11, 6, 24, 10, 3}
- Node 23: {17, 5}
- Node 24: {0, 22, 10, 15}
- Node 25: {16, 6}
- Node 26: {1, 19, 5, 14, 2}
- Node 27: {20, 28, 3}
- Node 28: {4, 8, 27, 15}

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: [3]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [1]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [0]
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 8: [2]
- Node 9: [0]
- Node 10: [2]
- Node 11: [3]
- Node 13: [2]
- Node 14: [1]
- Node 15: [1]
- Node 16: [1]
- Node 17: [1]
- Node 18: [1]
- Node 19: [1]
- Node 20: [2]
- Node 21: [0]
- Node 22: [2]
- Node 23: [1]
- Node 24: [2]
- Node 25: [1]
- Node 26: [2]
- Node 27: [1]
- Node 28: [2]

Adding them up, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is: [30]
