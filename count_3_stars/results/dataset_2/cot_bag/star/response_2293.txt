Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 7}
Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 5}
Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 7}
Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Node 4: Neighbors {1, 6, 7}
Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 9}
Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
Node 8: Neighbors {3, 6, 9}
Node 9: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Calculating the number of 3-stars: 

Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 also has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 \).

Hence, the final answer is [50] and the unique 3-stars are:
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
