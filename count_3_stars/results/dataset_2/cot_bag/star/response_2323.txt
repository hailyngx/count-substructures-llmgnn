Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 24) (13, 0) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 28) (22, 21) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (3, 25) (3, 12) (25, 3) (25, 14) (25, 11) (8, 13) (8, 7) (10, 1) (10, 20) (17, 1) (17, 28) (17, 26) (2, 5) (2, 18) (2, 20) (2, 24) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 28) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 28) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 19) (28, 22) (28, 17) (28, 18) (28, 7) (28, 29) (29, 28) (21, 22) (21, 19) (21, 15) (24, 13) (24, 2) (24, 23) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 27) (19, 12) (19, 21) (19, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (27, 1) (23, 18) (23, 24) (23, 4) (20, 10) (20, 2) (20, 12) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 15) (15, 21) (15, 4) (16, 1) (16, 6) (26, 17) (26, 11) (26, 6) (14, 9) (14, 25) (14, 2) (6, 13) (6, 16) (6, 26) (11, 5) (11, 25) (11, 26) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by calculating the inom{n}{3} for each node with three or more neighbors. Let's go through each node:

Node 0: Has 2 neighbors (13, 9, 0) - No 3-star formed.

Node 1: Has 4 neighbors (10, 17, 27, 16) - 1 3-star formed.  

Node 2: Has 5 neighbors (5, 18, 24, 14, 20) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 3: Has 2 neighbors (25, 12) - No 3-star formed.

Node 4: Has 3 neighbors (19, 23, 15) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 5: Has 3 neighbors (9, 2, 11) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 6: Has 3 neighbors (13, 16, 26) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 7: Has 4 neighbors (8, 12, 28, 7) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 8: Has 2 neighbors (13, 7) - No 3-star formed.

Node 9: Has 4 neighbors (5, 0, 12, 14) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 10: Has 2 neighbors (1, 20) - No 3-star formed.

Node 11: Has 3 neighbors (5, 25, 26) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 12: Has 5 neighbors (9, 3, 7, 20, 19) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 13: Has 5 neighbors (22, 8, 24, 0, 6) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 14: Has 3 neighbors (9, 25, 2) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 15: Has 2 neighbors (21, 4) - No 3-star formed.

Node 16: Has 2 neighbors (1, 6) - No 3-star formed.

Node 17: Has 3 neighbors (10, 28, 26) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 18: Has 3 neighbors (2, 23, 28) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 19: Has 3 neighbors (12, 21, 4) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 20: Has 3 neighbors (10, 2, 12) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 21: Has 3 neighbors (22, 19, 15) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 22: Has 3 neighbors (13, 21, 28) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 23: Has 3 neighbors (18, 24, 4) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 24: Has 3 neighbors (13, 2, 23) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 25: Has 3 neighbors (3, 14, 11) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 26: Has 3 neighbors (17, 11, 6) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 27: Has 1 neighbor (1) - No 3-star formed.

Node 28: Has 5 neighbors (29, 17, 18, 7, 22) - 1 3-star formed.

Node 29: Has 1 neighbor (28) - No 3-star formed.
