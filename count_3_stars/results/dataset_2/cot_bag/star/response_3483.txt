Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 11) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, first let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors (degree >= 3):

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For nodes with 3 neighbors, there is 1 possible 3-star.
- For nodes with 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
- For nodes with 3 neighbors:
  - Node 6 contributes 1 3-star.
  - Node 10 contributes 1 3-star.
  - Node 12 contributes 1 3-star.
  - Node 13 contributes 1 3-star.
  Total: 4 3-stars.

- For nodes with 4 neighbors:
  - Node 0 contributes 4 3-stars.
  - Node 1 contributes 4 3-stars.
  - Node 2 contributes 4 3-stars.
  - Node 3 contributes 4 3-stars.
  - Node 4 contributes 4 3-stars.
  - Node 5 contributes 4 3-stars.
  - Node 8 contributes 4 3-stars.
  - Node 9 contributes 4 3-stars.
  - Node 11 contributes 4 3-stars.
  - Node 14 contributes 4 3-stars.
  Total: 40 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 44. 

In <> format, the unique 3-stars are:
