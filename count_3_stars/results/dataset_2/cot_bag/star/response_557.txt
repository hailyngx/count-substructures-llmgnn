Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 13) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 12) (5, 15) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 0) (13, 6) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 19) (3, 18) (3, 6) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 9) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 12) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 16) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 15) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 12) (14, 2) (14, 15) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 9) (11, 0) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 6) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors, so let's find the 3-star centered at each of these nodes:

1. Node 10: 
   - Neighbors: 6, 8, 7
   - Number of 3-stars: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
   - Unique 3-star: <10, (6, 8, 7)>

2. Node 4: 
   - Neighbors: 17, 18, 13
   - Number of 3-stars: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
   - Unique 3-star: <4, (17, 18, 13)>

3. Node 18:
   - Neighbors: 4, 7, 12, 3
   - Number of 3-stars: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$

5. Node 13:
   - Neighbors: 4, 19, 0, 6

7. Node 12:
   - Neighbors: 18, 8, 3, 9, 6
   - Number of 3-stars: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
   - Unique 3-stars: <12, (18, 8, 3)>, <12, (18, 8, 9)>, <12, (18, 8, 6)>, <12, (18, 3, 9)>, <12, (18, 3, 6)>, <12, (18, 9, 6)>, <12, (8, 3, 9)>, <12, (8, 3, 6)>, <12, (8, 9, 6)>, <12, (3, 9, 6)>

8. Node 6:
   - Neighbors: 10, 13, 3, 12
   - Number of 3-stars: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
   - Unique 3-stars: <6, (10, 13, 3)>, <6, (10, 13, 12)>, <6, (10, 3, 12)>, <6, (13, 3, 12)>

9. Node 2:
   - Neighbors: 8, 1, 14
   - Number of 3-stars: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
   - Unique 3-star: <2, (8, 1, 14)>

10. Node 0:
   - Neighbors: 13, 7, 11
   - Number of 3-stars: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
   - Unique 3-star: <0, (13, 7, 11)>

11. Node 1:
   - Neighbors: 2, 16, 9
   - Number of 3-stars: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
   - Unique 3-star: <1, (2, 16, 9)>

12. Node 9:
   - Neighbors: 1, 19, 12
   - Number of 3-stars: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
   - Unique 3-star: <9, (1, 19, 12)>

13. Node 15:
   - Neighbors: 5, 14, 16
   - Number of 3-stars: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
   - Unique 3-star: <15, (5, 14, 16)>

14. Node 16:
   - Neighbors: 8, 1, 15
   - Number of 3-stars: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
   - Unique 3-star: <16, (8, 1, 15)>

15. Node 5:
   - Neighbors: 15
   - Number of 3-stars: 0

16. Node 19:
   - Neighbors: 13, 7, 9
   - Number of 3-stars: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
   - Unique 3-star: <19, (13, 7, 9)>

17. Node 11:
   - Neighbors: 0
   - Number of 3-stars: 0

18. Node 3:
   - Neighbors: 18, 6, 12
   - Number of 3-stars: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
   - Unique 3-star: <3, (18, 6, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is $1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 33$.

So, the final answer is [33].
