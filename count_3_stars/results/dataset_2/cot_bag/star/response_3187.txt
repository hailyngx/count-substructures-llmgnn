Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 4) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 7) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 3) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 12) (2, 14) (2, 1) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in the given graph. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars that can be formed:

1. Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
4. Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
5. Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
6. Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
8. Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
9. Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars, we get a total of 55 3-stars. Thus, the number of 3-stars is [55].

The unique 3-stars are:
