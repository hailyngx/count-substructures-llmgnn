Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes 0 and 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes 3, 5, 6, and 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 8, 2)>
- <1, (5, 7, 3)>
- <3, (9, 1, 6)>
- <5, (9, 7, 6)>
- <6, (5, 7, 1)>
- <9, (5, 8, 2)> 
Since these 3-stars are unique, each is only listed once.
