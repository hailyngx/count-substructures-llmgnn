Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 12) (17, 22) (2, 1) (29, 14) (29, 17) (29, 28) (22, 17) (22, 23) (22, 11) (23, 22) (23, 4) (23, 16) (23, 9) (10, 0) (10, 9) (4, 23) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 20) (8, 12) (28, 14) (28, 29) (28, 13) (28, 15) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 20) (18, 21) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 26) (12, 19) (0, 10) (0, 25) (20, 8) (20, 18) (24, 26) (24, 1) (24, 15) (26, 12) (26, 24) (26, 11) (26, 3) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 21) (5, 16) (13, 28) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 6) (9, 23) (9, 10) (9, 13) (25, 0) (25, 21) (27, 11) (27, 1) (3, 26) (3, 6) (3, 19) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 24) (1, 27) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 27) (11, 6) (15, 28) (15, 18) (15, 24) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 11) (19, 12) (19, 3) (21, 18) (21, 5) (21, 25) (16, 23) (16, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 28, and 29. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
20: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 52 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 7, 24)>
<5, (13, 16, 21)>
<12, (7, 8, 19)>
<13, (5, 6, 9)>
<14, (17, 28, 29)>
<15, (18, 24, 28)>
<17, (12, 22, 29)>
<18, (5, 15, 20)>
<22, (11, 17, 23)>
<23, (4, 16, 22)>
<26, (3, 11, 12)>
<28, (13, 15, 29)>
