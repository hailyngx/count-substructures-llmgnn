Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 12) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 9) (1, 12) (1, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 13) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 7) (9, 4) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes which have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <5, (8, 12, 14)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (4, 12, 0)>
- <6, (4, 12, 3)>
- <8, (2, 12, 14)>
- <8, (2, 12, 14)>
- <8, (5, 6, 14)>
- <8, (5, 12, 14)>
- <8, (5, 6, 12)>
- <8, (5, 8, 12)>
- <10, (7, 11, 14)>
- <11, (0, 13, 14)>
- <11, (0, 13, 14)>
- <11, (7, 13, 14)>
- <11, (7, 13, 14)>
- <12, (2, 4, 13)>
- <12, (2, 4, 1)>
- <12, (2, 4, 3)>

- <12, (2, 13, 9)>
- <12, (3, 9, 13)>
- <12, (4, 1, 13)>
- <12, (4, 9, 13)>
- <12, (9, 4, 13)>
- <14, (8, 9, 13)>
- <14, (8, 9, 13)>
- <14, (9, 8, 13)>
