Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 26) (15, 28) (27, 15) (27, 14) (27, 9) (14, 27) (14, 17) (14, 26) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (21, 5) (21, 22) (3, 20) (3, 26) (3, 22) (11, 19) (11, 4) (24, 10) (26, 15) (26, 14) (26, 3) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 23) (16, 10) (28, 15) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 12) (28, 20) (2, 7) (2, 0) (22, 21) (22, 3) (22, 6) (22, 1) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 29) (18, 13) (19, 11) (19, 18) (9, 27) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 4) (5, 17) (5, 21) (5, 18) (5, 12) (8, 7) (8, 10) (1, 28) (1, 22) (1, 25) (20, 3) (20, 28) (4, 11) (4, 9) (25, 1) (25, 6) (23, 16) (23, 13) (23, 12) (12, 17) (12, 28) (12, 5) (12, 23) (6, 22) (6, 25) (6, 10) (6, 0) (10, 24) (10, 16) (10, 8) (10, 6) (29, 16) (29, 18) (29, 0) (13, 18) (13, 23) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 29) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's first identify those nodes and then calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with each of those nodes:

1. Node 15 - 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
2. Node 27 - 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
3. Node 14 - 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
4. Node 17 - 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
5. Node 26 - 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
6. Node 28 - 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
7. Node 7 - 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
8. Node 21 - 2 neighbors: 0 3-stars
9. Node 3 - 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
10. Node 11 - 2 neighbors: 0 3-stars
11. Node 24 - 1 neighbor: 0 3-stars
12. Node 16 - 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
13. Node 2 - 2 neighbors: 0 3-stars
14. Node 22 - 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
15. Node 18 - 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
16. Node 19 - 2 neighbors: 0 3-stars
17. Node 9 - 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
18. Node 5 - 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
19. Node 8 - 2 neighbors: 0 3-stars
20. Node 1 - 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
21. Node 20 - 2 neighbors: 0 3-stars
22. Node 4 - 2 neighbors: 0 3-stars
23. Node 25 - 2 neighbors: 0 3-stars
24. Node 23 - 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
25. Node 12 - 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
26. Node 6 - 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
27. Node 10 - 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
28. Node 29 - 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
29. Node 13 - 2 neighbors: 0 3-stars
30. Node 0 - 3 neighbors: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 63

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [63]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<15, 26, 28>, <27, 9, 7>, <14, 17, 12>, <3, 20, 26>, <16, 28, 1>, <22, 6, 1>, <5, 17, 12>, <18, 13, 23>, <19, 18, 29>, <9, 18, 4>, <28, 12, 5>, <6, 22, 1>, <10, 24, 16>, <0, 29, 6>
