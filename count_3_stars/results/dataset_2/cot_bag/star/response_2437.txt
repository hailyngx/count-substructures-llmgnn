Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 0) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 10) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in adjacency list format for better visualization:

1: 6, 13
2: 9, 1
3: 8, 13, 0
4: 7, 8, 13, 10, 5
5: 4, 11, 0, 10
6: 9, 1, 12
7: 4, 0, 11, 14
8: 4, 12, 3
9: 6, 2, 11, 12
10: 4, 5, 0, 1, 12
11: 9, 7, 5, 0
12: 6, 9, 8, 0, 10
13: 4, 3, 1, 14
14: 7, 13, 1

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars.
Node 0, 1, 4, and 7 each have 6 neighbors, making them potential centers of 3-stars.
Node 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 each have fewer than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-star.

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. These 3-stars are: <0, (3, 5, 10)>, <0, (3, 7, 12)>, <0, (3, 10, 12)>, <0, (5, 7, 11)>, <0, (5, 10, 12)>, <0, (7, 11, 14)>.
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. These 3-stars are: <1, (2, 9, 13)>, <1, (2, 10, 14)>, <1, (6, 13, 14)>, <1, (9, 13, 14)>, <1, (10, 13, 14)>.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. These 3-stars are: <4, (5, 7, 10)>, <4, (5, 10, 11)>, <4, (7, 11, 14)>, <4, (7, 12, 14)>, <4, (10, 11, 12)>.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. These 3-stars are: <7, (0, 11, 14)>, <7, (0, 11, 5)>, <7, (0, 14, 11)>, <7, (5, 10, 11)>, <7, (10, 11, 14)>.

Summing up the total, we have a total of \( [20 + 20 + 20 + 20] = [80] \) 3-stars in the given graph.
