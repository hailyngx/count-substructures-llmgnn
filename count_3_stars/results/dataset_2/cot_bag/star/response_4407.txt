Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighboring nodes are as follows:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 2
- Node 1: 5, 3, 9, 8
- Node 2: 7, 9, 0
- Node 3: 1, 5, 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 7, 9, 6, 3
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6
- Node 6: 4, 7, 3, 8, 5, 0
- Node 7: 4, 9, 6, 2, 0
- Node 8: 1, 9, 6
- Node 9: 1, 3, 8, 4, 2

Calculating 3-stars for each node with more than 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
   <> <0, (6, 7, 2)>

- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
   <> <1, (5, 3, 9)>
   <> <1, (5, 3, 8)>
   <> <1, (5, 9, 8)>
   <> <1, (3, 9, 8)>

- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
   <> <3, (1, 5, 4)>
   <> <3, (1, 5, 6)>
   <> <3, (1, 4, 6)>
   <> <3, (5, 4, 6)>
   <> <3, (1, 6, 8)>
   <> <3, (5, 6, 8)>
   <> <3, (4, 6, 8)>
   <> <3, (1, 4, 9)>
   <> <3, (1, 6, 9)>
   <> <3, (4, 6, 9)>

- Node 6: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
   <> <6, (4, 7, 3)>
   <> <6, (4, 7, 8)>
   <> <6, (4, 3, 8)>
   <> <6, (7, 3, 8)>
   <> <6, (4, 3, 5)>
   <> <6, (7, 3, 5)>
   <> <6, (4, 7, 5)>
   <> <6, (3, 5, 8)>
   <> <6, (4, 5, 8)>
   <> <6, (7, 5, 8)>
   <> <6, (4, 3, 0)>
   <> <6, (7, 3, 0)>
   <> <6, (4, 7, 0)>
   <> <6, (3, 0, 8)>
   <> <6, (4, 0, 8)>
   <> <6, (7, 0, 8)>
   <> <6, (3, 0, 5)>
   <> <6, (4, 5, 0)>
   <> <6, (7, 5, 0)>
   <> <6, (4, 1, 8)>

- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
   <> <9, (1, 3, 4)>
   <> <9, (1, 3, 8)>
   <> <9, (1, 4, 8)>
   <> <9, (3, 4, 8)>
   <> <9, (1, 3, 2)>
   <> <9, (1, 4, 2)>
   <> <9, (3, 4, 2)>
   <> <9, (1, 8, 2)>
   <> <9, (3, 8, 2)>
   <> <9, (4, 8, 2)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10] = 45.
