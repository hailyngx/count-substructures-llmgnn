Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 6) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 0) (6, 14) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine which nodes have at least three neighbors:
- Node 0: 5, 9, 13, 11, 6
- Node 1: 3, 11, 2, 14
- Node 2: 1, 3, 8, 12, 11
- Node 4: 5, 9, 7, 3, 11
- Node 5: 12, 4, 0, 7
- Node 7: 5, 4, 10, 14, 8
- Node 8: 7, 13, 2, 12
- Node 10: 9, 7, 12
- Node 11: 4, 1, 13, 2, 0, 12

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least three neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 60 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 60 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 9, 11)>   
<0, (5, 9, 13)>    
<1, (3, 2, 14)>  
<1, (3, 11, 2)>   
<4, (5, 7, 9)>   
<4, (5, 7, 11)>  
<4, (5, 9, 11)>  
<4, (3, 11, 1)>   
<4, (3, 11, 2)>    
<5, (4, 7, 12)>    
<7, (5, 10, 12)>   
<7, (5, 8, 12)>  
<7, (8, 10, 12)>  
<8,  (7, 13, 2)>  
<11, (0, 12, 13)>  
<11, (0, 12, 6)>
