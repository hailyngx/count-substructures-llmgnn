Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 25) (9, 15) (26, 24) (26, 15) (26, 11) (1, 21) (1, 11) (1, 28) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 20) (3, 2) (15, 9) (15, 26) (7, 22) (20, 21) (20, 25) (25, 9) (25, 20) (25, 0) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 24) (10, 23) (10, 29) (11, 26) (11, 1) (11, 10) (8, 1) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 28) (23, 10) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 17) (4, 8) (4, 23) (4, 22) (4, 19) (4, 24) (0, 25) (0, 14) (0, 24) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 16) (24, 26) (24, 10) (24, 4) (24, 0) (18, 5) (18, 17) (22, 7) (22, 4) (22, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 17) (12, 22) (12, 2) (12, 16) (28, 1) (28, 8) (28, 27) (16, 14) (16, 12) (16, 19) (29, 10) (29, 27) (6, 10) (6, 0) (27, 28) (27, 29) (27, 13) (13, 2) (13, 27) (13, 19) (19, 4) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 17) (5, 18) (17, 23) (17, 18) (17, 2) (17, 19) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
Let's list the nodes with three or more neighbors along with their neighbors:
1. Node 1: (21, 11, 28, 8)
2. Node 2: (3, 14, 12, 13, 17)
3. Node 4: (8, 23, 22, 19, 24)
4. Node 8: (1, 23, 4, 28)
5. Node 10: (11, 6, 24, 23, 29)
6. Node 11: (26, 1, 10)
7. Node 12: (22, 2, 16)
8. Node 13: (2, 27, 19)
9. Node 14: (0, 2, 16)
10. Node 15: (9, 26)
11. Node 16: (14, 12, 19)
12. Node 17: (23, 18, 2, 19)
13. Node 19: (4, 16, 13, 17)
14. Node 20: (21, 25)
15. Node 22: (7, 4, 12)
16. Node 23: (10, 8, 4, 17)
17. Node 24: (26, 10, 4, 0)
18. Node 25: (9, 20, 0)
19. Node 26: (24, 15, 11)
20. Node 27: (28, 29, 13)
21. Node 28: (1, 8, 27)
22. Node 29: (27, 10)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 0 3-stars (Nodes: 11, 20, 22)
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: 1 3-star each (Nodes: 1, 2, 8, 16, 26, 28, 29)
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: 3 3-stars each (Nodes: 4, 10, 15, 17, 19, 23, 24, 25, 27)

Adding these up, we get a total of [22] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<8, (1, 23, 28)>
<16, (2, 14, 19)>
<26, (11, 24, 15)>
<27, (13, 28, 29)>
<4, (8, 23, 24)>
<10, (11, 6, 29)>
<19, (13, 17, 16)>
<1, (8, 11, 28)>
<25, (9, 24, 20)>
<17, (23, 2, 19)>
<2, (17, 13, 3)>
