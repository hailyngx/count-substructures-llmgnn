Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 29) (15, 14) (27, 15) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 13) (20, 9) (25, 20) (25, 18) (25, 11) (10, 16) (10, 14) (11, 25) (11, 21) (8, 20) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 0) (23, 13) (23, 28) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 25) (18, 21) (2, 8) (2, 5) (22, 3) (26, 24) (26, 16) (28, 23) (28, 14) (28, 19) (28, 13) (1, 12) (17, 4) (17, 24) (17, 19) (24, 26) (24, 17) (24, 7) (24, 9) (24, 5) (0, 8) (0, 23) (7, 24) (7, 3) (9, 20) (9, 8) (9, 24) (9, 21) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (16, 10) (16, 26) (16, 29) (16, 3) (3, 22) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 16) (3, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 24) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 28) (19, 28) (19, 17) (6, 3) (6, 29) (29, 15) (29, 16) (29, 6) (29, 21) (21, 11) (21, 18) (21, 9) (21, 29) (13, 20) (13, 23) (13, 4) (13, 28) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {8, 23}
2. Node 1: Neighbor {12}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {5, 8}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {6, 7, 12, 16, 22}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {5, 12, 13, 17}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {2, 4, 24}
7. Node 6: Neighbor {3}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {3, 24}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 9, 20, 23}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {8, 20, 21, 24}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {14, 16}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {21, 25}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {1, 3, 4}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {4, 20, 23, 28}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {10, 15, 28}
16. Node 15: Neighbors {14, 27, 29}
17. Node 16: Neighbors {3, 10, 26, 29}
18. Node 17: Neighbors {4, 19, 24}
19. Node 18: Neighbors {21, 25}
20. Node 20: Neighbors {8, 13, 25, 29}
21. Node 21: Neighbors {11, 18, 29}
22. Node 22: Neighbor {3}
23. Node 23: Neighbors {8, 13, 20, 28}
24. Node 24: Neighbors {5, 7, 9, 17, 26}
25. Node 25: Neighbors {11, 18, 20}
26. Node 26: Neighbors {16, 24}
27. Node 27: Neighbor {15}
28. Node 28: Neighbors {13, 14, 19, 23}
29. Node 29: Neighbors {6, 15, 16, 20, 21}

Now, we count the number of 3-stars centered at each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3: 1 3-star <3, (6, 7, 16)>
- Node 4: 1 3-star <4, (5, 12, 17)>
- Node 5: 1 3-star <5, (2, 4, 24)>
- Node 8: 1 3-star <8, (2, 9, 20)>
- Node 9: 1 3-star <9, (8, 20, 24)>
- Node 10: 1 3-star <10, (14, 16, 29)>
- Node 12: 1 3-star <12, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 14: 1 3-star <14, (10, 15, 28)>
- Node 15: 1 3-star <15, (14, 27, 29)>
- Node 16: 1 3-star <16, (3, 10, 26)>
- Node 21: 1 3-star <21, (11, 18, 29)>
- Node 23: 1 3-star <23, (8, 13, 28)>
- Node 24: 1 3-star <24, (5, 17, 26)>
- Node 28: 1 3-star <28, (13, 14, 19)>
- Node 29: 1 3-star <29, (6, 16, 21)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
