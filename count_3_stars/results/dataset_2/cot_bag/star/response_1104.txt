Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's organize the nodes based on their neighbors:
- Node 0: 5, 9, 4, 3, 7
- Node 1: 5, 4, 7, 2
- Node 2: 9, 1, 6
- Node 3: 4, 7, 0
- Node 4: 7, 8, 0, 3, 1
- Node 5: 9, 6, 8, 1, 0
- Node 6: 5, 9, 7, 2
- Node 7: 4, 0, 3, 6, 1
- Node 8: 5, 4
- Node 9: 5, 6, 2, 0

Let's go through each node to see if they can form 3-stars:

Node 0 can form a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 4: <0, (5, 9, 4)>
Node 1 can form a 3-star with nodes 5, 4, and 7: <1, (5, 4, 7)>
Node 4 can form two 3-stars:
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 7)>
Node 5 can form two 3-stars:
- <5, (9, 6, 8)>
- <5, (0, 1, 4)>
Node 6 can form a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 7: <6, (5, 9, 7)>
Node 7 can form a 3-star with nodes 4, 0, and 3: <7, (4, 0, 3)>
Node 9 can form a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 2: <9, (5, 6, 2)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [7].
