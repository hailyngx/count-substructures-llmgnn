Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 12) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with degrees more than or equal to three are 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14.   

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are the center of by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the degree of the node.

- Node 0 has a degree of 5, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has a degree of 4, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has a degree of 4, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has a degree of 5, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has a degree of 6, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has a degree of 4, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has a degree of 4, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has a degree of 5, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has a degree of 5, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has a degree of 4, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has a degree of 4, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up gives \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 84 \) 3-stars formed in the graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [84].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (5, 6, 10)>
- <0, (5, 6, 13)>
- <0, (5, 10, 13)>
- <0, (6, 11, 14)>
- <1, (3, 10, 13)>
- <5, (6, 7, 10)>
- <5, (6, 7, 11)>
- <5, (7, 9, 10)>
- <5, (9, 7, 10)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 11)>
- <6, (7, 5, 11)>
- <6, (7, 9, 11)>
- <6, (7, 10, 11)>
- <7, (5, 6, 10)>
- <7, (5, 9, 10)>
- <9, (5, 7, 10)>
- <10, (6, 7, 11)>
