Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 6: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Adding these up, we get a total of \(10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 52\) 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 3)>
<0, (5, 9, 2)>
<0, (5, 2, 8)>
<0, (6, 9, 3)>
<1, (6, 4, 3)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (9, 0, 3)>
<3, (9, 6, 4)>
<3, (9, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 4, 1)>
<3, (6, 4, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 1)>
<3, (6, 8, 0)>
<5, (6, 9, 0)>
<5, (6, 9, 3)>
<6, (5, 0, 9)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 3)>
<8, (6, 9, 0)>
<8, (6, 9, 3)>
<9, (6, 0, 3)>
