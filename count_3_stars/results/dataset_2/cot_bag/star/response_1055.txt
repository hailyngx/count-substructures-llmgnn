Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 16) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 17) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 19) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (18, 16) (18, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 15) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 1) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 12) (14, 11) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 5) (17, 9) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 16) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 0) (13, 10) (13, 12) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 12) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 12) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 40 nodes with degrees given by:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 1
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 2
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 19: degree 3

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 4, 7>,
<1, 6, 19>,
<2, 3, 16>,
<4, 7, 11>,
<5, 12, 15>,
<6, 9, 1>,
<7, 4, 16>,
<8, 9, 11>,
<9, 6, 1>,
<10, 11, 19>,
<12, 0, 18>,
<13, 10, 12>.
