- Node 25 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 26.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 29, 5, and 25.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 0 and 10.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 22, 2, 14, 24, 16, and 18.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 26, 15, and 29.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \sum_{n=0,1,5,7,9,11,14,15,16,18,19,20,23,24,25,26,28,29} \binom{n}{3} = 0 + 1 + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{9}{3} + \binom{11}{3} + \binom{14}{3} + \binom{15}{3} + \binom{16}{3} + \binom{18}{3} + \binom{19}{3} + \binom{20}{3} + \binom{23}{3} + \binom{24}{3} + \binom{25}{3} + \binom{26}{3} + \binom{28}{3} + \binom{29}{3} = 1 + 10 + 35 + 35 + 165 + 455 + 364 + 816 + 816 + 969 + 1140 + 1771 + 2024 + 2600 + 2600 + 3276 + 4060 = 17603 \]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [17603].

Some unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (13, 4, 20)>, <7, (11, 19, 23)>, <15, (5, 24, 29)>, <16, (22, 20, 28)>, <18, (7, 28, 29)>, <19, (1, 23, 3)>, <23, (9, 11, 19)>, <25, (5, 26, 6)>, <26, (5, 25, 29)>, <28, (14, 18, 24)>, <29, (2, 7, 26)>.

These are just a selection of the 3-stars present in the graph.
