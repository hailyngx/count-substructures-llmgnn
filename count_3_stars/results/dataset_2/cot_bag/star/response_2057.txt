Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 8) (3, 16) (3, 1) (3, 4) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 14) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 5) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 0) (7, 17) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 7) (17, 2) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 18) (19, 12) (18, 15) (18, 19) (9, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 2) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 6) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 6) (12, 19) (12, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

- Nodes: 20 nodes (numbered 0 to 19)
- Edges: 60 edges as described

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1: Degree 3 (neighbors: 3, 13, 14)
   - Number of 3-stars: 1
   - Unique 3-star: <1, (3, 13, 14)>
2. Node 2: Degree 4 (neighbors: 0, 6, 10, 17)
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 6, 10)>, <2, (0, 6, 17)>, <2, (0, 10, 17)>, <2, (6, 10, 17)>
3. Node 5: Degree 4 (neighbors: 4, 8, 12, 5)
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <5, (4, 8, 12)>, <5, (4, 8, 5)>, <5, (4, 12, 5)>, <5, (8, 12, 5)>
4. Node 6: Degree 3 (neighbors: 2, 10, 14)
   - Number of 3-stars: 1
   - Unique 3-star: <6, (2, 10, 14)>
5. Node 8: Degree 4 (neighbors: 5, 13, 16, 19)
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <8, (5, 13, 16)>, <8, (5, 13, 19)>, <8, (5, 16, 19)>, <8, (13, 16, 19)>
6. Node 10: Degree 4 (neighbors: 2, 6, 15, 19)
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <10, (2, 6, 15)>, <10, (2, 6, 19)>, <10, (2, 15, 19)>, <10, (6, 15, 19)>
7. Node 13: Degree 4 (neighbors: 1, 8, 14, 17)
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <13, (1, 8, 14)>, <13, (1, 8, 17)>, <13, (1, 14, 17)>, <13, (8, 14, 17)>
8. Node 14: Degree 5 (neighbors: 1, 6, 9, 13, 15)
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <14, (1, 6, 9)>, <14, (1, 6, 13)>, <14, (1, 6, 15)>, <14, (1, 9, 13)>, <14, (1, 9, 15)>, <14, (1, 13, 15)>, <14, (6, 9, 13)>, <14, (6, 9, 15)>, <14, (6, 13, 15)>, <14, (9, 13, 15)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 32\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].
