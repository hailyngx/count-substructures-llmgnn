Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 12) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
- Node 1: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
- Node 2: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $
- Node 3: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $
- Node 4: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
- Node 6: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
- Node 7: $ \binom{6}{3} = 20 $
- Node 8: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $
- Node 9: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $
- Node 10: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
- Node 12: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
- Node 14: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
$ 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 72 $

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 72, which can be represented as [72].

Some of the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 5, 13>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 13>
<3, 8, 13>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 9, 14>
<7, 10, 11>
<8, 9, 10>
<12, 7, 14>
...
and so on.
