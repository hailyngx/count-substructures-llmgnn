Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 1: Only 1 3-star since it has exactly 3 neighbors.
- For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 61 3-stars. So, the final answer is [61].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <0, (4, 7, 8)> 
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 7, 9)> 
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 2, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 7)>
