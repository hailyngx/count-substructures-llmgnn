Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 10) (22, 24) (5, 9) (5, 28) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 23) (15, 0) (15, 17) (15, 16) (27, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (14, 13) (14, 17) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 11) (1, 13) (1, 27) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 29) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 25) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 0) (21, 4) (21, 28) (21, 25) (28, 5) (28, 21) (28, 16) (28, 7) (19, 4) (19, 26) (19, 29) (26, 13) (26, 19) (26, 10) (26, 11) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 26) (11, 29) (20, 17) (16, 15) (16, 28) (16, 12) (16, 24) (0, 15) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 28) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 29) (18, 9) (18, 6) (18, 10) (10, 22) (10, 26) (10, 18) (23, 9) (23, 2) (23, 29) (24, 22) (24, 16) (29, 3) (29, 19) (29, 11) (29, 12) (29, 23) (25, 4) (25, 21) (2, 6) (2, 23) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: neighbors 27, 3, 13
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: neighbors 1, 11, 0, 29
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: neighbors 8, 19, 25, 21
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: neighbors 9, 2, 18, 12
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: neighbors 5, 6, 18, 23
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: neighbors 22, 26, 18
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: neighbors 17, 3, 26, 29
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: neighbors 6, 16, 29
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: neighbors 22, 26, 1, 14
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: neighbors 0, 17, 16
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: neighbors 15, 28, 12, 24
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: neighbors 15, 14, 20, 11
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: neighbors 9, 6, 10
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: neighbors 4, 28, 25
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: neighbors 13, 10, 24
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors: neighbors 9, 2, 29
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: neighbors 13, 19, 10, 11
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: neighbors 5, 21, 16, 7
- Node 29 has 5 neighbors: neighbors 3, 19, 11, 12, 23

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 11 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 13 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star
- Node 16 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 17 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star
- Node 26 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 28 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 29 forms 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars is 50.

Therefore, the final answer is [50].
