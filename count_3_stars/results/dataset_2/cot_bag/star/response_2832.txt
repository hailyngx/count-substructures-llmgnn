Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 27) (16, 6) (20, 24) (25, 1) (25, 18) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 21) (12, 14) (27, 16) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 19) (8, 16) (8, 24) (8, 0) (23, 1) (23, 3) (15, 26) (15, 5) (15, 21) (19, 27) (19, 26) (19, 22) (26, 15) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 6) (26, 4) (13, 12) (13, 26) (13, 4) (13, 10) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 22) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (3, 23) (3, 7) (3, 14) (2, 22) (2, 9) (22, 19) (22, 1) (22, 2) (22, 21) (24, 20) (24, 8) (24, 29) (5, 15) (28, 4) (28, 10) (6, 16) (6, 26) (6, 0) (6, 18) (14, 12) (14, 3) (9, 17) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (21, 12) (21, 27) (21, 15) (21, 22) (29, 24) (4, 26) (4, 13) (4, 28) (18, 25) (18, 6) (10, 13) (10, 28) (10, 9) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and their neighbors:

1: 25, 23, 17, 7, 22
2: 22, 9
3: 23, 7, 14
4: 26, 13, 28
5: 15
6: 16, 26, 0, 18
7: 1, 0, 3, 9
8: 16, 24, 0
9: 17, 7, 2, 10
10: 13, 28, 9
11: 16, 17
12: 27, 13, 21, 14
13: 12, 26, 4, 10
14: 12, 3
15: 26, 21, 5
16: 11, 8, 27, 6
17: 11, 1, 9
18: 25, 6
19: 27, 26, 22
20: 24
21: 12, 27, 15, 22
22: 1, 2, 19, 21
23: 1, 3
24: 20, 8, 29
25: 1, 18
26: 15, 19, 13, 6, 4
27: 16, 12, 21, 19
28: 4, 10
29: 24

Based on this information, we can now identify the 3-stars:

[8]

<8, (16, 27, 6)>, <16, (11, 8, 27)>, <27, (12, 16, 19)>, <6, (26, 16, 0)>

Put together, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
