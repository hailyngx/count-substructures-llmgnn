Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 15) (5, 13) (5, 4) (6, 18) (6, 16) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 19) (18, 8) (18, 6) (18, 11) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 16) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 14) (0, 16) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 3) (12, 16) (12, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (11, 18) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 9) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 3) (3, 8) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 14) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 3) (14, 2) (9, 12) (9, 11) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will start by identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes could potentially form 3-stars. 

Let's list the nodes with their degrees:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 4
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 2
- Node 10: 3
- Node 11: 4
- Node 12: 2
- Node 13: 3
- Node 14: 3
- Node 15: 3
- Node 16: 5
- Node 17: 2
- Node 18: 3
- Node 19: 4

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 30 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].
The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (8, 13, 17)>
<3, (4, 14, 19)>
<4, (13, 5, 19)>
<11, (18, 7, 19)>
<13, (5, 4, 1)>
<14, (15, 3, 2)>
<15, (13, 10, 14)>
<16, (6, 10, 12)>
<18, (8, 6, 11)>
<19, (17, 4, 11)>
