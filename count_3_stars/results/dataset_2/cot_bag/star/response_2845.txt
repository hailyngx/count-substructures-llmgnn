Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 9) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes, let's first identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 

- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7 (5 neighbors)
- Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 (5 neighbors)
- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 1, 7, 8, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 (5 neighbors)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3 (4 neighbors)
- Node 0 has neighbors: 3, 4, 9 (3 neighbors)

For nodes with 5 neighbors, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed around each of these nodes. 
For nodes with 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed around each of these nodes. 

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 10 \times 5 + 4 \times 2 = 58\]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 5, 1)>
- <7, (2, 3, 6)>
- <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- <7, (2, 1, 8)>
- <7, (3, 1, 8)>
- <7, (2, 1, 3)>
- <1, (3, 8, 9)>
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- <8, (6, 2, 7)>
- <8, (6, 2, 3)>
- <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- <3, (2, 8, 9)>
