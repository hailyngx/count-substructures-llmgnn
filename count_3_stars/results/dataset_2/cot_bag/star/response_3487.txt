Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 12) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 10) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 2) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 0) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the nodes are 0, 1, 2, ..., 13, 14 and the edges are as listed. Now let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors: (8, 12, 14, 10, 5, 0).
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (4, 1, 9, 12, 3).
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (7, 13, 11, 3).
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (4, 10, 8, 5).
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: (3, 8, 6, 11, 14).
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: (7, 13, 0, 5, 8).
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: (4, 6, 9, 12, 0).
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (3, 8, 6, 11).
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: (4, 2, 10).
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (1, 9, 0, 2).

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 

\[ 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 72 \]

Thus, there are 72 3-stars in the given graph. 
Listing the unique 3-stars found:

\[ \text{[72]}  \]
