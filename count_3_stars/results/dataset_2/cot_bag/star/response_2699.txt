Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 4) (16, 18) (15, 27) (15, 13) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 7) (27, 9) (27, 23) (27, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 20) (9, 11) (9, 27) (9, 6) (9, 18) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 29) (25, 13) (25, 4) (10, 12) (10, 1) (22, 26) (22, 14) (22, 17) (22, 12) (23, 27) (4, 11) (4, 25) (4, 18) (8, 27) (8, 20) (1, 10) (1, 26) (26, 22) (26, 1) (26, 28) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 22) (14, 0) (14, 24) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 17) (28, 26) (28, 2) (28, 20) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 5) (21, 20) (21, 2) (7, 11) (7, 27) (7, 13) (7, 17) (2, 6) (2, 28) (2, 5) (2, 21) (20, 6) (20, 8) (20, 28) (20, 21) (24, 14) (24, 17) (29, 3) (29, 13) (13, 15) (13, 25) (13, 7) (13, 29) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 22) (12, 18) (17, 22) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 7) (17, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

Node 2 has neighbors: 6, 5, 28, 21  
Node 4 has neighbors: 11, 25, 18  
Node 7 has neighbors: 11, 27, 13, 17  
Node 9 has neighbors: 11, 27, 6, 18  
Node 12 has neighbors: 15, 3, 10, 22, 18  
Node 13 has neighbors: 15, 25, 7, 29  
Node 14 has neighbors: 22, 0, 24, 17  
Node 15 has neighbors: 27, 13, 12  
Node 17 has neighbors: 22, 18, 7, 24  
Node 18 has neighbors: 16, 9, 4, 12, 17  
Node 20 has neighbors: 6, 8, 28, 21  
Node 22 has neighbors: 26, 14, 17, 12  
Node 26 has neighbors: 22, 1, 28  
Node 27 has neighbors: 15, 9, 7, 23, 8  
Node 28 has neighbors: 26, 2, 20  
Node 29 has neighbors: 3, 13  

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 2 -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 4 -> inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 7 -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 9 -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 12 -> inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 13 -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 14 -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 15 -> inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 17 -> inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 18 -> inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 20 -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 22 -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 26 -> inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 27 -> inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 28 -> inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Adding them up: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 68

So, there are 68 3-stars in this graph.    

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (6, 5, 28, 21)>
<4, (11, 25, 18)>
<7, (11, 27, 13, 17)>
<9, (11, 27, 6, 18)>
<12, (15, 3, 10, 22, 18)>
<13, (15, 25, 7, 29)>
<14, (22, 0, 24, 17)>
<15, (27, 13, 12)>
<17, (22, 18, 7, 24)>
<18, (16, 9, 4, 12, 17)>
<20, (6, 8, 28, 21)>
<22, (26, 14, 17, 12)>
<26, (22, 1, 28)>
<27, (15, 9, 7, 23, 8)>
<28, (26, 2, 20)>
