Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 15) (4, 10) (4, 15) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 6) (13, 5) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 0) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 15) (17, 12) (17, 6) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 6) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 18) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 16) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 6) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 19) (15, 8) (0, 12) (0, 11) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 16) (2, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) (16, 3) (16, 14) (16, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 12, 11
- Node 1: 6, 2
- Node 2: 1, 14, 10, 16
- Node 3: 11, 18, 16
- Node 4: 10, 15
- Node 5: 9, 13, 19, 10
- Node 6: 12, 17, 8, 1, 18
- Node 7: 12, 19, 14
- Node 8: 19, 15, 6
- Node 9: 5, 18, 15
- Node 10: 5, 4, 2
- Node 11: 3, 0
- Node 12: 7, 17, 0, 6
- Node 13: 5
- Node 14: 7, 2, 16
- Node 15: 9, 4, 19, 8
- Node 16: 3, 14, 2
- Node 17: 12, 6
- Node 18: 9, 3, 6
- Node 19: 5, 7, 8, 15

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least three neighbors:
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4+10+4+4+1+1+4 = 28

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<5, (9, 13, 19)>
<6, (12, 17, 8)>
<12, (7, 0, 6)>
<15, (9, 4, 19)>
<16, (3, 14, 2)>
<18, (9, 3, 6)>
<19, (5, 7, 8)>
