Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 23) (1, 9) (21, 7) (21, 12) (21, 25) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 17) (6, 22) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 13) (9, 0) (7, 21) (7, 17) (7, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 20) (17, 6) (17, 7) (17, 27) (28, 6) (28, 8) (28, 5) (28, 15) (22, 6) (22, 26) (22, 2) (22, 16) (26, 22) (26, 16) (26, 4) (4, 26) (4, 27) (4, 16) (27, 17) (27, 4) (27, 2) (27, 5) (25, 21) (25, 19) (25, 18) (20, 10) (20, 29) (20, 24) (29, 20) (29, 16) (29, 24) (8, 7) (8, 28) (8, 19) (19, 25) (19, 8) (19, 23) (2, 22) (2, 27) (2, 5) (2, 11) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 4) (16, 29) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 23) (18, 25) (18, 23) (15, 28) (5, 28) (5, 27) (5, 2) (11, 2) (11, 24) (24, 20) (24, 29) (24, 11) (3, 12) (23, 1) (23, 19) (23, 0) (23, 18) (23, 12) (14, 10) (12, 21) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 23) (13, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 6, 9, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 6 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 9 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 6 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(2 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 3 + 3 = 50\)

So, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in the graph.
