Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 10) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 4) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 12) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 14) (12, 19) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 4) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 10) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 15) (1, 16) (1, 11) (1, 10) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 13) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 13) (15, 17) (15, 14) (10, 9) (10, 19) (10, 18) (10, 1) (2, 4) (13, 3) (13, 14) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 18, and 19.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 7, 5>, <0, 11, 6>, <0, 3, 16>, <0, 5, 4>, <3, 16, 4>, <4, 16, 2>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 17, 15>, <8, 7, 5>, <8, 19, 12>, <8, 14, 15>, <9, 18, 10>, <10, 19, 12>, <10, 18, 16>, <10, 1, 11>, <11, 0, 5>, <14, 13, 15>, <16, 12, 19>, <16, 18, 10>, <19, 12, 16>
