Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 5) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) 

Response:
There are 15 nodes in the given graph with the following neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {11, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 11, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 10, 9, 6}
- Node 3: {7, 1, 10, 6, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {7, 2}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {3, 12, 0, 14, 2}
- Node 7: {4, 3, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 10, 9}
- Node 9: {7, 1, 8, 0, 2}
- Node 10: {3, 11, 8, 2, 5, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 10, 0, 5, 12}
- Node 12: {11, 13, 14, 6}
- Node 13: {12, 5}
- Node 14: {10, 12, 6}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of them:

- Node 1 forms 4 3-stars: <1, (3, 5, 11)>, <1, (3, 9, 11)>, <1, (5, 9, 11)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 6 3-stars: <3, (1, 5, 10)>, <3, (1, 8, 10)>, <3, (1, 5, 11)>, <3, (5, 8, 10)>, <3, (5, 10, 11)>, <3, (1, 10, 11)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 12, 14)>
- Node 9 forms 4 3-stars: <9, (1, 8, 10)>, <9, (0, 8, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (2, 8, 10)>
- Node 10 forms 4 3-stars: <10, (1, 5, 11)>, <10, (2, 5, 14)>, <10, (2, 8, 14)>, <10, (5, 8, 14)>
- Node 11 forms 2 3-stars: <11, (0, 5, 12)>, <11, (5, 12, 13)>

Adding these up, we get a total of 21 3-stars: 4 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 21. So, the answer is [21].
