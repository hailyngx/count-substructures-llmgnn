Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 6
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 6
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 4

Let's examine each node with a degree of 3 or more to determine the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 2 forms \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \(20 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 54\). Thus, the final answer is [54].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 8, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 6)>
<2, (3, 8, 6)>
<(3, 1, 6)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 1, 8)>
<4, (2, 8, 6)>
<4, (2, 1, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<(8, 3, 1)>
<(8, 3, 6)>
