Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 12) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 12) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}.

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 60 \).

So, the final answer is [60].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (5, 8, 12)>, <2, (4, 8, 14)>, <5, (9, 8, 12)>, <8, (5, 13, 2)>, <12, (5, 11, 6)>
