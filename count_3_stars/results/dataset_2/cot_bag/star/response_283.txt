Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}.

First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: 9, 12, 0, 10, 1, 14.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 5, 7, 1, 14, 10.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 11, 3, 6, 2, 13.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 14.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 9, 4, 6, 14.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 4, 13, 0, 11.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 7, 12, 2, 3.
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors: 8, 6, 0, 11, 3, 10.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- For Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: \( 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 76 \). 
So, there are 76 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [76].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <4, (9, 12, 0)>
- <6, (5, 7, 1)>
- <7, (11, 3, 2)>
- <8, (5, 9, 14)>
- <10, (9, 4, 6)>
- <12, (4, 13, 0)>
- <13, (7, 12, 2)>
- <14, (8, 6, 0)>
- <14, (8, 11, 3)>
- <14, (8, 10, 6)>
- <14, (6, 0, 11)>
- <14, (6, 3, 11)>
- <14, (0, 3, 11)>
