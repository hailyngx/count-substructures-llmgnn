Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 11) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 14) (10, 17) (10, 19) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 18) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 14) (4, 15) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 9) (12, 11) (19, 10) (19, 18) (11, 15) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (6, 14) (6, 16) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 6) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 11}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 8, 11, 17, 18}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 15, 16, 17}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 9, 15, 17}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 9, 13}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 8, 14, 18}
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 2, 12, 15}
- Node 13: Neighbors {8, 15, 16, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {9, 13, 6}
- Node 15: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 11, 13}
- Node 16: Neighbors {3, 6, 13}
- Node 17: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 10}
- Node 18: Neighbors {2, 7, 9, 19}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each central node:

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 2: [1]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [1]
- Node 11: [3]
- Node 13: [1]
- Node 14: [1]
- Node 15: [2]
- Node 16: [1]
- Node 17: [1]
- Node 18: [1]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
