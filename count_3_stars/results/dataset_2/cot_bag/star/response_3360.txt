Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 14) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 29) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 29) (15, 5) (0, 3) (0, 27) (0, 24) (0, 11) (0, 4) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 7) (7, 27) (7, 23) (7, 17) (20, 25) (20, 29) (25, 20) (25, 10) (1, 26) (1, 28) (1, 23) (1, 18) (10, 25) (10, 8) (10, 19) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 29) (12, 27) (12, 11) (12, 16) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (22, 19) (22, 28) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 14) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 22) (19, 5) (29, 26) (29, 15) (29, 20) (29, 11) (29, 14) (18, 9) (18, 1) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 4) (23, 7) (23, 1) (23, 6) (24, 0) (24, 17) (17, 7) (17, 16) (17, 24) (17, 28) (28, 1) (28, 22) (28, 17) (28, 14) (13, 2) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 23) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 16) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 29) (14, 28) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is therefore given by \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 59 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [59].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 11, 24)>, <1, (26, 9, 18)>, <2, (4, 6, 19)>, <4, (0, 16, 2)>, <5, (15, 19, 14)>, <6, (23, 3, 2)>, <7, (27, 17, 23)>, <9, (14, 26, 29)>, <10, (25, 8, 19)>, <11, (0, 12, 29)>, <12, (11, 27, 16)>, <14, (5, 28, 29)>, <15, (3, 5, 29)>, <16, (12, 17, 4)>, <17, (28, 7, 24)>, <18, (1, 9, 26)>, <19, (10, 2, 22)>, <20, (29, 25, 15)>, <23, (7, 6, 1)>.

These are the unique 3-stars formed within the given graph.
