Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 8, 7
- Node 1: 5, 9, 6, 8
- Node 2: 5, 9, 6, 3, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 2
- Node 4: 9, 6, 3, 8
- Node 5: 9, 2, 1, 7
- Node 6: 9, 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: 5, 9, 0
- Node 8: 1, 4, 2, 0
- Node 9: 5, 9, 6, 4, 1, 7

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph. 

For node 1, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 2, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 4, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 5, there are no 3-stars.
For node 6, there are no 3-stars.
For node 8, there are no 3-stars.
For node 9, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is: \(4 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 38\). 

Therefore, the final answer is [38]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (5, 9, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 2)>
<2, (9, 6, 4)>
<4, (9, 6, 4)>
<9, (5, 9, 6)>
<9, (5, 9, 2)>
<9, (9, 6, 4)>
<9, (1, 5, 9)>
