Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph with the given nodes and edges. 

Given the data provided, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 

- Node 0: {11, 5, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {9, 3, 13, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {9, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {6, 1, 2, 5, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 2}
- Node 5: {3, 10, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 14, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 12, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 2, 14}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 2, 14, 1}
- Node 10: {11, 5}
- Node 11: {10, 7, 0}
- Node 12: {3, 7, 14, 0}
- Node 13: {1, 0, 14}
- Node 14: {6, 9, 7, 8, 12, 13}

Now, we'll determine the 3-stars in this graph.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 12)>
<9, (6, 8, 14)>
<12, (3, 7, 14)>
<14, (6, 9, 12)>
