Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 3) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 14) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 9) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 4 and node 8. 

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 8, 9, 5, 3
- Number of 3-stars formed with node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <4, (8, 9, 5)>
  - <4, (8, 9, 3)>
  - <4, (8, 5, 3)>
  - <4, (9, 5, 3)>

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 4, 13, 14, 11, 1
- Number of 3-stars formed with node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <8, (4, 13, 14)>
  - <8, (4, 13, 11)>
  - <8, (4, 13, 1)>
  - <8, (4, 14, 11)>
  - <8, (4, 14, 1)>
  - <8, (4, 11, 1)>
  - <8, (13, 14, 11)>
  - <8, (13, 14, 1)>
  - <8, (13, 11, 1)>
  - <8, (14, 11, 1)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
