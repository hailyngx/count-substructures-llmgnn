Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 6) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 14) (9, 0) (9, 14) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are node 2, node 3, node 5, node 6, node 8, node 10, node 11, node 12, and node 14. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars for node 2 are: <2, (4, 1, 13)>, <2, (4, 1, 10)>, <2, (4, 1, 14)>, <2, (4, 13, 10)>, <2, (4, 13, 14)>, <2, (4, 10, 14)>, <2, (1, 13, 10)>, <2, (1, 13, 14)>, <2, (1, 10, 14)>, <2, (13, 10, 14)>.

For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars for node 3 are: <3, (0, 14, 13)>, <3, (0, 14, 8)>, <3, (0, 13, 8)>, <3, (14, 13, 8)>, <3, (0, 14, 5)>, <3, (0, 13, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (14, 13, 5)>, <3, (14, 5, 8)>, <3, (13, 5, 8)>.

For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars for node 5 are: <5, (7, 3, 6)>, <5, (7, 3, 14)>, <5, (7, 6, 14)>, <5, (3, 6, 14)>, <5, (7, 3, 5)>, <5, (7, 6, 5)>, <5, (3, 6, 5)>, <5, (3, 14, 5)>, <5, (6, 14, 5)>, <5, (7, 14, 5)>.

For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars for node 6 are: <6, (1, 8, 13)>, <6, (1, 8, 11)>, <6, (1, 13, 11)>, <6, (8, 13, 11)>, <6, (1, 8, 5)>, <6, (1, 13, 5)>, <6, (8, 13, 5)>, <6, (1, 11, 5)>, <6, (8, 11, 5)>, <6, (13, 11, 5)>.

For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars for node 8 are: <8, (7, 3, 13)>, <8, (7, 3, 6)>, <8, (7, 6, 13)>, <8, (3, 6, 13)>, <8, (7, 3, 8)>, <8, (7, 13, 8)>, <8, (7, 6, 8)>, <8, (3, 13, 8)>, <8, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (13, 6, 8)>.

For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
The 3-stars for node 10 are: <10, (7, 11, 12)>.

For node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
The 3-stars for node 11 are: <11, (7, 1, 6)>.

For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
The 3-stars for node 12 are: <12, (1, 10, 0)>.

For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars for node 14 are: <14, (4, 0, 9)>, <14, (4, 3, 9)>, <14, (0, 3, 9)>, <14, (4, 3, 2)>, <14, (4, 0, 2)>, <14, (3, 0, 2)>, <14, (4, 3, 5)>, <14, (4, 0, 5)>, <14, (3, 0, 5)>, <14, (4, 2, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 53. So, the final result is [53].
