Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (15, 9) (15, 8) (15, 5) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 15) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 2) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 18) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 12) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 14) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 12) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 14) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 14) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 7) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 18) (13, 19) 

Response:
In this graph, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors as potential central nodes for 3-stars. Let's list those nodes and calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each:

1. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (7, 14, 10)
   - Total 3-stars with Node 3: [1]

2. Node 15 has 4 neighbors: (9, 8, 5, 19)
   - Total 3-stars with Node 15: [1]

3. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (9, 11, 8, 0)
   - Total 3-stars with Node 6: [1]

4. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (15, 6, 2, 11)
   - Total 3-stars with Node 9: [1]

5. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (15, 6, 4, 18)
   - Total 3-stars with Node 8: [1]

6. Node 17 has 3 neighbors: (10, 1, 2)
   - Total 3-stars with Node 17: [1]

7. Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (9, 10, 17, 12, 14)
   - Total 3-stars with Node 2: [1]

8. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (15, 19, 18, 14)
   - Total 3-stars with Node 5: [1]

9. Node 12 has 3 neighbors: (1, 19, 2)
   - Total 3-stars with Node 12: [1]

10. Node 0 has 2 neighbors: (6, 4)
    - Total 3-stars with Node 0: [0]

11. Node 1 has 2 neighbors: (17, 14)
    - Total 3-stars with Node 1: [0]

12. Node 4 has 2 neighbors: (8, 0)
    - Total 3-stars with Node 4: [0]

13. Node 7 has 2 neighbors: (3, 11)
    - Total 3-stars with Node 7: [0]

14. Node 19 has 3 neighbors: (5, 13, 12)
    - Total 3-stars with Node 19: [1]

15. Node 18 has 3 neighbors: (8, 5, 14)
    - Total 3-stars with Node 18: [1]

16. Node 11 has 3 neighbors: (6, 9, 7)
    - Total 3-stars with Node 11: [1]

17. Node 14 has 5 neighbors: (3, 1, 5, 2, 18)
    - Total 3-stars with Node 14: [1]

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars formed with each node: 
\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [8] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (7, 14, 10)>, <15, (9, 8, 5)>, <6, (9, 11, 8)>, <9, (15, 6, 2)>, <8, (15, 6, 4)>, <17, (10, 1, 2)>, <2, (9, 10, 17)>, <5, (15, 19, 18)>, <12, (1, 19, 2)>, <19, (5, 13, 12)>, <18, (8, 5, 14)>, <11, (6, 9, 7)>, <14, (3, 1, 5)>.
