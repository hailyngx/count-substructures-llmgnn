Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 12) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 14) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 10) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 11) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are 6 and 5.
For node 6, we have neighbors: 9, 5, 1, 2, 12, 4.
For node 5, we have neighbors: 6, 1, 3, 12, 0, 7.

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 6, we have \( \binom{6}{3} \) = 20 3-stars.
For node 5, we have \( \binom{6}{3} \) = 20 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 20 = 40.

In <>:
<6, (9, 2, 14)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (5, 4, 12)>
<6, (6, 5, 1)>
<5, (6, 3, 12)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 12, 7)>
<5, (5, 3, 7)>   

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].
