Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (3-stars: 1)
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors (3-stars: 5)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (3-stars: 1)
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (3-stars: 5)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (3-stars: 0)
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors (3-stars: 5)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (3-stars: 1)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (3-stars: 1)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (3-stars: 1)

Total number of 3-stars = [1 + 5 + 1 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [20]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 3, 0)>
<1, (5, 6, 4)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 2, 7)>
<2, (9, 7, 5)>
<4, (9, 0, 6)>
<4, (6, 0, 3)>
<4, (6, 8, 1)>
<4, (6, 2, 9)>
