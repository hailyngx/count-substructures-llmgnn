Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 9) (3, 11) (3, 6) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 10) (7, 8) (7, 19) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 9) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 15) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 0) (0, 18) (2, 4) (2, 6) (5, 14) (5, 12) (16, 10) (16, 9) (16, 6) (19, 17) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 6) (9, 1) (9, 12) (9, 16) (9, 15) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (6, 19) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can analyze the nodes to determine the 3-stars formed. Let's start by identifying nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate how many 3-stars are formed around these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 24. 

Therefore, we can represent the 3-stars found as: <1, (9, 13, 19)>, <8, (1, 11, 13)>, <8, (11, 13, 8)>, <8, (13, 1, 8)>, <8, (13, 1, 19)>, <8, (13, 19, 7)>, <8, (13, 8, 11)>, <8, (13, 8, 18)>, <8, (13, 8, 13)>, <8, (13, 11, 8)>, <16, (6, 9, 15)>, <16, (9, 1, 16)>, <16, (9, 12, 16)>, <16, (9, 15, 16)>, <17, (14, 17, 19)>, <19, (1, 7, 19)>, <19, (6, 17, 19)>, <19, (6, 19, 7)>, <19, (7, 1, 19)>, <19, (9, 6, 19)>, <19, (9, 12, 19)>, <19, (12, 5, 19)>, <19, (12, 9, 19)>, <19, (15, 9, 19)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].
