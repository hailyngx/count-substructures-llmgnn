Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 13) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (13, 14) (13, 12) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14.

For node 1, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 3, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 4, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 5, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 6, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 8, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 9, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 10, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 11, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 12, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 14, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing all the 3-stars up, we get a total of 55 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55], and the unique 3-stars are:
