Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 11) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 1) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 10) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes that have more than 3 neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 92 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [92].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 11>, <0, 8, 7>, <0, 9, 12>, <2, 11, 1>, <2, 11, 9>, <2, 13, 6>, <2, 14, 3>, <3, 4, 12>, <3, 4, 10>, <3, 10, 13>, <3, 13, 6>, <4, 10, 12>, <7, 12, 9>, <7, 12, 4>, <7, 12, 13>, <7, 14, 3>, <7, 14, 1>, <9, 10, 12>, <9, 10, 13>, <9, 11, 0>, <10, 13, 6>, <11, 9, 0>, <12, 9, 11>, <12, 9, 0>, <12, 9, 7>, <12, 10, 3>, <12, 10, 4>, <13, 10, 3>, <13, 10, 6>
