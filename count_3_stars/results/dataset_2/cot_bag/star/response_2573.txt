Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 5) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 9) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 12) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 12) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 3) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 13.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding them up: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 62 \).

So, there are a total of 62 3-stars in this graph.

To list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, 5, 9>
- <0, 5, 3>
- <0, 9, 10>
- <0, 9, 3>
- <0, 10, 9>
- <0, 10, 5>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <3, 9, 10>
- <3, 9, 0>
- <3, 9, 6>
- <6, 5, 0>
- <6, 5, 3>
- <6, 10, 9>
- <6, 10, 3>
- <8, 9, 13>
- <8, 9, 3>
- <8, 9, 10>
- <8, 10, 9>
- <8, 10, 3>
- <8, 13, 9>
- <9, 10, 0>
- <9, 10, 3>
- <9, 10, 8>
- <9, 13, 8>
- <9, 13, 3>
- <10, 0, 5>
- <10, 0, 9>
- <10, 0, 3>
- <10, 9, 8>
- <10, 9, 3> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [62].
