Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 4) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 9) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (14, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 13, 12, 0, 10, 14.

Now, calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so there are 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars: $10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 64$.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64].

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 8, 14)>
<3, (1, 5, 11)>
<5, (3, 6, 13)>
<6, (1, 4, 0)>
<4, (1, 13, 12)>
<13, (3, 5, 4)>
<12, (13, 4, 10)>
<0, (6, 11, 10)>
<10, (8, 12, 0)>
<14, (1, 11, 12)>
