Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 5) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 17) (5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 7) (8, 15) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 16) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 17) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 19) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (19, 3) (19, 12) (13, 1) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (17, 18) (17, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is formed.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is formed.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 38 \)

Therefore, there are 38 3-stars in this graph.
