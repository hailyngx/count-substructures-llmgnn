The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 6) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 16) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 15) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 18) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 18) (13, 12) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 19) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 18) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 0) (6, 12) (6, 14) (19, 2) (19, 3) (19, 13) (10, 7) (10, 1) (4, 13) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 18) (15, 14) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 1) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:

0: 14, 16
1: 10, 12, 18
2: 8, 14, 16, 19
3: 5, 11, 18, 19
4: 13
5: 3, 9, 17
6: 12, 14
7: 8, 10, 16
8: 2, 7, 9, 11
9: 5, 8
10: 1, 7
11: 3, 8, 18
12: 1, 6, 13, 18
13: 4, 12, 17, 19
14: 0, 2, 6, 15
15: 14
16: 2, 7, 0
17: 5, 13, 18
18: 1, 3, 11, 12, 17
19: 2, 3, 13

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- For node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For node 16: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-stars
- For node 18: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [35].
The unique 3-stars are <1, (10, 18, 12)>, <2, (8, 7, 16)>, <3, (5, 11, 18)>, <8, (2, 7, 11)>, <12, (1, 6, 13)>, <13, (4, 12, 17)>, <14, (0, 6, 15)>, <16, (2, 7, 0)>, <18, (1, 11, 17)>.
