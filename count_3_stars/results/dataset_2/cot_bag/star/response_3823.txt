Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
To start, let's first list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 8, 9, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 8
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4
- Node 8: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 1, since they have more than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3, Node 4, and Node 8, as they have exactly 3 neighbors.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: 1 3-star
- For Node 4: 1 3-star
- For Node 8: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [17] \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
