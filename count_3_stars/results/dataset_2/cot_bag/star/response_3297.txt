Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 6) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 13) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (19, 8) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (13, 14) (0, 17) (0, 10) (0, 6) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 9) (12, 1) (12, 5) (10, 1) (10, 0) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 5) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (4, 16) (4, 1) (4, 15) (15, 16) (15, 17) (15, 4) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors --> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors --> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors --> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors --> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors --> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors --> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors --> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors --> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors --> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors --> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (6, 16, 17)>
<1, (3, 4, 12)>
<2, (3, 9, 11)>
<3, (1, 9, 12)>
<6, (0, 7, 16)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 8, 2)>
<11, (16, 17, 18)>
<14, (17, 18, 13)>
<15, (4, 16, 17)>
