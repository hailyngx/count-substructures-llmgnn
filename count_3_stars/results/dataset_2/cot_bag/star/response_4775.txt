Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 3) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 4) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows: 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 8), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 11), (9, 10), (9, 1), (9, 12), (10, 9), (10, 0), (10, 3), (10, 14), (11, 9), (11, 6), (8, 5), (8, 13), (8, 12), (13, 8), (13, 12), (13, 4), (13, 1), (13, 14), (13, 7), (7, 5), (7, 13), (7, 14), (7, 2), (12, 9), (12, 8), (12, 13), (12, 4), (12, 6), (2, 7), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 5), (3, 10), (3, 0), (3, 6), (3, 4), (4, 13), (4, 12), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 14), (4, 1), (0, 10), (0, 3), (0, 1), (6, 11), (6, 12), (6, 3), (14, 10), (14, 13), (14, 7), (14, 4), (1, 9), (1, 13), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 0)

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors (9, 13, 2, 4).
Node 3 has 5 neighbors (5, 10, 0, 6, 4).
Node 4 has 6 neighbors (13, 12, 2, 3, 14, 1).
Node 7 has 4 neighbors (5, 13, 14, 2).
Node 9 has 5 neighbors (11, 10, 1, 12, 13).
Node 12 has 5 neighbors (9, 8, 13, 4, 6).
Node 13 has 6 neighbors (8, 13, 4, 1, 14, 7).
Node 14 has 4 neighbors (10, 13, 7, 4).

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each relevant node:
- For nodes with 5 or more neighbors: inom{n}{3} = inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars per node
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: 1 3-star per node

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: 10
- Node 3: 10
- Node 4: 10
- Node 7: 1
- Node 9: 10
- Node 12: 10
- Node 13: 10
- Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 62

So, there are 62 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting the final answer in brackets: [62]
