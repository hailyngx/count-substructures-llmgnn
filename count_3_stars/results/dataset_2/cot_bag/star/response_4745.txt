Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 14) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 19) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (14, 16) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 18) (1, 15) (1, 10) (3, 9) (3, 15) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 0) (15, 1) (15, 3) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 7) (18, 16) (18, 17) (18, 7) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 0) (13, 9) (13, 14) (4, 9) (4, 14) (0, 6) (0, 19) (0, 8) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 0) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors: 11, 5, 16, 9, 14, 6, 10, 18, 7, 19, 8, 0.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 11: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
For node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
For node 16: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For node 18: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
For node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
For node 19: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<11, (5, 7, 16)>
<5, (9, 11, 19)>
<16, (6, 14, 18)>
<9, (4, 13, 5)>
<14, (13, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 8, 16)>
<10, (1, 17, 19)>
<18, (7, 16, 17)>
<7, (2, 11, 18)>
<19, (0, 10, 12)>
<8, (0, 6, 12)>
<0, (6, 8, 19)>
