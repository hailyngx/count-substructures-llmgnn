Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 24) (27, 18) (7, 21) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 20) (21, 8) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 16) (22, 18) (22, 28) (8, 21) (8, 23) (8, 11) (23, 8) (28, 21) (28, 22) (28, 26) (28, 25) (26, 28) (26, 25) (26, 0) (26, 17) (9, 29) (9, 2) (29, 9) (29, 13) (29, 0) (29, 3) (19, 17) (19, 12) (11, 8) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 17) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 14) (1, 25) (1, 12) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 14) (25, 28) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 10) (0, 15) (0, 26) (0, 29) (20, 21) (20, 6) (20, 10) (20, 16) (3, 29) (3, 5) (10, 25) (10, 20) (10, 5) (13, 7) (13, 29) (16, 18) (16, 20) (16, 6) (14, 24) (14, 2) (17, 26) (17, 19) (17, 11) (17, 4) (6, 20) (6, 16) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 10) (4, 11) (4, 17) (12, 15) (12, 19) (12, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Adding up all the numbers of 3-stars for each node, we get a total of 39 3-stars. So, the answer is [39].
