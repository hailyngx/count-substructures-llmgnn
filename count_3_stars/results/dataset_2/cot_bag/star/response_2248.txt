Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 9) (20, 22) (20, 10) (25, 27) (25, 13) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 21) (5, 27) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 23) (6, 16) (0, 14) (0, 26) (14, 0) (14, 23) (14, 12) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 15) (29, 19) (29, 13) (2, 3) (2, 24) (2, 15) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 25) (13, 29) (13, 1) (24, 17) (24, 2) (26, 0) (1, 13) (1, 9) (15, 17) (15, 2) (10, 20) (10, 3) (10, 23) (10, 28) (21, 5) (21, 27) (21, 9) (27, 25) (27, 5) (27, 17) (27, 21) (27, 19) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 3) (4, 22) (4, 9) (4, 28) (22, 20) (22, 4) (22, 7) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 28) (19, 29) (19, 27) (23, 5) (23, 6) (23, 14) (23, 10) (7, 6) (7, 22) (7, 18) (9, 20) (9, 1) (9, 21) (9, 4) (9, 28) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 16) (28, 10) (28, 4) (28, 18) (28, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 18) (16, 6) (16, 8) (16, 3) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's find the 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

- Node 20 has 3 neighbors: (9, 22, 10)
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors: (27, 13, 5)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (6, 23, 21)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (5, 7, 23)
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: (23, 0, 12)
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: (24, 27, 15)
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (3, 24, 15)
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: (25, 29, 1)
- Node 24 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (20, 3, 23, 28)
- Node 21 has 2 neighbors
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors: (25, 5, 17, 21, 19)
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: (14, 11, 3)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (22, 9, 28)
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: (20, 4, 7)
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: (11, 7, 28)
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: (5, 6, 14, 10)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (6, 22, 18)
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: (20, 1, 21, 4, 28)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (2, 10, 12, 16)
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: (10, 4, 18, 9)
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: (8, 12, 18)
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: (6, 8, 3)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + 0 + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + 0 + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + 0 + 0 + 0 + \binom{4}{3} + 0 + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + 0 ] = [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 0] = [38] \]

Therefore, there are 38 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
