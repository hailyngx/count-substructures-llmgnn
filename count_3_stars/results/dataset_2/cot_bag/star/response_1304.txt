Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 26) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 28) (16, 4) (16, 9) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 5) (27, 10) (27, 9) (27, 8) (10, 27) (10, 20) (8, 27) (8, 23) (8, 28) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 25) (15, 0) (15, 20) (15, 9) (20, 11) (20, 10) (20, 15) (20, 3) (1, 18) (26, 11) (26, 17) (13, 12) (13, 25) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 8) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 21) (2, 22) (2, 3) (2, 4) (22, 5) (22, 2) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 18) (6, 12) (17, 0) (17, 26) (17, 6) (17, 12) (14, 23) (14, 6) (14, 18) (25, 23) (25, 13) (9, 16) (9, 27) (9, 15) (9, 12) (9, 24) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 9) (21, 19) (21, 29) (21, 24) (18, 1) (18, 6) (18, 14) (3, 20) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 29) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 29) (24, 9) (24, 21) (29, 5) (29, 21) (29, 3) (29, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 30 nodes in this graph. Let's first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors along with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: {15, 17, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 19, 22, 29, 3}
- Node 6: {17, 14, 18, 12}
- Node 9: {16, 27, 15, 12, 24}
- Node 11: {16, 28, 26, 20}
- Node 12: {13, 6, 17, 9}
- Node 16: {11, 28, 4, 9}
- Node 17: {0, 26, 6, 12}
- Node 20: {11, 10, 15, 3}
- Node 21: {19, 29, 24}
- Node 22: {5, 2}
- Node 23: {8, 14, 25}
- Node 24: {9, 21}
- Node 26: {11, 17}
- Node 28: {11, 16, 8}
- Node 29: {5, 21, 3, 4}

Following the method described earlier, the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes are:

Node 0: [1]
Node 5: [1]
Node 6: [1]
Node 9: [1]
Node 11: [1]
Node 12: [1]
Node 16: [1]
Node 17: [1]
Node 20: [1]
Node 21: [1]
Node 22: [1]
Node 23: [1]
Node 24: [1]
Node 26: [1]
Node 28: [1]
Node 29: [1]

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (15, 17, 5)>
<5, (0, 19, 22)>
<6, (17, 14, 18)>
<9, (16, 27, 15)>
<11, (16, 28, 26)>
<12, (13, 6, 17)>
<16, (11, 28, 4)>
<17, (0, 26, 6)>
<20, (11, 10, 15)>
<21, (19, 29, 24)>
<22, (5, 2)>
<23, (8, 14, 25)>
<24, (9, 21)>
<26, (11, 17)>
<28, (11, 16, 8)>
<29, (5, 21, 3)>
