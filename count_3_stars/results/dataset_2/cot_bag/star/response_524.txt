Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 6) (2, 3) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 10) (12, 3) (12, 11) (5, 11) (0, 8) (0, 11) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 15) (10, 16) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 10) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 19) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 17) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 14) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 9) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 14) (14, 9) (14, 19) (16, 8) (16, 10) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors 
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors 
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors 
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors 
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors 
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<1, (3, 6, 19)> 
<1, (3, 9, 19)>
<1, (6, 4, 19)>
<1, (9, 3, 19)>

For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<3, (1, 9, 12)>
<3, (2, 9, 18)>
<3, (9, 1, 19)>
<3, (12, 11, 1)>

For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<6, (1, 4, 13)>
<6, (4, 10, 17)>
<6, (13, 6, 15)>
<6, (17, 6, 19)>

For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<9, (1, 3, 18)>
<9, (1, 11, 19)>
<9, (1, 14, 19)>
<9, (3, 1, 9)>
<9, (3, 12, 11)>
<9, (3, 18, 9)>
<9, (11, 1, 19)>
<9, (11, 3, 14)>
<9, (11, 5, 0)>
<9, (19, 14, 1)>

For Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<10, (4, 15, 16)>
<10, (4, 15, 8)>
<10, (18, 9, 16)>
<10, (18, 9, 10)>

For Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<11, (5, 0, 11)>
<11, (9, 1, 12)>
<11, (9, 5, 11)>
<11, (12, 3, 11)>

Adding up the 3-stars gives a total of [30].
