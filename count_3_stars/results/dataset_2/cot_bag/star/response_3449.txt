Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 2) (18, 9) (18, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 17) (5, 13) (5, 16) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 9) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 9) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 14) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 12) (12, 10) (12, 19) (12, 16) (11, 19) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 9) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 6) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 12) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 11) (3, 18) (3, 13) (3, 17) (7, 11) (6, 14) (6, 17) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}

For each node with 3 or more neighbors, we can calculate how many 3-stars can be formed:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

Adding all the 3-stars we find, we get a total of 153 3-stars. Hence, the answer is [153].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (13, 15, 9)>, 
<4, (19, 8, 2)>, 
<13, (5, 1, 15)>, 
<15, (13, 1, 9)>
