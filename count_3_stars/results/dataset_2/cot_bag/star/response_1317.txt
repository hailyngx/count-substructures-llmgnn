Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 4) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 4) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 10) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 11) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors. Let's list these nodes along with their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 12, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 7, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 12, 13}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 6, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 2, 10}
- Node 13: Neighbors {0, 2, 11}
- Node 14: Neighbors {4, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node and calculate the total:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3}] = 3
Node 1: [inom{5}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{5}{3}] = 30
Node 2: [inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3}] = 3
Node 3: [inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3}] = 12
Node 4: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 6: [inom{6}{3} + inom{6}{3} + inom{6}{3}] = 60
Node 7: [inom{5}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{5}{3}] = 30
Node 8: [inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3}] = 12
Node 9: [inom{7}{3} + inom{7}{3} + inom{7}{3}] = 105
Node 11: [inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3}] = 12
Node 12: [inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3}] = 3
Node 13: [inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3}] = 3
Node 14: [inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3}] = 12

Adding these up, we get a total of 282 3-stars in this graph. Thus, the final answer is [282]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (6, 12, 13)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 11)>, <1, (7, 8, 14)>, <1, (9, 11, 14)>, <2, (9, 12, 13)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 14)>, <3, (6, 9, 11)>, <9, (11, 13, 14)>.
