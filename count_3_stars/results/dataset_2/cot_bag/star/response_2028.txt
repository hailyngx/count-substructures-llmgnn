Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 7 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 1: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars
- For node 2: $\binom{7}{3} = 35$ 3-stars
- For node 4: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars
- For node 6: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars
- For node 7: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars
- For node 9: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars

Summing these up, we get a total of $10 + 35 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 85$ 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [85].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
- <1, (5, 2, 7)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <4, (9, 2, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <7, (1, 3, 8)>
- <9, (5, 4, 7)>
