Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 4) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 6) (4, 16) (4, 9) (4, 17) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 12) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 12) (17, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 9) (15, 5) (15, 6) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 19) (6, 15) (10, 13) (10, 0) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 18) (7, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 7) (18, 16) (18, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing them up: \( 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42 \)

So, there are 42 3-stars in this graph. Writing them in unique form: 
\[ [42] \]
<0, (8, 10, 14)>, <4, (9, 17, 19)>, <6, (3, 15, 19)>, <8, (0, 11, 13)>, <9, (4, 7, 14)>, <13, (6, 8, 10)>, <14, (0, 12, 9)>, <16, (4, 11, 18)>, <19, (5, 9, 6)>
