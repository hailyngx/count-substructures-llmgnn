Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: Since it has 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 at the center. Thus, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>.

For node 4: Since it has 5 neighbors, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 at the center. These are <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 3)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>.

For node 6: Since it has 5 neighbors, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 6 at the center. These are <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 3)>, <6, (2, 7, 3)>, <6, (4, 7, 3)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>.

For node 7: Since it has 5 neighbors, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7 at the center. These are <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 3)>, <7, (2, 6, 3)>, <7, (4, 6, 3)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>.

For node 8: Since it has 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8 at the center. Thus, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>.

For node 9: Since it has 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 at the center. Thus, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>.

Summing up all the 3-stars found, we get a total of [42].
