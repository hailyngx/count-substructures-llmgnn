Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 7) (15, 9) (4, 14) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 13) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 18) (5, 10) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 16) (1, 14) (1, 13) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 2) (13, 7) (13, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 18) (16, 9) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 11) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 19) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 11) (12, 3) (12, 0) (11, 18) (11, 9) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
- Node 0: {3, 8, 12, 16}
- Node 1: {13, 14}
- Node 2: {3, 10, 17, 19}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 12}
- Node 4: {14}
- Node 5: {6, 10, 17, 19}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 16}
- Node 7: {13, 15, 19}
- Node 8: {0, 14, 18}
- Node 9: {11, 15, 16}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 17}
- Node 11: {9, 18}
- Node 12: {0, 3}
- Node 13: {1, 7}
- Node 14: {4, 8, 1}
- Node 15: {7, 9}
- Node 16: {6, 0, 18, 9}
- Node 17: {2, 5, 10}
- Node 18: {8, 16, 19, 11}
- Node 19: {2, 5, 7, 18}

Next, we'll analyze each node that has three or more neighbors to find the number of 3-stars it participates in:

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so number of 3-stars = $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 
<3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 12)>, <3, (0, 6, 12)>, <3, (2, 6, 12)>

Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so number of 3-stars =  $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 
<5, (10, 17, 6)>, <5, (10, 17, 19)>, <5, (10, 6, 19)>, <5, (17, 6, 19)>

Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is formed: 
<7, (15, 13, 19)>

Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is formed: 
<8, (14, 1, 18)>

Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is formed: 
<9, (15, 11, 16)>

Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is formed: 
<10, (17, 2, 5)>

Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is formed: 
<14, (4, 8, 1)>

Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so number of 3-stars =  $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 
<16, (6, 0, 18)>, <16, (6, 9, 18)>, <16, (0, 9, 18)>, <16, (6, 0, 9)>

Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so number of 3-stars =  $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 
<18, (8, 16, 19)>, <18, (11, 16, 19)>, <18, (8, 11, 19)>, <18, (8, 16, 11)>

In total, there are 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 21 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [21].
