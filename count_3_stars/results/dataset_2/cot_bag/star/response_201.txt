Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 0) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 6 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 2 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars for the nodes with three or more neighbors, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 64 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [64], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

- <0, (2, 12, 14)>
- <0, (3, 8, 12)>
- <0, (4, 8, 12)>
- <0, (5, 8, 12)>
- <1, (2, 4, 14)>
- <1, (2, 5, 14)>
- <1, (4, 5, 14)>
- <1, (4, 12, 14)>
- <2, (3, 12, 4)>
- <2, (3, 12, 13)>
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (3, 5, 13)>
- <3, (4, 8, 13)>
- <3, (4, 13, 5)>
- <3, (5, 10, 13)>
- <3, (8, 10, 4)>
- <3, (9, 13, 4)>
- <4, (5, 8, 14)>
- <5, (8, 14, 4)>
- <8, (10, 14, 4)>
- <9, (13, 14, 4)>
