Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 7, 6
- Node 1: 9, 4, 7, 3, 8
- Node 2: 9, 3, 8, 6
- Node 3: 9, 1, 7, 2, 8
- Node 4: 5, 7, 8, 1
- Node 5: 9, 6, 4
- Node 6: 5, 8, 2, 0
- Node 7: 4, 0, 3, 1
- Node 8: 4, 1, 3, 2, 6
- Node 9: 5, 2, 3, 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing these up, we get a total of 34 3-stars. Therefore, the answer is [34].

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
