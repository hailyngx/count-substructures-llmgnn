Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 11) (13, 9) (22, 10) (15, 27) (15, 26) (15, 23) (15, 7) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 16) (18, 7) (18, 28) (3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (25, 3) (25, 16) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 20) (1, 24) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 7) (20, 1) (20, 16) (21, 27) (21, 10) (24, 1) (24, 26) (24, 6) (24, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 28) (14, 2) (17, 1) (17, 9) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 3) (7, 0) (5, 19) (5, 29) (5, 11) (5, 16) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 16) (26, 15) (26, 24) (26, 28) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 17) (29, 5) (29, 8) (10, 22) (10, 21) (10, 28) (8, 24) (8, 19) (8, 29) (8, 6) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 24) (6, 8) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 5) (23, 15) (28, 18) (28, 14) (28, 26) (28, 10) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 19) (16, 27) (16, 25) (16, 20) (16, 5) (16, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

For each of these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors, giving \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, giving \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, giving \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, giving \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, giving \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, giving \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 8 has 4 neighbors, giving \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, giving \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
11. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, giving \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
12. Node 12 has 4 neighbors, giving \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
13. Node 14 has 4 neighbors, giving \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
14. Node 15 has 5 neighbors, giving \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
15. Node 16 has 6 neighbors, giving \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
16. Node 19 has 4 neighbors, giving \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
17. Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
18. Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
19. Node 22 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
20. Node 24 has 4 neighbors, giving \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
21. Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
22. Node 26 has 4 neighbors, giving \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
23. Node 27 has 4 neighbors, giving \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
24. Node 28 has 4 neighbors, giving \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
25. Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated above: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 \) =
\( 100 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 100 3-stars in the graph and the final answer is [100].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
