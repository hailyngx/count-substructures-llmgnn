Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 8) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 4) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 1) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

```
    0 -- 1 -- 2 -- 10
    |    |    |    |
    8 -- 5 -- 9 -- 4
     \   |    |   /
       11 |  12
         \| /
           3
           | \
           7  13
          /    
         6
```

We can see that nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 11, and 13 have 3 or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 38 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [38]. 

And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
