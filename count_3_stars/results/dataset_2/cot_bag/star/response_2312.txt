Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 14) (16, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 16) (15, 12) (8, 19) (8, 7) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 9) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 17) (1, 16) (1, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 18) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 19) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 13) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 14) (10, 4) (10, 0) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 6) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 13) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

The degrees of the nodes are:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 4

So, nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 14, and 19 have at least three neighbors and can form 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with degree 4 (3-stars): \( \binom{9}{3} \times 9 = 84 \)
- For nodes with degree 3 (3-stars): \( \binom{4}{3} \times 4 = 4 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 84 + 4 = 88.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [88].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (11, 14, 16)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 9, 18)>
<5, (1, 3, 11)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 18, 19)>
<11, (0, 14, 16)>
<14, (11, 16, 19)>
<19, (9, 13, 18)>
