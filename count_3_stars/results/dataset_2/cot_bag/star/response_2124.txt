Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 12) (22, 25) (22, 1) (3, 25) (25, 22) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 27) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 27) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 16) (23, 9) (4, 8) (4, 11) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 1) (17, 29) (17, 0) (17, 12) (29, 17) (29, 7) (29, 5) (29, 10) (21, 8) (21, 28) (21, 14) (28, 21) (28, 20) (27, 25) (27, 8) (27, 10) (7, 25) (7, 29) (7, 6) (16, 23) (16, 6) (16, 15) (10, 29) (10, 27) (10, 19) (15, 18) (15, 16) (15, 26) (11, 23) (11, 4) (11, 5) (24, 12) (24, 1) (9, 23) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 14) (1, 22) (1, 18) (1, 24) (1, 19) (20, 28) (20, 19) (14, 23) (14, 21) (14, 6) (26, 15) (26, 12) (5, 8) (5, 29) (5, 11) (5, 0) (12, 22) (12, 17) (12, 24) (12, 26) (12, 0) (0, 17) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 12) (19, 10) (19, 1) (19, 20) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 5, 8, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 23, 25, 27, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars for these nodes: \( 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 75 \)

So, there are a total of [75] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, 19, 20>, <5, 0, 12>, <8, 4, 11>, <12, 0, 26>, <15, 16, 26>, <17, 0, 12>, <18, 1, 24>, <19, 1, 20>, <22, 13, 25>, <23, 8, 11>, <27, 8, 10>, <29, 10, 27>.
