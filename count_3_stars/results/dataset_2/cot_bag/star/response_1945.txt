Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 10) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 0) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- For nodes 5, 9, 4, 7, 10, 11, 6, 3, 2, 0, 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars for each node
- For nodes 13, 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for each node

Count the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 13 \times 20 + 2 \times 1 = 266 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [266].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars: 
- <5, (9, 3, 10)>
- <9, (5, 3, 10)>
- <4, (5, 7, 10)>
- <7, (9, 4, 0)>
- <10, (5, 9, 4)>
- <11, (7, 10, 0)>
- <6, (5, 3, 11)>
- <3, (5, 9, 10)>
- <2, (13, 6, 14)>
- <0, (7, 11, 6)>
- <14, (7, 11, 2)>
- <13, (8, 12, 2)>
- <12, (9, 13, 14)>
