Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:  
1: 5, 7  
2: 5, 6, 8  
3: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9  
4: 0, 3, 5, 9  
5: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 2  
6: 2, 5, 7  
7: 1, 6, 8, 0, 9  
8: 3, 5, 2, 9, 7  
9: 3, 8, 7, 4  

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:  

Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.  
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 50 \).  
Therefore, the final answer is [50].  

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<3, (0, 4, 5)>  
<3, (0, 4, 8)>  
<3, (0, 5, 8)>  
<3, (4, 5, 8)>  
<3, (4, 8, 9)>  
<3, (5, 8, 9)>  
<5, (1, 6, 7)>  
<5, (1, 6, 8)>  
<5, (1, 7, 8)>  
<5, (6, 7, 8)>  
<5, (6, 7, 9)>  
<5, (6, 8, 9)>  
<5, (7, 8, 9)>  
<8, (2, 7, 9)>  
<8, (3, 5, 9)>  
<8, (3, 7, 9)>  
<8, (5, 7, 9)>  
<8, (5, 8, 9)>  
<7, (0, 6, 9)>  

(All combinations of neighbors for each central node that form a 3-star are considered)
