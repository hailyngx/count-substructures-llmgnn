Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 3) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 3) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 7) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 11) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 5) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 10) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 3) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 4, 1, 3, 12.
- Node 1 has neighbors: 6, 11, 14, 10, 0, 12.
- Node 3 has neighbors: 4, 2, 12, 7, 0.
- Node 4 has neighbors: 6, 9, 0, 3.
- Node 6 has neighbors: 9, 1, 2, 4.
- Node 7 has neighbors: 11, 3, 10, 5.
- Node 8 has neighbors: 13, 14, 12.
- Node 9 has neighbors: 6, 4, 10, 13.
- Node 10 has neighbors: 9, 1, 7, 5.
- Node 11 has neighbors: 13, 1, 14, 7.
- Node 12 has neighbors: 8, 1, 3, 0.
- Node 13 has neighbors: 9, 8, 11, 14.
- Node 14 has neighbors: 8, 13, 1, 11.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed for each applicable node:

- Node 0 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <0, (4, 1, 12)>, <0, (4, 3, 12)>, <0, (1, 3, 12)>, <0, (4, 1, 3)>.
- Node 1 forms 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars. <1, (6, 11, 14)>, <1, (6, 11, 10)>, <1, (6, 11, 12)>, <1, (6, 14, 10)>, <1, (6, 14, 12)>, <1, (6, 10, 12)>, <1, (11, 14, 10)>, <1, (11, 14, 12)>, <1, (11, 10, 12)>, <1, (6, 11, 0)>, <1, (6, 14, 0)>, <1, (6, 10, 0)>, <1, (6, 12, 0)>, <1, (11, 14, 0)>, <1, (11, 10, 0)>, <1, (11, 12, 0)>, <1, (14, 10, 0)>, <1, (14, 12, 0)>, <1, (10, 12, 0)>, <1, (6, 1, 0)>.
- Node 3 forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars. <3, (4, 2, 12)>, <3, (4, 7, 12)>, <3, (4, 2, 0)>, <3, (4, 7, 0)>, <3, (2, 7, 12)>, <3, (2, 7, 0)>, <3, (4, 2, 7)>, <3, (4, 12, 0)>, <3, (2, 12, 0)>, <3, (2, 12, 7)>.
- Node 4 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <4, (6, 9, 10)>, <4, (6, 9, 13)>, <4, (9, 10, 13)>, <4, (6, 10, 13)>.
- Node 6 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <6, (9, 1, 2)>, <6, (9, 1, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (9, 2, 4)>.
- Node 7 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <7, (11, 10, 5)>, <7, (3, 10, 5)>, <7, (11, 3, 5)>, <7, (11, 10, 3)>.
- Node 8 forms 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star. <8, (13, 14, 12)>.
- Node 9 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <9, (6, 4, 10)>, <9, (6, 4, 13)>, <9, (6, 10, 13)>, <9, (4, 10, 13)>.
- Node 10 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <10, (9, 1, 7)>, <10, (9, 5, 7)>, <10, (1, 5, 7)>, <10, (9, 1, 5)>.
- Node 11 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <11, (13, 14, 7)>, <11, (13, 14, 1)>, <11, (13, 7, 1)>, <11, (14, 7, 1)>.
- Node 12 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <12, (8, 3, 0)>, <12, (8, 1, 0)>, <12, (8, 3, 1)>, <12, (3, 1, 0)>.
- Node 13 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <13, (9, 8, 11)>, <13, (9, 8, 14)>, <13, (9, 11, 14)>, <13, (8, 11, 14)>.
- Node 14 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <14, (8, 13, 11)>, <14, (8, 13, 1)>, <14, (8, 11, 1)>, <14, (13, 11, 1)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 61
So, there are 61 3-stars in the given graph.
Putting this number inside brackets: [61].
