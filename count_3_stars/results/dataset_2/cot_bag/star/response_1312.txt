Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6, 2, 7
- Node 1: 6, 4
- Node 2: 9, 3, 0, 8, 7, 4
- Node 3: 2, 8, 4
- Node 4: 5, 6, 1, 3, 2
- Node 5: 9, 6, 4, 7
- Node 6: 5, 1, 4, 0
- Node 7: 5, 9, 0, 2, 8
- Node 8: 9, 3, 2, 7
- Node 9: 5, 8, 2, 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [\[ \binom{3}{3} \] = 1]
- Node 1: [\[ \binom{2}{3} \] = 0]
- Node 2: [\[ \binom{6}{3} \] = 20]
- Node 3: [\[ \binom{2}{3} \] = 0]
- Node 4: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]
- Node 5: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]
- Node 6: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]
- Node 7: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]
- Node 8: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]
- Node 9: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have:
\[ 1 + 0 + 20 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 57 \]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [57]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
