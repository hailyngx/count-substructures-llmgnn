Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 10) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 18) (1, 29) (1, 7) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 22) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 23) (10, 14) (10, 11) (10, 24) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 5) (11, 6) (26, 6) (29, 1) (28, 3) (28, 11) (28, 12) (28, 2) (24, 10) (24, 0) (24, 7) (2, 17) (2, 28) (2, 22) (2, 27) (2, 16) (22, 8) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (25, 27) (27, 2) (27, 25) (27, 21) (27, 23) (4, 22) (4, 12) (12, 28) (12, 22) (12, 4) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 9) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 23) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 19) (0, 18) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 15) (7, 9) (21, 27) (21, 9) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 2) (20, 14) (20, 9) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 21) (9, 20) (6, 11) (6, 26) (18, 17) (18, 0) (23, 14) (23, 13) (23, 27) (23, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are:
- Node 2 with degree 5
- Node 3 with degree 4
- Node 7 with degree 5
- Node 10 with degree 4
- Node 11 with degree 4
- Node 12 with degree 4
- Node 13 with degree 4
- Node 14 with degree 3
- Node 16 with degree 3
- Node 17 with degree 3
- Node 19 with degree 4
- Node 22 with degree 4
- Node 23 with degree 4
- Node 27 with degree 4
- Node 28 with degree 4

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: 
\[ 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<2, (16, 17, 2)>, <3, (11, 5, 3)>, <7, (9, 20, 7)>, <7, (15, 7, 9)>, <7, (15, 19, 7)>, <7, (1, 7, 3)>, <7, (1, 29, 7)>, <10, (11, 5, 10)>, <10, (11, 28, 10)>, <10, (11, 6, 10)>, <10, (14, 20, 10)>, <11, (5, 3, 11)>, <11, (6, 26, 11)>, <12, (4, 22, 12)>, <12, (4, 12, 28)>, <12, (22, 28, 12)>, <12, (22, 2, 12)>, <13, (23, 14, 13)>, <13, (19, 15, 13)>, <13, (8, 22, 13)>, <13, (23, 19, 13)>, <14, (10, 20, 14)>, <16, (2, 17, 16)>, <17, (2, 16, 17)>, <19, (15, 9, 19)>, <19, (0, 23, 19)>, <19, (13, 23, 19)>, <19, (0, 18, 19)>, <22, (2, 12, 22)>, <22, (8, 22, 4)>, <22, (2, 28, 22)>, <22, (4, 12, 22)>, <23, (27, 19, 23)>, <23, (19, 13, 23)>, <23, (14, 13, 23)>, <23, (27, 23, 19)>, <27, (21, 9, 27)>, <27, (2, 16, 27)>, <27, (25, 21, 27)>, <28, (2, 12, 28)>, <28, (11, 12, 28)>, <28, (11, 2, 28)>, <28, (3, 0, 28)>, <28, (2, 16, 28)>
