Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 19) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 19) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 18) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 6) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 7) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 7) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (3, 19) (3, 4) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 2) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 1) (4, 3) (4, 14) (12, 10) (12, 18) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 12) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 1) (0, 17) (0, 19) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 3) (19, 0) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 4) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 6, 8, 10, 13, and 15. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

1. Node 1:
   - Neighbors: 6, 11, 15, 2
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <1, (6, 11, 15)>, <1, (6, 11, 2)>, <1, (6, 15, 2)>, <1, (11, 15, 2)>

2. Node 6:
   - Neighbors: 1, 7, 13, 14
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 7, 13)>, <6, (1, 7, 14)>, <6, (1, 13, 14)>, <6, (7, 13, 14)>

3. Node 8:
   - Neighbors: 5, 13, 14, 15
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <8, (5, 13, 14)>, <8, (5, 13, 15)>, <8, (5, 14, 15)>, <8, (13, 14, 15)>

4. Node 10:
   - Neighbors: 7, 12, 15, 18
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <10, (7, 12, 15)>, <10, (7, 12, 18)>, <10, (7, 15, 18)>, <10, (12, 15, 18)>

5. Node 13:
   - Neighbors: 6, 8, 15
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <13, (6, 8, 15)>

6. Node 15:
   - Neighbors: 1, 8, 10, 13, 16
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <15, (1, 8, 10)>, <15, (1, 8, 13)>, <15, (1, 8, 16)>, <15, (1, 10, 13)>, <15, (1, 10, 16)>, <15, (1, 13, 16)>, <15, (8, 10, 13)>, <15, (8, 10, 16)>, <15, (8, 13, 16)>, <15, (10, 13, 16)>

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 27\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27].
