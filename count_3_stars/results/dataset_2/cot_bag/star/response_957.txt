Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 8) (16, 13) (16, 25) (16, 8) (13, 16) (13, 22) (13, 18) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 6) (22, 29) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 21) (9, 17) (9, 10) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 27) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 14) (2, 5) (2, 24) (2, 28) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 1) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 20) (1, 28) (15, 1) (15, 7) (20, 1) (20, 21) (20, 4) (29, 22) (29, 19) (23, 11) (23, 4) (19, 22) (19, 29) (26, 6) (26, 27) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 4) (7, 15) (7, 3) (7, 24) (0, 3) (0, 21) (0, 4) (25, 16) (25, 21) (21, 5) (21, 20) (21, 0) (21, 25) (24, 2) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 10) (18, 13) (18, 14) (18, 28) (12, 3) (12, 24) (12, 6) (27, 14) (27, 26) (4, 20) (4, 23) (4, 3) (4, 0) (10, 9) (10, 24) (28, 2) (28, 1) (28, 18) (6, 13) (6, 22) (6, 26) (6, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors: 8, 14, 15, 20, 28
- Node 2 has neighbors: 5, 24, 28
- Node 3 has neighbors: 4, 7, 12
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 3, 20, 23
- Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 17, 21
- Node 6 has neighbors: 12, 13, 22, 26
- Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 11, 16
- Node 9 has neighbors: 10, 14, 17
- Node 13 has neighbors: 6, 16, 18, 22
- Node 14 has neighbors: 1, 17, 18, 27
- Node 16 has neighbors: 8, 13, 25
- Node 17 has neighbors: 5, 9, 14
- Node 18 has neighbors: 13, 14, 28
- Node 20 has neighbors: 1, 4, 21
- Node 21 has neighbors: 0, 5, 20, 25
- Node 22 has neighbors: 6, 13, 19, 29
- Node 24 has neighbors: 2, 7, 10, 12
- Node 28 has neighbors: 1, 2, 18
- Node 29 has neighbors: 19, 22

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
\[10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 47\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 47.  
Listing the unique 3-stars found:  
\[ [47] \]
