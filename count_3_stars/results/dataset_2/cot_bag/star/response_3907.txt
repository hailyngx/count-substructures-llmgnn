Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 6 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- for Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- for Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- for Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- for Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- for Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- for Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- for Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- for Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- for Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

The total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 55 \).

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [55]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
