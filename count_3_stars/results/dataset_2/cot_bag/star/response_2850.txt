Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 18) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 15) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 11) (18, 14) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 15) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 6) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 5) (16, 6) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 16) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 16) (4, 1) (4, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are nodes 1, 3, 10, 11, 17, 19, and 9. We'll now calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars around node 1:
   - <1, (3, 4, 19)>
   - <1, (3, 12, 19)>
   - <1, (4, 12, 19)>
   - <1, (3, 4, 12)>

2. Node 3: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars around node 3:
   - <3, (1, 14, 6)>
   - <3, (1, 6, 9)>
   - <3, (14, 6, 9)>
   - <3, (1, 14, 9)>

3. Node 10: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars around node 10:
   - <10, (11, 17, 12)>
   - <10, (11, 17, 7)>
   - <10, (11, 12, 7)>
   - <10, (17, 12, 7)>

4. Node 11: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars around node 11:
   - <11, (10, 9, 18)>
   - <11, (10, 18, 14)>
   - <11, (10, 9, 14)>
   - <11, (9, 18, 14)>

5. Node 17: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars around node 17:
   - <17, (10, 15, 0)>
   - <17, (10, 0, 15)>
   - <17, (10, 0, 7)>
   - <17, (15, 0, 7)>

6. Node 19: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars around node 19:
   - <19, (1, 2, 8)>
   - <19, (1, 2, 15)>
   - <19, (1, 8, 15)>
   - <19, (2, 8, 15)>

7. Node 9: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars around node 9:
   - <9, (3, 11, 7)>
   - <9, (3, 11, 15)>
   - <9, (3, 7, 15)>
   - <9, (11, 7, 15)>
   - <9, (11, 7, 4)>
   - <9, (3, 7, 4)>
   - <9, (3, 15, 4)>
   - <9, (7, 15, 4)>
   - <9, (11, 15, 4)>
   - <9, (7, 15, 4)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars formed, we get a total of 34 3-stars. So, the answer is [34].
