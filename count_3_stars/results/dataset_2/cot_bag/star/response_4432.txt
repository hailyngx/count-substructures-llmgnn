Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 8) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 17) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 4) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 10) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 4) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 6) (7, 9) (7, 12) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 18) (19, 8) (19, 0) (0, 16) (0, 19) (1, 9) (1, 4) (6, 10) (6, 13) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 13) (2, 4) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 18) (13, 4) (4, 14) (4, 15) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 13) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually to better understand the connections:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
- 0: (16, 19)
- 1: (4, 9)
- 2: (4)
- 3: (10, 12, 15)
- 4: (1, 13, 14, 2)
- 5: (11, 8, 17)
- 6: (10, 13)
- 7: (9, 12)
- 8: (5, 9, 16, 18, 19)
- 9: (1, 7, 8)
- 10: (15, 3, 17, 6)
- 11: (5, 16)
- 12: (7, 12, 13, 16)
- 13: (4, 6, 12, 18)
- 14: (4, 17)
- 15: (3, 10)
- 16: (11, 0, 12, 8)
- 17: (5, 14, 10)
- 18: (14, 8, 13)
- 19: (8, 0)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For each node with three or more neighbors, we will count the number of 3-stars it is part of.

1. Node 4: <4, (1, 13, 14)> => 1 3-star
   
2. Node 8: <8, (5, 16, 18)>, <8, (9, 18, 19)>, <8, (9, 16, 19)> => 3 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 3 = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
