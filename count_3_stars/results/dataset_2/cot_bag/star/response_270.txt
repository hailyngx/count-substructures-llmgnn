Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 7)
Number of 3-stars at node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 7), (1, 5)
Number of 3-stars at node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 8)
Number of 3-stars at node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 9), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Number of 3-stars at node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Node 5 has 7 neighbors: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 7)
Number of 3-stars at node 5: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)

Node 6 has 5 neighbors: (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 1)
Number of 3-stars at node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 6), (8, 5)
Number of 3-stars at node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 8)
Number of 3-stars at node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 35 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 81

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [81].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
