Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 15) (16, 28) (16, 22) (16, 20) (2, 3) (29, 1) (29, 26) (29, 3) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 24) (21, 7) (21, 0) (21, 22) (21, 24) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 24) (10, 20) (3, 2) (3, 29) (3, 6) (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 9) (0, 18) (0, 23) (18, 0) (18, 26) (26, 29) (26, 18) (26, 27) (26, 17) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 23) (15, 17) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 6) (17, 26) (17, 15) (17, 13) (17, 12) (28, 16) (28, 8) (28, 23) (8, 28) (8, 24) (8, 20) (8, 12) (8, 1) (1, 29) (1, 8) (24, 7) (24, 21) (24, 10) (24, 8) (24, 25) (23, 0) (23, 15) (23, 28) (23, 4) (4, 23) (4, 9) (4, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 27) (19, 13) (22, 16) (22, 21) (22, 6) (27, 26) (27, 9) (27, 14) (14, 27) (14, 5) (12, 17) (12, 8) (25, 24) (20, 16) (20, 10) (20, 8) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 22) (5, 4) (5, 14) 

Response:
After analyzing the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we can identify the nodes that form a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from the above calculations: 
\( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 54 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [54].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (18, 26, 27)>, <7, (21, 24, 8)>, <8, (1, 12, 17)>, <10, (11, 15, 24)>, <15, (17, 23, 4)>, <16, (20, 22, 28)>, <17, (13, 15, 12)>, <21, (0, 7, 22)>, <24, (8, 10, 25)>, <26, (18, 29, 27)>
