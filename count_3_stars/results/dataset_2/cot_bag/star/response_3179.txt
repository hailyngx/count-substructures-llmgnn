Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (26, 23) (26, 3) (5, 6) (5, 29) (5, 11) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 28) (17, 21) (0, 27) (0, 22) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 1) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 29) (6, 13) (28, 17) (28, 6) (28, 16) (28, 24) (28, 2) (2, 28) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 21) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 21) (7, 2) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 4) (1, 17) (1, 27) (1, 20) (1, 22) (16, 28) (16, 8) (16, 3) (20, 1) (20, 19) (29, 5) (29, 14) (29, 6) (4, 12) (4, 10) (23, 26) (23, 0) (11, 5) (11, 25) (19, 20) (19, 25) (19, 10) (25, 11) (25, 19) (25, 21) (25, 18) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 21) (22, 0) (22, 1) (22, 3) (24, 28) (24, 13) (18, 14) (18, 25) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 3) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 18) (3, 26) (3, 16) (3, 22) (3, 18) (13, 6) (13, 24) (21, 17) (21, 2) (21, 8) (21, 25) (21, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 25, 28, 29.

Let's first calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 77

Therefore, we have a total of [77] 3-stars in this graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (23, 26, 27)>, 
<1, (27, 19, 22)>, 
<2, (21, 16, 28)>, 
<3, (26, 16, 22)>, 
<5, (11, 6, 29)>, 
<6, (28, 13, 29)>, 
<10, (18, 19, 4)>, 
<14, (29, 15, 17)>, 
<15, (21, 18, 15)>, 
<16, (28, 2, 3)>, 
<17, (1, 21, 28)>, 
<18, (3, 15, 18)>, 
<21, (2, 15, 28)>, 
<22, (0, 3, 22)>, 
<25, (21, 19, 18)>, 
<28, (16, 24, 21)>.
