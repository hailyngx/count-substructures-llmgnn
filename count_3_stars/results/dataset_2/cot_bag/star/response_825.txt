Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 15) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 19) (10, 11) (10, 9) (11, 10) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 15) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 16) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 7) (12, 9) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 19) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 0) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 7) (16, 13) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 0) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 12) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 16) (13, 19) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 19) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars, let's first determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has neighbors {14, 3, 2, 4}.
- Node 3 has neighbors {1, 13, 9, 19}.
- Node 5 has neighbors {2, 18, 6, 0}.
- Node 7 has neighbors {14, 12, 16}.
- Node 9 has neighbors {3, 10, 12}.
- Node 13 has neighbors {3, 4, 16, 19}.
- Node 14 has neighbors {17, 1, 7}.
- Node 15 has neighbors {17, 18, 19}.
- Node 16 has neighbors {17, 6, 7, 13}.
- Node 18 has neighbors {19, 5, 15}.
  
Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (14, 3, 4)>
<1, (14, 2, 4)>
<1, (3, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 13, 9)>
<3, (1, 13, 19)>
<3, (9, 13, 19)>
<5, (2, 18, 6)>
<5, (2, 18, 0)>
<5, (2, 6, 0)>
<5, (18, 6, 0)>
<7, (14, 12, 16)>
<9, (3, 10, 12)>
<13, (3, 4, 16)>
<13, (3, 4, 19)>
<13, (3, 16, 19)>
<13, (4, 16, 19)>
<14, (17, 7, 16)>
<16, (17, 6, 13)>
<16, (17, 7, 13)>
<16, (6, 7, 13)>
<16, (6, 16, 13)>
<18, (19, 5, 15)>.
