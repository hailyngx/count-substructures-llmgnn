Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 3, 4, 8, and 2. 

1. Node 1 has 6 neighbors: nodes 9, 3, 2, 4, 8, and 7. There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.  
2. Node 3 has 5 neighbors: nodes 5, 1, 0, 4, and 8. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
3. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: nodes 6, 1, 3, 8, and 0. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
4. Node 8 has 5 neighbors: nodes 6, 1, 3, 4, and 7. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center.
5. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: nodes 9, 6, 1, and 7. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 54] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (9, 3, 2)>
<1, (9, 2, 4)>
<1, (9, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 2, 4)>

<4, (6, 1, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 7)>
<4, (1, 8, 7)>
<8, (6, 1, 3)>
<8, (6, 1, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (9, 6, 7)>
