Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first list out the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Based on the provided edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are:  

Node 0: Neighbors {9, 4, 8, 6, 1}  
Node 1: Neighbors {5, 9, 4, 7, 2, 0}  
Node 2: Neighbors {5, 9, 4, 7, 1}  
Node 4: Neighbors {8, 0, 3, 1, 2}  
Node 5: Neighbors {9, 6, 2, 8, 1}  

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:  

For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)   
For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  

Adding these up: 10 (from Node 0) + 20 (from Node 1) + 10 (from Node 2) + 10 (from Node 4) + 10 (from Node 5) = 60.  

Thus, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in the graph.  

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:  
<0, (9, 4, 8)>  
<1, (5, 9, 4)>  
<1, (4, 7, 2)>  
<1, (7, 1, 0)>  
<2, (5, 9, 7)>  
<4, (8, 3, 1)>  
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
