Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: No 3-stars can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.
2. Node 1: No 3-stars can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.
3. Node 4: There is 1 3-star with node 4 as the central node: <4, (6, 9, 8)>
4. Node 5: There is 1 3-star with node 5 as the central node: <5, (1, 8, 7)>
5. Node 6: There is 1 3-star with node 6 as the central node: <6, (1, 4, 8)>
6. Node 7: No 3-stars can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.
7. Node 8: There is 1 3-star with node 8 as the central node: <8, (6, 4, 5)>
8. Node 9: There is 1 3-star with node 9 as the central node: <9, (6, 1, 7)>

Adding up the 3-stars from each node, we have a total of [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [6] 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<4, (6, 9, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (6, 4, 5)>
<9, (6, 1, 7)>
