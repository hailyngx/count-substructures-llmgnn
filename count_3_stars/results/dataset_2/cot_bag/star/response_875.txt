Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 16) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (3, 11) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 11) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 17) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (17, 13) (17, 14) (17, 1) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 16) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 19) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 12) (10, 9) (10, 8) (16, 9) (16, 18) (19, 4) (19, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0:  (15, 14, 7)
- Node 1:  (6, 17, 7, 19)
- Node 2:  (6, 14, 4, 12)
- Node 3:  (11)
- Node 4:  (6, 18, 12, 19, 2)
- Node 5:  (9, 6)
- Node 6:  (5, 1, 2, 4)
- Node 7:  (0, 1)
- Node 8:  (13, 10)
- Node 9:  (5, 10, 16)
- Node 10:  (9, 8)
- Node 11:  (3, 15, 14, 18)
- Node 12:  (14, 4, 2)
- Node 13:  (15, 8, 17)
- Node 14:  (15, 13, 17, 0, 11, 2)
- Node 15:  (0, 13, 11)
- Node 16:  (9, 18)
- Node 17:  (13, 14, 1)
- Node 18:  (4, 16, 11)
- Node 19:  (4, 1)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- For Node 4: 
    - Nodes 6, 18, and 19 form a 3-star: <4, (6, 18, 19)>
    - Total = 1

- For Node 6: 
    - Nodes 5, 1, and 2 form a 3-star: <6, (5, 1, 2)>
    - Total = 1

- For Node 11: 
    - Nodes 3, 15, and 14 form a 3-star: <11, (3, 15, 14)>
    - Nodes 18, 16, and 4 form a 3-star: <11, (18, 16, 4)>
    - Total = 2

Adding these up, we get a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
