Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 22) (3, 25) (3, 27) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 15) (25, 21) (20, 25) (20, 23) (0, 21) (0, 15) (0, 11) (4, 12) (4, 26) (4, 2) (18, 19) (18, 8) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 16) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 1) (28, 7) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 16) (26, 4) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 23) (24, 6) (24, 26) (24, 5) (24, 29) (1, 17) (1, 28) (1, 8) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 22) (5, 26) (5, 24) (5, 8) (5, 10) (2, 4) (23, 20) (23, 26) (23, 13) (23, 27) (16, 6) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 9) (7, 28) (7, 11) (11, 0) (11, 7) (8, 14) (8, 18) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 10) (21, 25) (21, 0) (21, 15) (21, 29) (15, 25) (15, 0) (15, 21) (15, 29) (9, 28) (9, 16) (9, 27) (10, 5) (10, 8) (22, 17) (22, 12) (27, 3) (27, 23) (27, 9) (13, 23) (29, 24) (29, 21) (29, 15) 

Response:
There are some nodes in the graph that have three or more neighbors. Let's identify those nodes first and then count the number of 3-stars formed around those nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are:  
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 12, 26, 2, 5  
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 28, 24, 16, 28  
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 14, 18, 1, 5, 10  
Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 25, 0, 21, 29  
Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 6, 19, 12, 9  
Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 14, 1, 22  
Node 21 has 4 neighbors: 25, 0, 15, 29  
Node 23 has 4 neighbors: 20, 26, 13, 27  
Node 24 has 4 neighbors: 6, 26, 5, 29  
Node 25 has 4 neighbors: 3, 20, 15, 21  
Node 26 has 5 neighbors: 4, 19, 24, 23, 5  
Node 28 has 4 neighbors: 6, 9, 1, 7  

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

Node 4 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 6 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 8 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 15 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 16 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 17 contributes 1 3-star  
Node 21 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 23 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 24 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 25 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 26 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 28 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node, we get a total of 48 3-stars.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].  

The unique 3-stars are:
