Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 17) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 19) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 12) (12, 11) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 0) (10, 14) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (17, 4) (17, 3) (17, 15) (2, 19) (2, 13) (19, 3) (19, 2) (19, 6) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 15) (1, 18) (1, 14) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 1) (13, 0) (13, 2) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 6) (15, 16) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 

Node 0 (Degree: 3)  
Node 3 (Degree: 5)  
Node 5 (Degree: 4)  
Node 7 (Degree: 4)  
Node 8 (Degree: 4)  
Node 9 (Degree: 3)  
Node 11 (Degree: 3)  
Node 12 (Degree: 3)  
Node 14 (Degree: 3)  
Node 15 (Degree: 4)  
Node 16 (Degree: 5)  
Node 19 (Degree: 3)  

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 3 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 15 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 16 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  

Adding these up gives us a total of \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 36 \) 3-stars.  

Therefore, the final answer is: \[ 36 \]  
The unique 3-stars found are:
