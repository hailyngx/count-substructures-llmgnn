Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 8)
(1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9)
(2, 0), (2, 7), (2, 8)
(3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)
(4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 7)
(5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 9)
(6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 5)
(7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)
(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 5)
(9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 5)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each qualifying node:

Node 0: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars
Node 1: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars
Node 3: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars
Node 5: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars
Node 8: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 8, 3)>
<0, (2, 8, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 1)>
<0, (8, 5, 1)>
<0, (8, 5, 3)>
<1, (0, 8, 5)>
<1, (0, 8, 3)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 5)>
<3, (6, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 8, 5)>
<3, (8, 5, 1)>
<3, (8, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 3)>
<5, (4, 8, 0)>
<5, (4, 8, 1)>
<5, (8, 0, 4)>
<5, (8, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 3)>
<8, (3, 1, 5)>
<8, (3, 1, 9)>
<8, (3, 7, 4)>
<8, (5, 1, 9)>
<8, (5, 9, 1)>
