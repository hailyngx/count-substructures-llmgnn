Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 13) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 13) (5, 7) (5, 10) (1, 11) (1, 4) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 9, 13
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 10, 14
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 3, 5, 8, 9, 12
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 7, 11, 14
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 8, 10
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 11
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 14
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 9, 12, 13
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 9, 13
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 7, 13
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 7, 10
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 4, 11
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 8, 12
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 9, 11, 13, 14
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 10, 14

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For nodes 6, 9, 7, 14, and 13:
  - \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for each node
- For nodes 2, 3, 10, and 4:
  - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each node
- For nodes 12 and 11:
  - \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for each node

Total number of 3-stars = \( 10+10+10+1+4+4+10+4+1 = 54 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (0, 2, 13)>
<9, (4, 7, 14)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<14, (0, 4, 13)>
<13, (6, 10, 14)>
<2, (3, 8, 10)>
<3, (0, 7, 13)>
<10, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 11, 13)>
<12, (7, 11, 14)>
<11, (1, 8, 12)>
