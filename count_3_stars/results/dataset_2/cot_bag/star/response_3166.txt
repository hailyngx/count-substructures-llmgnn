Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 67 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [67], and some of the unique 3-stars found in the graph include:
- <1, (2, 6, 3)>
- <4, (7, 8, 13)>
- <10, (5, 1, 14)>
- <13, (5, 4, 7)>
