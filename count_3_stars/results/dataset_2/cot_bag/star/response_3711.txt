Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 18) (4, 13) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 18) (3, 5) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 2) (8, 10) (8, 16) (13, 4) (13, 2) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 7) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 14) (17, 4) (17, 3) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 2) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 2) (6, 15) (6, 1) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 12) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 12) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 0) (19, 3) (19, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 18) (16, 5) (16, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's first identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars formed at these nodes: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 52 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is: [52]

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, (9, 1, 3)>
- <3, (5, 15, 17)>
- <15, (3, 6, 18)>
- <17, (3, 1, 0)>
- <1, (5, 6, 14)>
- <18, (9, 7, 12)>
- <2, (15, 13, 17)>
