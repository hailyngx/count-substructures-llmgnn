Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 21) (6, 20) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (14, 17) (14, 20) (14, 15) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 4) (0, 6) (0, 27) (0, 4) (27, 0) (27, 26) (27, 5) (20, 6) (20, 14) (20, 25) (20, 13) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 19) (25, 12) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 29) (28, 17) (28, 29) (29, 18) (29, 28) (29, 13) (29, 5) (21, 6) (21, 24) (13, 20) (13, 29) (13, 12) (13, 16) (26, 27) (26, 15) (7, 25) (7, 2) (7, 22) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 26) (11, 8) (11, 12) (23, 24) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 16) (19, 25) (19, 8) (19, 3) (5, 27) (5, 29) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 4) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 19) (12, 25) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 24) (24, 21) (24, 23) (24, 12) (24, 1) (1, 9) (1, 24) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 16) (22, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, 6, 20>, <3, 9, 1>, <4, 17, 14>, <6, 20, 14>, <14, 17, 10>, <20, 14, 25>, <10, 14, 15>, <12, 25, 13>, <13, 20, 29>, <15, 14, 18>, <24, 21, 1>
