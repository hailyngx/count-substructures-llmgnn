Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (5, 12) (5, 7) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 1) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 1) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 14) (16, 15) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 18) (3, 8) (3, 9) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 18) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 7) (19, 17) (4, 1) (15, 13) (15, 0) (15, 16) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 4) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 17) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 17) (14, 16) 

Response:
There are 9 nodes with three or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 1, 8, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, and 18. 

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 41 \) 3-stars.

So, the final answer is: \[ [41] \] 

And the unique 3-stars found are: 
1. <0, (7, 12, 15)>
2. <0, (7, 12, 1)>
3. <0, (7, 15, 16)>
4. <0, (12, 15, 16)>
5. <1, (10, 12, 16)>
6. <8, (2, 6, 13)>
7. <8, (3, 6, 13)>
8. <13, (6, 8, 15)>
9. <16, (12, 15, 17)>
