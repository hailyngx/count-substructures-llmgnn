Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
Node 0: 5 neighbors
Node 1: 4 neighbors
Node 2: 4 neighbors
Node 3: 5 neighbors
Node 6: 4 neighbors
Node 7: 5 neighbors
Node 8: 5 neighbors
Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 56 3-stars.
So, the final answer is [56].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 5)>
