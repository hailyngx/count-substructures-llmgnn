Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 0) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 2) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: (3, 11, 2, 12, 9). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 1.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (1, 11, 13, 5, 12). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (6, 11, 12, 2, 14). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (3, 8, 10, 0, 12). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 5.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (13, 5, 14, 0, 12). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 8.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: (14, 10, 1, 12, 9). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 9.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: (9, 7, 5, 14, 10). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 10.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: (1, 3, 13, 4, 11). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 11.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: (9, 1, 3, 8, 4). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 12.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: (6, 9, 8, 10, 4). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 14.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 100 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [100].
