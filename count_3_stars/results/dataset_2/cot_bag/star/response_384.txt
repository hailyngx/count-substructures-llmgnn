Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 22) (1, 27) (21, 0) (21, 26) (21, 15) (0, 21) (0, 22) (0, 18) (27, 1) (27, 28) (27, 3) (10, 26) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 7) (2, 17) (2, 7) (8, 29) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 23) (26, 21) (26, 10) (9, 25) (9, 4) (9, 28) (22, 1) (22, 0) (22, 16) (22, 25) (3, 27) (3, 11) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (5, 13) (5, 24) (5, 20) (13, 19) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 18) (15, 1) (15, 21) (16, 22) (16, 28) (16, 24) (16, 29) (28, 27) (28, 9) (28, 16) (28, 4) (28, 18) (14, 11) (14, 12) (24, 5) (24, 16) (24, 7) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 24) (7, 29) (7, 6) (29, 8) (29, 16) (29, 7) (25, 9) (25, 22) (25, 23) (25, 4) (6, 7) (6, 23) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 25) (4, 20) (20, 5) (20, 4) (20, 18) (23, 19) (23, 25) (23, 6) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 28) (18, 20) (18, 12) (12, 14) (12, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 0, 21, 27, 19, 22, 3, 11, 13, 15, 16, 28, 24, 7, 4, 5, 25, 20, 23, and 18.

Calculating \( \binom{3}{3} \) for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, there are 4 3-stars: 
- <1, (15, 22, 27)>
- <22, (1, 0, 16)>
- <27, (1, 28, 3)>
- <28, (27, 16, 4)>

Calculating \( \binom{4}{3} \) for nodes with 4 neighbors, there are 1 3-star:
- <18, (0, 13, 28, 20)>

Calculating \( \binom{5}{3} \) for nodes with 5 neighbors, there are 2 3-stars:
- <13, (19, 11, 5, 18)>
- <16, (22, 28, 24, 29)>

Calculating \( \binom{6}{3} \) for nodes with 6 neighbors, there is 1 3-star:
- <7, (17, 2, 24, 29, 6)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8].
