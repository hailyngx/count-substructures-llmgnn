Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (8, 14) (8, 11) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 18) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (10, 2) (10, 4) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 17) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 14) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 13) (18, 11) (18, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 14) (16, 13) (16, 1) (16, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 12) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 16) (1, 7) (4, 10) (4, 16) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:

1: 9, 7, 0, 16
2: 5, 10
3: 11, 7, 17, 5
4: 10, 16
5: 2, 3, 19
6: 9
7: 9, 3, 19, 1
8: 14, 11
9: 6, 11, 1, 7
10: 2, 4
11: 9, 8, 3, 0, 18
12: 15, 13, 14
13: 17, 12, 16, 14
14: 8, 13, 18, 12
15: 19, 12, 17
16: 13, 1, 4
17: 3, 15, 13
18: 11, 14
19: 5, 15, 7

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and find the number of 3-stars for each of those nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
1: [1]
3: [3]
5: [3]
7: [3]
9: [3]
11: [3]
12: [3]
13: [3]
14: [3]
15: [3]
16: [3]
17: [3]
19: [3]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [39]

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (9, 7, 0)>
<3, (11, 7, 17)>
<5, (2, 3, 19)>
<7, (9, 3, 19)>
<9, (11, 1, 7)>
<11, (9, 8, 0)>
<12, (15, 13, 14)>
<13, (17, 16, 14)>
<14, (8, 18, 12)>
<15, (19, 17, 12)>
<16, (13, 1, 4)>
<17, (3, 15, 13)>
<19, (5, 15, 7)>
