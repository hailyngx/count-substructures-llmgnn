Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:  
Node 0: 4   
Node 1: 4  
Node 2: 6  
Node 3: 4  
Node 4: 4  
Node 5: 4  
Node 6: 4  
Node 7: 5  
Node 8: 6  
Node 9: 4    

We see that nodes 2, 7, and 8 have degree 6 or more, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars using these nodes. 

For node 2:  
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]  

For node 7:  
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]  

For node 8:  
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]  

Adding these up, we get a total of 50 3-stars in this graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<2, (6, 5, 8)>  
<2, (7, 8, 6)>  
<2, (8, 5, 6)>  
<2, (7, 1, 8)>  
<2, (1, 4, 0)>  
<7, (6, 8, 2)>  
<7, (8, 2, 6)>  
<7, (1, 2, 8)>  
<7, (1, 4, 0)>  
<8, (6, 2, 7)>  
<8, (5, 6, 2)>  
<8, (2, 1, 7)>  
<8, (5, 6, 2)>
