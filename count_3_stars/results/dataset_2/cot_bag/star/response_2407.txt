Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 2) (27, 2) (27, 9) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 24) (14, 29) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 18) (17, 21) (10, 11) (10, 20) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 24) (11, 29) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 26) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 12) (6, 13) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 7) (28, 13) (28, 15) (19, 5) (19, 18) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 20) (8, 16) (9, 27) (9, 8) (23, 11) (23, 24) (23, 12) (15, 28) (15, 16) (15, 22) (15, 4) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 15) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 1) (26, 5) (26, 3) (25, 17) (24, 14) (24, 11) (24, 23) (24, 4) (3, 26) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (7, 28) (7, 3) (7, 20) (4, 15) (4, 24) (4, 3) (12, 6) (12, 23) (20, 10) (20, 8) (20, 7) (1, 18) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 27) (2, 1) (29, 14) (29, 11) (22, 15) (13, 14) (13, 6) (13, 28) (13, 3) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, 14, and 11.  
Node 0 has 3 neighbors, node 14 has 5 neighbors, and node 11 has 6 neighbors.  
We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.  

For node 0:
- The total number of 3-stars for node 0 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \). 
- There is one unique 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, 2, 8, 16>.

For node 14:
- The total number of 3-stars for node 14 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- There are ten unique 3-stars with node 14 as the center: 
<14, 11, 13, 24>, <14, 11, 24, 29>, <14, 11, 17, 25>, <14, 11, 17, 21>, <14, 13, 6, 28>, <14, 17, 11, 25>, <14, 17, 21, 6>, <14, 17, 21, 28>, <14, 17, 18, 25>, <14, 24, 11, 29>.

For node 11:
- The total number of 3-stars for node 11 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- There are twenty unique 3-stars with node 11 as the center: 
<11, 14, 29, 24>, <11, 14, 17, 25>, <11, 14, 17, 21>, <11, 14, 13, 24>, <11, 24, 23, 12>, <11, 24, 4, 15>, <11, 24, 14, 13>, <11, 24, 14, 29>, <11, 24, 3, 4>, <11, 24, 23, 12>, <11, 29, 14, 24>, <11, 29, 14, 17>, <11, 29, 14, 24>, <11, 23, 12, 6>, <11, 23, 12, 24>, <11, 23, 24, 14>, <11, 23, 24, 4>, <11, 23, 24, 12>, <11, 10, 20, 8>, < 11, 10, 20, 7> 

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 1 + 10 + 20 = 31.  
Therefore, the final answer is [31].
