Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 7) (9, 23) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 22) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 21) (27, 18) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 19) (20, 25) (20, 14) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 8) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 19) (4, 21) (8, 25) (8, 4) (8, 17) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 28) (1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 18) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 24) (21, 27) (21, 4) (21, 23) (14, 20) (14, 26) (14, 24) (26, 14) (26, 15) (26, 6) (26, 12) (3, 28) (3, 19) (28, 2) (28, 3) (6, 26) (6, 22) (6, 15) (22, 0) (22, 4) (22, 6) (16, 20) (16, 1) (16, 24) (16, 29) (24, 7) (24, 14) (24, 16) (24, 18) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 3) (15, 26) (15, 6) (15, 13) (29, 27) (29, 16) (29, 12) (23, 9) (23, 17) (23, 21) (12, 26) (12, 29) (13, 15) (18, 27) (18, 17) (18, 24) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the nodes with at least three neighbors to compute the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For the node with 3 neighbors: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- For the remaining nodes with more than 3 neighbors: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars each

Adding up these results: \(1 + 17 \times 4 = 69\)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 69.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 27, 22)>, <2, (0, 28, 5)>, <4, (8, 21, 19)>, <7, (0, 11, 24)>, <8, (25, 17, 4)>, <14, (20, 26, 24)>, <16, (20, 29, 1)>, <17, (8, 23, 19)>, <19, (4, 17, 3)>, <20, (25, 16, 14)>, <21, (27, 23, 4)>, <22, (0, 6, 4)>, <24, (7, 14, 18)>, <25, (8, 20, 25)>, <26, (14, 6, 12)>, <27, (0, 29, 21)>, <28, (2, 3, 27)>, <29, (16, 12, 27)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [69].
