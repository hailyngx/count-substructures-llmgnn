Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 23) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 12) (28, 29) (28, 19) (28, 5) (29, 28) (29, 3) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 21) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 10) (19, 12) (26, 19) (26, 7) (2, 18) (2, 27) (2, 24) (2, 7) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 22) (6, 20) (3, 4) (3, 29) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 21) (24, 8) (24, 2) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 0) (15, 17) (15, 21) (20, 6) (20, 7) (20, 23) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 27) (16, 18) (16, 1) (16, 10) (17, 15) (17, 27) (17, 7) (25, 0) (14, 6) (7, 26) (7, 2) (7, 20) (7, 17) (7, 13) (5, 28) (5, 12) (5, 22) (5, 27) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 5) (23, 4) (23, 20) (23, 13) (0, 1) (0, 25) (0, 22) (22, 6) (22, 5) (22, 0) (27, 2) (27, 9) (27, 17) (27, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 23) (10, 19) (10, 9) (10, 16) (21, 18) (21, 11) (21, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 4, 8, 28, 19, 2, 6, 3, 18, 1, 9, 16, 7, 5, 12, 23, 22, 27, 13, 10, 21.

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
1. Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
2. Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
4. Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
9. Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
10. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
11. Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
12. Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
13. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
14. Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
15. Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
16. Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
17. Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
18. Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
19. Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
20. Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 46 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in this graph.
