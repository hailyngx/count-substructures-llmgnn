Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (14, 19) (17, 11) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 1) (18, 13) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 9) (1, 0) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 11) (13, 18) (13, 12) (19, 3) (19, 14) (19, 5) (10, 15) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 7) (8, 9) (8, 16) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 16) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 12) (12, 3) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 16) (7, 11) (7, 9) (6, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 3, 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, 16, and 18. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <3, (0, 11, 15)>, <3, (0, 12, 19)>, <3, (0, 15, 19)>, <3, (11, 12, 19)>, <3, (11, 15, 19)>.

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <4, (5, 9, 12)>, <4, (5, 9, 17)>, <4, (5, 11, 19)>, <4, (9, 11, 17)>, <4, (9, 12, 17)>.

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <5, (4, 11, 19)>, <5, (4, 15, 19)>, <5, (11, 15, 19)>, <5, (11, 17, 19)>.

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <9, (4, 7, 12)>, <9, (4, 7, 16)>, <9, (4, 8, 16)>, <9, (7, 8, 16)>.

- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <11, (3, 5, 17)>, <11, (3, 7, 17)>, <11, (3, 15, 17)>, <11, (5, 7, 17)>.

- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <12, (3, 13, 18)>, <4, (3, 13, 16)>, <12, (4, 13, 18)>, <12, (4, 16, 18)>, <12, (13, 16, 18)>.

- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <16, (0, 8, 10)>, <16, (0, 8, 12)>, <16, (0, 10, 12)>, <16, (8, 10, 12)>, <16, (8, 12, 18)>.

- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <18, (1, 13, 2)>, <18, (1, 13, 12)>, <18, (1, 2, 6)>, <18, (1, 2, 13)>, <18, (2, 6, 13)>.

Considering all the above, the total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 52 \).

Therefore, the final result is [52].
