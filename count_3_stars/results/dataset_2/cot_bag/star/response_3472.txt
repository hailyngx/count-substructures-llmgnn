Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
<20, (15, 2, 12)>

Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
<21, (14, 17, 5)>, <21, (14, 17, 28)>, <21, (14, 17, 18)>, <21, (17, 5, 23)>

Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
<24, (12, 2, 18)>

Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
<25, (13, 6, 29)>

Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
<26, (0, 21, 15)>

Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
<27, (1, 15, 10)>, <27, (1, 15, 25)>, <27, (1, 15, 21)>, <27, (15, 25, 29)>

Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
<28, (10, 14, 18)>

Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
<29, (10, 11, 25)>

Adding up all 3-stars, we get a total of 63 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [63].
