Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be visualized as follows:

```
0 -- 2 -- 3 -- 1
|    |    |    |
5 -- 8 -- 6 -- 7
 \         /
   4 -- 9
```

Given the edges provided, we can see that nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 8 each have three or more neighbors, making them potential central nodes for a 3-star.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [20] \) 3-stars.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (2, 8, 3)>
- <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- <3, (2, 8, 6)>
- <3, (2, 6, 1)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <5, (4, 7, 0)>
- <5, (4, 0, 8)>
- <5, (4, 8, 3)>
- <5, (8, 3, 6)>
- <5, (3, 6, 1)>
- <6, (7, 0, 9)>
- <6, (7, 9, 4)>
- <6, (9, 4, 5)>
- <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- <8, (4, 7, 0)>
- <8, (4, 0, 5)>
- <8, (4, 5, 3)>
- <8, (4, 3, 1)>
- <8, (3, 1, 6)>
