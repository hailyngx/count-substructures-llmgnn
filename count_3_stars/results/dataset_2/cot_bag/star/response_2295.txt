Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph has multiple nodes with three or more neighbors, namely nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
For node 4, there are 4 neighbors: 7, 0, 5, and 6. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 4 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 5, there are 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 3, 6, and 2. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 5 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 6, there are 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 5, 2, and 8. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 6 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 7, there are 5 neighbors: 4, 6, 5, 1, and 8. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 7 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 1, there are 4 neighbors: 7, 2, 9, and 8. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 1 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 2, there are 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, and 9. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 2 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 8, there are 4 neighbors: 7, 1, 6, and 9. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 8 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 9, there are 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 2, and 8. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 9 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [50].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (4, 7, 3)>, <6, (4, 7, 2)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (7, 2, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (7, 1, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 2)>.
