Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (14, 3) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 18) (17, 14) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 1) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 7) (2, 19) (2, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 9) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 6) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 6) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 11) (19, 2) (19, 16) (18, 14) (18, 0) (16, 19) (16, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 16) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 11) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can draw the graph with 20 nodes labeled from 0 to 19 and the specified edges. Here, we'll focus on nodes with three or more neighbors to determine the 3-stars.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 42 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (14, 18, 8)>
<0, (14, 18, 9)>
<0, (14, 8, 1)>
<0, (8, 1, 13)>
<0, (14, 18, 1)>
<1, (8, 13, 0)>
<1, (8, 13, 11)>
<1, (8, 0, 11)>
<2, (7, 6, 15)>
<4, (7, 8, 12)>
<6, (7, 2, 15)>
<6, (7, 11, 5)>
<7, (4, 12, 2)>
<7, (4, 12, 15)>
<9, (7, 10, 0)>
<10, (9, 7, 15)>
<11, (6, 1, 5)>
<12, (4, 7, 6)>
<14, (3, 18, 0)>
<15, (6, 12, 4)>
