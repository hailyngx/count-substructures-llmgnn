Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 5, 9, 8, 2, 1
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 5, 6, 4, 3, 1, 0
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 9, 6, 4, 7
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 5, 9, 3, 2, 0
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 9, 4, 7, 3
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 9, 1, 6, 8
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 5, 2, 1
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 4, 3, 2
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 4, 7, 6, 8
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 9, 6

Now let's count the number of 3-stars:

- For node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20
- For node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 7: 1 
- For node 8: 1 
- For node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].

Unique 3-stars: <4, (5, 9, 2)>, <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <5, (9, 6, 4)>, <6, (5, 9, 3)>, <1, (9, 4, 7)>, <3, (9, 1, 6)>, <7, (5, 2, 1)>, <8, (4, 3, 2)>
