Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's first find the degree of each node:

- Node 0 has degree 5
- Node 1 has degree 6
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 4

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 1, and Node 2 have 5 neighbors each.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 20 + 10 = 40 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <0, (5, 7, 2)>
- <0, (5, 1, 2)>
- <0, (7, 6, 9)>
- <0, (7, 6, 1)>
- <0, (7, 6, 3)>
- <1, (5, 4, 2)>
- <1, (5, 4, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 3)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (7, 6, 3)>
- <4, (7, 6, 3)>
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
