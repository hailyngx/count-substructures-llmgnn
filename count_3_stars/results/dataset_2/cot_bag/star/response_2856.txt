Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 13) (8, 11) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 14) (0, 10) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 2) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: Node 1 has 5 neighbors (4, 7, 11, 8, 2), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

2. Node 2: Node 2 has 4 neighbors (12, 9, 1, 14), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

3. Node 4: Node 4 has 6 neighbors (7, 10, 9, 3, 1, 14), so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

4. Node 6: Node 6 has 3 neighbors (5, 12, 13), so it can form 1 3-star.

5. Node 7: Node 7 has 5 neighbors (4, 12, 11, 10, 1), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

6. Node 9: Node 9 has 5 neighbors (4, 11, 2, 14, 3), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

7. Node 10: Node 10 has 4 neighbors (4, 7, 11, 0), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

8. Node 11: Node 11 has 5 neighbors (7, 10, 1, 9, 8), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

9. Node 12: Node 12 has 5 neighbors (7, 5, 6, 2, 13), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

10. Node 13: Node 13 has 4 neighbors (6, 12, 3, 14), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

11. Node 14: Node 14 has 5 neighbors (4, 6, 9, 2, 13), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is calculated as \[ [10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10] = [83]. \]

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 11, 8)>, <1, (4, 2, 7)>, <1, (4, 2, 8)>, <1, (7, 10, 11)>, <1, (7, 11, 10)>, <11, (1, 9, 2)>, <11, (1, 9, 8)>, <11, (1, 8, 2)>, <11, (9, 2, 14)>, <11, (9, 8, 1)>, <4, (7, 10, 9)>, <4, (7, 10, 14)>, <4, (7, 11, 10)>, <4, (10, 11, 7)>, <4, (10, 11, 1)>, <4, (10, 1, 7)>, <4, (10, 7, 1)>, <4, (11, 7, 10)>, <4, (11, 10, 7)>, <12, (5, 6, 13)>, <12, (5, 13, 6)>, <12, (6, 5, 13)>, <12, (6, 13, 5)>, <12, (13, 5, 6)>, <12, (13, 6, 5)>, <1...
