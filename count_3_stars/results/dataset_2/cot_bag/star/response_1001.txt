Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 9) (11, 27) (16, 11) (16, 17) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 27) (17, 16) (17, 27) (1, 3) (1, 29) (1, 10) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 4) (20, 18) (20, 2) (20, 19) (25, 5) (25, 26) (25, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 29) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 18) (4, 3) (4, 25) (4, 8) (15, 19) (15, 7) (28, 11) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 5) (24, 26) (24, 9) (26, 25) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 0) (18, 14) (18, 20) (18, 13) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 22) (22, 6) (22, 27) (22, 0) (19, 3) (19, 20) (19, 15) (19, 28) (29, 1) (29, 8) (29, 21) (21, 29) (21, 0) (0, 26) (0, 22) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 5) (7, 15) (7, 27) (27, 11) (27, 14) (27, 17) (27, 22) (27, 7) (10, 1) (10, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 28) (9, 24) (9, 12) (2, 20) (5, 25) (5, 28) (5, 0) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up these numbers, we get a total of 61 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [61], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 22, 26)>, <1, (3, 9, 29)>, <4, (3, 8, 25)>, <5, (0, 25, 28)>, <6, (10, 14, 22)>, <8, (4, 12, 29)>, <9, (1, 24, 28)>, <11, (16, 27, 28)>, <13, (8, 18, 26)>, <14, (6, 18, 27)>, <16, (11, 17, 27)>, <18, (13, 14, 20)>, <19, (3, 15, 28)>, <20, (18, 19, 2)>, <22, (0, 6, 27)>, <26, (0, 13, 24)>, <27, (14, 22, 7)>, <28, (11, 19, 5)>, <29, (1, 8, 21)>
