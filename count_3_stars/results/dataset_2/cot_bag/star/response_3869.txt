- Node 1 has degree 5
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 3
- Node 10 has degree 4
- Node 11 has degree 4
- Node 12 has degree 3
- Node 13 has degree 2
- Node 14 has degree 5
- Node 15 has degree 3
- Node 16 has degree 1
- Node 17 has degree 4
- Node 18 has degree 5
- Node 19 has degree 3
- Node 20 has degree 2
- Node 21 has degree 5
- Node 22 has degree 2
- Node 23 has degree 4
- Node 24 has degree 2
- Node 25 has degree 4
- Node 26 has degree 4
- Node 27 has degree 4
- Node 28 has degree 3
- Node 29 has degree 1

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 58
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [58].

Listing the unique 3-stars:

<1, (26, 2, 28)>, <1, (26, 28, 25)>, <5, (9, 15, 20)>, <9, (15, 20, 27)>, <10, (11, 14, 7)>, 
<10, (11, 14, 18)>, <11, (14, 18, 20)>, <14, (18, 20, 25)>, <18, (11, 14, 20)>, <18, (11, 14, 25)>,
