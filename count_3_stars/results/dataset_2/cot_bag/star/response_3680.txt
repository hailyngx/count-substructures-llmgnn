Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 11) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 12) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:  
1: 4, 8, 9, 11  
2: 7, 8, 5, 13, 0  
3: 9, 14, 12  
4: 7, 13, 1, 6  
5: 7, 2, 13  
6: 4, 13, 0, 11, 14, 12  
7: 4, 0, 2, 5  
8: 2, 9, 10, 1  
9: 8, 10, 3, 1, 12  
10: 8, 13, 9, 14  
11: 1, 6, 12  
12: 9, 11, 3, 6  
13: 4, 2, 5, 10, 6  
14: 10, 3, 6  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the number of 3-stars for each node:  
\( 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 73 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [73] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:  
<1, (4, 8, 9)>  
<2, (7, 8, 5)>  
<2, (7, 5, 2)>  
<2, (8, 5, 13)>  
<2, (5, 13, 4)>  
<2, (13, 4, 6)>  
<3, (9, 12, 3)>  
<4, (7, 4, 13)>  
<6, (13, 0, 6)>  
<6, (6, 0, 11)>  
<6, (13, 6, 0)>  
<8, (9, 10, 8)>  
<9, (10, 9, 1)>  
<9, (9, 12, 3)>  
<10, (10, 14, 3)>  
<11, (1, 11, 12)>  
<13, (13, 10, 14)>  
<14, (6, 14, 10)>
