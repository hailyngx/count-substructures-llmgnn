Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 5 and node 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 5:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 9:
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 (from node 5) + 10 (from node 9) = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 2)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 7, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
