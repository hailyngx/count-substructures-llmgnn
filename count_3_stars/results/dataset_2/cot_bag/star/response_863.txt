Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 10) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 11) (6, 13) (6, 10) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 9) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars with these nodes:

For node 1: There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 2: There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 3: There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 5: There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 7: There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 8: There are 3 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = 1
For node 9: There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 10: There are 6 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 11: There are 6 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 12: There are 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 13: There are 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 14: There are 3 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = 1

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 86

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [86].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 8, 10)>
<1, (5, 7, 11)>
<2, (1, 7, 13)>
<2, (11, 13, 14)>
<3, (7, 12, 13)>
<4, (1, 8, 10)>
<5, (1, 7, 11)>
<8, (4, 10, 11)>
<9, (0, 7, 10)>
<10, (0, 6, 9)>
<11, (2, 9, 13)>
<12, (3, 7, 13)>
<13, (3, 6, 10)>
<14, (1, 2, 10)>
