Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (4, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 2) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 13) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 1 neighbor
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors

We can see that nodes 0, 1, 7, 8, and 11 have 5 neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars. For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 50 3-stars formed by nodes 0, 1, 7, 8, and 11. These 3-stars can be represented as:
<0, (1, 10, 14)>, <0, (1, 11, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 13)>, <0, (1, 6, 13)>, 
<0, (7, 8, 2)>, <0, (7, 8, 6)>, <0, (7, 8, 5)>, <0, (7, 2, 6)>, <0, (8, 5, 4)>, 
<1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 13)>, <1, (0, 6, 13)>, <1, (3, 6, 13)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, 
<7, (0, 3, 13)>, <7, (0, 6, 13)>, <7, (3, 6, 13)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 13)>, 
<8, (0, 6, 13)>, <8, (3, 6, 13)>, <11, (0, 3, 6)>, <11, (0, 3, 13)>, <11, (0, 6, 13)>, 
<11, (3, 6, 13)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].
