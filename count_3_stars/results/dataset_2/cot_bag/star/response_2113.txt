Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 5) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 11) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 5) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 9) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes in this graph that each have 3 or more neighbors: node 1, node 3, and node 5. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 7, 2, 3, 5, 10, 0.
- There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed by node 1.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 8, 12, 14.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed by node 3.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 1, 8, 6, 0, 14.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed by node 5.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(20 + 10 + 10 = 40\).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (7, 2, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 10)>, <1, (3, 2, 5)>, <1, (3, 8, 5)>, <1, (5, 0, 1)>, <3, (1, 2, 14)>, <3, (1, 8, 14)>, <3, (1, 12, 14)>, <3, (2, 8, 14)>, <3, (12, 14, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 14)>, <5, (0, 8, 14)>, <5, (1, 8, 14)>, <5, (0, 8, 1)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].
