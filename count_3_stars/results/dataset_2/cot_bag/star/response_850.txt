Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 7) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 14) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors so we can determine how many 3-stars can be formed with each of them. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 35 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 119

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [119].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (6, 12, 14)>, <4, (6, 10, 14)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 13)>, <10, (0, 11, 14)>, <12, (3, 7, 14)>, <13, (2, 7, 8)>.
