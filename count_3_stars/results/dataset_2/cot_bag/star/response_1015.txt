Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
2. Node 2: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
3. Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
4. Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
5. Node 7: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
6. Node 8: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
7. Node 10: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
8. Node 11: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
9. Node 13: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
10. Node 14: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from all these nodes: 
\[10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 96\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 96. 

Putting the final number inside brackets: [96]

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<1, 8, 13>
<2, 8, 13>
<3, 1, 7>
<6, 1, 5>
<7, 3, 11>
<8, 0, 10>
<10, 0, 8>
<11, 3, 7>
<13, 1, 8>
<14, 1, 2>
