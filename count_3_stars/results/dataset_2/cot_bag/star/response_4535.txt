Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 0) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 3) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 3) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors, which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives:
\[ 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 92 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [92]. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 13)>, <1, (4, 11, 13)>, <2, (5, 6, 10)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 14)>, <4, (7, 8, 14)>, <4, (7, 14, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 10)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 14)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 14)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <11, (1, 12, 13)>, <12, (1, 11, 14)>, <13, (0, 4, 3)>, <13, (0, 4, 11)>, <13, (11, 3, 14)>, <14, (3, 6, 7)>
