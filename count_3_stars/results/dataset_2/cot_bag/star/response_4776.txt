Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph based on the given edges:

```
    0 --- 1 --- 4
   /|    |   / |  
  9 |    |  /  5
   \|    | /   |
    2 --- 8    6
           |   /|
           |  / |
           | /  |
           7 ---3
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 9 = 4 neighbors
Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 8, 9 = 5 neighbors
Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 9 = 4 neighbors
Node 3: Connected to nodes 4, 6, 7 = 3 neighbors
Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6 = 4 neighbors
Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 = 6 neighbors
Node 6: Connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 7 = 4 neighbors
Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 7 = 4 neighbors

Now we can count the 3-stars:

Node 0: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$ 3-star
Node 1: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars
Node 2: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars
Node 5: ${6 \choose 3} = 20$ 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of $1 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 35$ 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 4)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 1, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 1)>
<5, (8, 1, 4)>
<5, (8, 1, 9)>
